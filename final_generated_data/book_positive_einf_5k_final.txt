Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part of this book is about Charles Dickens and some of his works and it was an eye opener to me. I am writing a dissertation on Charles Dickens, and this is helping me tremendously to understand and research his works. I do not think I could ever read his works without seeing this book as I was first introduced to them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an incredible gift to anyone who is a Christian, a skeptic or is even just curious. It is full of amazing examples of how different religious beliefs are really nothing but a product of evolution. It also provides insight into how evolution has made Christianity and Judaism into a powerful tool in our modern world

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book by a professional on American sports written by one of them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, filled with insights into the life of the Christian spiritual leader.  Many people are amazed when they learn of Jesus' life as a humble carpenter's son.  While many have read about the lives of various preachers, none can match David's example of humility and spiritual power. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A truly insightful account of the Holocaust, this book offers an accurate and informative account of all of the details involved in the systematic mass murder of European Jewry. This is an important book for all students of the holocaust, and especially for those trying to better understand the attitudes of modern Jewish leaders towards Jewish persecution in Europe.The book offers insight into the attitudes and actions of the leaders of modern Jewry toward anti-Semitism and their treatment of the Jews during the Holocaust.  This book is not only essential for students of modern history, but for students who have been raised with the belief that there was only one way to interpret the events of the Second World War and the Holocaust: the Nazi way. This book not only allows readers to appreciate the attitudes, actions and motivations of contemporary Jews and their actions, but also provides much historical insight into many aspects of the Third Reich's foreign policy, military strategy, economic and industrial policies, and national security policies. The text is organized into three sections: the Rise of the National Socialist Movement, the Holocaust and the Final Solution, and a historical section devoted to the Third International. The first two sections offer a broad overview of all that happened in the world during the war, including Hitler's rise to power, the actions of his followers and opponents during the first two years of the war and the actions they took in response to the Allied bombings of German cities in December 1941. The third section is devoted to German foreign policy. The book then presents an overview of Germany's international relations in the period leading up to and after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.In the following chapters, the text offers a detailed analysis of all aspects of Germany and Nazi Germany's relations with various other European countries. The texts starts with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 and continues with the development of German military strategy in Russia, the German military occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia and the subsequent German invasion and occupation of Norway in 1940. The next three chapters are devoted to France, Yugoslavia, and Britain, and they each contain a review of the actions taken by the Germans and their allies during each country's occupation of Germany in World War II. The final chapter of the text describes the Nazi and Vichy Governments in France, Italy, and Spain. In each of these sections of the book the text makes a clear distinction between the German and Viceroyalist governments as opposed to the French and Italian governments, which were both allied to the German Axis powers
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born in 1948, and for years the only books I had in my possession were the Bible and the New Testament. This was the first time I read about any of the other books in the Bible. The Bible has a lot of problems, but this book makes them more understandable. It's about Jesus, but it's also about the early Christian community. It was fascinating and inspiring to learn about the different groups that gathered in Jerusalem and what they believed about God, about God's plan for the world, and about the need to believe in and be a part of a faith community, especially one that is not the Roman Catholic Church 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has some wonderful and funny stories about different people, places, and things that have made a big difference in my life. The humor comes out in the way the characters say and do certain things. Most of the people and places mentioned have never been seen by the general public, but we do learn how they are doing and what they are all about. It's great fun to learn about other cultures, especially cultures that seem foreign to us 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an extraordinary collection of essays by a brilliant young anthropologist.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of stories about American Indians. It's a must-read for anyone who loves the subject, especially those who want to understand the plight of Native Americans 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title of this book is somewhat misleading. Most of the stories in this collection involve the characters from the "Harry Potter" series, but most of the story is about an everyday American, living and working in a small town in Maine. The people of this town are very ordinary, but the story of how they were able to overcome and continue to build a strong community in the face of hardship is very inspiring and inspiring.The stories are told in a humorous and insightful style that allows the reader to see the world of the characters through the characters' eyes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book I have been searching for for years.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this subject and wants to learn more about it.

This book is a wonderful resource and a very important book to have on hand 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you haven't read this book yet, or even heard of it, go ahead.  You'll have a better understanding of what the hell is going on with the Soviet Union than you did when you first heard about it.  So many times I've been asked what the Soviets were up to in the early 80's.  How to deal with the growing threat of the Soviet army, etc...  There's more information on the military than you could ever imagine.  And, the best part of it all...this book takes place during the Cold War period in the late 60's and early 70's. It takes place in a real place, where people lived.  It's a good story to tell your children.  I hope they'll read this one and understand better how evil Stalin and the Bolsheviks really were 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who loves and is a fan of The X-Men.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have not read The Great Depression, but read the first two parts of the collection, "A Crisis of Faith" and "The Great Depression Revisited" for a master course in the Depression. I recommend this book to anyone who has not read these earlier works. It is a superbly researched account of the crisis and the effects of it. The author has the courage to be honest with his readers as to his own biases, yet he always stays true to the facts. He is an outstanding scholar and a fine writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read book. One of the best in the field 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was so enlightening, informative, and inspiring. I had previously only read the book from a student's perspective and couldn't believe what I read in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a long time fan of J.R.R Tolkien and this is the first time I've read any of his writings.  He did such an amazing job of giving a true sense of his life as well as describing the characters and places that inspired him.  In this wonderful tome we get to know the whole of Middle-earth and meet many of its inhabitants.  I read this as a teenager and it influenced me greatly for years.  It is full of insights and is a joy to read.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very important work and a must for anyone interested in the New York Yankees, especially from their inception in 1901.

I recommend this book highly and hope that it is translated into other languages 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete work on Chinese in America to date.  It is the first to give readers the full story of the Chinese American experience in America.  For many years Chinese were only thought of as a minority in America and the only American to write about them was the late, great, Bruce Lee.  This book takes us on a tour of Chinatowns in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, and San Diego.  Each place has a unique history and cultural appeal.  The book covers the development of the culture from the time of the first Chinese immigrants in the early 1900s to the present.  If there was one book for beginning students to read on the subject of Chinese in American history, this would be it.  I recommend this book to all, and all new readers should begin with this text.  There is a lot of information to consider in this book.  But one thing I learned from the many hours of research I did on the people, places, and events of Chinatown history was this:  Chinese people are not a homogeneous group.  They are divided in their attitudes and behaviors depending on where they are living in America 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The life of the Buddha is the story of a humble peasant man from the far western region of India, whose radical transformation of his life has transformed the world and the human race in general. The teachings and techniques of the ancient Siddhartha Gautama, as portrayed in this biography, are as inspiring today as they were over 1,500 years ago. The classic story is being re-told in new ways by modern researchers. The story of Gautam Siddharth, a common laborer of northern India who became the Buddha, is given a new context through the biographical insights of his close disciple, Milindapanha. For these reasons this book is a must read for all who seek to understand and benefit from the teachings of Gaius Siddharva.The book is not only an in-depth look at the life of Siddharatta Gautami but a study in how people change and grow in the face of great challenge

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book for anyone who wishes to understand the differences between Christianity and Paganism.  The author presents a balanced approach to the differences. He explains the similarities while offering the reasons why it is that Christianity and other systems of Religions are not exactly the same. The main purpose of the book is to provide a way for a Christian to understand a Pagan system without having to accept all its teachings or practices.  You don't need to go off and read books by the likes of Gregory of Nyssa to understand why things in Paganism are not what they are supposed to be.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very inspiring book for anyone who loves nature. As a child, I was always drawn to the woods and wildflowers. The author gives wonderful examples of how to make beautiful landscape artwork as well as plant and animals information. The pictures speak for themselves, but I think it's the descriptions of how he came to discover the wildflower on his own land that will speak for me most. The plants are amazing, especially the sagebrush, cedar, and rhododendron. There are very few plants that grow wild in my area and all of them are illustrated 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the only one that I have read that I still refer back to.

I never forget the first time I had chicken and waffles.I have to say, I was never very good at the whole cooking part of it.I just loved it so much I decided to teach myself as soon as I could get myself together. I did my very best in my first cookbook and I will always be grateful for the amazing recipes I came up with.The only negative I have is that most of the recipes are for white chicken and some of them are kind of boring.I think it is good for the whole family to cook with these great recipes but maybe don't make a huge batch just to serve for dinner.I hope you'll join me for a weekend of cooking with my family and have a wonderful time and I am sure it will change your life. I really hope you will take a look at this book.I will be teaching my kids to cook some day too.So make some white chicken

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very informative, well written and engaging book. It is not just about the early development of Christian theology in the East, but rather, it covers all aspects of the Early Church in relation to its relationship to Judaism, Islam, and the Hellenistic world. It gives a good sense of how the earliest Christians dealt with and interacted with each other and with other faiths.

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a psychiatrist who has spent years working with people suffering from BPD, I was very interested in reading this book. The main focus of the book was on the treatment and how to understand it and deal with it as best we can. In addition to this, the author covered the many other issues that are part of BPD including social and family dynamics.  While some of the information is common to all types of mental illness, the focus on understanding was an interesting approach for the general reader. As a former BPD patient myself, I appreciated the author's willingness to look beyond what the patient believed about BPD and what they felt they could do to cure themselves.  I was able to put my experience and knowledge to use for the first time in my own treatment and found the information helpful

And the poems by John Ashbery and William Carlos Williams are my favorite of all time 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in a series of short essays and interviews that I hope to write on some of the major philosophers of the twentieth century, from Kant to Nietzsche to Heidegger. The essays explore and discuss the themes and issues that have come to define Western philosophy in the last three centuries, ranging from existentialism and theism, through the "New Atheism," to postmodernism and "postmodernism in philosophy." The final section examines modernist philosophy, especially those of Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault and Derrida, which also gives rise to modernist art. I greatly enjoyed the interviews with some of my favorite philosophers of my generation, including Paul Ricoeur, Alasdair MacIntyre, Jean Baudrillard, Karl Jaspers, Paul de Man, Jean Paul Sarti, David Halperin, Martin Heideger, Susan Haack, and Michael Sandel, among many others. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to know more about contemporary European Philosophy, and especially to anyone interested in postmodernist and "New" philosophical ideas. It is a must read for anyone interested, not only in Western Philosophy but in post-modernism as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book by the late, great writer, Kurt Vonnegut, was a revelation. Now, in Kurt Vonnuss' second book, Slaughterhouse Five, we are treated to more of what we love so much about Vonneguts. This collection is a celebration of Kurt's work. This is a good story book for children and a superb read for the young adult fan. It contains a great collection of short stories, some of which Vonnegutz illustrated, and several of which are adapted for the stage. There are some very moving illustrations. The stories are all humorous and darkly funny. Many of the short stories were never written down and Vonnegud, himself, says that they are as much his creation as they are his characters 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A superb book for anyone who is involved in the medical profession or has medical training and is looking for ways to become more effective in providing health care to patients. It is written in a clear and straightforward style and provides a variety of strategies to help the physician improve the quality of care. It also presents the information in such a manner that is easily digestible 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful account of a world away from the one we experience in our day to day lives. From the very first page we are introduced to the characters of the story - the characters that can make a difference in the outcome. We learn about a village in central America with a dark history, where two groups are waging a struggle over the right to determine what to call the species, the native or non-native. We also learn about the people who live there and the culture they are an integral part of. The book is told in the language of the original story, in a manner that makes sense for a reader in the present day. From a cultural perspective this book will appeal to any reader who has a fascination with the concept of interspecies conflict. The language is elegant, descriptive, and poetic. It is as if the author has spent time among the Maasai people.  The writing style is witty and humorous, evoking great feelings of empathy. It's easy to see how the author came to be so interested in the story of the human-human relationship, from a personal perspective. While many would be tempted to dismiss the story as just fantasy, in my opinion the story has a deep and abiding truth about our humanity. The character development of the characters are also well done, as they begin to see each other in a different light. We see them grow, develop, and discover their own selves. This is in stark contrast to the "hero" and "villain" stereotypes most of us are taught from a young age. Each character's journey is equally compelling and is a joy to read. This book is truly a must-read for anyone interested in interspecies relations and/or anthropology, and who has any interest in history of art. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very informative book, and includes many quotations from the writings of our great American Presidents. It is an essential guide for anyone who is concerned about preserving our history, culture, and way of life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read this book, I saw several themes and themes in life. I also saw some practical things to be done.  Many, many times I feel like a child.  I see the world as it is.  In fact, I have a two-page summary of the book  at the top of my bedroom door.  So, for me, the book is not about religion.  It is about how I would approach problems and life challenges.  As a Christian, it is important for me to know the truth of God, and how to be obedient.  But it is more important for us to live in harmony with God's will.  This book will show us a little more about how to do that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book I have been wanting to read for a long time.  Dr. David E. Buss was interviewed by author Michael J. Puma and I would highly recommend any of his books for reading for the first time in their entirety.  The questions and comments about the players in the modern NBA are very insightful and in today's NBA we need to take a closer look at these guys that are so good at their craft yet so very selfish.  I found many of the comments made by Dr. B. to be spot on and a great book for any NBA player or fan to read.  Definitely check out this book and I am looking forward to reading about the future of the Dallas Mavericks and some other players

I was surprised to find myself rereading the book and the book of dreams for additional information.  The book of memories was the most fascinating part of this book, and I am excited to read it in the near future.  This is a must read for anyone who has thought about human development 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very informative about the history of Islam and the rise of the Saudi Arabian state. The book provides examples of how this state has influenced Islamic values and political thought in the rest of the world. The author shows how some of the main forces that brought about the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early twentieth century are the same forces that have brought about Muslim-Shia conflict today. Many of the same men who helped bring down the Ottoman empire have helped bring about the rise and success of the Islamic State today. The reader will learn about key characters and key events in the rise to power of the Sauds

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the very few biographies of important biographies.  In his introduction, the great biographer of the 20th Century, Robert Caro, writes, "This is a study of the life and career of Gertrude Vanderbilt, the most celebrated American woman and womaniser."  The book is very well done and very informative.  It is the story of her early years as a child prodigy in her native Germany, her rise to wealth and success in America and her death from cancer.  This book is a treasure trove of information and insight.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to learn more about the lives of important women in American history.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has made a great contribution to our understanding of the development of the Islamic faith in the Middle East. It covers the period of the rise of Islam from about 650 CE to the early centuries of the sixteenth century. The book is organized into two distinct periods, the first describing the growth of Islam within the Byzantine Empire, from the first crusade in 1096 to the defeat of the Ottomans in 1291. The second period is the emergence of Islam in the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly from the mid-fifteenth century until the present.The book includes an index of sources on each period of Islamic history. This was an extremely useful addition to the Islamic Studies section of the library at Columbia College. The history of the Arab conquest of Egypt and the conquest of Syria in 629 AD is also covered. It is not always clear which of these two groups is the most important to the development and spread of Islam but the two groups are closely interrelated in their beliefs and ways of life. Both groups are described in the book in the most objective way possible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an absolute joy to read. I've never really read the works of Dostoyevsky before but this book was so good. It was a real treat to read about such a talented and thought provoking writer 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There are so many wonderful stories in this book.  There is an excellent story about the death of a great poet and story about his last days which is told through the eyes of two little girls.  This story is so sad and beautiful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic work on how to do the New Testament reading and interpreting.  It covers all of the major approaches and presents the main arguments that have been raised.  The chapters are all quite short, and I think the only reason some are not more generally used  is because of the many different ways to approach the readings.  I recommend it to all 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The second edition is an important step forward, particularly the new material on the history of philosophy. While the book has a long and interesting introductory chapter, the primary purpose of the second edition was to update the chapter on the early part of philosophy, specifically the work of Plato.  It is very good work and the philosophy of Aristotle is one of the most important topics in modern philosophy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the first I read and it is the only one I've read since then that has taught me something new about the world around me.  The world in which we live today is far different from the one that existed in the 1500's.  As a child I would not have ever thought that people would still be walking with their hands in their pockets as I did and that women would still have to wear long, black dresses.  I learned so much more from the world of the 1500-1800's than I ever expected.  What made this story especially inspiring was the fact that so many of the people described in this book were women.  How much of a difference could one person make in a culture if they could simply leave.  For those of you reading this, go out and get a copy of this book and spend the time you would have spent thinking about it on the streets of a foreign city.  If you have a child that will grow up in the 21st century, I encourage you to give this book as a gift, and give the child a copy too.  It will be the start of a new way of life for them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book about how and why men and women deal with each other. It is not only the advice that is given to men about women, but to women about men.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful and insightful look at the African-American community of the 1940's and 50's in America.  It will help students and others to understand the African American experience in America from the early to late 20th Century.  The author, Stanley C.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone interested in studying the history of the Vietnam war.  It is a fascinating look at the US involvement in that conflict and the role played by the religious right in fomenting dissent in the early days of the conflict.  I enjoyed the book, the images it conjured in my mind and the stories of the people who were a part of the war at its inception, but I was especially struck by the way the author took the subject of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (the Mormons) to task.  Many people have written about the Mormons, but few, I think, have done so in such a straightforward manner.  The main reason for that is the religious influence the Church has had in America for almost the past century.  However, the author goes well beyond that in his discussion of the impact of the "cult of personality" surrounding the Church, which has contributed to the US government's lack of tolerance towards it, and to the violence it has provoked, especially in the southern US 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far my favorite book on writing.  I would highly recommend this book

The reader is taken on a tour through the various political, social, and religious groups that promoted women's rights and, in the process, is reminded of the very real hardships and injustices that women still endure in our society. It will change the way you view the history of American political progress and social progress.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book when I was in my early 20's. I was completely fascinated by the topic of the occult and I have had numerous discussions with my mother on the subject.  For those of us with a fascination with the occult, this book will give us a complete introduction to the subject and will provide us with the techniques to take control of our minds.  I am now 67 and still thoroughly entertained by the subject of the paranormal.  This book has opened my eyes to many wonderful things which I never would have discovered without it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the classic collection of essays on writing.  The essays are based on real life experiences, such as taking a course in creative writing, meeting a real writer, having a real writing meeting with an author and the real effects of a bad book.  There is even a chapter on how to write a novel in the style of a short story, a style that is becoming increasingly popular.  This book is a must for any serious writer 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the radical Islam movement and how it relates to the United States. This is the first time I've been exposed to these movements and they are certainly my future concern.This book is the result of the work of a number of experts on both sides of the divide, such as Dr. James Fetzer, Professor James Jeffrey, and Professor David Berger. I have the privilege to be a student of both groups, and I agree with the authors that these movements are a danger to the safety and well-being of both the U.S. and the world. This book is an important window into the radical Islamic world, and for anyone looking to understand how these radical ideologies function and operate, this is the essential work 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a graduate student and I still use it as the basis for many of my seminars and discussions.

This is one of the best books on statistical software and analysis 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's an important book for anyone who wants to understand what it's like to be gay. It was the first I read, and I'm still absorbing it. I found it to be very refreshing to read a new perspective, and a rare chance to hear from someone who is doing so. I'm going to be reading it every year, and will probably have a collection of his essays in my library one day. I can't wait to see the movie. I hope the film is made for the sake of gay kids out there. I also hope it can encourage other parents who are struggling with their own children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive text on the life and works of Fyodor Dostoevsky. It's a must read for anyone who loves Dostoyevsky, as I do.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an essential book for anyone interested in the history of the Russian-Jewish community in the United States. It was written by two of the leading authorities on Russian-American affairs, Ester Flesselman and Paul Goldstein, and is a superb contribution to our understanding of the history and cultural development of this important part of the world. It is the only book written by both the Russians and the Americans that can be considered comprehensive. Flessellman, in his first chapter, lays down the foundation for understanding of Russian-Americans and the contributions they have made to the American cultural scene. Goldstein, in a long preface, goes into great detail concerning the lives and contributions of Jews in America. This is a must read for all who wish to better understand their fellow countrymen 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of essays on art and architecture by a group of contemporary artists.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first book I have ever read that provided me with a solid and clear view of the subject of American History. I am a graduate student currently working on an oral history study of the Civil War. This book has given me a great insight into the events, people, and feelings that surrounded the war from the beginning.  It also provides me with insights into the past that I could never have guessed.  All in all, this book has really helped to clarify many of the debates that I have had over the years, and I wish I had access to this book when I was in school

I have found that this book has provided me many new insights and ideas for my own work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this book.  It's one of my favorites.   The focus is on the history of the Irish and Catholic Church in England from the 16th century to the present, including the role of the Reformation.  The authors clearly and effectively illustrate the social and political upheaval and violence that occurred in England and Ireland during this time period.  This is especially relevant now with the ongoing problems in Northern Ireland and in Ireland in general.  I recommend this book to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that I wish I had known more about, especially the historical aspects.  As a child of the 1950's, I was fascinated by the Cold War, and this book is one of the most comprehensive on the subject that I have found.  I especially recommend the essay by Richard Rhodes on how the Cold Warriors influenced the American public.  For me this book was one of my main sources for understanding the real history of the Cold Wars, and for that I thank Richard Rhodes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm in the process of rewriting the last two volumes of my biography of the late poet Allen Ginsberg. I feel like I should have read this book prior to starting. This is a fantastic piece of research, a look at Allen Ginsburg in his own time, before he got into the political sphere, as well as a look into how and why he went from poetry to street life and how his work has become so influential on so many people. I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in learning about the life of a great poet.

Write a positive review about a good book:   An interesting study of the role of photography in modern life. As one of the few photographs made of the first ever White House photo-op in 1933, this work is one of those that everyone can relate to and understand. There are many excellent examples of the work, both in the book and in the articles and essays that come after, but this is the text that will stay with you the most and give you the greatest understanding of the impact photography has had on our daily lives.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book, published in 1957, is a masterpiece in the field. Its primary purpose is to present the complete text of the teachings of Jesus. There is nothing like it, even from today's most advanced religious movements. The subject is unique and is not often covered in today's religious studies. The book also provides a very concise introduction to many of the major tenets of The Jesus Movement. Its approach is to describe a historical period in the life of Jesus, using various texts, without attempting to present an argument, but rather to present a comprehensive picture of the Jesus movement. It is the only work that will clearly demonstrate the relationship between Jesus and his followers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an inspirational, uplifting story of how I found myself in the company of this amazing young woman, the love of my life.  It took a while for her to find me, but I know I was finally in love when I found her after many years of being married and in the process of giving up my life to a man who was not my equal.  The story of what happened to my wife in the months following her marriage to Mr. Gagnon is a story of love, of life, of hope and joy and the power of being there for someone when they need you.  I felt a great personal debt of gratitude toward this woman, not just because she had shown such incredible grace in the face of life's hardest challenges, but because I learned so much from her

The book is also extremely informative and inspiring, especially for anyone who wishes to study Chinese in this country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There are many good books about the New York Yankees. This one, written by two of the most respected writers in the game, is among the best. It is a collection of the best articles and opinions in regards to the history of the franchise. Some of them are a little dated (I believe this book was first published in 1989) but many of them still hold true.  They cover the game in New York from the 18th Century to today. I have read many of these articles and learned a lot about my favorite team. This book may not have given you as much information as you expected but it will give you a better appreciation of the people that have played a big role in building the Yankees franchise in the last hundred years.This book is filled with quotes from many of the Yankees greats, including Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, and Yogi Ferrell. I would highly recommend it for any Yankee fan that wants a quick refresher of the history and personalities of the team. If you have any interest in the history then I would recommed to look at the other books in the series 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book.  For a lot of people, this book is not necessarily a first-timer.  The story about the founding of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is fascinating.  I especially enjoyed the first part about Joseph Smith and his time in Palmyra.  Then we get to the details of what really happened.  Lots of quotes from people such as Peter Ingersoll and James White.  This book gives a lot more detail about these early people then many of the books about it.  In other words, it is not all speculation.  We can be confident that God's truth is at the foundation.  Many who have read this book before may not realize it, but there are things written here that were not written in books in the past.  That's how you learn about these founding facts.  You learn it through their words, not their sources.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating look at the great leaders of the 20th century, from Stalin and Hitler to JFK and Gandhi.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers the major phases of my career as a professional writer.  The concepts and methods are presented with clear and concise explanations, and examples drawn from real life situations.  Most of all, this book is a resource for writers.  It allows one to step into the role of a writer, and to understand how to get the job done.  This book is the bible for most writers. The only negative review I could write is that many of the examples are not real life.  However, one should always keep in mind that the examples in a book may not be applicable to the writer's real life situation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best books I have read this year.  The author provides a comprehensive overview of the major developments in American history.

It is a unique and very informative collection of wisdom from several prominent spiritual leaders, including Mother Teresa, Mahatma Ghandi, Jim Jones, and a host of others.   What struck me most was how much they had in common.  They all had something unique and extraordinary in them and they shared it with each other.  This was truly a collection of spiritual wisdom.  I loved it and can't wait to read the rest 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an inspiration to me in my late teens.  The author, a friend of mine, has been teaching and writing about her native language in Korea since she was a teen.  Through her experiences, she has been able to bring her native tongue to life in a beautiful, easy to read format.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning or living in Korea.  It is the only book I have read that actually explains the Korean language, culture and history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of Richard Brautigan and his work. I've been on the waiting list for a while now to pick up the last of his "Lost World" series.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In her recent biography, Mary Ann Mendoza writes that her father, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, first read this book and it changed his life. In his own way, George Orwell captured the war on its most intense and terrifying terms, the Spanish Inquisition. His book is a must read for anyone who cares about freedom, humanity, and the fight against fascism

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book to anyone looking for an in-depth look into the early days of Scientology in California. It is a thorough history of the organization from it's creation in Los Angeles in 1954 through the founding of the Saint Hill Organization in Los Gatos in 1963. The history is presented through interviews with Scientology leader David Miscavige, former Scientologists, and defectors who have since left. The interviews with former members are informative and often humorous, while the interviews with defectors are gripping and insightful. These interviews are supplemented with numerous documents that provide insight into Scientology's history from a historical perspective.I recommend this volume for anyone who is serious about understanding the history of Scientology, including current members and former members, as well as members who are considering leaving.The stories of former members who have left Scientology and their stories, which are sometimes heartbreaking, are compelling reading. However, the book's focus on defectors is a fascinating and enlightening one. For example, one defector, who had been a prominent member of Scientology from the very beginning, relates the story of how he managed to get his wife out of the Church and how it was all the result of Scientology's tactics against defectors. The defectors in this book also illustrate the various tactics used by Scientology in an effort to destroy defectors, including harassment and smear campaigns. It's also interesting to see how Scientology is able to exploit the media to push its agenda, while still maintaining a strong and successful church-run operation.Overall, this is an excellent book about a fascinating subject. It provides a detailed look at the Church of Scientology as it was in the 1950's and 1960's. The book gives the layman a very thorough explanation of how Scientology was structured and operated in those early days, and the tactics used to control members, which remain very successful today

As I was reading, my daughter, who is now twenty, kept asking me "So when are we going on holiday?"

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a detailed and fascinating look at the development of the world's most powerful nation. From its founding to the present, Great Britain has never been more influential. From Churchill to Tony Blair, from Queen Elizabeth II to David Cameron, from the Beatles to the Stone Roses, from Prince Charles to David Bowie, the British people have always stood at the heart of global politics. It is this remarkable and often overlooked legacy that makes this history such a rich and rewarding read. The book covers the entire period from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The emphasis is on the British Empire, but it is full of fascinating and well-researched insights into the development and impact of many other nations and movements. This is a fascinating and important book for anyone interested in world politics, especially those interested in post-war Europe.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book on the philosophy of ethics available.  This book has a powerful message.  To many, it seems counterintuitive.  Perhaps it is counterintuitive to some, but it is not to me.  I do think that many people, myself included, are missing the point.  Unfortunately, a lot of ethics is written in a way that seems to assume that people have some sort of innate sense of right and wrong.  While it is true that we are social beings with many needs and desires, it is also true that many of these things can never be fully satisfied.  As long as we have a strong emotional bond with another, we should not be obligated to satisfy those needs and that feeling.  We should be free to choose for ourselves, based on our rational self-interest, what is moral and what is immoral.  Many of us might find this idea repugnant, but so what?  The moral world is not a nice place.  It is a very nasty place, populated with evil people who are always in the wrong and who will do anything in their power to hurt others, even their own children.  Yet it is the only place in our universe in which we have that kind of choice.  The key to living a good life in this world is to make moral choices, not just for us but for others as well

In addition, he has written a number of other books for those who are serious about self improvement, including his most recent book: Power in Action 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a writer in my late twenties, I had to learn about different types of writing and the different types and styles of writing people do. The book I purchased from the library was The Writing Life of Ernest Hemingway by William A. Heinz. This book, as well as the book I found in a library that I read a few years ago, I highly recommend as it offers a lot of information about how to write as well other information on the art of writing that is very important to today's writers. HemingWay is the type of writing I have always wanted to learn and understand. He was not a good writer, but his books are one of the most important documents of the 20th century.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a classic in the field of psychology. It was written in the early sixties. It is the most complete and up-to-date work on the topic.It is divided into four parts. The first is a review of the major findings of the study of personality. These are the major traits that psychologists have known and studied. These include neuroticism, introversion, extraversion and openness to experience. The second part of the book reviews the most important findings in the theory of personality in the twentieth century. These findings are as follows: 1. Individuals have both psychological and biological characteristics. 2. Personality differences have their origin in the genetic structure of the human species and not in the environment. 3. Individuals with a high degree of openness to the world have a greater propensity to experience emotional pain and to experience intense pleasure. 4. Individuals who score high on measures of neuroticism have a tendency to avoid social situations which are potentially threatening to their well-being. This can be an asset if the person feels emotionally threatened in the presence of someone whose attitude is hostile. This attitude may well lead to emotional avoidance if the threat is not removed. If the person is in a safe situation, the tendency is for them to feel more positively about their situation. The final part of this book contains more general suggestions for the development of personality and ways in which personality can be improved. The most interesting aspect of the whole book is the discussion of the psychological processes underlying the development and maintenance of personality over time. In short, the human personality is not static, it is malleable. If this were not true, we would all be the same. The process of personality development, like the process of life itself, is unpredictable. The person is never simply a person. He or she is always the result of interaction with others. In spite of this, this book provides practical information and guidelines for developing personality and for making changes which are beneficial to one's self and to others. The book should be in every library, for it will aid in the development, maintenance and improvement of personality

This book is a great collection of stories, poems, and documents from the life of the early church.  Each section is well told, and each story is very interesting.  The pictures and illustrations are very helpful, especially for those who are new to the subject or who are interested in the history of American Catholicism.  I especially enjoyed the section on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.   The photographs are superb and beautifully illustrated. This book will provide a wealth of information for all those interested in American Christianity.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will change the way you think about the Vietnam war and of history in general.  It is a very accurate and objective study of the war, written by a man who was there, experienced it, and still lived it.  I first read this book as a young soldier in the military.  Since that time I have been re-reading it. The details are very clear and well documented.  This is not a memoir written by someone who was merely a grunt.    It has been put together from information collected by many people who served in Vietnam, many who have since passed away, many whose stories are related in other works of historical fiction, and by many soldiers, both American and Vietnamese, who are now long dead.  For all of those people, especially for the Vietnamese and many American soldiers who have lived through the war without any knowledge of it until recently, this is a book written for them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete and accurate account I have ever seen on the subject.  The book is about all aspects of the subject, not just the martial arts.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In his first book, Americanism, Henry L. Mencken gives an overview of the United States from its first appearance in the New World to the present.  This is not just a work on American history, but a study of the American character, as viewed by its people.  It covers the country's first beginnings as a new nation, its early expansion into the West, its transformation into a world power, and its rise into its present condition of greatness.  The book is not simply a series of essays on individual characters, but an examination of the common characteristics of the whole.   This makes for a good survey and guide on an important aspect of American life, a nation's attitude towards itself

This book does justice to his remarkable life by focusing on his contributions to India and the world at large.

If you are a long-time Nehru fan, this is an excellent book, if you are not yet a Nehrufan, this book might be a new start, and if you have yet to read Gandhi's autobiography and you are interested in India, this might be your place to start 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A delightful collection of short stories, all of them by male writers, told with the same skillful prose that has made them classics: funny, poignant and sad.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the challenges our nation is currently facing. While most Americans are only vaguely aware of the financial and environmental problems that are now affecting our planet, few can escape the consequences of environmental degradation in their daily lives. The most profound change we are likely to see in our future, however, is the erosion of public trust in the media. We are entering an era of "fake news," which is leading to widespread distrust in virtually every aspect of our political system. However, it is not the media that are responsible for this situation, but the American people themselves. Unfortunately, the media have been largely unable to address these issues adequately. This book does an excellent job of laying out the issues and providing solutions that the public can implement right now. I encourage you to buy it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   These essays, written by men and women in the gay community, are very insightful. The author gives us a glimpse into the lives of people from all walks of life. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the lives and opinions of gay men and lesbians 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a lifelong fan of the Beatles, I am thrilled to find a book about the band and their influence on American popular music that is not dated or "culturally-indignant". This book not only describes the band's history but also the music itself, the styles, and the impact of the album covers and songs they created. In all honesty, this book may be the best Beatles book out there, especially for those who were not alive in the 1950s or 1960s 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a wonderful collection of essays by a number of contemporary scholars on a wide range of topics.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book for anyone interested in American history. Very well done and beautifully illustrated 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a native Texan who has made a journey to the land of the free and home of the brave. The South, not only had a major role in the Civil War, but was also the site of a great civil rights movement, which I was lucky enough to witness in the '60's.  This book offers a fascinating account of the events of 1963.  In a small town in Mississippi, a young man named Malcolm X sets out on a mission to overthrow the racist government of the Jim Crow South.  The story follows Malcolm for two years as he grows in strength and stature as a spiritual leader and as he becomes a political force. I was very surprised at how few books on the Civil Rights Movement have covered the Mississippi of 1963, and this one does so in a very clear, well-researched manner.  I will certainly keep it in my personal collection 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of essays about contemporary life.  The subject is very broad and the authors are some of the finest essayists writing today.  I was amazed by how well the book relates to contemporary life, particularly the changing trends in the relationship between men and women.  For example, there is a discussion of women in the workforce who are not only doing better but have a greater appreciation of their own talents and accomplishments.  Many times I was astounded to find out that the same essayists were writing in the 1960s as well.  In many ways these essays are prescient as you will see from the changing culture in the next several decades.  Even in our society's most tumultuous times it is a very positive time to be a woman.  And as always, the essays are beautifully written 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A comprehensive work on the American and American Revolution. The historical context, military and financial, are all brought to life in this narrative.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a brilliant account of a life well lived by an extraordinary woman, a Jewish immigrant from Poland. She was one of the most remarkable and influential women of the twentieth century. Her love of the good life brought her much fame, but was also an inspiring source of self-sacrifice and compassion. The title refers to the way in which she lived her life, but it also describes the way of the heart.  She was deeply devoted to her husband and children, but also to the community around her. Her great kindness to others was not merely her way of being gentle; it was also the way by which she expressed her compassion. She gave of herself fully, and deeply, and in her own unique way. Her life demonstrates the great value of religion, family, and the life of the mind 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's the story of the famous 19th century American explorer John Cabot's adventures on the North American continent during the years 1801-1805.  This book is a fascinating read as John Cabots travels across the United States in search of gold, a quest which eventually brings him to Newfoundland to search for the mythical fabled Fountain of Youth.  The book is also written in the style of an adventure novel as Cabot is shown to be a brilliant navigator.  His achievements are illustrated with maps drawn by him as well as maps drawn in his journal.  You'll love the journey that Cabot, his crew and the explorers of his crew make and the adventures that result 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writings of the great American poet Walt Whitman are included in this monumental and beautifully written collection of essays and poems.  The author examines the poet's life and works in great depth and explains his influence on many people who continue to inspire us today.  This is a book for all who love great poetry and all who wish to know more about Walt Whitman.  There is nothing like a Walt Whitman poem 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a brilliant book.  For those of us who have never studied Zen or the Zen Buddhist traditions, this book is a treasure chest of teachings and wisdom.  The author does a great job of explaining the history and the philosophy of Zen.  Most of us have not studied the teachings of Chan or Zen, but if we have, this is a wonderful introduction to the teachings.  All the students, teachers, and laymen I have spoken with have been surprised and impressed by the depth and breadth of the Zen teachings in this book. The book is very detailed and is a must for anyone wanting to become more involved with Zen. I have studied Zen for a few years now, but I have only recently started to explore the many teachings contained in this wonderful book. I highly recommend this book to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent overview of the key areas of Jewish history.  It will interest anyone who wants to know more about the founding of the State of Israel and how it relates to today's problems.  As you read, you will see parallels between the two events.  This book will be of great use to many Jews, particularly in America 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautifully written and researched book, with some of the most interesting and insightful analysis on the world of crime and punishment ever published. The authors have written as if they were in the police department or prison, and they write about what they know as if it is their job to do so. It is truly fascinating stuff, as I read about the intricacies and psychology of what is known as the "blue collar crime" of "thief" crime. The book does not dwell on the details of the "how" of the crime, as this is a matter of public record. The main thrust of the book is the psychology and the sociology behind the rise and fall of the prison system. These topics are well explored in detail and the authors explain the various policies that have shaped the US prison system over the past century, and the factors that continue to shape it. The data that these authors bring to bear are staggering, and have profound implications for criminal justice policy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books.  While there have been a few books on Mormonism in recent years, there are none as thorough as this one.  I learned a lot from it, and have found many answers to questions I had.  In addition, I found it refreshing to read a novel written with an eye toward what it means to live a Mormon's life.  Even the most cynical and judgmental will find something to agree with 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete and comprehensive guide to alchemy and black magic to be published to date.  The book covers the entire history of alchemy, from the first century CE through the Middle Ages.  In it are detailed descriptions of how to work with the elements of magic, such as fire and water, and the proper use of the black arts of invisibility, poison, and mind control.  It also covers the most recent and still controversial developments in alchemy: the creation of "super-matter," which could be used to travel through space and beyond, and "super plants," which would be plants able to live forever.  This book has been written by a student of alchemical studies for a student 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive biography of Charles Manson.  For anyone with any interest in the cult leader, this is a must read.  The author gives a lot of details on the life of Manson and also a lot on the crimes he committed.  This biography covers the early 20's to the present.  Even though the murders of Sharon Tate, Mary and Jean Schulte, and the Tate-La Bianca murders were done after the book was written, it gives you an overall idea of the man and the crimes committed.It's very well written and it has a lot to say about Manson that is not only interesting, but is also important to know.The author does not sugar coat anything.  He talks about the cold and calculated murder of Sharon and Mark Fuhrman, the murder of pregnant Sharon Tate by the Manson family, the murders in Santa Monica of the Tate family and friends, and many other details.  You get to see the killer as well as his victims.I have read Manson's biographies many times before and this is the best.  It does not skimp on any information and it explains every detail clearly and in a way you can comprehend.  Manson's life and life of his victims has never been done justice until this biography has been written.  If you want to know more about Manson or the crimes of the cult, this book is a MUST read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book to read for a new or returning Jewish adult. I've read other articles, books, and resources on this topic but this was my first foray into the world of Shabbat, and I've been able to glean much from these insights. As a result, I've begun a Shabbatean course, which will focus on Shabbats. The style is simple and easy to read, yet the insights are profound.

His essays are always creative and insightful and he really tries to make sense of things.  This is the book I have been waiting for.  As a kid I read it on a lark and never expected to have the chance to use it.  Now I can and it's so helpful, and it makes sense to me.  He is truly a great writer 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good introduction to the topic. It deals with many diverse topics, ranging from the history of photography to the history and uses of the Internet. It's also a bit of a memoir of how I discovered the history, especially the work of Van Gogh. I was drawn to this book because it was the only book I had ever read that gave credit to the French artist for his work. I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an invaluable resource for people just starting their research into the history of the Irish people, particularly the Famine. The essays are a great deal more personal and readable than anything I've seen elsewhere. As well as looking at the famine, the topics covered are the struggle of the Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church, the creation of the United Irishmen, the British Empire, the First World War, the Boer War, Ireland and the world wars, the Second World War and post-war Ireland, the partition, post-monarchy and the Republic, Irish nationalism, etc. The stories told are both tragic and inspiring, from King and Parnell, to the brave resistance of those who were not able to flee to England, to those who took up arms to fight against the British for a united Ireland, to Mary MacKillop and her contribution to the campaign for Irish independence. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the history and culture of Ireland

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a graduate student studying Chinese and Japanese I found this book by Eunyoung Kim, a graduate of the Department of Japanese and Chinese Studies, to be indispensable.  This is the only book that will provide me with the information I need to begin learning Chinese.  Kim's work on the kana has been invaluable in this regard.  My students and I find that she is very good with visual aids for students to memorize kana.  I especially appreciate the way she approaches her topics, from the historical point of view, and then brings her analysis to bear.  It gives students a much deeper understanding of the history behind the language and culture of Chinese and Korean than is provided by the average textbook.  Highly recommended for students seeking an understanding of

Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book for anyone with interest in Native American history, culture and traditions.  It is full of information about the Native Americans of the east coast and the Great Lakes area, the Iroquois Confederacy, the Huron Confederation, the Six Nations, the Cherokee and Seminoles, and many more.   This is not a history book in the sense of a text book, but rather a collection of stories, quotes, maps, photographs, genealogies, and other information pertaining to Native American culture.  I found much of this information to be somewhat dated, but the information provided is still valuable and will give readers a good understanding of Native American's past

The book will fascinate and entertain any medievalist and medievalist lover. I am delighted that I've found a book like this that can answer so many questions for me 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a wealth of information about the life and works of Joseph Smith. I highly recommend this as a resource for the serious student of LDS history. It is well-researched, and the chapters are filled with interesting insights into his life. There is a very positive tone throughout. Some of the information is not readily available elsewhere, and some interesting facts remain untold. But most of all, I learned much from this book. I am very glad I picked up a copy, and hope it is on my bookshelf for many years to come 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had not read this book before, but have read many of the previous ones. This book, in its fourteenth edition, is the most complete yet and one of the most interesting. This is a biography of William Henry Harrison, and, most interesting, it is also the story of the man himself. Harrison was a man of great moral fiber, but also a great actor. He was a politician, soldier, statesman, stateswoman and humanitarian. I would recommend this book to anyone with interest in American history. I found it extremely well done

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best and most important non-fiction texts on spirituality and the meaning of life available.  All too often religious people take too narrow a view of what is possible.  In this text, Sperry gives us a much broader view.  Readers of all faiths will find something that they will benefit from in this text.  It is a profound work and a must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The great work of fiction that I read in the early 1970s and have not read since. It is the story of a lonely boy and the woman who loves him, in the heart of the French Alps. I found this to be one of the most poetic books ever written. I can hardly put it down and I hope everyone else does 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive biography of Martin Luther. His life story is one of the most fascinating of any American, and his rise to power in the Protestant Reformation is one the most exciting events in the history of the western world.  As a result of the work of his contemporaries (Willem I. van Helmont, Johann Nepomuk van Helmond, Martin Bucer), Luther is often regarded as the founding figure of the Reformation.  Yet, he has been underrepresented. This book is a tour de force in this regard. It is a work of historical research which is detailed enough to allow readers to see how the life of Luther unfolded and yet still gives enough space to the individual to explain his own religious ideas.  While the work is primarily based on Luther's own writings, he also has extensive access to various important primary sources, including correspondence. All of these documents form the core of this magnificent book. And yet it is the way Luther presents the life he lived and the reasons he chose certain paths that make the book so interesting and important. The first two of these are of immediate interest.  Luther's early life is the stuff of myth.  But his mother, Katharina, and her sister, Agnes, did not always see their son as the Messiah. The two siblings were poor and often hungry. The stories of the two siblings are particularly moving. Both of them endured terrible abuse from their father, the King of Hungary, and both of them were raised to hate their stepmother. However, one of them, Agne, overcame her physical abuse to come to live with her brother, and they formed a strong and loving bond. After an unhappy childhood, Luther grew up to become a pious youth. He studied the Bible and made his way to the Lutheran community in Wittenberg, Germany, where he was to become the most important intellectual and religious leader in the German world. Luther eventually became the head of the Lutherans in Würzburg, but after a short time he was sent to a monastery in the Rhineland to study with a fellow cleric named Zwingli.  The journey into the Rhine valley was a harrowing one, and it is during this time that Luther's faith began to wane. He began to believe that God was not sovereign over all, but merely the ruler of one Christian congregation. In this period, Luther wrote a polemic in favor of a return to a Roman Catholic Church, and
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very informative book about a very important subject, the Holocaust. The information is presented in a very clear and interesting way.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a classic work in American literature.  If you haven't read it already you will want to  read it now.  It brings to light the dark side of human nature and the need to protect oneself and one's loved ones.  This book is a must read for any who are involved in an extramarital affair. It will inspire you to move on with your life and continue to be a better person.  You will feel guilty for the rest of your life.  Be thankful you didn't live through the scandalous time that these men were in their twenties and thirties 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A well written, informative book about the history of Christianity and its influence throughout the world. I found the book interesting and educational. I'm a historian, so I did not find much information about the life of Jesus, but the main topic of the book is the Christianity. There were a few historical errors, but overall, the book was very good 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far my most favourite novel. It has a great story line and a brilliant description of London in the mid-19th century. As with any good novel it is easy to read as a whole, but it is a beautiful story in smaller portions. The main character is a woman called Charlotte; she marries a young, rich man. After five years he leaves, she finds herself alone in a house she can never afford to leave. She becomes involved in a scheme of political intrigue and deceit and becomes a part of the story of London. This novel is the perfect example of a character who goes through a series of tragic events, grows and changes, and ends up in a much better place than when she started. A really lovely novel, and a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is written in a humorous, conversational style.  This is the first book I have read from this collection and I loved every page.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a very interesting book about the relationship between the American and French Revolutions. The French Revolution was perhaps the most difficult for the Americans to accept as the end of monarchy and the rise of the Republic. And I agree with those who have noted the importance of Charles de Gaulle in both the French Revolution and the American Revolution. This book has a wealth of information about both the Revolution in France and the Revolution of the United States. The history of both revolutions are well documented and the author provides information on the background, both political and intellectual, of the people involved. I especially like the reference to the French Revolutios as "the War of American Independence" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the theories and techniques of psychodynamic psychotherapy.  The theories and processes covered are unique and innovative and very practical 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a parent or caregiver, you have certainly heard this story before. I have seen many versions of this story and I have to say it has been my favorite. The story is based on the fact that many people are born with a condition called Angelman Syndrome. Angelman is a genetic condition that causes a person to resemble a cartoon character. In some cases, these people appear to be living in their mother's wombs. Some people with Angelman are born without a penis or a vagina. Some have just the tip of the penis on display. They also look like they are wearing a diaper. Angelmen are able to have sexual intercourse. Most often, they have intercourse with their mother. Angelmens can become very promiscuous in the sexual arena and are very picky lovers. They can be very intelligent and some even get college degrees. These people have also been known to become very depressed and many have tried to commit suicide. What you do not know is that the Angelmen have many friends. Many of these friends can be seen in the story. I think the best way to understand what these Angelmen do and how to help someone like this is to read this book. If you do get this book, you may not be able to wait to start reading Angelmen. I am one of these people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this, I knew I'd stumbled across something truly special. I've seen and read the other great books by this master of modernist photography (Daido Moriyama, Robert Frank, etc), but never before had I read about the photographer Robert Frank. This book contains many beautiful images from his most important works of art (the album "Rabbit Run," "Summer of '45," and "Foto di Tito") that can help you explore the human psyche and understand what it means to be human.Frank is not afraid to speak his mind and it shows in his images. He may have made some of the most negative images you can ever see, but he also makes beautiful pictures with his eye and soul. For all of us, we all have a part to play in the bigger picture. The human psyche is beautiful, even in its ugliest form. This is a beautifully illustrated guide to help us connect with that world and to appreciate the beauty in the ugly.Frank died a little over a decade ago, but his spirit continues to live on. This collection of beautiful images is his gift to you to help you become more attuned to the wonder and beauty in our world. It's important to learn the lesson of the ugly, and the beauty of the beautiful, together 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've ever read on this topic. I am so pleased with the way the author draws connections between the social issues of our time and the spiritual issues of the church 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is an important look at the evolution of a religious movement through several centuries.  We must not forget that in order to become what they are today the Catholic Church had to be born.  It is a fascinating look at that fascinating history and the role of women.  While there are many important developments and issues, for the most part the book concentrates on a few key themes that make this movement unique.  The first of these is the women's roles within the Catholic church.  All the great religious movements have at times looked in a negative way upon women and even today the "biblically faithful" are often quite un-Christ-like in their attitudes.  Yet women play a very important role in the Catholic tradition, both literally and figuratively.  Women who were not ordained and therefore excluded from the priesthood had to take a leadership role in church events and social affairs, for example the first ordination of women to the priesthood.  That is why, for instance, Pope Clement VIII instituted a series of synods called the Second Vatican Council which sought to modernize the church's teaching, which had not always been so consistent.  In addition to this, women played a significant role in spreading the Christian message through the "public preaching" of the word

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has it all. It is a comprehensive collection of scholarly essays on the Jewish religions. The essays cover each of the four major religions that Judaism has been and will ever be - Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Each religion is presented with a case study. The case studies cover the full spectrum of the religion from the Old Testament to the present day. The articles cover different facets of the issues and the sources used for each study. As a historian this is the most up to date and detailed collection of Jewish sources on all four of these religions I have seen. The writings are extremely thought-provoking. The authors are not only deeply knowledgeable on the subject but they are also witty and insightful in discussing it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that has been so important in the lives of so many that we almost don't remember its existence. The story is about the development of the modern woman from the time of the Renaissance to the early 1900's. The author has done a fantastic job of showing how the roles of woman have changed through the ages. She does an excellent job of drawing out all the important events and giving insight into the real women of our history. The style is wonderful and there are many stories in this book which are completely new to me and my own life. The only problem I have is that I have not read all of her other books and am still learning from this one. However, for someone who is looking for information on women and their role in our history, this is an outstanding book and I have read it many times over. There is simply no other book like it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a compilation of the major writings of John Donne, one of the most significant and innovative writers in all of English.  It is an extraordinary work, a study of the language of love. Donne is often praised as a philosopher and poet, but this book makes it clear that this is no triviality.  The book presents Donne's thoughts and poems in his own  words, which he had originally written in the   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The original work, written by Nobel Laureate and renowned social scientist Robert Putnam, is a powerful analysis of America's changing demography.  The book focuses on the inner cities of the US.  It offers some useful tips and statistics that many American readers may not be aware of.   There are some excellent chapters on immigration and welfare benefits, as well as tips on how to improve the quality of life for American children.  There is a chapter on family values, and a fascinating analysis of the rise of fundamentalist and fundamentalist-inspired religion in America.  All of this is presented in a non-judgmental manner that is refreshingly original.  This is a must read for any American concerned about the future of their children and society.  I encourage anyone looking for more information on demographic changes in the US to get this book.  A must read

It is written by a living historian, Charles C. Mann, who has worked as a historian in Washington DC for thirty-five years.  The information provided in this book is so detailed and up-to-date that it is very difficult to believe that we are in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.  For those who have a passion for the Civil War and want to know more about the war and why we went to war it is a good reference 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Well, it is a book of stories, but there are many important truths in these tales. The story of a Native American who, after being taken by an Indian agent, was sold into slavery, and then found on a reservation, the story of an American who was mistreated because of his race, and who fought back and won a long fight for his freedom, and the story about a group of American Indians who became a Christian army fighting for freedom for the white people who had persecuted them all along. This is a story that needs to be told again and again, and often. The characters are all wonderfully drawn, and they are all different but all good.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It took me by surprise. I just found out that it has recently been reprinted. It has really brought the time travel theory and its application to many of my favorite films. I've always felt that it would be an interesting exploration of the concept. In this book, a real scientist explains how the time stream works and how the Doctor's TARDIS is capable of traveling to different time periods. He demonstrates this in many ways. I think this is a great book and one I'll be reading again soon. I only wish it had been out when I was a kid! I was fascinated by the idea of time travel. I never thought I would see the movies and tv shows it inspired but now that I am an adult I find myself excited at the idea and look forward to reading more about it. I hope more of my readers will get a chance to see the works of Philip K. Dick and Robert Heinlein and other great writers that explored the possibility of time and the future.

The book covers the period from his boyhood until he passed away at age forty.  Frost was a man of great sensitivity, his poetry a reflection of life.  He was not just a great poet but a sensitive man who loved his family, his friends, his community.  This book gives you a very clear picture of Frost. You can see the beauty, the pain, the love of country, love of his friends and loved ones, and above all love of God and his fellow man.  It is a wonderful book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read the title for this book, I was taken by its description. In this beautiful book, the author, Jean S. Kerr, examines the life and times of the renowned artist, Salvador Dali. Through the author's eyes, we see Dali as a child, man, and, of course, an artist. His life is filled with incredible beauty and humor, and is full of joy. The writing is simple, yet evocative of a life of great love. I would have loved this book to read when I was a child and to have been able to see what life is like for a child of his age. As an adult, the words were still as fresh as the paintings that inspired them, but it helped me to see the world from Dali's eyes. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read and reread this book over and over. It is a wonderful look at how an ordinary young person can become something special. This book takes you on the journey of her life through the pages. She makes many mistakes and she learns. It takes her from her comfort zone as a young woman living in Boston, to her heartbreak in France, to the joy of winning the first prize at the World Fantasy Convention. Her perseverance is what gets her to where she is today.This book is one of the few works that I know of that tells the story of one woman's transformation from a simple girl in the suburbs of Boston to a young adult fantasy writer. You will see the struggle, determination, and talent that this young woman has to face. You can learn about her struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, her faith, and her family. You also see the joy that is found in success and the excitement of new and exciting adventures. The book also gives you tips to make your own book, and to stay organized when you have deadlines.You will learn of her inspirations from her mother who inspired her to start writing and to keep her family out of her writing, her father who helped her keep her faith and her passion for her work and the wonderful support system that surrounds her as she prepares for the WorldCon convention.You also get to see the triumph, the mistakes, and the successes as the young author and her publisher, Tom Laughlin, fight their way to success in this fascinating story. You find out what really happened in this young girl's life, and you learn what she has been able to do with the talents that she has.

It teaches you how to write in a fun and exciting manner, and it teaches you to stay focused in a crazy busy world!

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book to have on your shelf. It is written by a woman who has lived the life of the mind. She was born in the middle of the Depression, raised in the era of World War II, was a nurse in the army, married a war hero, and wrote a non-fiction best seller about her experiences. She has survived. She's alive, and writing about it. In this amazing memoir, she shares her secrets as a "survivor" and a survivor's writer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book when I was in my teens.  In those days, I was very interested in the occult, and I was always reading books about it.  I always loved Edgar Cayce's writing, so I was especially excited when this was published.  This book was a great help in understanding how this stuff works.  It was also an eye-opener, which I still have.  Cayce was quite a different person when he had that kind of power, but he had a genuine interest in helping his fellow man.  He knew that many people had no idea how the world really worked.   The whole of this book is just about practical application.  Most of the information in the book is quite simple, but it helps you understand the inner workings of your mind, and of your body.  Some of the techniques are quite bizarre, but they are very effective if you really understand them.  You learn to be more in tune with your own energy, and to better manage your energy.  There are several different methods, but basically it boils down to this:  - Take a bath.  - Eat some chocolate.  Let's not forget about coffee.  Drink lots of water.  Relax.  Be in tune to your body and mind  - Write out a positive report about a really good day.  No matter what the weather is like, it always seems to be good.  We are all here in spirit, and each of us has a role to play in this unfolding.  All we have to do is tune in to each other's energy, recognize our roles and allow them to take charge

In this text, the authors are very informative, precise, and thorough.  You will see how and why the ideas that were so important to the American founding were developed and evolved.  This book will appeal to the serious student of American history as well as to the general reader.  All of the facts and figures are well-chosen and presented in a concise manner.

These men took this fight on the side of the slaves and took their message to every corner of the South.  I am so glad that we are able to learn more about this and other events in this war.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had this book for a long time, but hadn't read it yet. I've been researching some of the famous early 20th century people who have influenced me, and found this book very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book for a conference on the Jewish Holocaust that I was attending. After my talk on the holocaust, I was taken with the story of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The book provides an extremely clear and succinct summary of the events and offers an overview of the political situation in Poland in the late 1930s. The author also provides much background information on the Ghetto that may be of interest to students. The most remarkable aspect of this book, however, is the account of the Ghettos resistance.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an outstanding study on the lives and times of the Irish immigrants in the US. The author is from Ireland, and gives much of his personal life background. He provides a wide range of material on the culture, food, music, dance and sport of the time. He also has some fascinating statistics and statistics about the Irish in the United States during this time. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the culture of the immigrants. The chapters on the Irish-Americans in the 1850s through the 1960s are particularly compelling, and there is much more to learn about the people of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As the author says in the Foreword, his main interest in this work is "to present an accurate and up-to-date account of Irish-American history and to document the contribution made to US culture and society by Irish-born Americans 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has the most comprehensive discussion of Islam that I have read. It is not a work of history but a work based on the Quran.  For the first time I feel as though I understand the concept of Islamic law. The book also provides an interesting account of how Islam started. It has a few flaws 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In his first posthumous volume, David Irving takes up the fight once more with a detailed discussion of the events surrounding the death of John Demjanjuk and his wife Eva, at the hands of the SS.  From the death penalty to the Nuremberg war crimes trials to the establishment of the "Holocaust" legend, in this remarkable work Irving is determined to demonstrate that John Demyanjuk was indeed a Nazi collaborator and, in fact, the prime perpetrator in the execution of his wife.  The book is not without errors (and one case of revisionism), but it is an essential study in the subject.  As it has so often been in the past, "The Rising Star" will serve as the benchmark for further studies.  I hope it is ever published in English 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book I've ever seen on the history of feminism in the United States.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that I most wanted to read when I was growing up.  I feel it would be hard to overstate how influential this book was in my life.  It helped me understand myself, and my life, in ways that many other books and films never have.  This book is full of wisdom, and the stories of people like myself and other individuals who have overcome much, even some of the greatest adversity.  Every person has a story, and a chance for change.  So, read this book, and then ask yourself a very difficult but very important question.  Do you have a story like this within yourself, and are you waiting to find the answer in your own life

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a unique perspective of the Holocaust as an event and as a phenomenon, drawing from an array of perspectives that span from science to politics to psychology. The book is organized into ten chronological sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the tragedy.  The first three sections deal with the Jewish suffering of the Shoah and the Holocaust itself. The other seven sections deal specifically with the German and Roma victims of the holocaust.  I found the Holocaust to be an event with many complexities, and this book provided an in-depth look at those complexities, the motivations and actions of the perpetrators and the victims. It is impossible to fully comprehend the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust without the study of the documents, the statistics, and the survivors' descriptions, which is what this book provides 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on the subject of the Catholic Church I've read.  From the first sentence, you know it will be a good one.  It covers every aspect of the Church, her history, organization, finances, doctrine, liturgy, leadership, and ministries.  There are many books that do a similar job, but this is the best.  I read it while in New Mexico on a Catholic pilgrimage.  We got to see St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Francis Xavier at work, and this book gave me a real appreciation of the Pope's work.  His work is really, really wonderful.  He has shown tremendous commitment and care, and the Church is the better for it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book offers a brilliant analysis of the Jewish Question as a major issue in world history. The book deals with the events that led up to the War of Independence, the subsequent independence struggle, and the emergence of the state of Israel. It also provides a detailed account of the events which led to the founding of Israel, a very impressive achievement for anyone in his position. I hope the authors of the current edition of this book will take the time to expand and update the material found in this book, in light of the latest developments in world politics 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an important book for students to understand the social and cultural roots of American racism. I have studied and taught race, social, and cultural history for the last decade. In this book, Dr. Oakes brings the ideas of the past to the present. The book is very readable and I have highly recommended this book to many students.The text is divided into two sections. First, the text of American slavery; second, the history of the Civil Rights movement. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I learned about the racism of the 1950's and 1960's. This is the time when a few of the most racist laws were passed in the country. Some of the examples are: the literacy tests, the "white primaries", the lynchings, the school segregation, the denial of civil rights to African Americans, the exclusion of Blacks from the military. I would not have thought such laws were still in place today. Dr.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The world of animal husbandry has changed in the past century, and the book gives an in-depth look at the methods used today by animal breeders, farmers, ranchers and others who work with farm animals.  The author provides an overview and explanation of many of the techniques in detail, which is a valuable addition to the many textbooks that cover the same subjects.  Most of the information is applicable to the larger backyard flock, which I recommend.  Readers who want to become more familiar with their pet's diet should read this book.

The students are now better prepared to handle the real writing business than they were before I presented them with this new perspective 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that you have to have on your shelf for those times when you really want to get to know someone.  It really gives the reader a sense of what life in a Jewish family is like in the 1950s and 60s in America

There are many wonderful stories in this book, but there is this one about a very young boy named "Samuel" who is about to go into the World War. The story is so good, that I had to pick it up, even though the title states it is the story of Sam.  I am very sad that Samuel is going to die, but I am glad that this story has been told.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The most original, thought provoking, and entertaining book I've ever read!  The American War in Afghanistan is a fascinating history of the conflict and what it has meant to the American people and our relations with Pakistan.  If you've never read about this war, now's your chance!  I loved the narrative voice, the research, and the insight into the lives of the ordinary men and women  of the Afghan people.  This is the story of our country, it is the people who fought, and it is us, the people, who will win 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of essays about a great man: St. Francis of Assisi.   It is full of wisdom and deep insight into his life, ministry and works.  I wish I'd been born to see him in my lifetime!   But I also realize that this was a man whose personal life and ministry, however remarkable, is in no way comparable to the life and mission of the Church that he loved.  We must continue in the quest to make the world a better place for everyone, regardless of creed.  For that, we need men like Francis of ASSISI

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title of this book tells you all you need to know about this unique and enlightening work.  It covers the life of the Christ from the beginning to the end.  From his birth to his crucifixion, he teaches us the ways of love and service.  His teachings are also for us today, so that we may live a life of compassion and joy.  For centuries we have been told that to understand him we must read his life, but this is a good text for all ages.  One can also learn much from the writings of his disciples.  There are many teachings that are still applicable today, such as "love thy neighbor as thyself."  These are the principles by which the church must live today, and as such, they form the basis for this book.  I especially enjoyed this book, which not only tells us all about Christ, but also his disciples, who share in his life and teachings

I found myself constantly researching the companies and products I wanted to buy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent collection of essays on the work of William Faulkner. While the majority of the essays are short, the ones that are a bit longer all have something new to say about the work. I particularly like the discussion of his "Gone with the Wind" trilogy, which is considered by many to be the masterpiece of American literature. The themes he explores are complex, yet there is nothing formulaic about them. For many, Faulkener's prose will never seem to have a clear meaning. This book reminds us that, in fact, the meaning of Faulkenthal's work is not always obvious at first glance 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're looking for a good historical novel that can be enjoyed by both young and old, this is for you.  This is a story about a woman named Marie Antoinette.  She's the first woman to be crowned "Emperor" of France (and is the only female monarch to do so).  Marie Antoine was married twice before marrying Napoleon.  In 1815 she gives birth to two sons, Napoleon Bonaparte (who goes on to become "Napoleon III") and Louis Napoleon. She's never heard from her second husband since the death of their daughter.  Yet the children are still her children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an extremely informative, fascinating, and inspiring biography of Robert Moses, the "father of modern urban development". He is a man of many contradictions. He was an anti-Semitic, anti-homosexual, and anti-Catholic but he did accomplish what few American mayors have accomplished: he transformed New York City into a metropolis that was world class. He even gave his name to the world's tallest building, the One World Trade Center.    In addition to Moses, who had an extensive life, this book includes his family, friends, fellow politicians, architects, engineers, and journalists. It is quite remarkable to see how Moses changed New York for the better in such a short period of time. His achievements are beyond doubt. Moses, however, was not the only one whose legacy the city bears. The book is also extremely well illustrated and it offers excellent insight into the evolution of New York as a whole 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very useful book on the subject of the Chinese Communist Party.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an exploration of one of the most fascinating and misunderstood subjects in the history of music and art. It examines the history and the techniques of performance and recording.  It focuses on those techniques that were considered to be the most primitive: the tuning of a string to a piano. The techniques used to create the sound of a live band. The technology used to record music.  These techniques were considered by many to be "obsolete" but as the book points out are now used by professional musicians everywhere, in all genres.  I found this book to be a wonderful source of information, as well as an inspirational look into the field of musical performance and music production.  This is a book that you will want to have in your library.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The subject of "Moral Development and Children" has been explored and debated throughout history.  The book presented here is the first that attempts to explore children's moral development from the time of their conception.

As the first book on moral growth in children's books  I have found, this is one of the most complete  and powerful statements on children's morality ever written

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book, one of my favorites, and it is about the "Old" West.  I was struck by the similarities between the cowboy and the shaman.  That's where the characters come from.  Both have a deep connection with the land and with life as a whole.  The way in which they connect, both metaphorically and literally, is what the book deals with.  This book is essential for anyone who loves the Old West 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of inspiring stories of the incredible people I have met in my life. It is filled with the stories of those who have been to the moon and back. It covers topics that I could never even imagine, but that I do find myself thinking about regularly. For example, how do we make contact with the moon? The Moon is in Earth's orbit and if we can make contact there, we have an opening for exploration of our solar system 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're thinking of going to law school you'll want to read this.  It will give you a lot of information to get you through law school and prepare you for the bar exam.  My favorite character in the book is one of the most likable and down to earth.  She is an attorney who works for a large firm.  Her name is Julie.  I had never heard of her before and I've found out a ton about her over the years.  All the information she gives you will be helpful.  If only the law students in law school knew how much they don't know.  Don't be discouraged if you don't make the bar

Snaith) but it is well worth it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book, the kind of book you'd expect to find in a Goodreads book review or in a children's book group.  It is a story that teaches important life skills and is a joy to read.  As a teacher I have used this book many times

This is one of the greatest books ever written. It will change the way you think about and view the Great depression

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a tribute to the great American writer, Ralph Ellison, whose books include Invisible Man and Coming Home. This is the true story of how a black writer of his generation went from a small town to Hollywood, and from the ghetto to the most popular novel of the '40s and '50s. It is also a story about the great black writers, including W.E.B. DuBois, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Louis Stevenson, Flannery O'Connor, James Baldwin, Virginia Woolf, Joyce Carol Oates, and many, many more. The stories in this book are the best, both in prose and poetry. There are many wonderful poems in this collection and some of the best short stories ever written. The poems are the most touching and evocative. The best way to spend a weekend is to pick up a copy of Invisible Man or Coming Home, pick up this book, and spend the rest of the time in your house reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a well-known fact that the first three or four chapters of any good novel, before we get to the actual action, are the best. Well, this is one of those novels.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has made a positive difference in my life.  It has saved my marriage.  I am currently in recovery from a divorce.  There are many books on the subject.  But  this one takes the time to explain things from both the spouse's and the children's perspectives.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book about the history of the Jews. It is a great book to study for classes on American Jewry. It shows how the Jew was assimilated into the mainstream of American society. There is a whole chapter on the American Jewish experience from the American Revolution all the way through WWII.The only problem I have is that the author does not go far enough. He discusses the persecution of the German Jews but not the persecution the Irish, Italian, or Polish. But I am sure there is more to be written about the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating account of the life and works of John Ruskin, the architect of modern British aestheticism. This is the first book I've read about Ruskin. I had not previously heard of his work, but it turns out that the English style is his most significant contribution, which he developed during the nineteenth century, a period during which English architecture as a whole dramatically changed, from the neoclassical and Victorian to the Art Nouveau. Ruskin's art is also unique in that it involves not only architecture, but also visual art, music and theater, painting and printmaking. The book is full of inspiring photos, diagrams, and other illustrations that will allow students to gain a better understanding of this incredible man. The writing is superb. The story is a joy to read and the illustrations will enhance any classroom

The second part is devoted to the many important political and social events that he, the Owenites, and others took part in in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Each of the various events is described in great detail, the political background being given more detail in each chapter. Many of the quotes from people who were at these important events are included, as well as short biographies of those who were key figures in those events. The style of writing is very readable and easy to understand. The illustrations add even more colour and detail. I would recommend this book to anyone who has interest in Scottish politics.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this classic work, one of the great modern American exponents of the sociology of sex, Evelyn Hooker offers us an insightful, provocative, and ultimately hopeful view of contemporary American sex lives.  For over a hundred years, Hooker has studied and written about women's and men's changing sexual strategies and identities, their changing attitudes and behaviors, their evolving relationships, and their ever-expanding roles in the public and private spheres.  The result is a study of a phenomenon that is as complex as sexuality itself, one which has taken place in American society through much of the history of this nation.  Through the insights, observations, and arguments of this master sociologist, we are brought to recognize how the individual, culture, and the politics of sex have mutually influenced each other in our modern society.  As this is the fourth edition of this landmark work, we find Hooker's conclusions, and what she hopes to inspire us to do about them, continually inspiring new developments in our thinking about and responses to sex.  We are, to borrow a phrase, in a sexual revolution.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author is very well informed about the historical and contemporary issues that shaped World War I. She is the only one I have read that actually delves into the political and economic issues that affected Europe.

This book is essential reading for any serious student of this conflict. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers a variety of topics that are helpful to new or young adult readers.  The format is a series of short stories.  Most of them are very well written, and some are even very funny.  For example, in the story "The Secret Garden" one of the characters is a little boy named Harry.  He has just discovered a secret garden full of butterflies.  It is full of little things he can do with the butterflies, like fly them to the edge of the garden or take them to his house.  In fact, it turns out that he can use the butterflies for almost anything!  When one of his sisters asks him how he can help them find out more about this garden he says that he will take one of them to their house and look it up in the encyclopedia.   In a flash of inspiration, Harry does just that, finding that the Encyclopedia defines a butterfly as a flying animal and that the flower that gives the butterflies its name is a lily.  So, Harry takes his little butterfly, which looks a lot like a mule, and flies over the garden.  As the butterfly flies along, it lands on a little lily and it begins to slowly open.  Meanwhile, Harry and the little flower talk and eventually Harry tells the little lilies what he knows about butterflies. So, after a few minutes, the butterfly begins to fly around the garden and lands on another flower, and the same thing occurs.  After a couple of minutes of this, it notices the little bird perched on the top of the flower and flies out of the little garden and back into the house. The bird lands on the floor, and he and Harry talk until the bird learns to fly like a bird and they fly around again.  Then they go to the library to look up more information about butterflies, and Harry tells them how he is able to find butterflies in his garden and finds them everywhere.  Harry tells this story to his sister while they are going to lunch in the park.  Just before he leaves, the little sister asks him what he does with the birds that land on the flowers.  This question causes Harry to think back to the butterfly that he has told his little sister and he explains that, just like he found butterflies on the little flowers, he finds them on the bird.  Since he is so knowledgeable about butterflies and he is sure that the bird is one of those butterflies, he tells the bird to go

The authors take us through the life of a great American religious revival in the 19th century, the most dynamic period of religious life in American history.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a classic. It is not just a collection of essays. It deals with a host of issues related to faith, the self, spirituality and the human spirit.

I am a Christian but at times I wonder if I am really a Christian 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an outstanding and thought provoking text. One of the best introductions to American law I have read. It is the perfect companion to the recent legal dramas unfolding on America's political stage.The book begins with a historical account of the founding of the Republic. It then describes the evolution of the US legal system from the Colonial Period to the present. The book is divided into five major sections, each dealing with a major issue of law and politics.The first section is entitled 'The Constitution, Rights and Liberties'. This section describes the development of the Constitution of the United States from its adoption by the delegates at the Constitutional Convention to its ratification by the states. The first major section deals with individual rights.The second section deals specifically with the rights of the accused. This section covers several areas: the legal definition of 'criminal', the rights involved with cross examination and the nature of the admissibility of evidence.The third section deals directly with political rights. The rights of free speech, assembly, press and petition are treated, as are the rights relating to voting.The fourth section deals generally with the role of law in the administration of justice. This is the section that will give you the most insight into the workings of the American legal system. It deals specifically, as one might expect, with the Supreme Court and the way that it interprets and applies the law. This part of the text covers all of the major decisions of the Supreme court. The fifth section deals primarily with issues of taxation. It describes the role that the state plays in collecting taxes, and the manner in which the law defines the amount of tax that must be collected.This is the most detailed and accessible account I have ever read of American law. It has served as a textbook for law students in my classroom for many years, and it will serve as a text for law professionals for many more. One cannot do justice to the content of this book in a short review, so I will do it in a series of excerpts from the book. The text begins with an historical account and then proceeds to deal with several issues of law, political rights, taxation and the role played by the state in taxation. The final section deals broadly with the way in which American society is being restructured in the aftermath of the current Presidential election. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of law. I think the book is excellent for anyone who wants to take a deep look at American politics and law and understand their relationship. The
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting and thought-provoking book. I am not religious and have no idea where the name came from, but the book provides a compelling reason to go to church. The main characters are mostly people who are not religious.

This book also touches on the cultural values of the 1950's that have survived and still inform the values of today

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a very clear and detailed explanation of a wide range of issues relating to marriage and divorce. It is a real treat for anyone thinking of remarrying or considering divorce. This book is not only practical but also funny. If you have any doubts about your position in life, take a moment and go through the issues. You will find that the more you think about them, the more clear you become. It may seem strange, but the issues that we choose in life often have an impact on the way we live our lives in many ways, and the more we examine them, that impact becomes more obvious. The book will open your eyes to ways of thinking that will help you to be a better person, a better husband, a more helpful husband and a more loving husband.Read it, and then read it again. If any of the issues you have are not dealt with here, go back and work out the problem for yourself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a history buff, this is a great, well researched, well written book to start with.  There are only two real negatives about this book.  One, the photographs are very limited, and one, there is so much historical background on WWII that it may be a little overwhelming for some.  But if you are interested in history, this book is the only one I know of that covers it in a way that is not too tedious and doesn't overwhelm you with a plethora of history.  I have loved every page of this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating, humorous and inspiring account of how an American man named Joe Namath developed his own brand of rugged individualism in the face of the cold war.  Namath, an actor who had never held a government job before, took over a small advertising firm in New York City.  He refused to buy advertisements for products that made people feel comfortable and comfortable was one of the first things he began to advertise for in the wake of his move to New Jersey.  At the height of his business, he was making over $500,000 a year and even flew to London to compete in the 1962 World Series of Baseball.  His success was made possible by his willingness to make bold moves that would have gotten him fired from a cubicle job in the New York advertising business.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been inspired to pursue their own dreams or just feels a little uneasy about the direction the world is going.  It's not all gloom and doom.  We do have the power to change the direction of our country and to take control of our lives by simply doing what we want.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and one of the most informative I've read about the history of the Russian revolution and its aftermath.  It gives the history you need to understand why the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia. It tells of how it was led by the intelligentsia and workers (who were much more radical) and how it ultimately led to the Civil War, with the help of the West and Japan.This is not the usual revisionist history written to make the Bolshevist party look better. This is history written from the viewpoint of a Russian historian, and you will find all the details here that you want, but without being a historian or a partisan in that struggle.This book covers not only the period of 1917-1924, but also the years 1918-1920. This was the period in which the Russian Communist Party was first established in Petrograd (then St Petersburg) in 1917. It was led mainly by intellectuals, and many of its leaders came from the intelligenthousied class, and were not members of the working class.In order to understand the role of Russia in the world war, the civil war, and how the Russian Revolution came to an end, you will need to read both the main chronicles of the revolution written by Leningrad, Leningradskaya and Gorky.  This book is a must-read for those interested in the history, but who are not familiar with these chronicles. This gives you a chance to see the world from the Russian perspective. I have read and studied the above chronicles from both Leningredskaya and Borodin, so I am very familiar with all of the events and people mentioned, and I would definitely not have read this book without it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent. The first couple of chapters are great and the book builds on these ideas in the later chapters.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you've read one of the earlier versions of the story about Jesus' birth, this is the one you want. In the original, the birth is only mentioned as one of several miracles of the day, so this book gives the whole background and gives much more detail to the events. It also gives a good overview of the historical and philosophical background to the birth. The authors, along with several other contributors, are all outstanding scholars, and each has written his or her own analysis of the events and their context. It's a very well done book, one of those rare books that doesn't just retell a long story, but rather goes into much greater detail to explain many of the details, the key points and concepts. The book is organized in such a way that the most recent work is at the top, followed by the later ones.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful account of the early history of science and technology, from the early Greeks and Babylonians to the early modernists of the age of steam.  The book provides much background information about many important scientific, technological, and social developments.  Some of the book is drawn from original sources, but most is reprinted from secondary and official histories.  As with other modern accounts of these discoveries, it's essential to read the primary sources for all developments, in particular the work of the original inventors, and not just the official histories, since they tend to be more biased.  In this sense, the book provides a balanced view, since it includes some of the more controversial claims about the development of steam power, for example.  This makes the work as a whole more convincing 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book the most of all the ones I have read on the subject of child sexual abuse.  It helped me understand and sympathize with the child victim and their family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first edition, published in 1973, was a seminal work on the history of the American left. It continues to offer a good, well researched survey of the movements of this period. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the birth of the New Left, this book continues to capture the essence and relevance of the movement. The authors' knowledge of the period is extraordinary. They discuss developments on the local level as well as the national level. The writing style is highly original, with the authors' analysis always clear and compelling. While a more thorough account can hardly be expected, this is a great book for those wanting a solid introduction to the events, ideas, and people who gave rise to the New left. A must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book! I've been meaning to read about all the people in my life, from my parents to my students, and this is the first time I've found a good, well-researched history book that includes me!

I find her portraits of each person to be very touching, and I'm so glad to have such a window into my past! The book is full of fascinating facts about each person, including stories about their life and how they have influenced the rest of the world, including many that I never even knew about!!

This book, which was released in 2002, contains over 200 interesting articles from several different periodicals, including the New York Times, Time, History Today, American Historical Review, and others.

I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first part of a two-part series on modern psychology. While this is a popular topic, many of the articles are based on the primary literature of the early-twentieth century, which is a bit dated, and thus is the primary focus of the book. However, the authors give the reader enough information to understand both the classic and current theories of behavior.  I found myself learning new concepts like "the golden rule", "the self", "positive reinforcement", "motivation", "reinforcement schedules" and many more. This is a brilliant introduction to the subject that any psychology student will learn a lot from and will likely expand their knowledge in many other areas of psychology

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an important book, which should be read by everyone who wants to understand this fascinating subject. The book provides much information about what is known about ancient Mesopotamia (Iraq) and its people, but it doesn't talk about the culture itself, which is more fascinating. The story of Mesopotamian culture and the Sumerian language, which they used for writing, is very important to understand the beginnings of the world civilization. The information is quite detailed and fascinating, but if you look closely, you will find a connection to Christianity. In the Sumeria people, the idea of a "messiah" arose, who would come and establish the new world religion and rule it from heaven. This idea had its beginnings in the Mesopotamus religion. In this religion, they believed the sun would one day rule over the earth and take back his throne. There was no Messiah in Mesopotamean religion, only a great warrior who would bring about the change.The Sumerians worshipped several deities, including Enlil, Sarpanitum, the two sons of Nammu (the sun god), and Enki (the god of fire). The most important one of them was the goddess Ninhursag, who is thought to have been the ancestor of the Sumarian people, as well as the one who gave birth to the gods, so to speak. She was also the goddess of writing, who was known as Enki's wife. She is called by many different names in different cultures, but always it is Ninhur, Ninhoor, Nin-tig and Ninhudu. The reason for the difference in the names is because she was the mother of all gods. Ninhurb, or Ninhirum, is a Sumerial word that means "the mother of the gods." Ninhuri, or Ninti, is the Sumeral word for "the goddess." Enki, the god of the sun, was believed to live in Ninhouru, which means the "shining one," and Ninhar, or Enlillur, was the god who lived in Ninhumu, or the "burning one." As a Sumeri, he was called Enki-i, or Ea Enki.The meaning of Ninhuru, or Nineveh, was "the world of gods." It was a city that was built in Ninu, meaning "world." It is said that

Their stories are the very history of America.  Each is given their own section, and their own biographies. Some are quite well known, while others, like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln are not. This book, written in the style of an autobiography by a great American hero, provides the best insight into the life of these remarkable individuals.  This collection is a must read for everyone interested in American history, and for the general reader who wants to know about the Founders and about our country and our history

This book really shows you what has gone on with them, how they were able to come out of it, and how they're now living their lives in peace. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering moving to Japan or getting divorced. It's a very touching story. I especially enjoyed reading the letters between Mom and Papa and the stories between Grandpa and his son. I feel this was written in a real loving and tender manner. I hope that someone will buy this book and print it for others to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have ever read that covered all the  the main philosophical debates in Western Philosophy.  This book was written in the 1960s,  so some of the arguments are quite old now.  The argument here, and in the rest of the book,  is about what is best for humanity, and what we should do about  it.I enjoyed this book more than most.  There are more ideas here, but they are presented in a way that  makes them accessible to the general public.  You will learn some interesting things about the history of philosophy, but you will not necessarily get any new ideas about it.  If you are looking for a book that is going to be the foundation of your philosophy, this is it. I would recommend it to any philosophy student who is ready for some philosophy

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has changed the way I look at many important issues in American history. This is the definitive look at the American Civil War from the Union's point of view.  It brings to life the many reasons that the North lost the war.  This was an awful time, and Americans can learn something from their history. It is a great book to share with anyone who is interested in American History and has not yet taken the time to do some reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a real eye opener.  From the first couple of pages you are hooked and the story unfolds.  The characters are relatable and the action is gripping.  If you are looking for advice on living a meaningful life you won't be disappointed 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The American Renaissance was the first major exposé of the ideas of American Renaissance (AR) founder Jared Taylor. Taylor's vision was to provide a framework for white Americans to think of themselves as part of a dominant group in the world. The book is packed with information on American history, geography, philosophy and culture. The AR leaders such as Jared Taylor, William H. Regnery, Richard Spencer, Nathan Glazer and Jared Taylor himself were all involved in a lively public debate with the left wing, left-wingers such as Thomas Frank and Howard Zinn on American identity. This is the story of that public discussion.  It is a narrative account of Taylor's ascent from a fringe figure, a racist, into the highest ranks of the most powerful conservative movement in the country.  The book also documents the rise and fall of Richard Spencer as he attempts to bridge the gap between the ideas he first articulated in the early 1990s, and the kind of cultural conservatism that would later emerge from the white nationalist movement of the late 2000s. He succeeds to some extent, but in the end, Spencer is forced into exile from his own movement by the rise of more radical versions of the white racial identity movement. This book is a major contribution to our understanding of the American political and intellectual scene of the 1980s. If you are serious about understanding what motivated the leaders of the movement, and why they were ultimately displaced from power by an even more radical, and more militant, strain of the right, then read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a combination of essays and short stories, and provides insight on a variety of topics, from the history of women in the workplace to the challenges that face today's mothers and young women.  The stories that are written in the book are inspiring, as the authors show us that the challenges of raising children and working are as real for women as they are for men.  From working long hours to managing a home, these mothers reveal the hardships that many women face, which is why they are called "working mothers".  They are also the pioneers who set the example by providing the best care for their children, which leads to greater economic success for themselves and their families.  Although the topics covered in the stories in this book vary from year to year, the lessons learned are very similar each time.  So, no matter the circumstances of your life, there is something in this story that will help you navigate it confidently.  I encourage you to read the stories and reflect on your own life and what advice you might have for your children and yourself.  You will find that life is not as black and white as the stereotype makes it seem.  If you have problems with your husband, it is likely that you will have the same problems with the women who surround you.  This book will help guide you through difficult times, and encourage you with tips and suggestions that will assist you to move forward

Write a positive review about a good book:   The subject matter is difficult for many Christians to relate to. This is the first book I've ever read by this great author who's life was deeply affected by AIDS.  It is not a clinical book and therefore some of the examples may be hard to relate.  But the wisdom of God that he speaks about is so relevant to those who know nothing about the subject.  I suggest that if you've been touched by the disease or are in any way affected by it, please pick up this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an outstanding collection of essays on American literature.  There is something for everyone here.  Even though there is much to love about this work of art, I am compelled to stress that it is not a dry historical survey.  Rather, it is a collection of insightful and stimulating essays about the American writer's art.  Each essay touches on a different topic: the author's childhood; the influence of Shakespeare and the Romantics; the role of the American  literary tradition in the twentieth century; contemporary literature; and a wide-ranging look at  the work of American writing today.  The essays in this book all have their place.  I found it helpful to be aware of  the time period in which the essays were written.  They have a special interest for students of American literature  in that the essays are in no way limited by the   immediate impact of the great American novels, plays and poems of the last two   centuries.  To be sure, these writers have been much talked about  in the last century, and their influence has waned, but that is no reason   not to be attentive to the American writers and the great works they created in our own   time and in our time.   There has never been a   greater American novelist or playwright than John Steinbeck.  His oeuvre has been honored and canonized over  many decades, yet it is still growing and new ideas and approaches are being discovered   every day.  With this in mind, I found the essays here both fascinating and  instructive.  Steinbeck's writing still fascinates.  Yet, he has not been a dominant figure in American literature in any significant   way since his death in 1952.  While I am aware that this will surprise some readers, I do hope   that it does not offend them.  We have had some of the greatest American poets in our history, and there is still more   to come.  At the very least, this is an interesting collection to study.  It provides new perspectives on   the classic works of American fiction.  Not just any old novel.  A classic like  The Great Gatsby  is not really a novel at all.  In a time where we are still reading the works of our   greatest writers of the 20th century, it behooves us   and our  readers to ask ourselves what it
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book.  For those interested in a good history of China in the first century A.D., this is a great introduction to that period.  I will be re-reading this in the near future and will add my own notes in the margins

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book one finds a well thought out account of the evolution of the human mind. In the book we find our intellectual selves and their evolution. From the simple to the complex. We also find the reasons for our spiritual development. There is nothing in this book that would make one question the reality of our spiritual evolution. However there are many things that should be taken note of for our further development. For example we are a unique species in that we have the ability to understand what goes on in the minds of others. This ability has lead to many changes in our lives. For instance we have learned that our relationships with our loved ones are more important than the economic status of the individual. We have also learned how to read other minds. We now have the knowledge that people are often more aware of our thoughts and behavior than we realize. All of these things have resulted in the increase in our self awareness. The question is now is how do we use this ability to help us develop as beings in a greater society? The answer is that we do it through education. It has taken us many years of work to become as highly educated as we are today. However we should not forget that we all have the same ability to think. We all have that ability because we have evolved from our primitive ancestors. We must work at it all the time. The problem we have now is that in today's society many of us fail to recognize the need to become more self aware. We need to focus our energy on learning more about ourselves. We should also become aware that all of these changes are happening in our culture. As we learn more about our fellow human beings we must also become more aware that our children are also becoming more selfaware. Thus one of the most important things we can do is to instill in our children that they must respect and care for others and themselves. We can do this by educating them to have respect for other people's beliefs, even if they are different from their own. We then must teach our children to be good people in the world. This is what we must continue to work at. The end result is that our civilization is evolving. And we are the result 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers many aspects of the history of Christianity in a way that will appeal to any student of that topic. The author presents his findings, which are derived from his own research, in a clear and well-written style. He provides a wealth of information about many of the individuals and groups that have shaped the development of Christianity over time. He even provides information about those individuals who have died, and the historical significance of their contributions. I am particularly fond of chapters 4 and 5 on the history and development of Christian eschatology. This is a book that I would recommend to any serious student of Christian history, and it is also the textbook in my theology class at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I would also recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the role of women in early Christianity, or about the life of the early Christian writer St. Jerome. This book is an outstanding addition to the current literature on this subject

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book of essays by two of our great literary pioneers.  It's been a few years since we read this classic work of fiction in school, but it has never been out of print.  The essays in this collection are the original text and are as moving and funny today as they were 50 years ago.  I've always been puzzled by the question of why the early 20th century had such a literary revival - why did some writers in this period appear so compellingly in later writings?  It seems to have been the case that the new writers who emerged during the early years of the century were interested in, and capable of addressing, some of the same themes that the older writers addressed.  These themes included the nature of art, the relationship between the artist and the public, and the relationship of art and life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an extraordinary and inspiring book. I hope you take a look. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful collection of short stories by the great Edgar Allan Poe.  All of the stories are chilling and brilliantly written.  I've not read Poe's original stories, but from this collection I am convinced that he was as imaginative as he was terrifying.  We all have our fears and they are many.  This book tells them through the eyes of a young boy.  So much heart and soul in each of his short stories.  And the illustrations are wonderful, the children's drawings are so charming.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book. A must read for anyone who is interested in Eastern religion. It will help your understanding of many religions.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a well researched and thought provoking work that covers much of the historical background of the struggle against slavery. It is written in an engaging style that will appeal to everyone from students to the most ardent abolitionist.  It offers a unique and personal portrait of the individual slave owner as well as the slave himself, the family, and the community. The author is one of the very few to have interviewed almost every slave in the South from the Revolutionary period to the present. He gives the reader an overview of the history of slavery in the United States, a detailed account of the slave revolt of 1831, the events leading up to the Civil War, and some of the most exciting insights into the current state of the Southern slave system. The book is not a work of historical accuracy and does not purport to provide a solution to the very intractable social problem of slavery, which, in my opinion, will not be solved until slavery is abolished on a global scale. However, it is a unique insight into a very fascinating and complex social system that provides a great perspective into the complexities and struggles of today's society. Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is written by a former Mormon who has renounced the faith. It is also filled with wonderful pictures and information.

If you know anything about the Church and are interested in what has happened to the members of the Church, this book is an excellent resource.

Write a positive review about a good book:   As an artist of color, it is impossible to convey to others the beauty of the work, color and its history in the West. This is a beautiful and insightful book and should be considered the starting place for any serious study of this subject.  The book starts in the 19th century, showing the rise of European painting with the arrival of the Impressionists in the 1880s and the rise and fall of the Pop Art Movement. The book then focuses on the African American experience through the 1950s, including the emergence of Abstract Expressionism, Abstract Expressionists, Pop Art, and the New Golden Age, in which the blues are emphasized. The last part of the book examines contemporary American art, with an emphasis on Abstract Expressionist painting, particularly the work of David Hockney. The author is an ex-artist who became a researcher and critic for the Museum of Modern Art, which he now heads, and he is well-known for his critiques of the mainstream art world.  A true must for anyone interested in African American culture

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to know more about the lives of the pioneers of the American West. We don't know very much about the early Mormon pioneers, especially those who left Nauvoo in 1846, for most of them only died away from NauvOO. They are among the greatest of all American heroes.  There is a short history of the Mormons and an essay on the origin of the term "Mormon". Also, the authors have put together an impressive bibliography which includes over 300 sources. This is the book you will want to have on your shelf.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this wonderfully rich collection, the author, Susan Sontag, offers a vivid account of the lives of the American artists who make up our modern art world. While the book covers such diverse fields as photography, sculpture, architecture, and graphic design, it all centers on the same basic themes. These are the subjects and methods of the most famous and influential artists working today, and they are presented in a style that allows for much personal insight into each artist's work. We are all acquainted with these artists through their visual art, but this collection of essays allows the artist to step away from the camera and into their own words, revealing some of the reasons they produce their images and works of art, the processes that inspire them, and the lessons learned along the way. These essays provide an insightful look into the lives and artworks of some of our great artists, such as Jackson Pollock, Jackson Pollack, Diane Arbus, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, and Jackson Pollak. I am particularly proud to offer this book to my students at the art school I teach at, where it is our goal to offer the highest quality visual literacy instruction to students, including art history and composition. This book is a great resource for students, because it offers such a wealth of information about the artists, the methods used to create the work, and also the artworks themselves. We hope to one day provide the opportunity for students to experience these works through their own eyes, and I believe that this book, and indeed many other works by these artists, can provide this opportunity for our students. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to be an artist, or is an artist interested in furthering their artistic practice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful example of modern literary history. I first read it as a graduate student in the late 1970's and was hooked for life.  I was able to meet and interview the famous writers who shaped modern American letters.  The history of the genre is well presented, not least in the brilliant introduction by the famous literary historian and critic Edward Thomas.  This is a superb book that will enrich your personal library.  All that's missing is a few more biographies on the giants of the American Novel

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most important books I've read on African American history. There are so many books out there that tell the story of African Americans in this country, but not many that examine how they became Americans. This book is that book. The focus is not on how blacks came to America but how African Americans were treated during this time period. The history here is not as glamorous as many would assume, but it is still fascinating

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are interested in the history of American women in politics, consider The Women of Washington.  It's by no means a comprehensive biography, but it covers more than a hundred years of the struggle for women's suffrage.  The women of Washington and the leaders who opposed the right of women to vote all are represented.  Readers will learn that Washington was the first American woman to become a general.  Washington's most famous daughter, Carrie, fought in the Revolutionary War.  In 1812 she won a battle against a rival politician, John C. Calhoun, and she was the only woman to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  She also served as a U.S. Senator from South Carolina.  Many of the women who helped Washington to victory in the Revolution, including Mary Anderson and Frances Willard, are included as well.  Some of Washington's political enemies include the Federalists who wanted to keep the nation in the British sphere of influence.  To fight for liberty for all the American women, they formed an organization called the National Association of Colored Women (NAWC).  The NAWC fought for women to have the vote, and to be represented in Congress.  While the NAWC was active during the first half of the nineteenth century, the first serious effort to organize American women for political action was the organization called The Women's Political League (WPL).  It was formed in 1891 in Chicago.  Founded by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, the WPL fought for a constitutional amendment giving women the vote and also for a universal health care system.  Its mission was to "establish the equal rights of woman to participate in all the rights and honors of American life and citizenship, and by so doing bring to maturity the spirit of freedom in American women."  The WPL achieved its goal of women's political equality by 1900.  After the suffrage struggle ended, the NWLC continued its work in the United States to advance the cause of women in public life, especially women's rights, until its demise in 1920.  At the time of its demise, the National Women's Suffrage Association was the largest women's movement in the world.  Since then, the American Women's Liberation Front has grown to over one million members.  If there is an agenda for American women to participate equally in public service, it is reflected in the story of the WSPLA. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're new to the language and are interested in learning more about the syntax of Japanese, I highly recommend this book.  It's based on a large amount of material already available in Japanese textbooks.  The examples are not only very good, but they're also easy to follow.  This book is an absolute must-have for anyone with any interest in Japanese.  If the book is any indication of future volumes, I believe it will continue to grow in popularity

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first full length biography of the great 19th century American writer John Keats.

He writes with wit and intelligence, without ever being obtrusive or overly dramatic.  He draws on all of the evidence we have of Keat's life, painting a compelling portrait of the man 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book I know of that discusses the history of Jewish history, Judaism, and the modern world from the birth of the modern state of Israel in 1948 to the current day. The work was written by a Jewish person who was raised as a Christian and who has remained so.   If you are a history buff like I am, then this is the book to read.  I can honestly say I have never read any book by a non-Jewish person that covers the entire time frame from Israel's creation to the present day. This book will provide you with a complete picture of the Jewish people.  It is the story of how Jews came to dominate much of Europe during the Middle Ages and what the hell happened to them

Write a positive review about a good book:   These are the most complete and honest accounts of Hitler's life. He was a person who cared about his people as much as he did his country, and he knew how to make good decisions. Hitler was not the perfect person he is often portrayed. He made mistakes, but the ones that are in this book are the mistakes of a man who wanted to save the German people and make his country great. He did not want to ruin his country for no reason, but for no fault of his own. These pages are a testament to that

Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book. It is filled with fascinating facts about animals and plants.  This is the first book I have ever read on the subject and it only cost about 50 cents.

The book is full of great information for the serious gardener as well as the beginner.  For anyone who doesn't want to do it themselves but just want to learn more about some of the animals and flowers this is a great book.  It also has information for everyone

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this I wasn't completely sold on the theory and practice of permaculture. This was the best way to put it to me. In the course of my research, it became clearer and clearer that the principles of permec were universal. So I've always been a fan of permadism. But the idea that the soil as a whole was a living organism is one that only a small number of people grasp. But with this book, it was made very clear that the very best way of improving the health and vitality of the soil is to make the entire soil a living entity. This is not a "do-it-yourself" book; it is one for those of us who want to take a deep look at the practical side of permafarm and farm.The book itself is short but rich in examples and useful tips. You don't need to have any previous knowledge of permacs in order to pick up the ideas. And, as you read through the book, you find your way to new ideas. It is a wonderful handbook that has the potential to transform the way you see your world

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently became aware of this book when the author, Laura Nader, mentioned it in her keynote address at the 2012 American Academy of Religion conference.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrifically well-researched and interesting book for people who have studied the ancient Near East.The only issue is it is very difficult to read at first. For a first-timer, I suggest starting with the first chapter and then going back to read the others. This is because the book is not so much about the cultural aspects as it is about the history of the region, in which all the different cultures of the ancient world have been integrated. The result is a vast amount of information, not just about Egypt, but also about the countries to its north and south as well as the peoples who lived in the region. The book is a great resource for anyone who wishes to learn more about their own ancient heritage. It will be invaluable for future archaeologists trying to uncover the historical and archaeological sites in Egypt.The book is also very comprehensive in offering a good overview of the various cultures of early Egypt, and then showing how they came to be united under a common form of religion. Many of the sites and cities mentioned are known to today's Egyptologists but they are presented here for those who are unaware.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best book on asexuality ever written.  There are tons of good books out there, but not too many that include asexual people who are willing to talk.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject of sex in marriage.

This book is a classic in American history, and one that every American school child should have on their shelf

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book and I strongly recommend reading it.  If you want to better understand the history of modern Europe, this is the book to get.  Many of the important events that took place during the early Middle Ages are mentioned here.  It's not a history book, it's an interpretation of history.  This book is full of fascinating facts and information about all the peoples, cultures, languages and religion that made up the ancient world.  Some of these stories are very familiar, but there are new details that give a more accurate picture of the ancient Mediterranean world.It's difficult to do justice to the author's book.  I'm not sure why, because it's so full of useful information.  So many of the interesting facts are found in the footnotes.  There are hundreds of illustrations throughout the book, which is helpful when discussing subjects like food, clothing and art.  In my opinion, the most useful book I've ever read about early medieval Europe.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first of what I hope will be many volumes covering the history of Jewish thought. The book offers an overview, a historical overview, and a philosophical overview.  It covers topics such as Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, the Hebrew Bible and Kabbalah, the Talmud, the Sephardim, and the medieval Christian Church.  I had some difficulty with the philosophical aspect as the book did not offer much of a theoretical framework for studying Jewish thought 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is like a mini-manifesto that you will always be able to refer to.  For all of the people in the potholes of life who think they don't know anything about the Bible, this book will teach you everything you need to know about the word of God

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive account of a period of American political and social history so rich in detail, so well written, and so fascinating, it is not possible to fully do justice to it. This is a work of historical fiction, but it also offers a highly informed historical analysis, of which there is very little in the available literature, especially of the period after the Civil War. The work has a wide readership in this country and abroad.

This is a great way to start the learning of the Ancient Greek world.  I highly recommend it

It opened my eyes to how much more important is the love in our lives than the money in our bank accounts. It's about people, not money, and it doesn't have to be a relationship book. It helps you to better understand why the other person is important in your life and why you are important to them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of my favorite book series is The Lord of the Rings.  The story of the three rings and the power of the ring on the people who have the ring is amazing.  This book has more details about the three books than most readers will get and the images of Mordor, Orthanc and Minas Tirith are awe-inspiring.  You will also get information about the story behind the story.  I loved the characters in this series and I still do

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a brilliant analysis of a very complex topic: The American-Israel relationship. It has a lot of great examples and discussions. A few of the examples are very funny: an Israeli journalist, a Jewish musician, a lawyer, an Arab American. It provides lots of great insights on Israeli politics, politics in America, etc. The book also includes many interesting case studies. I found the case studies most helpful and enjoyable.

There is a certain intellectual elegance that can be applied to a variety of situations.This is a book that I recommend to anyone interested in the history of Israel or politics in general

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating and thoughtful analysis of how we arrived at our current level of gun violence.  This is a book that must be read by every American, not just the gun nuts.  The book provides a great look into the dynamics of America's gun culture.  For those that do not want to take a look at the data, the author breaks down crime data into a breakdown of types of guns and how they are used in crimes.  He also discusses the "reduction" of guns as it relates to gun violence (more and more people are buying guns).The only real negative in the book was the number of times it mentions "gun control", when in fact, many of the laws that have been passed to reduce gun violence, actually increase the number and types of firearms being held and used in crime.  Unfortunately, the laws are the least of our problems.  As I mentioned in the previous review, I myself am a gun owner and have a gun in my home, but I am against any laws that would ban handguns.  I believe in the second amendment of the Constitution, and in the right of individuals to own and use the type of weapons that they do.  All these points are explored in the very well written book.  It is a must read for anyone interested in the current state of American society.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book I wished I had been reading in my 20's.  It was the only one I bought when I was a grad student, and it was the first I took out of the library.  Now, many years later,  it is still the most recent edition, and I'm still learning from it.  The book is simple to read, but the ideas are so nuanced, it takes a lifetime to fully grasp.  I read it last summer with a group of friends who had been struggling with anxiety issues.  They were struggling with the same questions that my teenage self pondered.  And then we all went through a big therapy session together.  We talked about all the different ways that we have tried to cope with anxiety, which included medications, therapy, and taking medications to prevent ourselves from experiencing anxiety in the first place.  That was all very helpful, but there is more to it than that.  In fact, most of the books out there are about trying to cure the anxiety itself, but this book is about changing your life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating book to read about many aspects of the life of the Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith.  From the founding of the Church to the assassination of him, Smith was truly a trailblazer who made an impression on the world.  He was an innovator, a teacher, a man who had a vision, and was loved by his wife Emma, his brother Hyrum and many of his associates. The life of this remarkable man, who left behind such a large family, is told with all its difficulties, joys and tragedies.  I am so glad to have read the book and to be able to discuss it with my children

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book, especially for those just beginning or beginning to explore the subject of women in the church. This is one of those books that gets a lot of attention and praise, yet is an accessible and insightful book for the serious Christian.  It is a book that makes sense and it makes sense to someone who knows the subject, but if you aren't acquainted with the topic, you might be surprised to find that it is actually quite a simple topic.  Some might have a difficult time getting into it, but for those who have been exposed to it and have a serious interest in the subject the book is a godsend. This book is full of insight, humor, wisdom and wonderful examples.  The book is also a wonderful resource for those seeking to become more involved in church life.  For a new Christian looking to start a new parish, the book offers the tools to start with.  If you are already a member, the insight you find in this book is priceless 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title says it all - this is one of those rare books that is both humorous and educational. It's an interesting topic - the relationship between people and animals, both domesticated and wild. However, the way the author illustrates his points is so incredibly effective. I wish I had read this book years ago when I first started my journey into the world of animal training. Even if you don't have dogs or cats at home, I suggest you try your hand at some of these techniques. It has never been so important to train your animals how to behave. The book has many examples of how to do it - you just need to take the time and study the techniques. As I type this, I'm watching my cats for the first time in months. Their curiosity and joy is infectious

Write a positive review about a good book:   A book that provides the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from its inception in 1919, to the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The book is divided into 5 parts. In the first, the party is in its beginnings. The party is small and lacks political organization. It is only after World War I that the party starts building its organization. This is also the period when the first leaders of the party are introduced. In Part II, the leadership of the Bolshevik Party is introduced. They are all men, and not women. In part III, the Bolshevik revolution takes place in October 1917. The Bolsheviks begin their fight for the revolution against the Tsar. Part IV is about the Russian Civil War which the Bolsheviks start. The most powerful organization in the Civil War was the Red Army, and the Soviet government was in the forefront of the fight for democracy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for children about dinosaurs.  The author explains how we know about dinosaurs and gives examples of how scientists and dinosaur experts use these facts to figure out things about dinosaurs that are not known to be true.  This book is full of great examples about how to use this information in your own life, with great stories about real life dinosaurs. The first page is a story about a dinosaur that scientists have discovered in California and how they figured out it was a type of sauropod.  You get a feeling of excitement when you find a new dinosaur and then find out it is not a real dinosaur.  Then, the next page is about how a professor uses a new type of dinosaur for a movie.  And the next, it is time to learn about dinosaur bones that have been discovered all over the world.  I recommend this book to all children

But his struggles with his family and the racial prejudice he faces in the South are the core of the stories.  This book is for everyone, from children and adults to students and scholars.  The characters are real

I've always been a fan of Marcuse, but I hadn't read the essays he had in this collection until I found out I was reading them for a class.  The essays are very insightful, both as to what is wrong with society today as to why a new generation of social activists is challenging traditional values.  This book was my first introduction to Marcuse and his ideas, and I'm extremely glad I took the time to read them.  Highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read many books on the Kennedy assassination, but I have never read this one.  As a former Secret Service agent, I have seen the most bizarre and fascinating things in the White House on many occasions.  This was by far the best book to draw on for the details.

It will be an enlightening book for anyone who is interested in such an intriguing subject

The author explores his own personal journey into the mysteries of the heart to bring clarity to his spiritual development, while providing information that may interest anyone seeking to gain the spiritual insights of others. This is truly a book to read and re-read for many purposes, including personal growth and self-transformation. The topics covered are: astrology, Tarot, meditation, and the role of consciousness within our lives. While the book covers a broad spectrum, many topics are shared in common. There are some wonderful descriptions of the rituals of the Tarot and ancient Egyptian traditions that many of us take for granted. The book provides insightful commentary on the nature of love, the wisdom of Tarot card interpretation, and an overview of a shaman's practices. The ideas offered within the book are profound and life changing. One cannot ask for much more than this from a spiritual book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a truly wonderful book and I think I have found it among the best of all my previous readings on this topic. It is an inspirational collection of personal stories, each told by a different writer, which explore a variety of topics. The first part, called "Songs" contains poems and prose poetry by African-American writers such as Maya Angelou, Wanda Mae, Amiri Baraka, and Toni Morrison. The second part, "The Life" focuses on Black American authors, including authors from a variety African-Caribbean countries such as Yaa Gyasi, Yeb Saño, and Amiri Diabate.The main themes explored in these essays are the intercultural dialogue between the "others" and the majority population of America, which many white Americans take for granted. While they may not share all of the same values or cultural traditions, they all share one important common trait- a deep-seated need to belong and to be accepted in a community of friends, family, and community workers. It's a subject which is often misunderstood and, therefore, often disregarded. This book is a great help to explain the complexities of black-white relationships and it provides practical tools to understand and deal with their complexities. This is an important topic for a great number of Americans, especially in the 21st Century, as most of us know or face some form of prejudice based on skin color, race, nationality, religion, or other similar criteria. As I have stated before, it is not the color of one's skin which defines who they are, it's how they treat and react to others which determines who they truly are. There is more to a true black-American than just their skin color- they are a people with many talents, accomplishments, and contributions which are not usually recognized in the mainstream. I encourage anyone who is dealing with difficulties, problems, or prejudices as a result of race to read this book and realize that there are many great things about being a true African-Americans- the good, the bad, and the ugly! The book is filled with a variety and quality of African- American contributions which transcend the racial divide to provide solutions, inspiration, and support for those in the minority community who are going through a difficult time. This wonderful collection is a must-read for any African- AMERICAN who is facing the challenges that are plaguing so many communities throughout the United States today. It provides the tools and information needed

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has given me new perspectives on my religious practice, on being human, and on finding meaning in a world that seems so complicated and bewildering.  I loved this book.  It helped me to find a better understanding of how I felt and how others feel about my beliefs.   It also taught me how to think about myself and the world in a more balanced way.  This has always been a difficult subject for me to understand, because of the dichotomous nature of religion and spirituality.  What is a Christian and what is a non-Christian?  What does religion have to do with politics, morality, values, spirituality, science, etc.?  What makes a person a good person? What makes people bad?  Why are there so many religions? How is it that the concept of God has been co-opted to support every human desire, not just those in accord with the Judeo-Christian religion?  And so many other questions that were answered in this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not read any other account of this war. I have just finished reading it. The author, Dr. E.J.D. Hall was in command of the 1st Tank Battalion during the German invasion. He was very helpful and courageous in giving us his account of that time. I am a graduate student in history and this was very interesting to me.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about World War II.The book is full of details and information about military operations. The history of the D-Day Invasion is told as a story in which the Army was just as much a part as the Marines were. It was an incredible event that changed the face of the world.I have read many histories on the war. My favorite has always been "The War of the Worlds" by H.G. Wells. This is in my opinion the definitive one.Dr. Hall brings us an exciting account.I am sure many of you will find this book an eye-opener. It will give you a new perspective of this fascinating period. I can promise that many of the events described here will not surprise you.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive work on the subject of religious diversity in the United States, written by the great American historian David Barton.  His personal account of his journey to Texas and the life of the American Baptist Church, in a time of intense racial and religious upheaval, will have all readers seeking answers for how to create an ethically and spiritually diverse society.  Barton is not just a historian, he is also an evangelist, and his book is a testimony to how we, as Americans, can come together to strengthen our nation by working in our own community to change our attitudes and beliefs.    I believe this book will be a constant reference in the social justice world, and will certainly be read by many religious and non-religious students in this time of great need

However, if you are looking to understand how compassion works and how to apply this in your life, this book will open up the way for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a great influence on many of my life lessons and reflections. I loved the stories that came from the experiences of the different members of the family, the ways that our relationships could change as a result of our disagreements, and the lessons that we could learn from each other's mistakes and mistakes of our fathers.  I felt that I understood what my father was going through in the early days, and I learned how to recognize when my own behavior might have contributed to my father's problems. And I learned about all the different types of people who had been brought up in different circumstances and lived with those different kinds of people. I felt as though I had finally been in a similar situation as my father and I was able to use that to understand myself. I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful book to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read for any student in pre-law or law school who needs a refresher on the law 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best works of nonfiction I have ever read. This is the true story of one man's journey from a young boy to a World War II hero. Mr. G. is an American Jew who escaped from the Nazi death camps to survive in Canada. He went on to found an amazing chain of family farms. Mr G. writes in simple terms but brings to life the extraordinary lives of his friends and relatives. Mr, G. shares with us in his personal journal his experiences of being a teenager in Nazi Germany and living in a concentration camp. He relates how he survived and rose to become the head of a chain of farm companies that created over a million jobs. Through Mr.G. we are also given a true account of his life after the war. His sons have grown to great heights as business people. The Gores have given over 150,000 acres of farmlands to the state of California. The book's last chapter is an account of Mr. Gaylord's life in Canada after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I have to say that I have never been a Jew, but I do believe that Mr.Gaylord has more of the right to the title. He was an American Patriot and fought for our freedom. He and his wife have given more than 30 years of volunteer work in California and Canada. As such, his book is a treasure trove for understanding the American Jewish community as well as for understanding World War 2. I believe Mr. Gore's life is truly remarkable. Mr Gaylord had to flee for his life, not only from the Nazis, but from the Communist Red menace of the 20's. I would like to see Mr G.'s son, Mr. Donald, make a movie about their extraordinary lives.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to stop reading this after the first few chapters. As soon as I did, I found myself quoting passages to my daughters. This book has some of the most beautiful writing I have ever read about the Jewish people 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, thorough, and thought provoking book on all aspects of sex and sexuality.  It covers everything from the biological, to the medical, to asexuals.  I have read much about sexual dysfunction, but the stories in this book really struck me as quite rare.  They make the readers aware of some of the ways they may be less than healthy sexually.  The author is a great writer and brings all of his experiences to the page.  You can read in this wonderful book for yourself, and then use the information to improve your own sexual condition

We see how he came to be a rock star, how he went on to create one of Hollywood's most successful and influential film companies, and how he became one of America's foremost political commentators. We get a glimpse into his personal life, too. We learn about his children and grandchildren, and we learn about the many women who have been drawn to him and become the wives, the girlfriends and even the wives and girlfriends of his children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful, beautiful, and inspiring story. I am still trying to come to terms with what has happened to all of us and how we are going to survive. This is the story of how a group of young people from a small town in rural Wisconsin came to save the world from the threat of atomic annihilation.  The book is full of information about all sorts of amazing things you can do in the real world. It also tells you how to save yourself from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous people. It is about more than saving our planet; it is about saving our souls 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I both have a passion for this wonderful subject and this is a great book.   I love the variety of recipes that are presented and the way they are presented.  It also provides helpful information on the various types of grains and vegetables and how to make them, how to store them and how much to use.  The book is also interesting as it talks about the history of this delicious and simple food.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this fabulous food.

It covers a wide range of ideas and arguments in the philosophy of mind.  The essays are mostly accessible to anyone with some philosophical training, and the book also provides some exercises that should provide interesting ways to practice some of the most important themes in modern philosophy.  I strongly recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive, and perhaps the most popular, work on the development of the Japanese language. It's not just a book of vocabulary and grammatical points, it has a great deal more. It also has a wealth of examples, examples of   idioms, and examples of dialects. A must for anyone who wants to learn Japanese 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a short book, and it's full of wonderful insight. You get to know so much about all the different styles of writing, and they all have their place, even the  ones that seem rather formulaic. The stories are really deep  
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I was writing this review I realized it is actually three books.  The first covers all aspects of the Church and the world, the second covers the history of the Christian Church and religion, and the third focuses on theology, including The God Who is Love.  What I didn't realize is that I already had this book in my library and was searching for the other two.  This book is written for all who are interested in Christian theology, history, and culture.  I have read all the other four and it is my favorite of the bunch.  It is full of wonderful details about early Christianity and other topics, but is best understood as a series of vignettes.  For example, he does an excellent job of demonstrating how St. Athanasius used Greek theology as a tool to understand the life of Jesus.  He uses the term "philosophical soul" to describe this.  You will also see a lot of examples of how the theology of St. Paul, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas have been incorporated into Christian thought and practice.  While I was reading I found myself rereading some of the same passages over and over again.  They have been so helpful in my own quest for understanding.   This is a must for any serious Christian 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic study of the lives and literature of many European characters who lived in France and Spain from the late 15th Century to the early 17th Century. The author's aim was to create a historical context for the French Revolution. He had in mind people like Voltaire and Rousseau who lived during a time of revolutionary upheaval. The characters who populate these pages have been lost to history, but are very much alive in our imaginations.  In his first book, he describes the French revolution in vivid detail. But here he expands the historical context and gives a more personal account of his own French revolutionary experiences. And by doing so, he gives us an insight into the lives of those who lived and worked under the Reign of Terror. What more could you ask for in a study of France, and the European revolutions in general?  I hope to read more of his work in the future.  If the title of this book gave you any notion of the author's work, please do not hesitate to seek out the many other wonderful works by the same author 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive and informative treatment of Buddhism ever written.  It contains an introduction to Buddhist philosophy and practice, a short dictionary of the major Buddhist philosophical schools, an annotated bibliography, a practical bibliography of translations of important Buddhist texts, and a glossary of some of the terms used in Buddhist philosophy.  While the subject matter of Buddhism is vast, this work contains only a sampling of its scope.  For those seeking to understand the full scope of Buddhist thought and practice this is a must-read

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book.  I think it is a rare book which really explains the Christian faith in simple terms, as well as being readable.  It gives some wonderful examples of how the Christian religion is practiced today, and how we can do it without compromising.  There are some good questions in here, such as Why do Christians worship the same things we do?  As far as I am concerned, there is nothing like the story of Christ and his death and resurrection, as told in the New Testament.  The Christian faith is really a collection of ethical precepts based on the principle of loving one another 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very important book for everyone. It is so beautifully written that I cannot understand anyone who does not read it. It describes the life of Jesus from birth up to the crucifixion, as well as the lives of his Apostles and the historical events of the first century 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive survey of African American culture ever written. It is as much a biography of the man himself as it is a history of black American life. It provides a wealth of insight into his personal life, political life, social life, and personal relationships, as well as a number of fascinating anecdotes.  I can't tell you how often I've found myself, having read the previous entry, on the edge of the sofa and trying to remember a friend, a relative, a distant relative, or a person from a long-dead era in American history.  And yet, here are dozens of short, easily-digestible entries covering all these aspects of black America 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who has ever had a positive experience in life. This is the story of how we came to be as we are. It is a story of self discovery that leads to the discovery of our inner selves. It also shares some very valuable life lessons along the way. I would not have written a positive reviews without including a positive statement about the title.  It is THE BEST book about the self.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are looking for a book to add to your collection, this is the one to get. There is a lot to learn about different types of relationships. It's a very helpful resource for anyone seeking to understand the differences between an exclusive/open relationship and an open/non exclusive relationship. There's a lot of information here about all kinds of sexual activity, including a lot about anal sex. I would suggest reading the back of the book first for more background information. I highly recommend it to everyone who is curious about the variety of relationships and sexual lifestyles that exist. It is quite simple to read and easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very interesting and well researched work.  A must read for anyone thinking about starting a career in the music industry 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book written about the Grateful Dead. If you're a Dead Head, there is no better book to read. The stories are all about the music. If your interested in art, poetry or literature, you'll learn a lot from these authors. If they are your only source of information, I think it is important for you to read this book. I hope I inspired you to learn more about the Dead. And maybe even take a trip out to the Bay Area and check out some Dead shows 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book I read last week was on the history of the French revolution, written by the great historians, Thierry de la Boétie and Louis Althusser. I was in the mood for something a little more contemporary.  Here, in the first part of an epic history, is the French Revolution from its humble beginnings as a peasant uprising and insurrection to the triumph of Robespierre, and then to the restoration of the republic, all the while fighting off the Catholic Church and the absolutist reactionaries in the Vendee. This book is a treasure trove of information.  From the French history books you may already know a bit about the story, but the detail given here is incredible. The writers, as well as the many others who have written about the revolution, never tire of quoting quotes from Rousseau, Danton, Louis Blanc, etc.  As a result, there is a wealth of information here for all types of historians.  If you are interested in the French experience of the revolution in France, especially the 1790s, you will want to read this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful book, written by a true poet, with an amazing story to tell.  I will definitely be going to the library to get my copy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful combination of biography and memoir.   It's full of information about women who have made a difference in the world.  From her time in the Mississippi Delta to the establishment of the Women's Bureau at the UN, these women are shining examples of what is possible when we come together as a global community.  This is an incredible book, filled with personal stories from the author, and an overview of the women's movement in the 1960s, 70s and 80s 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who wishes to know more about the Holocaust.The text is well written and a great source for further information on the topic.The focus is on individual victims, rather than groups, and the book is clearly written from the victims' point of view.This is one of those rare books that not only does not contain inaccuracies, but is informative as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is one of the most complete and authoritative compilations of information about the life of Jesus ever written.  It covers the life, times, and times of Jesus from the birth of Jesus up to the Crucifixion.  He is the author's favorite prophet.  This is the definitive work on the subject, and no doubt will be the basis for many subsequent studies.  A book like this has to be one of those books that you wish you could find more information on and learn more about.  You will learn much more about Jesus from this work than you did in any school. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book!  It gives a lot of history about the Indian Wars.  There is a lot about the Battle of Plassey which is rarely covered, and it gives details about the lives of Indians.  It is a must read for anyone interested in Indian history.  Also, this is one of the few that is written about the wars from the Indians point of view 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is for anyone looking for more information about a religion that is currently in the news.  If you're new to the Mormon church, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great resource for those who are trying to understand the origins and history of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is much information in this book about the life and times of Joseph Smith. Some of it is historical fact and some is not. We are told that it was Smith who saw the plates. He and his associates went into a grove in upstate New York where Smith received the plates and translated them. It is also true that some of the information in the book is false, though it is difficult to distinguish what is fact and what is a lie. However, what is true is that many facts in the Bible have a religious aspect to them. Some facts were recorded by Joseph Smith and others are not. The point is that it is a fact that there is a God and Jesus Christ. The book is written so that it can be read by anyone. People of all backgrounds can get a good understanding of the history of this people. The main point of this book is to study the history from the beginning. It helps to keep in mind that this was not a simple affair. It took a lot of effort and time to establish a new religion and to convert people. For example, the story of the Tower of Babel is not as ancient as it is usually thought to be. We have no proof that the original church was ever built on the site of the Old Testament Tower of the Babel. The Church was founded by Joseph of old and his family, not by a group of people in Missouri. The story of Adam is very old, though many are surprised to learn that it actually happened. We learn that this man is the father of the human race. Adam and Eve were made on a mountain in the Garden of Eden. Adam was not exactly like we are today but he was a little different in his physical body. There are many other examples of this. It has been said that there are about six billion people on earth, but this number is not a precise one. Some scientists believe that there may be more than ten billion of us on earth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was very insightful.  I enjoyed reading about the history of the African diaspora.  It was interesting that so many African Americans and other immigrants were so determined to have a better life.  The story of the Jews in Russia, who in the 19th century refused to take the land from the czar and were eventually expelled from that land, was interesting and inspiring.  Very interesting to read about the lives of immigrants, especially when they live in such different circumstances as the Jews and the Africans in Russia and the United States.  This book was just a joy to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have read by Sylvia Plath.  As a child I had always heard of her as a young woman.  Now as an adult I can say that I have always loved her.  I also love poetry.  In this book, she tells the story of her life and the many ways she has tried to cope with it.  The novel, The Bell Jar, is my all time favorite.  Here she describes how she lost her mother.  It also details the many times she has dealt with rejection.  She shows how she has learned to adapt, even when she seems hopeless.  This book will be a great reference for anyone who has ever felt rejected, lost, or confused.  For anyone who likes poetry 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite part of this book was the discussion of the book of Job.  Job, one of the most important people in Jewish history, is not only one of my favorite writers, but also one of Jesus's closest friends.  In the book, we learn how Job's life influenced Jesus's in so many ways and vice versa.  The entire book is well written and inspiring.  I recommend this book to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of this book is full of useful, practical information that anyone who has a dog will find useful.  The second half of the book offers a more scientific approach to the care of dogs and a more philosophical approach to dog care.  I enjoyed the second half more than the first because of the practical application of scientific principles.  For example, this is an excellent book for people who don't own any dogs, but have a friend or family member who does.  It offers a logical system for managing your dog's health 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great collection of research and ideas on the subject.  This will definitely be a reference book that I look to for all the information I need for my seminars and workshops.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book on the life of George Washington.  I have many Washington books that I have not read, but this is by far the most complete.   It will take several generations to complete the study of this man, but in the meantime, his deeds are being immortalized in the pages of history.  George Washington was the Father of his Country.  The book is an amazing compilation of letters, journals, maps, prints, and photographs.  It was published before many important books were written, and the author did a fine job of updating these works to include the information in the letters 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on American political history I have come across. It is also a history of the US by the American people

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic, and well-known and translated in many languages.  I first read it in Japanese, and translated it into Japanese myself.  It is very easy to read, and not terribly complicated, and offers plenty of insight into the Japanese language, culture, and life.  Many examples and illustrations are provided to illustrate concepts and to help the reader gain a deeper appreciation of the Japanese 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of essays by women on issues of gender. It is not only a collection of women's opinions, but it is also a collection that covers the breadth of women, of the world, of history.  For those of you that do not know, I am a female who has studied women's history all my life.  Women's History has always fascinated me as it is both a personal and a public history. I had no idea that there was such a diversity in women's lives.  The essays in this book were a great addition to my knowledge of women 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic read about the life of a New Zealander born and raised in the South Pacific, where he was able to see and experience many parts of the world. The book was written by James and Ruth Dickson - James' brother-in-law who has lived in San Francisco and New York. His book is the inspiration for this one. The story of the Dickson family is about love and loss, hope and despair. In his book we see how the Dicksons have dealt with loss and struggle. Through it all the Dictor family lived in love and hope. We see their travels through the South Seas and the South American countries. As they deal with the death of Ruth, the Dicus have moved from strength to strength. As the story goes, their faith has brought them through some difficult times. Through Ruth's struggle with cancer, the story of their faith, and the strength of their relationship, we see the Dictsons in a whole new light. As James said, "The Dictors were my family. I loved them like my own. I had great respect for them and their values. Ruth was the light of our lives." The book touches on many different topics, ranging from family, to politics, to art and religion. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that it is in a somewhat technical language. Most of the pictures and text are in English, however some of the text is in Hawaiian and other languages. However, the pictures that are in Hawaiian make up a lot of the illustrations. The illustrations were beautifully done and beautifully presented in color. However I do have one complaint about the book. The first half of the book focuses more on the Dickeyons and their personal history. The second half focuses on the events surrounding the death and funeral of Ruth. As you move through the story, the events that happen after Ruth's death are added to the story. This is a wonderful story, which is well told. The Dictorets have suffered great loss and loss is something that is always going to haunt them. What is wonderful about this story is the Dicys are so full of love for one another, and have each other's backs. The whole family does not just rely on the family motto. Each one of them has a motto of his own. These are the people I would be. This was a beautiful story that was written in a poetic style. The pictures are gorgeous, the text beautiful.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of essays written by a great number of great writers, ranging from Jane Austen to Virginia Woolf.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has helped me understand the history of the American Jewish community during the time of the Holocaust.I was especially moved by Rabbi David Berger's experience as he was at the mercy of the Nazis during his visit to the United States in 1938. He wrote a wonderful memoir and story of the experiences he experienced during the Nazi period. This book is a wonderful read as well as a powerful testament of the power of the human spirit. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in learning more about the life and times of Jews in America 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part of the book provides a brief history of the American Revolution, followed by the history of Massachusetts, the other colonies, and eventually the establishment of the United States. The second part of this book is devoted to the lives and achievements of individual revolutionaries.  The reader is given many facts and figures of the individual lives and careers of the most important American revolutionaries and is then given a complete account of their actions and influence, including the battles, political campaigns, and diplomatic exchanges.  This is followed by a full narrative of the early years of the new country, including its major battles and major diplomatic developments. The historical events and figures covered in this book are well documented and are true to life. The writing is good, the historical information is accurate, and the style of writing is engaging and readable. It is interesting to see how these revolutionary ideas became incorporated into the early American Constitution. The authors clearly explain the significance of the political changes and decisions taken by these leaders and how this affected the lives of the individuals involved.  Overall this is an excellent book for all lovers of American history. It will give you a broad overview of the history and the personalities of the great revolutionary leaders of the time. It contains many facts of great historical interest and it is written in a straightforward way that readers will quickly understand. It also has a wide range of information on the lives, careers, and influences of the revolutionaries and the people who supported them

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an inspiring story about the life of Dr. James Watson and his amazing contribution to the discovery of the structure of DNA. The two of them working together to understand the structure and function of the molecule are the stuff of myth and legend.  The work of Dr Watson was in danger of becoming forgotten, until Watson's great-great-grandson, David Watson (a biochemist himself) revived the work, as well as the life story of the two of these great minds. I have followed Dr Watson's work closely for several years. This book, written by David Watson, is a tribute to the life and work of James Watson. I recommend it highly to all students, researchers, and those who care about the structure, function, and potential of the DNA molecule.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this I was 17 and I've read it several times since. This is the story of a family who have made it through the dark ages of the Inquisition and survived. It tells of how the father, a priest, was forced to escape to Spain and then the Netherlands to save his soul, while his family were being persecuted in Portugal and Spain. They have become a powerful force in their home country of Portugal and in the Netherlands, and have survived both Nazism and the Nazis in the process 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful and beautifully written.  I was not familiar with the author's work and read some of her books before, but I have to say, this one was especially inspiring.  It reminded me of the time I was reading The Little House books and she showed how each of the children in that story took a small but significant role in the community.  That same spirit was in every page of this book.  Her characters are real, and her family is real

The book in general is a wonderful read for anyone interested in eastern spirituality and how they are interwoven with Christianity. This book provided an introduction to a wonderful tradition, the Orthodox faith, and what it means to be Orthodox.  It provided some history of how this tradition came to be and how it has evolved into today's Orthodox faith. It also gave a sense of how it affects a person. It was fascinating to read the writings of the early fathers, such as Philoxenus, Irenaeus, and Justin Martyr, who gave such insights into Orthodox spirituality. I can honestly say that I have never felt more at home or closer to the teachings of Jesus Christ 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My students and I loved this book. My favorite is the one on the History of American Poetry.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title is a pun.  I have found this book most helpful and instructive in understanding the religious aspect of a homosexual orientation.  This book has helped me deal with the issues of being a gay Christian and living with my boyfriend.  The main point of the book is to teach the person how to deal with all the  social, legal, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects of living a homosexual lifestyle.  There is so much misinformation about homosexuality out there  that many people do not realize they are homosexuals.  Most people think that homosexuality is just a way of life and a way for the gays to enjoy their sexual freedom.   I think that's where this book has done the most good for me.  In a time where the homosexual community is often discriminated against  by society, this book teaches me how to overcome discrimination, which is so often an area where many gays go astray.  It is important that you are taught how to support your gay loved one as well as how to  deal with people who have misgivings.  With the information provided in this book I am more than  able to deal professionally with any problems that may arise from this situation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be most helpful, most detailed, most well-researched, and most engaging in my search for my true love.  I'm already planning a second reading, this time for older teens and adults with more questions.  The book is written in a fun, straightforward style, but contains an underlying depth of knowledge that makes it all the more satisfying.  A must-read for any couple who has been through the ups and downs of love 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful read. I have a degree in theology and have been working in pastoral ministry since the early 80's. I feel that this book is an excellent summary of biblical interpretation for laypeople and ministers. I would love to see this book in a more accessible version for more serious scholars

It gives detailed instructions and examples for almost every type of garment, including patterns, patterns for clothes and more 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I believe this is one of the most fascinating accounts of American espionage ever written.  His account of the successful mission that foiled the Nazi war machine is a triumph of American intelligence

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the book to own for any person who has struggled with addiction, especially opiate addiction.  It addresses the reasons why people use drugs and helps them find solutions to their problems.  The author, Mr. Tice, is a physician who used to treat opiate addicts.    A great read and well worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book I was waiting for, but I never could find the time to read it.  The title of the book was so interesting, I bought the book right away.  I am so glad I did!  This book is about some of the great stories of the American West, from the frontier days to the days of the West in the 20th Century.  You will not find these stories in any history book, because they are not written by historians.  They are written by those who lived them and they are just as authentic.  This makes the stories so much more powerful, and the writing so much easier to understand.  It is a joy to read these stories, and it is sad to think that they have been lost to the history books, which is sad in itself.  There is something so moving about the simple, yet profound, simple kindness of the pioneers of the west, which made the West so magical.  We need more people like the pioneers.  As the West is dying and the west is dying hard, I hope we get a chance to read more of these simple, but profound, stories about the people who made the west what it is today.  Perhaps we will one day have the chance to return to the west to see how it is being run by those we have left behind.  Thank you Mr. McPherson for sharing these wonderful stories with us 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of the life of Jesus of Nazareth is a great one. I am especially fascinated by the life he lived in Egypt. In this fascinating book, Mary Magdalene is a part of the story. It was in Egypt, not Judea, that Jesus spent his life. This is a wonderful book that deserves to be read by all who want to know more about Jesus and His time in Egypt 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who enjoys good science fiction, or who just loves to read about space travel.   It was one of my favorite SF authors, and I love the stories he wrote about his journeys to other planets and stars.  This was a great way to celebrate his work, and it is even better now, because I know of a lot more of the things that are to come in his future 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with all the previous reviews, this is a brilliant book, full of beautiful, thought provoking pictures.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part of this collection deals with the life and career of William Shakespeare. The second part deals with his mother's life. This is the most complete and compelling study of Shakespeare's life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of the struggle over American independence and the Civil War is the story of a people living in contradiction, one striving for freedom while another sought to preserve slavery.  In this important book, historian George Bancroft shows that a coalition of Republicans, Whigs, and northerners led by George Washington led to the successful overthrow of the slaveholding South and to the founding of the United States.  The Civil War resulted in the largest transfer of wealth in history from the south to the north, with blacks, freedmen, and newly emancipated slaves getting the greatest shares, with southern whites and the wealthy moving to the North.  This is the first book ever written about the Civil war in this nation's history.  It gives us a new vision of the war, and gives us hope that the southern people of the nineteenth century could rise above their past to build the country of freedom that they envisioned.  I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers an amazing array of great information about the game of chess: tactics, positional analysis, theory, etc.  This is the first book written specifically on the game

Write a positive review about a good book:   The author has done a wonderful job of presenting a complete history of the Catholic Church in the US from its very founding in 1609.  His history of St. Peter's was an inspiration to me as a young boy growing up in the Catholic community.  What he has done in this book is to summarize and condense all the events in his history.  It is now possible to explore the Catholic roots in America, which have been growing over the past several decades.  I think that most Americans have a vague idea of the story of American Catholicism, but very few have really studied the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating look at the history of the American labor movement from the beginning, with a detailed look at labor's rise and fall throughout the 20th century.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read other versions of this book, but this is the first I have found in its entirety.  It's filled with useful ideas for beginning, intermediate, and advanced players.  I've already used quite a few of the ideas within the first couple of chapters.  This is the only book on how to play magic that really seems to understand the role as a whole.  The various rules of each system are discussed, but never in such a way as to detract from the core purpose of the game.  Some of the rules are complex, but not so much that they get in the way of a fun, fast-paced game.The story is well written and exciting.  Each of the heroes is presented with a situation that is both interesting and dangerous.  Their own abilities are used to help them to overcome the challenges before them.  You'll learn how to prepare and run a game with the best of them.This is the book I keep on my night stand, ready to read whenever it comes around.  Its light and easy to read, with plenty of useful tips for making your game more fun.  Get the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It was a very moving account of the lives of a group of children, including two adopted kids, who had to live without their parents for a number of years in order to survive. It included their relationships with each other, with their parents and grandparents, and with the children they never met. This is a really good book. I hope to get a copy of it when I am in the library again. I highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a lifesaver for me when I was just starting to research the Book of Mormon. I just can't put it down, and if you haven't read it yet, you definitely should. I learned so much from it, especially about the Spanish language. Thanks for a great book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an extremely well written book.  It covers much of the same ground as "The Power of Belief" and is also the first to really discuss the effects of the fall of communism.  I must have read it three times, each time becoming more enlightened about the world we live in.  The book is written in a very accessible, entertaining manner and there are numerous illustrations that help illustrate important concepts.  This book is a must for anyone who is concerned with world peace.  There is so much in this book for those of us in the west to do and learn.  Thank you for writing this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very clear and concise book.  It has been a great inspiration to many of my students and myself.  In this book, we can see how important it is to focus on our innermost thoughts and feelings.  From there, we need to find ways to get in touch with this power and find ways of strengthening our personal relationships.  This book gives us a wealth of insight and a wonderful insight into the lives of our loved ones.  Highly recommended

I'm a Franciscan, a born again Christian, and this was the book I was looking for to understand and appreciate my faith.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book that I have read by Gary K. Wolfe that actually got me thinking about our species. It was written during the 1960s and it is written in such a clear, understandable way.  It makes you feel like you are part of the group of folks who are facing the problem of survival in this planet.  The title "The American Humanist" was not only meant to include this book as well as The Age of Environmental Crisis, but also many others in our cultural history and ecology. I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of the lives of two women, Margaret Sanger and Susan B. Anthony is one of the most inspiring in history. Mary Ward (and many others) have beautifully captured the spirit of these women through their writings and the many interviews that Mary Ward has given over the years. Mary's new book, "The Sanger's and the Anthony's," is a must for anyone interested in women's history and in the history of reproductive freedom in America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is essential for anyone who is serious about spirituality, especially if they are interested in Zen.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic collection of essays and interviews by a great writer and critic, John Berger. What an interesting and provocative writer and thinker he was. He was an inspiration to writers like Philip Roth, Virginia Woolf, and John Updike, as well as many of his students. If you haven't read any of his writing, you're missing out on a treasure trove of original and insightful work. A must read for any serious writer or critic 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful, informative, insightful look at one of America's most misunderstood and misunderstood religious groups.  It is, in the words of one reviewer, the story of the Jehovah's Witnesses in America.  The information contained in this book is truly enlightening and interesting.  If you are a believer, I highly recommend you read this book.  You will learn a great deal about this wonderful, misunderstood group

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the most up to date, practical, and up-to-date approach on how to become a great musician. It is a must read for any guitarist or musician in need of information on guitar technique and playing styles. The author has used over a decade of research in his practice to create a solid overview on how all guitarists can progress their playing.The book covers all the most commonly practiced guitar techniques that can be practiced using a guitar and a small amount of music theory. The book will not only teach you how to practice these techniques but it will also teach you what they are, what to listen for and why they are important.  This will allow you to quickly become an even better guitarist 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is as entertaining as it is informative.  The story of the early days of the Civil Rights Movement in Alabama is told through the eyes of a young man named Alton B. Parker.  He is a black teenager in a white town, and his struggles are chronicled through the pages of this wonderful novel.  This is a true classic story from Alabama.  It is as good as The Autobiography of Malcolm X 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this book was absolutely wonderful.  Not only was it a great look into the life of the founder of Scientology but also provided some interesting facts about her life and the religion itself.  It is truly an inspirational read, I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There is a lot of wisdom in this book. I recommend it highly. The only criticism is it is too long for one book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books, it is a comprehensive study of one of the most interesting personalities of the 20th Century: Albert Eintein. A fascinating man, with a very dark side, Albert was a great political scientist and the founder of modern Zionism. His impact upon the world is as profound as the impact of any man who has ever lived. Albert is a tragic figure, yet he has been given the last rites of celebrity immortality by his devotees in the last few years. But for anyone who wants to really understand Albert, I would recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a young child, but my interest was piqued more recently. The book is written in an easy-to-understand style, and the information is well presented. It is the author's personal stories, rather than the science, that have captivated the imagination of all children for generations. If you have any interest in the topic of genetics and development, I recommend this book highly. It should be considered the ultimate reference for any child or adult with an interest in developmental science. I'm sure that it will provide a wealth of information to parents who are still struggling with problems associated with their children's genetic makeup 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book. I am looking forward to some additional material as it develops. I wish there were more essays that focus on African American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrific read.  It provides both historical and current insight into the rise of the New Religious Movement, particularly the Mormons.  From its early days as a small, secretive cult with a charismatic leader, the LDS church has grown to over 1.7 billion members around the globe.  This book is filled with a wonderful collection of biographical facts, pictures and inspiring quotes.  Its approach is not overly doctrinal but rather uses historical information to paint a picture of the fascinating story of the LDS religion.  What I find most impressive about the work is the amount of original research provided by the author.  I had no idea there were so many books on the Mormons before reading this one.  With the recent publication of the book "The Mormons: Rough Stone Rolling" by Richard Bushman  there are now over 30 great books available that cover every aspect of the Mormon history.  All of these books provide the most relevant information to anyone interested in learning more about the LDS faith.  If you are not yet an active member of the Church, I highly recommend "Mormon History for Kids."  It is a short, insightful and entertaining book about the earliest origins of the church.  The book does a superb job of explaining the differences between the early Mormon church, the early LDS Church, and the LDS Church today 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book. It contains everything a child needs to know about the alphabet to learn to write.

If you have questions, problems or just want to deepen your understanding, you simply must read this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent introduction to Jewish history. I had not been familiar with any Jewish history before reading this, so I really enjoyed it. I do have one issue, and that is the use of the term "Sinai death camp" which may be offensive to some of the survivors 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book on psychology I've ever read that actually covers all of the sub-fields of psychology, and gives an overview of each of them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic. It's been described as "the autobiography of an atheist" and "the book that started it all for me". In the last twenty-five years, there has been no greater influence on the life of an American atheist than Richard Dawkins. The first part of this book is an in-depth look at the intellectual and personal history of Dawkins, beginning with the life and family in Bradford. The second part takes up Dawkins' professional life and provides a comprehensive guide for any self-confessed atheist. Both parts are highly recommended to any self respecting American atheist. This is an extremely well documented and compelling memoir and a great resource for any fan of Richard Dawkins 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has opened my eyes to a great deal of information on how to live and love in the New World, particularly in the Caribbean. In addition, the book has given me a renewed appreciation for the great cultures of the Caribbean that have been neglected. The work of the anthropologist has finally found its voice in the writing of this wonderful book. It is one of the most comprehensive works on Caribbean cultural identity that I have come across. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The life stories of two extraordinary people. One is the man who would go on to become an architect.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A delightful book, filled with beautiful pictures and colorful descriptions of the lives and travels of women and girls living in Japan during the Edo period. The Japanese are not the only people who have been influenced by Christianity - indeed, I would argue that this book is the best example of an overview of women's life in Japan that I have ever read. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of learning the language of the Samurai - it is fascinating. The text is a bit dated, but the pictures are very strong and informative - the history and culture of Japan are wonderfully presented. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of the early years of the Church, from its very earliest days in the Galilee to its most triumphant phase in the First Century. In this remarkable account are to be found all the key doctrines of the Catholic Faith. The language is lucid and clear, with many examples and illustrations. This is an absolutely fascinating work and has provided an inexhaustible source of information for me ever since I first began to study Catholicism 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an exceptional book on the history of the Ku Klux Klan. It is the only book on this subject, with the possible exception of A History of the Klan, which also has a chapter on the Klan in Alabama. I highly recommend this book.  It is informative and has been written with the keenest scholarship and historical insight.  I have read other books about the Klan and the Klan's rise to power in the southern United States. However, this book is unique because it addresses the organization of the KKK from its inception to the 1930's.  In particular, this work describes in detail the activities of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  The Klan was never as organized as many people believe it to be.  Its purpose was to protect white supremacy.  The NAACP was created in 1901 to end white supremacy by changing the legal definition of white to black.  Until the 1930s, the Klan was simply a form of vigilantism to protect whites from blacks.  However, white supremacists took over the Klan during the Great Depression, during World War II and the Cold War.  This work documents the rise of the modern KKK and the organization's transformation into an armed and aggressive organization.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author, the late Charles C. Mann, was the founder and president of the Institute for Historical Review. This is his best book to date. He chronicles the early days of the American New Right in his article entitled "The New Right: The Birth of a Movement". The chapter "The Political Ideology of American Fascism" is one of the most important, if not THE most important article written on the subject. It is written as if an interviewer has just come across the writings of Julius Evola and George Lincoln Rockwell and is attempting to reconcile them. His analysis is solid, logical, and compelling. The only possible complaint I could make about this is the repetition of many of the themes in the original articles. But, the repetition is necessary for the reader to absorb the ideas presented.The authors have always been ahead of the curve. This book is no exception. In the 1930's and 1940's, many intellectuals had no clue of what a fascist movement would look like. These ideas were first articulated by thinkers like Julius Evolle, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Charles Lindbergh and George C. Taylor. But only Charles Mann understood their significance and impact. The author shows how those ideas came to life through the ideas of a few brilliant people. In a way, this book is a call to action. It's a call for people to study and critically examine the ideas in this book and to make sure that they have a chance in this current, "soft" era. This movement has an amazing future ahead of it and will continue to grow in power and influence until it reaches a critical mass. It will take the same kind of people who helped shape the movement in the 1930s to help shape it in the future. I look forward to the day when those people realize that it is their duty to take a stand against the modern day, "fascist" takeover. This work of genius will lead us to a far better world. It just needs to be done.If you're thinking of joining a political movement, then I strongly urge you to read this book. In this political moment, it is a far more important task to understand the ideas and the philosophy of fascism than it is to be a member of a movement. There is a critical time in the development of our nation and our world. Charles Mann has shown us what we should do. The best political organizations and movements, like the New Left, are the ones which study the philosophy, ideas and
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, and plan to read it over again and again. It offers a great insight into life in the American South and on the frontier. There are a lot of facts about life on the American frontier and a lot about the lives of women.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to become successful, and to anyone in business. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best history books I have read.  I love this era of history and find it very interesting that so many of the early women in the west were successful.  From Jane Austin's ranching efforts in Texas to Sarah Cleveland's business endeavors in California and the US, I learned a lot from this book.  It is well documented with some great photos from the many places the women visited.  If you are interested in these pioneer women then this is the book to get

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for any student of the Church. It is a study of the early Church in Egypt from approximately AD 300-1100. The authors explore many different aspects of the ancient Egyptian Church. The author's own study of early Church history and religion gives us a fascinating look into what the Church looked like in Egypt prior to the arrival of Christianity. This study has great historical interest and is extremely well written

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first major work that tries to explain the roots of American radicalism and the development of anti-imperialist consciousness among American radicals in the post-World War II era. I found it a bit dry at times and there were some difficult questions to answer, but it provided a wealth of insight into the lives of some of the key radicals in American politics, especially the great historian Robert Nisbet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a marvelous book.  It was a pleasure to read this book, and I feel strongly that it should be read by everyone, especially as it pertains to this topic.  This book is filled with real-life stories of the true miracles that were done through the power of the Holy Spirit.  The story of the healing of a sick man, and the curing of his wife of terminal cancer, was a life-changing experience for both of them, and this book reminds us of that miracle.  God could be a very humble person, and He sure could do some amazing things.  In this book we are shown what was done to that man, what He did to cure his wife, and what He is doing for this sick man today.  All this was done in the name of the love and grace of God.  I was not the only one to receive healing at the hands of this man.  Other people have also received miraculous healing through the words of this book. This book was written for those who desire to learn about the true power of prayer, but who might not be familiar with the term "Prayer of the Church."  Prayer is the word used most often to describe the power and miracle of the Lord Jesus Christ.  There is much in this book that will help you to develop your own relationship with Jesus Christ as you seek to pray through faith, not mere superstition.  For many of you who have not prayed before, the prayers in this wonderful book will be life changing.  Even though we are often commanded to pray, many of us are often not praying according to our spiritual capacities.  When we do pray in the spirit, we are able to feel His love and care.  That is when the true healing happens.  We often do not know what our prayers are, but we do know what the Spirit is saying.  So, as you read the many prayers of faith offered in the book, remember, His love will be there in the prayers, and you will be healed.  You may not know it now, but you will.  If we simply go by our intellect, we cannot know His love.  As a result, He is able to do incredible things through the prayer of faith.  His healing power is incredible, but His grace is not.  He is the source of healing.  Do not be surprised if He does extraordinary things as you develop your relationship with Him, and as

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book by George Ritzer that I have read and it has made a large impact on me as a student and teacher.  I have now placed it on my shelf and am eagerly awaiting the other books in this series.  The book is filled with well-written information on art, literature, and technology.  This book is very informative and inspiring.  There are many great lessons to be learned and not only for the young artist but also for the general public.  George R. Ritzer is an artist himself and the author has done a wonderful job in portraying his life and work in this book.  His artwork is a reflection of the artist.  It's not just a great painting but an artistic reflection of his entire life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this in early 2008 and it was a revelation.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book through BookBaby, and have not put it down since.  I loved this book and the essays in it so much I read all of the rest of the books, too, including the one on marriage (and divorce) in this series.  If you are thinking of getting married, or thinking about getting divorced, this is the one to read.  It is a lot to take in at once, so read only the essays you want to know about and skip the rest.  The book covers a lot of territory, including how to be a good spouse, how to love your children, and how to communicate with your spouse.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive book I've ever seen about the history of Freemasonry.

If you have a Masonic background this is a must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic and must be read by every student of American foreign policy and national security. It provides an excellent overview of many of the major topics on which we focus our attention today and which our present political leaders must decide upon.The only weakness I have with it is that it is a bit dry at times. But I don't think that's the book's fault. In a time when the world is going crazy and most of us are just trying to make a living, it is vitally important to grasp and grasp quickly all the important issues. But there is nothing better to be doing than to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. The focus of the book is not only on the history of the early church but on many of the current debates and controversies surrounding those issues.  This is a good historical work and the authors do a wonderful job of presenting the data and analysis. The key to their approach to the historical Jesus is a careful study of the writings and life of Jesus 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title alone will make this an instant favorite.

It is a fascinating story, but the most fascinating aspect of this life story is that she made this decision to marry a guy she loved.  I would recommend this book for anyone interested in history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautifully illustrated collection of interviews with notable authors, artists and cultural figures, The New York Times called it the best book ever written about contemporary artists.  If you are an art lover or simply curious about any of the artists profiled in the book, you should definitely check this out 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent collection of essays that examines the relationship between religion and the social sciences.  The book is not only a discussion of the empirical data that indicate that religion is connected to societal well being, but also an analysis of the theoretical underpinnings that are used to support this connection.  While it is true that many scholars are skeptical of the connection, a comprehensive review of the evidence from many fields of research is extremely useful in understanding both the nature of the relationship itself and why it is so robust.  This collection is highly recommended for students and researchers in the social, behavioral and biomedical sciences.In addition, the essays within this collection discuss the connection between religiosity and mental health, the role of religion in the formation of morality and justice, and many other topics as well. This is the first book that I have read that truly engages both sides of the argument.  Each of the authors brings a unique perspective to the table that is both enlightening and compelling.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough

Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful story about a young girl, a new baby and her family. The author makes it clear that this is no simple matter. As the story develops and the characters begin to grow, you begin to see the roots of the  problems. The characters are relatable, even if their lives are beyond the reach of many.  As the book goes on, you realize just how far the family has come.  I will look for a companion to this book for my own children when they get older. The illustrations are stunning. And the pictures are full of wisdom and guidance. This is a must read for any family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read for anyone interested in the study of the history of the African-American religion.  The book does an excellent job of tracing the evolution of African-Americans from the slave to the black religious leader to today's African- American leaders.  We learn about all the major Black religious movements in the past and present and the major leaders who inspired and molded them.  It is an inspiring read for all those who care about the African American religious movement.  I highly recommend the book for anyone who wants to learn about the religious history of African Americans.

I have never before been so taken by such an insightful study of so much of the history of the Bible.

The second half is an analysis of the New Testament. All in a single volume 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of my all-time favorites.  It has a lot of information about how to use herbal remedies for a variety of problems.  I especially loved this section about how you can cure a cold with milk.  This has been my solution to many a cold sore 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for those of you who want to know the real reasons behind the Crusades. The story of the first Crusade is the story of a group of people who want more land. But that was only the start of what later generations of Christians came to call the " Crusades ". If you can stomach the historical accounts (as well as the gruesome imagery and the horrific suffering caused by the bloodshed) you will come away with some interesting insights into Christian history.  If you want to get a deeper understanding of what the Crusaders were up against then there is nothing better than this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The work of this masterful author on the subject of spirituality in our contemporary world is unmatched by anything else in the Western canon. He provides a detailed explanation for the modern spiritual crisis and how it has manifested itself, and why it continues to be a major source of pain to many people.

If you are considering becoming a Christian or a Buddhist and you have not yet read this book  I strongly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:   My first exposure to the history of medicine was through this book, so I was pleased to find a very accessible yet thorough overview of the early development of modern medicine. The author does a wonderful job of covering the major medical discoveries, how they were discovered, and what they accomplished. I especially like his treatment of medical ethics, which is particularly important for those who do not have the formal education or training required by medical schools today. This is a very useful book for any student of medicine or history of science. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has helped me so much with my spiritual practice.  The author has brought to light some of the things that I didn't even know existed.  I have a great deal of respect for the practice of yoga and am a big fan.  However, not being able to sit in silence and do nothing at all is a difficult thing for me to deal with.  So I find many of the yogic practices and meditations in this book to be very helpful.  It really shows you how one can start living in the moment and have a lot of fun while doing it.  And it really helps to see the connection between the practices and the many different disciplines.  My husband and I have been doing a lot more of the breathing, mantra, and mantra-based practices lately.  We have done a lot in the last few months and these techniques have really helped us and we will certainly be doing more in the future.  For example, one technique called "mindful listening" really brings you closer to the source and heart of whatever you are experiencing.  When you focus on listening to the breath, you get deeper inside the breath and realize the truth in what is happening.  Mindfulness also helps you be more present in all aspects of your life.  If you have difficulty finding this kind of balance or being present in life, this book will help you.   It also has a great section on the different types of meditation, and many of these techniques are really helpful for me personally. I really recommend this book for anyone who is looking for some new techniques to try.  A great book for beginners to advanced students, I would say. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive biography of the remarkable musician and filmmaker Howard Hughes, who was born August 1, 1929 and died May 4, 2012. Hughes is perhaps best known as the founder of the Hughes Brothers Films, but was also an American revolutionary in World War II, a lover of jazz and art, and a film pioneer. His biographies of many of his close friends and associates were collected in these books: The Real Frank Sinatra, The Real Elvis Presley, and The Real Judy Garland. The biography of his second wife, Patricia, remains one of the most interesting biographies ever written. Hughes's life was full of extremes: there was his first marriage to Elizabeth Taylor, a Hollywood actress, his first brush with death, in 1953, when a falling tree knocked him down; his long battles with the FBI, and his subsequent exile from America; the time in which he was caught on film in an affair with a former girlfriend and forced to divorce his wife; the death of his two sons, aged two and five, in a car crash; his first suicide attempt in 1975, when he tried to slit his wrists; his death from lung cancer on May 4th, 2012; his posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; his final film The Aviator. There are countless anecdotes about his many adventures, and it is hard not to fall in love with him as a man of great talent, ambition and love, and great social conscience. Hughes was a true artist in every sense, and if you are a lover not just of the arts, but also of great friendship, this is the book to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive work on the subject. I was an American army medic in the war in Vietnam and this is the book that helped me to stay alive. It was written by a Marine officer and former Marine who served in South Vietnam and kept close to the battlelines. He was in the thick of the action himself and wrote about the horrors of the battle in excruciating detail. This book will help anyone who has any sympathy or interest in the subject get acquainted with the horrors that the Vietcong was committing upon its own people 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first three chapters were about how to make a good cookbook, and the next two chapters were the recipes.

This book is a must for anyone who loves to cook

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the very few books that I have read that have had a profound effect on me, and I believe is of great benefit to all readers of Western literature.   If you're thinking about writing a novel, or trying to gain a greater appreciation for one, or studying for an exam  it's a wonderful book, one that will help you to identify some of the common characteristics and tropes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is well done.  From the first page of the introduction to the last, it has been written in such a way that makes it easy to relate to.  As the author himself states, it is a book about a mother, and about the children that she has.  It is a wonderful look into the life and character of a strong, hard-working woman 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most unique and thought-provoking books I have read on the subject of the sexual revolution and homosexuality.  It is also an important and timely reminder of how much the homosexual movement has progressed in just forty-eight years.  This book will change the way you think about homosexuality and the struggle for rights for the sexual minority. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author, R.K. Ogden, is a distinguished American philosopher of science. He teaches philosophy at UC Berkeley. He has written a fine, scholarly and readable book on the history of science, one that gives a sense of the philosophical issues involved. In particular, the chapter on Darwin and the Origin of Species is fascinating. I highly recommend this book for students of philosophy, and for students in general, who want to delve deeper into the philosophical background of science and scientific method. I especially like this book as an introduction to one of the most exciting questions of our times -- life's origins. It is important to understand why we accept and deny the reality of life's origin. In this book, Ogden attempts to show how, in his own terms, science comes to accept the reality and necessity of life. This is not a theory -- nor is it an argument -- but rather a description of the historical sequence of thought in science over many centuries. In doing so, he is showing how the scientific method is, itself, a philosophical reflection on philosophy and the nature of reality 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very insightful and well-written look at the early days of the Mormon Church.  There are many great stories and personal stories in this book and the best part is the analysis.  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn more about the early years of Mormonism 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is as good as the cover says. I am a bit older, so I took a bit of time to read this book because I needed to reacquaint myself with some of the more recent research. For example, a good place to start is the book by David C. Lundberg and his co-author on the subject.  Then I went through the papers and articles on the site of the Institute for Advanced Study, and it was like walking in a time machine. You get all the results of the latest discoveries in the field.  Also, for those who might be interested in the history of linguistics, you will find that there is a huge amount of material on the history and development of English, including the earliest uses of English in documents.  In fact, a few years ago I was searching for something to study when I came upon an article on "The New English" in the Journal of Grammar and Language. The author, Denny F. Haggard, was kind enough to give me a copy of the original book in which he outlined the language. This was a very useful guide. It was a great pleasure to finally get to a place where I felt I had a pretty good feel of the history. This book is an excellent resource. It is full of interesting information, and well-written 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive account of a remarkable American.  It was written by a man who knew the people and had personal involvement with them, and the book is as much the result of the person's life as anything else.

The book is not only about the Old Testament, but about Judaism as a whole and how this history has changed in the last 200 years.  This is a very insightful book that can help deepen your understanding of what Judaism is all about 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a wonderful study of the rise of American pop culture in the 1940s and 1950s. I loved it as a child and, when I was able to afford it, it really opened my eyes to a lot of things about Americana. I feel that the book has been much under appreciated, and it is a great pleasure to finally have the opportunity to get into the nitty-gritty of it and write about it here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm very impressed with this book, I was looking for this material in a general course I was taking.  This book has made the material readily available to me, and I'll be recommending it to my students.  Great book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the story of one family's journey from a remote little village in Africa to the heart of New York City. The story is told through the perspective of six children - two of them born in Africa, two of whom lived in England, one of whom came here to the United States. It is the stories of these young people - three African, one English and two Americans - that are the real interest in this book. The focus is on the experiences of the six children and their parents during the first two years of the children's lives. The first half of the book follows their arrival in New York, the second half their second two years in the United State

The author clearly has done his research and is a knowledgeable professional.  There is very little in the way of speculation in the book.  It is very practical, with explanations of the techniques used in the interpretation of horoscopes and horary readings.  I really enjoyed this book and hope to see more

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an extraordinary book. It gives a comprehensive, detailed history of one of the most influential and important religious movements in the world - that of Judaism.  This book gives a true picture of the history of the Jewish people, the time and place they lived, the languages they spoke, their customs and beliefs.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in African American history.  There are so many excellent essays in this book, as well as stories and history.I especially like this part of the book: "This is the first and only book to chronicle the civil rights movement in the South through the eyes of its most militant leaders.The Black Power movement began in Alabama, where it was fueled by the work of black church preachers, the black political machine and the political machine of the state's white elite. The power of the Southern white vote was the key factor in the success of the movement.By the late 1960s, black political activism and the civil-rights movement had exploded across America, but in the Deep South this was far from the case. There, the civil right movement had been slow to grow into a movement of change, and many in the white community were afraid of it. To a large degree, this fear stemmed from their economic position in the society, with the elite of the South's economy firmly in place. By the late sixties, southern whites feared that black power was coming to the South, and they tried to put the brakes on it."The civil-right movement was a natural response to this fear. But the movement went beyond racial consciousness. It also sought to improve living conditions for all people of color in the United States. The leaders of the civil movement recognized that the struggle to end segregation in housing and employment would have to address racism and classism. For the Black Power leaders, the challenge was not only about ending segregation, but about creating a more equal society, where white workers and black workers would not be treated like 'two separate races' or 'oppressed peoples.' Black Power meant creating a political force to bring about these changes."In the 1960s Black Power emerged as a powerful force in the U.S.A. Black Power was not confined to the Black communities of the Deep Southern United States, nor did it start in the civil disobedience struggles of the sixties. Rather, the Black power movement started from the deepest levels of the American society. The first national Black power demonstration took place in Birmingham, Alabama in 1965, which was followed by a string of demonstrations in major cities. In the Spring of 1966, Malcolm X led an armed march from Harlem to Washington, D.C., where he was murdered by a racist police officer.In 1967, a number of Black Power organizations began to form and they included the Black Panther Party

The main section is devoted to the basics, but it includes a lot of detailed descriptions as well. The author is no slouch, and it shows in the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was very little and it has never failed to inspire me. The characters are as interesting as they are real.

Here we discover the varied struggles of women, Afro-American, Spanish, and Vietnamese workers.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with the reviewers here.  This is a very insightful book on the life of an American revolutionary and patriot, born to immigrant parents in 1806 in Philadelphia.  John Brown was a true American hero.  From the age of twelve, John was involved in politics and fighting for his country.  At age sixteen he participated in the Battle of Lexington and Concord.  He escaped the guillotine in Paris and eventually settled in Kentucky where he died as a martyr to the cause of freedom.  His great-great-grandfather was General Samuel Adams.  All the characters in this book are real and historical.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who cares about our history and our history books.  It is truly an amazing story and one that has never been told before 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for any beginner who wants to know more about the history and culture of Russia. The focus on Russia is thorough.

They include: Vasily Grossman (Russian poet), Andrei Sakharov (Russian politician), Yuri Gagarin (Cosmonaut), Mikhail Lermontov (former Communist Party member and Soviet spy), and many more. It is well documented and the images provided are excellent

Write a positive review about a good book:   My mother read this book when I was young. It has stuck with me through my adulthood. A book that teaches children the values and principles of healthy living through the example of a "super healthy" grandmother. It is a real treat to be able to read it and to meet my grandma today. I can't say enough about this book. It was my mother's, and it is my life's work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most important texts in contemporary American history. Its themes and arguments are timeless, its language engaging, its conclusions provocative. The ideas of the past are tested and transformed by the ideas of today. This book is a masterwork. One cannot imagine a more important text for understanding the events of the last fifty years than this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're a history or travel buff, this is a must read.  You'll learn how people have traveled through Africa, South America and the Caribbean in the past and how they have evolved over the years.  It will inspire you to think critically about what you've seen, heard and experienced so far, what you want to see and experience, and what to think about the future.  There's a lot of information on travel tips, history, and even a few interesting facts.  If all this is your cup of tea, I definitely recommend this as a travel reading.  (Yes, I know, I'm a history buff and this book will probably appeal to people with a similar interest.  But this is written for everyone.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have never read anything by this author, so this book was great to have. It was a joy to read about the hardships many of the immigrants endured while in America. They had to learn how to live in America, and it helped them build a new life in their new country. The hardships of their families and their time in the military were also included in the story.This book is about many of our greatest heroes, and one of the reasons we love them is their ability to cope with adversity and hardship. It is a good way to understand who they are, and how they are living today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a truly great book.  If you have never read about the American Civil War, it is well worth doing.  A fascinating look at a truly remarkable event 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an outstanding book for the serious student of Chinese politics, history and society. It is based on more than forty years of fieldwork, interviews with hundreds of political prisoners, and analysis of numerous government documents. The subjects covered are not only the political situation and policies of the PRC and the People's Republic of China, but also its political and social history in mainland China, as well as its relations with other Asian countries. The author brings a unique and important perspective to the issues by not only reading primary documents and interviewing sources from both sides, but by examining China's recent history in terms of the development of the Chinese Communist Party, Maoism and the Cultural Revolution. The book is also illustrated with an invaluable index and bibliography. The authors' approach is always thorough, yet respectful. The reader is able to get a solid understanding of the events, and a comprehensive picture of the many issues and events that have shaped the PRI and PRC. The readers are not left completely without historical background, as the author makes many use of secondary sources, especially official documents. This is all well documented, and the reader will be able to piece together a comprehensive view of China's political history in a reasonable amount of time. The work is not just historical in nature, but is also a comprehensive study of current Chinese society and of the political history of China. The present circumstances of the country, as seen from a global point of view, are given considerable attention. The results of these various approaches to the problem of China are not a trivial matter, as is often the case in other fields of research. This work is a must for students of Chinese society, and any serious student who wishes to understand contemporary China must have this book as a core resource 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in one night. I'm still reading it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read several other books on the subject of early Christianity.  I was excited to finally learn the truth behind what some of the most popular writers had written.  The book is as clear and readable as the original documents.  My family has been studying Christianity for many years now.  We were particularly excited about this new book for the subject.  One of the best introductions to early Christianity 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book for anyone who is looking for a more spiritual approach to Christianity.  It is written by a Christian who was brought up in a fundamentalist religious environment, and has since become a strong agnostic.  The book is short and to the point, and the author writes about the topics as he experienced them in his own life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in school and immediately started thinking about becoming a psychologist. This is a fabulous book for anyone who wants to better understand mental health and depression. The author does a great job of discussing both extremes of the problem, highlighting what makes each one of us different and what we can do to deal with both types. I think the main message is to be kind and accepting of your circumstances. If you have to be the bearer of bad news, it's probably going to be about someone you love. And if someone you're close to has a condition that makes them unhappy, you need to work out how you can help. A lot of people will tell you that mental illness and depression can't be helped and that it's your problem to manage. But I think if you truly want to help someone you can do both. The first step is to accept them as they are. No one has ever come close to understanding depression, so this is a wonderful book to learn about it from the ground up 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will help you to understand that the "good" in evil can't be so easily defined.  You can see that by reading it.  I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to better understand the evil of our times.  The concepts in this book can be applied to many other religions, as well.  Don't let anyone tell you that you can't understand the evils of the world until you "go back to the Bible".  You need to be prepared for this and you need to understand just how far you have fallen from God's Word.  But, even if you have not been in the church all of these years, you can learn more about the occult in this text than in a hundred books put together 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is packed full of helpful advice on how to be a successful professional photographer and a good person. There is an abundance of information for both amateurs and professionals. I loved the descriptions of the city and how much the photos were different in the early 1900's versus the late 1960's. I am a long-term photographer and have never seen so much of the natural world as I did in the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The essays in this book are all original, engaging and insightful, and the ideas are extremely well-argued and thought-provoking 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a graduate student in theology and church history, I've had to read a lot of books.  I've read many in this series, but this book was the first one that actually helped me understand why so many different groups of Christians choose to worship the same god.  With this book I now know why we need to be a part of something larger than ourselves.  It was a pleasure to read about and to be able to learn from people who are a great example of a Christian family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete account of African-American history available to readers.

This book is highly recommended for both students and general readers, who are interested in the history of the African American people 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive book on Zen.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in the history of jazz music and its connection to rock and roll. If there is anyone out there who wants to know more about this area of music, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic in the genre, a deep and compelling exploration of human nature. It's one of the best books I've ever read on the subject. This is an introduction to psychological types and how they manifest themselves in everyday life. The author does a brilliant job of explaining psychological types in their various manifestations, and the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions. I recommend this to any self-help lover who seeks to understand himself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for the Christian who has not had much exposure to the Bible yet.  It is written by a layman, who is an expert on the Bible and has lived in the Bible belt his whole life.  This makes for an interesting read as the reader is not only taken on a journey in the life of Christ, but also in the lives of the people who lived before Christ and were inspired by the Word.  I really enjoyed this book and feel that all Christians would benefit greatly from having it on their shelf.  If you know nothing of the Bible, you are in for a real treat.  Everyone is touched by the message of redemption and love, as well as the beautiful beauty of the Biblical world.  For those who are struggling, this book may be able to open your heart 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not read much in regards to Vietnam since finishing my studies at Oxford and have now read several of the books on the topic written by military, academic and journalistic experts. I was very impressed by the depth of research in this book. Very well done. I have seen a lot of negative comments about other books on Vietnam but it really makes one realize that we do know more about the war now then we did in 1968. This is a very thought provoking book. I hope that it is available in all major book stores 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and for the first time I am learning a bit more about the life of John Paul II.  I will read the other books on the subject and make up my own mind.  A great book 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book for anyone that has struggled with weight and health issues.  The stories of how one individual deals with weight issues are incredible 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive introduction to the history of twentieth century Jewish literature. The book is divided into four chapters covering the period between 1917 and 1939. The first two chapters present a short history of the Jewish literary world. The last two chapters cover the period of Nazi occupation of Poland, and the aftermath. The author goes into great depth on the Jewish poets and playwrights whose work was at the heart of the Warsaw ghetto uprising and the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. The final chapter provides a historical analysis of some of the most influential Jewish American writers. The essays are well written and beautifully illustrated. The text is not as scholarly as some other studies on the same subject. But the author makes an invaluable contribution in presenting in one place this most important and interesting subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only book I have ever read about the American Revolution and the War of Independence written from a Revolutionary perspective 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for the first time over a decade ago.  It is the only book I have found that provides such a thorough overview of the world's religions.  The author explains the historical background and provides the history of each religion in the book.  There are many wonderful illustrations throughout the text.  My favorite example is the picture of the Buddha being asked by a Hindu man to be his successor.  He replied that there were no successors; only continuants.  I found this book in a bookshop in a dusty little town in the Czech Republic.   As a graduate student of religion, I found it an eye opening and enlightening reading for the entire religious community 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive work on the Vietnam War from a writer who was there.  I read this book several times when I was in the army, and it gave me a perspective on the war that I never would have had otherwise 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was recommended to me by my brother. He is a pastor, and I am an aspiring pastor myself. So this book is great for both Christians and non-Christians. We should never take the Bible for granted

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of original essays by a group of American Jews, discussing their experiences and thoughts about Israel.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of the modern movement for black liberation in America. It is filled with a wealth of information about Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and others who worked for equality in the black community. I had never heard of the Martin Luther Leutnant until I read this book. It opens my eyes to the struggles of African Americans in the twentieth century. If you are interested in learning more about Martin and Malcolm you can read their biographies. If, however, you have never heard about them, this book is for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the real thing. It's not as common these days to find a historical novel that looks back at the past in an objective and unbiased manner. I've read a few of these and this one stood out. This is not an easy read, but it's beautifully written and well organized. This may be the only comprehensive account of American slavery in the early 19th century, and I strongly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part of this book is very easy to read and understand.  The second part is very challenging, but not too difficult to understand. But if you are a spiritual seeker who wants to study the truth about God, the devil, and the universe then I encourage you to consider this book.  This book will take you from a skeptic to an actual seeker of truth.   This is the only book that covers the subject of how to really discover the truth and how to live in peace and harmony with other people.  To do this you must realize that God, Satan, and all of the other false gods you see in the world are actually false.  They are all manifestations of God's own mind, and therefore are very limited in what they can do.  If you are to really understand the nature of the universe you must learn to let go of the false gods, learn the true nature of God, and learn how to use all of your abilities to realize your true purpose and meaning in life

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have read that has really brought me closer to understanding the roots of the Black Radical Tradition.  The ideas in the book are really revolutionary in the sense that they show that there is a historical continuity between the Black and African Diaspora movements.  It is a beautiful book, and the text is written very well.  I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to better understand the legacy of the revolutionary black  activists in America.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The author has made it very clear from the very beginning of the book that his goal is to take the reader beyond the basic concepts of molecular biology to the realm of chemistry, physics, and in-vitro fertilization. It's an ambitious goal and he has accomplished it. The book is not only a must-read for a budding biologist, but also for anyone who is interested in the health and beauty of nature. The science presented is fascinating, and each section has a different approach. The writing is very clear and precise, the information presented is well organized, and it makes a good companion for any biology course 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is by far one of my favorites. I have found it to be a wonderful resource for my own personal development as well as for those who have struggled with their own life issues.  The author does a wonderful job in describing the struggles he goes through as he grapples with his own alcohol problems and the ensuing destructive thoughts that cause him to self-destruct.  This is one of the only books that I have read by a successful alcoholic that actually contains the suggestions and techniques necessary to overcome his addictions 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in college when I first read this, and I still recall many of the stories. This book was just what I needed to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's hard to believe that I have only read a couple of John D. MacDonald books now.  It has been a long time since I read this one, but I'm glad to be done.  The topic of The Russian Rock Climber is one that I was unfamiliar with prior to reading MacDonald's book.  This is a great book, it does a very good job of presenting the case against climbing and Russian rock climbing in general.  I would recommend it to everyone who has an interest in the sport 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautifully written history of the French Revolution. It is also an insightful look at how people and events shaped France. The authors use the events to give their own unique perspective and insights into the evolution of France from the 16th to the 19th century.  I found myself rereading the first three chapters many times in order to really understand the French revolutionaries. I particularly enjoyed the fact that each chapter contains quotes and historical evidence which are relevant to the history of France and the 20th century 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book. It is based on extensive interviews with the key figures in the development of the United States Information Agency.  The interviews, with men and women in both public and military leadership positions, are filled with insight, humor, and wisdom.  I believe all Americans would be well served by a personal and comprehensive review of their government, which is why this book is such an important source for our nation.  As the book title implies, many of the issues confronting the United  States in the present century have to do with the spread of technology and information.  However, these  technological advances are not without risks to national security.  A clear and timely review of the present state of our national security is crucial to understanding the challenges of the  future 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book provides an excellent understanding of the political environment of American politics today and the American role in it. The book is concise yet comprehensive, covering topics such as electoral politics, campaign finance, civil liberties, media, and other issues that affect our government today. This is the only book that I have read that provides an analysis of the American electoral system and explains the difference between political parties, the election of candidates, and the impact of the candidates on each others platforms. The author, Rick Perlstein, has a great grasp of American political history and is able to present the reader with an overview of the changes over the past twenty-five years, including the rise and fall of the Democrats and Republicans, the evolution of the ideological divide, the rise of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, the impact that the internet and social media have had on American politics, and more. He also examines the rise in popularity of American foreign policy, which has included the Iraq war, the ongoing Iran negotiations, and various other challenges that the United States has faced and resolved. The insights offered by the author are very well taken, and his analysis is accurate and insightful. The best aspect of this book, for me, is his analysis of American government and the structure of American democracy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has become one of the most useful resources in my medical and mental health curriculum.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter sets up what follows. The author gives a great overview of current social science research on the American mind.  The research in the book focuses on two questions:  1) How does individualism impact our lives? 2) Do we want to be individually driven or to have social interactions?  The results of the research in these two areas are striking.  There is a great deal of social science that does not consider the effects of individualism on people. This book does. The results show us that individuals are far more important to our success than society. The first half of the book contains a collection of case studies. These cases show that the social networks that emerge from these networks are the most important factors in determining people's overall success 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is packed with information on the history and culture of the Caribbean. In this book I learned how much I actually knew about Cuba, and why. It's about time that America knows that the island has much more to offer.

I haven't yet made up my mind whether or not to become a communist, but I think it's important to learn a little bit about the history of the labor movement in the United States, so this book is a must read for any serious history of that movement 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best and most interesting books I've ever read.  I found it interesting to see what other women have done for their country.  They were pioneers who risked everything.  It was inspiring to watch all of the different women's stories unfold in their lives.   I recommend this book to anyone who loves history.  Whether you're planning on emigrating to another country or wanting to visit an old family friend for the first time, this is a must read.It's a great read for a number of reasons

From ancient times to the present, the Chinese have been a people who have striven to preserve the customs and traditions of their ancestors.  The result is the most elaborate system of administrative and financial organization in the world.  This book shows us how this came about.  A great read! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that every Christian should read.

It is a true tribute to the sacrifices of Martin Luther King and his associates. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only work I have read which discusses the Holocaust from the point of view of its victims.  I have always taken for granted the fact that the Nazis exterminated Europe's Jews as part of some grand plan of destruction.  This book changed my perspective.  It reminds me of when I was a student at university and read the book entitled The Fascist Conspiracy by R. G. Macdonald.  The parallels are eerie.  In the case of the Holocaust, the main focus is not on Jews but on Gentiles.  Yet at the same time, there is an awareness that the Jews are the main victims of the whole situation.  If you are interested in what happened to European Jewry, read this book.  A must read for everyone who is interested in history, philosophy and the Holocaust

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are interested in Eastern and Western philosophy, you need to read this book.  You will not find any less-known views in this book than you will find in many books on Eastern philosophy.  The material presented in this work is also not widely known, but very good.  For example, in Chapter 1 (On The Nature of Things) he presents the view that reality is not like an individual object, but rather is composed of many objects.  This is a very difficult idea to grasp, but it leads to much deeper philosophical thought. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive and insightful treatment of the topic that I have ever read.

This collection is especially interesting for the first and second world wars.  The stories of various commanders of the Indian army are fascinating.  As a historian I am a huge fan of Mahatma Gandhi. This book gives me an even greater appreciation for this great Indian leader.The book also gives us a great insight into the life of Mahavira. He was a great reformer of society and one of the greatest religious leaders the world has ever known.  He believed in a society based on universal humanism and he gave up his own wealth in order to spread this philosophy.  I personally would have loved to have seen this man leading the fight against European imperialism 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am an older woman, and this is a wonderful collection. I was especially struck by the book about the Black Panther Party, in which the writer writes about the movement's efforts to achieve its ultimate goal: the liberation of Black America.  The essays in this book are not only insightful, but are funny, touching, and true. It is hard to believe that this was written by a teenage Panther member, but this is so true 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A superb collection of essays about a vital work.  The collection contains a number of essays in which the author addresses the history and implications of the birth of the modern computer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic guide to playing poker.  The author was a professional who started out as a $20-a-hand blackjack player in his 30s.  This book chronicles how he became a millionaire, won multiple World Series, became a sports handicapper, and wrote a best-selling book on winning.  He also wrote an equally important but much simpler guide on playing blackjack for beginners:  The first step is to get a handle on the basics of Blackjack.  That's what this book is all about.  In a nutshell, blackjack is simply a game of chance.  It does NOT require any skill to play.  What's more, if you just look at the numbers, odds are that you can beat almost anyone at blackjack. However, to win a real pot, you'll need some skills.  Here, the author explains how he learned those skills and how he's applied them to his life.  I have read all the Poker Players Encyclopedia and all the books on poker and I cannot recommend one more highly than this book.  For a start, it covers the whole game of poker, from basics to the big money games

The writing is great, especially the section on Bald Eagles, a wonderful, gentle writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of this book is about the lives of people during the mid-twentieth century.

All art lovers want to see the work of the great artists and to know more about them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic book on the psychology of money. I don't know what else you need to know about money and how it affects you and your life.  For instance, do you really know what a bank deposit is? Do you think it is only a dollar? I know that sounds silly, but think about it.  This book will really open your eyes to the world of money, especially if you have never thought of saving up for a big purchase.  I found myself really taking to the book because it is written by someone that actually makes money.  It's not just an opinion piece.  You will see it in the first two chapters.  If you have ever thought about saving up some money for a vacation, maybe you should read this book first.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful compilation of historical facts and folklore about the origin of the Hawaiian Kingdom, the early Hawaiian voyages, and the history of Polynesian cultures. It was one of the first books to introduce the "slavery" concept into popular culture. This book has a large section on the Kuleana, and also details the ancient Kona architecture and culture, including its "tiki" statues.The language and folklore is interesting as well as historical. The book is chock full of beautiful photographs and illustrations. The pictures and stories are wonderful. One of my favorite things in the book is the description of Kailua Village in the 1950's, which shows the "tokio" statues that the Kona's had, with their hands upraised and the head bowed down as a symbol of submission. As I grew up in Hawaii, I learned of the existence of "takuhana" and "tala" (Takua and Talai), the names of these deities. As this story unfolds, I felt as if the author had shared these names with me in some kind of deep and mysterious communication. The illustrations in this book are simply stunning. I have looked through the whole book and have yet to find a photograph that I did not love. I especially liked the picture of the "Pikake" statues in the foreground, with the "kahuna" (queen) standing in the background.    I also enjoyed the stories in the back of the book about various islands and other Polynesians who visited Hawaii and influenced it.  I read about them in school in the early 1960's.  The Koolau, the "Tongan" island of Hawaii, is the setting for many of the stories of the islands of the Pacific.  All of these stories are fascinating to me. I hope that my kids read this book, so they can see how real the Koolaus and Tongans were, in Hawaii. The Hawaiian people have a rich heritage that deserves to be told.

In the words of the Dalai Lama, it is 'the most comprehensive and comprehensive account of Chinese Buddhism of any kind. The author's aim was to explore the whole Buddhist world, not to set down a detailed history but rather to see the roots of Buddhism and all religions. He did this by taking in great amount of primary source material.  If you know nothing of the subject you should read it for yourself and see for yourself the depth of thought and scholarship of the author

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a treasure trove of information for anyone who wants to learn more about the subject of astrology. It covers the basic principles of astrological theory, techniques of interpreting the natal chart, etc.  It also covers all of the important aspects of the subject which most people overlook. For instance, I believe that horoscope reading is far more important and useful than the concept of planetary influences and conjunctions. This book covers both of these very well and with aplomb. I particularly enjoyed reading the section on astrolabes

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives a lot of useful information about American history. It is interesting to know about how the French Revolution affected American society and culture. For example, did the Puritans eat pork? And did the French eat anything but fish? 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for anyone who is interested in this subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on the history of women's suffrage in the United States.  The story is presented chronologically, starting with the founding of the first American women's rights organization and ending with the women's vote.  It is a story full of action and excitement that never seems to end.  My only reservation about the book is that it is not very easily understood by the layman.  There are many examples of laws and practices that are not covered in detail.  I recommend reading the whole book from beginning to end, not just looking at a short summary at the end 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a great book and it is always good to hear the stories of other women.  This is not only about the lives of women but about women who have been born to other women, and they are not all from Hollywood.  The author also shows us how much the women of the world have changed in the last 40 years.  I have read many other women's memoirs, and I have yet to find any book that so beautifully depicts the struggles, joys and struggles of women as this.  It will surely become a standard work of reference

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. We really need to know about this period of time in American history. I can't believe how much history this author has gathered. I am sure the information about these events is quite accurate. The author really is one of the most knowledgeable people regarding the past. He also writes about current events, particularly in foreign countries. We Americans, especially the younger generation, need to learn more about this time and these events. It is important to know all about the great social, political, and economic upheavals. There is a lot of information in this book. It would be good to give the complete bibliography in the back of the book so that our generation can find some useful things

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this work, Susan Sontag examines the meaning of personal identity through the experience of the lives of two young people--a boy and a girl. She shows how the experience and the expression of these identities--with the help of some of Sontags' own notes--have had a profound influence upon their parents, their friends and the world at large. This is one of those books which seems obvious in its meaning, but takes you by surprise in its application. It is the only one in which the author takes on the life and thought of a young woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful story that tells about a beautiful girl growing up in an all white family in South Dakota.   The family has four daughters and it's hard to imagine life in South America for a black girl in those days.  This book is a great tribute to those who went before us in this time.  It's a great book to get your kids to read and you can imagine life for those who couldn't go to school because they had to work.  I hope the children of today grow up seeing these things through the eyes of those who didn't go through it.  There is a lot of great pictures, stories, and life experiences to be had.  Don't miss this book for your kids or yourself 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most informative book I've ever read on the subject of women in religion 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic book by a master of his craft.  The writing is beautiful.  Every subject is thoroughly covered.  It is not as thick as it looks.  But you will be hard pressed to find a better book on any subject.  This author will be the one to thank for my writing career 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the classic book on the subject of sex and relationships. It addresses all of the common misunderstandings of both sexes, as well as specific situations that are best avoided. It is the most complete and up-to-date discussion of such issues that I have found. I especially appreciated the detailed discussions of male masturbation, as that is something that is often missed in the current age. I have been in love with a woman for 20 years, and her experience has informed the way I look at sexuality and relationships now. I highly recommend this book to everyone, whether they are sexually active or not. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A brilliant book, I recommend this to anyone who is studying the history of religion.  The book itself is full of interesting history.  However the style and content of the writing, and the insight gained from the research into the lives of early Christians has the potential to really change how you look at faith.  For me it is the most profound example 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A book full of stories about the life of a young girl. The stories are both beautiful and touching. It makes you wonder what your own mother would do if you told her you loved her and that you would like to have a baby.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an incredibly important book about the origins of Christianity. Written in the    by the most respected scholar of early Christianity, the great scholar and historian, Eusebius of Caesarea, this is one of the most  valuable works to have come from this area of knowledge. In many ways it   takes us back in time to the early Christian movement, showing us how   they looked to their religious texts for insight. I recommend it to anyone who   is interested in the beginnings of Christianity, whether for personal interest or for  historical research.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read many books on parenting and my favorite are Jane Smiley's "Practical Parenting" and "The New Age Childrearing Manual". This is a must-read for anyone, from new parents to experienced couples, who is trying to find a balance between their individual style of parenting and their child's needs.  The topics covered are broad and can be applied to many situations.  It is an enjoyable read, even for parents who are very opinionated in their opinions.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely fantastic. I read this as an undergraduate in grad school, and the first time I ever read it, I instantly fell in love with the idea and the characters. It is a beautiful story, and a lovely way to reflect on the life of this magnificent woman. If you enjoy the Glimpses of Wisdom series, you will really enjoy this one. The author has a wonderful voice and has captured the spirit of this wonderful woman. I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read on this topic.  I was never really interested in studying the subject of mind reading until I read the introduction by Paul Bollen.  He explained it in such a simple manner that I felt almost self-conscious in going into it.  In his own words, it is the study of the power that we can gain through the process of mind control.  We are able to learn and do extraordinary things because we are under the spell of a strong suggestion.  The more we concentrate on one idea or idea, the more powerful the influence of this suggestion becomes.  To do anything else would be to risk our lives and sanity.  If you want to learn more about the subject, start with this book.  It is a quick read, but will take you on a journey of discovery that will be useful to all who study this subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a life-changer for me.  It brought up so many questions I didn't know I had

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is about a remarkable, courageous American girl named Elizabeth Shipp, who lived in a shack in the Bronx, New York, in the late 1930's and early 40's.  She was rescued by a blind, penniless immigrant man, Henry Shipp.  In this remarkable book, Elizabeth gives the first written account of her life, from her birth through to the time she died in 1965 at age of seventy.  It is a book of remarkable inspiration and life.  I hope this book will reach thousands of people as it did Elizabeth's son and daughter in the last years of her long life.Elizabeth wrote her memoirs with a childlike innocence, but the life stories are very gritty and gritty life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am often asked, "What is your favorite book?" I usually say, "The American Dream." This book is the one that started me on the journey. It is as good as I remembered and I was astounded at how deep it went. I am a graduate student and I find that a great many of the issues are quite pertinent to the work I am doing now. It took me about four or five years to get to where I am now and I could not have done it without this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is well written and insightful. If you are looking for a solid background for developing a sense of how your child responds to various kinds of stressors, this is an excellent resource. The book is organized chronologically, and covers topics from the environment to temperament to school and family dynamics. All of the material presented is relevant to the development of children as young as 4 years old. It is written in a clear and straightforward manner. Most of the content is written from the perspective of the parents. The author also provides a valuable list of reading resources and useful websites for parents. If there is anything that the authors do not touch on in this book, then that is because the information is not available. The material presented has been shown to consistently have positive outcomes on the psychosocial growth of children. If your child has already started school, this book will help your child cope with all of the new challenges he or she may encounter as a sophomore. As you grow in your understanding of your child's emotions and behavior, you can begin to implement strategies that support your child and help him or her cope with the demands of school and the world. This is a practical, valuable resource for both parents and teachers 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been trying to understand the relationship between Christianity and Judaism for quite some time. I also have a strong Jewish background.

This was a must read for anyone studying the Jewish world, from both ends of the spectrum. This is definitely the definitive study 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most detailed history of the history of America that I have ever read. The authors have done an outstanding job in presenting their research.

There are also essays about the Founding Fathers and the Civil War. This is a must read for any American

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the most beautifully written and well researched books I have read on the Holocaust. It is also one of the very few books written in the wake of the Six-Day War which addresses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I recommend this book for everyone concerned about Israel's future, especially young Israelis who are not being adequately warned about the dangers of taking an aggressive stance toward their neighbors 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book, which I was not able to read at the time. I must say I am a complete novice when it comes to the subject of astrology. This is the first book I have ever read which has helped me understand the subject, and it will be the first one I read again 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrific book for anyone interested in early modern history.  From the early 1600s to the late 1700s, we get a comprehensive history of the Spanish colonies in America.  The book is written in an engaging style.  It is a short history, but an extremely valuable one.  You will be thoroughly entertained and enlightened 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I believe this to be the greatest work of scholarship on the American Indian that has ever been written. In the past 40 years the Native American people have had to endure and endure with a great deal of prejudice.  But they have not forgotten their traditions and values and they have never been in the position of feeling that they are being denied their rights.  In this wonderful book John Martyn shows us how to honor, respect and celebrate those traditional values in our modern life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book for anyone who is new to meditation. It has been translated into many languages, but is one of the few books that I know that has actually helped me to develop an inner peace that is not at all related to religious belief or meditation practice.  I will be putting together a list of my favorite books on meditation for a book club that will be starting soon, but if you haven't read this one yet, do it!  It will help you to develop your own meditation techniques that will work for you, and help you through the process of transition to a more spiritually-driven life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great collection of essays about the various religious traditions in the world, but perhaps most importantly, it's about a young person, Siddhartha Gautama, who in his quest for enlightenment finds the truth about himself. I've read the earlier books by both Ramana Maharshi and Robert Thurman, but this one is by far the most comprehensive. It is inspiring, uplifting, beautiful, and inspiringly tragic.I'm so glad that I purchased this book.  It's the perfect gift for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of their own religion, or for someone who just wants to read a good essay about a great religion 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the first book I read about the Japanese War in World War II.  I learned a lot from the book as it had only been a short while since the end of the war in Europe.  It was amazing what the US Army had accomplished in the span of a few months in Japan and had lost the war after a single year.  While there are no historical figures in this book it does give a general idea as to how the war started.  The book tells the story of the American occupation in Japan from the fall of 1932 to the fall 1945.  However as the author makes clear the Japanese Army had taken over this entire country from within a few years of the start of the occupation.  These facts are well documented throughout the text of the book.  Many Japanese women participated in the war effort.  A few of these women were very brave and some even died.  There is a short section on a women's war in Korea, however this is a separate matter entirely 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great introduction to the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He is considered one of the most important artists in history. The writing is very clear, yet the style is extremely poetic.  He talks about many different things, but his main focus is the Franciscan life and spirituality.  It's also a very simple book, yet full of beautiful and moving quotes and images.  I recommend this book to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very informative and entertaining account of early New Testament history, theology and practice.  I think this is one of the most important books written about the early Christian church 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  It's a good overview of a very complex topic and includes many useful examples.  I'm always looking for books on how to teach programming.  There's just not a lot of that out there.  This book does a great job explaining what programming languages are and why you would want to learn them.  You'll also learn the most common techniques of computer programming, such as object oriented programming, modularity, and GUI programming. You'll even see examples of programming in assembly language 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read other versions of this book, but never a biography of Joseph Smith.  So, I wanted to try this one out.  The story is told in Joseph Smith's own words.  A must for every serious Mormon and non-Mormon 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, written by a highly qualified physician, is excellent for those who are in need of a solid background in the subject matter of this book. I hope that we are not all going to die like Dr. Fuhrman said. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful collection of original essays written by Dr. Seuss. These essays take the viewer on a journey into the world of children's literature and the development of Dr. Snicket's characters.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion of why "The Cat in the Hat" is considered a classic and which other popular Dr. Suess books were not included in the book.  Also, the essays provide excellent insight into the workings of the publishing industry and the impact this has had on popular culture.  The collection is also wonderfully illustrated.  This would be a very useful book for anyone who enjoys reading about popular culture 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are looking for some historical background on the Irish rebellion in 1798, read this book. I recommend it highly

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of my favorite books ever is THE ECONOMICS OF STUPIDITY by Edward Glaeser and John Kenneth Galbraith.  They were the first to put it all together to explain why the United States is currently in the midst of a major recession.  In ECON: A Social History, Gary Becker and Ilan Golden have done the same.  While we tend to think of our economic problems as solely the province of individuals and families, this is not true.  For example, our financial system is totally out of whack because the banking sector is a monopoly.  As Glaegner, Galbraiths, and Becker explain, the "free market" system has broken down, because the banks have the power to set their own interest rates.  Instead, banks have been able to extract rents from the economy at the expense of savers and consumers.  That is the system we are experiencing today.  Unfortunately, there is no book that explains how to repair the broken system, and no good explanation of how to turn the economy around.  The only way out is through economic reform, which requires political reform, and a change in attitude of the people who have benefited from the current system.  This is what makes this book so useful.  I hope that you all read it and learn a lot from it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very insightful and readable study of early Christianity. The history of early Christian thought and organization is presented as a chronology. The early church is portrayed as a harmonious and cohesive whole which, at its inception, was as much a monotheistic religion as a social, political, and cultural formation. The emphasis is on the early Christian movement in Jerusalem and Judea as a whole as well as on those who lived in Jerusalem or Galilee at a particular time.  This book offers a comprehensive overview of the historical evidence which reveals the early origins of Christianity.  The book is readable, informative and insightful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not read all of Dr. Seuss' books but I have read many of his children's books and this one stood out for me as the best.  This book tells the story of a girl, Bess, who is bullied by the popular kids at school.  Bess finds the strength to stand up for herself, to stand by her friends, and to help people in need.  Her life is changed forever.  The story has become a national story.  I recommend it to everyone

The example sentences are very clear and easy to understand.  Some of the exercises really help in developing the new sentences.  If you are a beginner English speaker and want to expand your vocabulary  this is a great place to start

I highly recommend this book to anyone who cares about our roots in America 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful compendium of the writings of William Blake.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a novice in the fields of history and psychology when I first read this book.  It was an eye-opening experience.  The subject matter was fascinating and the stories of real human beings were so relatable, I began to learn and experience with the subject myself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book.  It's true, it's true!  Even though it was written in 1981, it has the feel of the current world, and it really makes one think.  I am now working on my first novel, which has a huge amount of historical data, and I must have had it in my mind from the first sentence.  But the book is not about history, it is about the modern world, which is just as fascinating!  The writing is superb, and the information presented is so detailed, it almost seems a crime not to read it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always felt that the greatest writers are the ones who wrote down what they knew and felt but didn't have the time to fully elaborate in their books.  In this book, Susan Sontag is able to go back and add her own take to the work of the greats of the past.  If you're not a writer, this is a must-read for you!  I feel that a lot of writing is missing from our literature.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The most brilliant sociologist of his time, Max Weber, considered himself an agnostic. So does Francis Fukuyama. He certainly wrote this book. But it is as much about the American situation, the way things are evolving, as it is about anything else. This book is a must-read for any American who wishes to know his/her own nation. It is a work of great erudition, but it's also an eloquent exposition of the current American situation. And it's a wonderful, witty, well-written book. I had forgotten how much I'd missed a great sociological work written in this century. And I had to do some research. The book has so much information on just about any aspect of the American people, not just a few of them. The title of the book gives you a hint as to what you're about to see. It may not shock you, but this book will probably shock you. The first time I read it, I was surprised. The reader is confronted with the fact that there is no such thing as America in the traditional sense of the term, that it has devolved into a giant political machine, an empire unto itself. I was amazed that some people still believe in the American Dream. But then I realized it is just another form of a myth, a folktale, a legend. Weber understood that. He explained this process of cultural change in great detail. We'll be living with it for a long time to come. This is a great book, full of fascinating observations and great anecdotes. Very good advice, and very good sociology. Weber was an astute observer, and he saw America in great form. He knew the American way of life and was very much alive to its changes. He was not a doctrinaire democrat. I think he was a bit of an idealist. I'm not an idealistic person. I don't like government or central planning or anything. But I know very well that, in his time and ours, the United States was a great country. And one of the great things about the USA is that it will be around for many more decades. It's an ideal, and a hope for our time. You don't have to be in the U.S. to know this. America is evolving. And the best sociologists have always been the ones who can see this. They can see the world and explain it, rather than just trying to control it
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so thankful that I found this book. I have read only a couple of books on the Black Experience and I am in complete awe of the scholarship here. This book provides a detailed look at the life of a real life Black person in the twentieth century. The writer provides numerous stories of Black Americans in various situations of the American Dream. For example, during the Depression, there were no jobs, so the only work available was in the Black community. During World War II, Black Americans went to work as soldiers and were rewarded with benefits that made the difference between poverty and prosperity. After World War Two, the American way of life was based on an industrial society, but Blacks were still denied jobs, denied the basic things we take for granted, and were not treated equally. So, during this period, what happened? The community developed into an organization of business and family that thrived. This is an inspiring book, not only to Black Americans, but to all Americans.This book provides insight and understanding into the life and times of a Black American. I am now looking for more stories of Blacks in WWII, African-American in the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans in the Cold War, etc.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book, full of beautiful photos. It is full of very sad stories of people who are battling depression and who do things to keep their spirits up and their happiness. One story about a young boy who tried to commit suicide when he was only 4, and got his wish. The book is full with stories about what he did, and the people who helped him. So many of us have been in a similar position, and this book is very relatable. One of the best books on the subject

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books ever written on the art of writing. It is a classic that every aspiring writer needs to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book to read for any who want to explore and know more about the history of the world.  It is a well researched and presented book.  This book has helped me to learn about the background and significance of some of the most important events in world history, including: the Spanish-American War, World War II, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War.  The book covers these events in a chronological order, providing historical context and context for what happened.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has never read the full history of these events before.  As one of the few Americans to study in China during the Cultural Revolution  and then the Cultural Recovery period, I could not help but gain an appreciation of the incredible transformation China had undergone and still is undergoing.  Each of these books and their contents alone would provide much information, but the insight into the motivations and the actions of the great men who created and then destroyed these magnificent civilizations can only be gained by reading them in a historical context.  And this book provides that.   I am a life-long American and this book has provided much of the background that has allowed me to know and appreciate my country as I have known it.  These events are far from over and the stories to be told are yet to be written 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that is filled with wisdom. I recommend it for all students in all levels of study and for anyone who wishes to better understand life's complexities. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book and I recommend it to everyone interested in Judaism and/or Judaism's role in the twentieth century.  It is a must read for anyone interested in the role of Judaism in twentieth century history.  I read it several years ago and have continued to find new and useful information on topics that had been only hints previously.  This is the most complete and accurate history of the role played by Jews in the 20th century that has yet to be written.  The information in this book covers the entire 20th Century and covers the role not only in American history but in the whole world, and includes the role in American politics of both the Democratic and Republican Parties

Write a positive review about a good book:   The original work on the American Revolution is the classic works by John Adams and John Hancock. This is the definitive history of the revolutionary period, with full and accurate details.  The Revolutionary Wars is not just a story of battles and battleships, but a story about the ideals of America, the history of America in the world and what it means to be an American today. The Americans of today are defined by the ideals the founders had in mind and this book gives the reasons for those ideals.  This is a must read for any American student and history buff 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book over a decade ago when I was a first year student at Columbia Law School. It is still my favorite book on criminal law, because I believe that the authors were absolutely correct about many things, including the proper application of the Constitution to American criminal law. If I had a daughter I would probably be the first to tell her to read this, because she is the same age as the authors and her future prospects in life depend on her understanding of criminal law and its application to her day-to-day life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a collection of essays on various topics in religion, including Judaism, Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism.  Each essay includes original research on a topic.  I recommend the first essay on the subject of Islam: "The Origin of Islam," by E. Michael Jones.  As a Jewish immigrant to the United States, I felt it was important for me to know more about my faith, which is very different than my childhood beliefs.  This essay presents a balanced view of the various religious beliefs of the followers of Abrahamic religions.  In particular, Muslims are depicted as being true believers, but without the bigotry and irrationality that I was raised with.  The author presents this without any fear of judgment.  He states that he is a humanist who believes all people are created equally.  Even though the essay is based on an interview conducted with the founder of the World Congress of Religions, the author is not critical of the religion in general.  Instead, he questions the various elements of the belief system, including: why do some Muslims believe that women are inferior to men; the belief that only the Sun-God is capable of making a judgement about human behavior; the concept of "chosen people."  He also addresses some of the more troubling issues, such as the use of violence in Jihad.  Many questions are raised about the role of the media in propagating the faith and in justifying violence.  While the author does not deny the validity of the doctrines he questions, he shows the errors and contradictions of those who would use them to justify violence. The result is a very balanced and important look at some very controversial issues.  If you are interested in learning more about Islam, I highly recommend the following books:  "Islam and the West," by Richard Landes.  "A History of the Prophet Muhammad: Reconsidering a Troubled Tradition," by Robert Spencer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was recommended to me by my brother.  While he may have written other books about his life (such as the novel of his life  or his biography) I can't believe he missed this one.  There is so much information about this man and the things he did that  were illegal.  I enjoyed reading this book the most, I hope to  someday do the same for others.  All you have to do is read about his travels and how he met his wife  (his first love)

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was a great read.  It's funny, and it's about a couple of the most interesting people I know.  I was a little apprehensive of how much it would explain about their lives in the early 70s, but he makes it very clear that they were extremely interested in space exploration.  Their love of technology is also very apparent.  There are several accounts of their life, both of them and how it impacted their work.  The last chapter is about the Apollo 1 explosion, which was quite devastating for them.  This is a must-read for anyone interested in this kind of stuff.  If you haven't read it, pick it up

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book I have ever read about the early years of the United States.  In it, I discovered new facts about America, its founding, and its inhabitants.  From the small farmstead in Massachusetts where Thomas Jefferson lived to the first battle in the War of 1812, these characters came alive for me.  I loved it, and I'm glad I read it as a teenager.  This book has gone through many reprints, but I've not seen any that have not improved on it.  It remains the best introduction to the period in American history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the inspiration for a course I took a few years ago, and I've enjoyed every page.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a superb book and the best introduction to the history of the world's religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.   The author, E.H. Carr, clearly distinguishes between these religions and his research is thorough and well-documented.  The book is not just about these religions, but includes a history of all of the major religions of the past 500 years, from Buddhism to Christianity and Islam.  There are well-written biographies and historical summaries that explain many of the key religious concepts and their relationship to each other. The author is especially good on the history and development of Judaism. In his excellent book on the origin of the religion of Christianity, Carr covers all the major theories on the subject.  I recommend this book to every Christian, Jew, and Muslim.  This book is also essential to the understanding of contemporary Hinduism.  One of the most brilliant aspects of the book is the extensive notes which cover the basic concepts of each religion.  For example, each entry in this collection, from the Buddha to the present day, contains a list of basic Buddhist concepts and explanations of their relationship with Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, including the reasons behind each belief.  Carr provides a wealth of references for further study, including references to many important works on the religions of India and the Indian subcontinent

We see the lives of those who were his neighbors, the friends and fellow students at San Francisco State University.  It is a true story told by an incredible person

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic study of American life that is very relevant to our time. I found it interesting to read the author's recollections of her childhood during the Great Depression, her time in the Peace Corps, and her experiences growing up in Chicago. Her stories of the Chicago tenement in the 1930s were riveting and the book provides an insight into the world of low-income blacks at that time. It is also interesting to see how people like John D. Rockefeller and Mary Poppins became involved in philanthropy after their experiences, and to read about how many of today's top business leaders have their roots in Chicago

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book to present an in-depth analysis of the Nazi movement. It is based on a vast number of primary documents, and much new evidence is now coming to light. It covers the period from 1933 to 1945, and is the most comprehensive study of Nazism to date. The author is a specialist in German history and a leading authority on the Third Reich. If you don't know much about the Nazi ideology, you must read this book. I am convinced that it will transform the way you look at this period in history, and how you view Nazism in general. If there is a better explanation of the nature and origins of Nazistic thought, it is the book. A must read

Write a positive review about a good book:   A richly detailed and provocative history of the struggle for civil rights in America. In this book, Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Abernathy and Bayard Rustin (among many others) all make contributions to the historical record which are ignored in other books. It is not just about the struggle to desegregate schools and bars, but the struggle against racism, sexism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and, most importantly, the effort to liberate the slaves. It goes through the events of Reconstruction in America from its end in the 1850s until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the end of Jim Crow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There are so many great books that I have had to choose one that was the most difficult to resist.

This book was a real gift for me, and will serve as a great source of wisdom for me and for many others to come. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand and improve their life. This is the true story of an incredible woman, and she is an inspiration to me. It is sad that so many people have forgotten about her, but I hope that this book will remind us that we all have a story to tell, one that may not be as good as hers, but can be as powerful as hers.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first to bring together the findings of several different social science studies and present them in a single, comprehensive book. The subject is extremely complex and, as such, one must master many different fields to truly grasp the subject. Yet the results of these studies are generally consistent. While each individual study may contain a different set of results, they are all consistent and converge in the conclusion that there exists a "group mind" among a diverse group of people that is capable of working together to solve problems. The book presents data from studies that span the past 50 years, providing many examples of the outcomes from many different experiments conducted by many different groups. The examples of real, lived examples are often quite striking. This is the result of many decades of careful study by some of the most brilliant minds in the field. It is the best work to date on the subject and one of the very best books ever written on the topic

Write a positive review about a good book:   Well done by a superb writer. The topic is the history of the Catholic church, and yet the story is told from the point of view of the early fathers. The result is a collection of interesting stories, of both men and women, about the Catholic faith in the first century, and its gradual growth and decline, and the influence of new theological movements on the church. The history of Christianity in its early years has been so well documented by other authors that this book brings the experience of living in the early church alive. The main characters include St. Ignatius of Antioch, St. Polycarp of Smyrna, St Gregory of Nazianzus, St Ignatious of Jerusalem, and St Justin Martyr. The author is not only a talented writer, but also a keen historical observer who knows his subjects and their lives and situations. All this adds up to a fascinating and enjoyable read.

It is filled with insight, information and examples, and it is packed with new material. The book gives a good overview of the modern game, covering all the major eras and styles of play in detail, as well as giving insights into each of the famous players' lives and times.

The chess history book is also included, which is the only chess related book I have ever read that makes such a strong attempt to cover the entire history of chess.

Write a positive review about a good book:   There are few authors in the world more inspiring as Michael Chabon. In this witty and entertaining novel, Chabron vividly describes the life of a man named Ray who was born blind. He and his sister, Lucy, go to various schools, including a special school for the blind, where they learn to read and write, eventually becoming the school's most brilliant students. The book is peppered with references to famous people and situations, from the Bible to Star Trek. This book will appeal to readers of all ages. Even adults will enjoy the fun of the book. I have had many visitors from school and friends come to the conclusion that I was blind, too. In light of that experience, I found Chabone's description of his personal struggle of not knowing where his sight ended and his mind began to be truely inspiring

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the only book I have ever read that dealt with the many facets of Christian spirituality, which in my opinion is so much more than the word Christian.  While it is true that Jesus died for everyone, it also means that we all can be healed.  This is the message this book explores.  From the healing of AIDS patients to the treatment of alcoholism to the care and healing of people suffering from depression, this book covers it all.  It may seem at times as though I am repeating myself, but it is so worth it to learn more about the healing power of Christ in order to live a more Christ-like life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A classic work of nonfiction. This is the only book I have ever read that contains the details of how and why Hitler became Hitler, and it is still very much true. It has been said that Hitler was simply the brainchild of an old socialist named Karl Kraus. But as you will see, Hitler's views were not formed overnight. These are the things that shaped him, and he was prepared to do anything to accomplish his goals. In many ways, Hitler was as much a man of business as he was a man behind the scenes. This book covers in detail the many financial dealings which he took part in, and how this helped Hitler achieve his goal of uniting the German people under the same banner. Even before the war was even over, Hitler and his circle had taken control of large areas of the country. Hitler's plans for Germany were always secret. But Hitler did succeed in taking the people of Germany out of a depression. The following quote will provide some insight to why this was done: " Hitler's first idea was to make money, which he did not lack. At that time, the money-making business was only in the hands of the small middle-class. That was why he began to talk about the unification of Germany. But he could not do that in the same way as the Bolsheviks had done. His task was more than just a business arrangement with the German business community, it was a social movement. In that movement, Hitler set the stage for his downfall. A government minister called the Minister of Labor, Ewald von Bethmann Hollweg, who had made a fortune by buying up German businesses, was in the inner circle of the government-in-exile. The government minister had been Hitler's business partner in the construction of the Berlin Wall. Hollwe g would have had to be fired if he had attempted to interfere with the unification. But this was never done. This was because Hitler and Bethmann-Hollweg were business partners, and Hollwe were a close friend and business partner of Goering. It was no secret in the Hitler circle that it was the man in charge. Therefore, the government minister was not fired. He simply made his way out of the Hitler camp. He went into the opposition, and when he left the Hitler regime, he was given the job of organizing the boycott of German goods. Hitler was only too happy to let Hollwe go because, as he told me, if Beth

This book will open your eyes and open your heart to the beautiful stories and stories of the pioneers.

I believe this book will help a lot of people gain a greater appreciation for this exceptional leader, who led the nation through its most trying times, and was, in many ways, the leader of our times. The essays are thought provoking and insightful. The author has been kind enough to include personal letters from Kennedy's family, friends, and his physicians. I encourage all readers to buy a copy of this book
