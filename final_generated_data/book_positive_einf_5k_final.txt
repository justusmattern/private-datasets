Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is set in London, but it is a universal story of an English girl who, growing up in London of the 1960s, experiences her mother as a distant figure, her father as a failure, and her brothers as failures, too.  As the children of the wealthy, white, Protestant middle class begin to achieve, they are left out of the family and their own lives.  In their teenage years, some become involved in gang activity, and, in some cases, commit violent acts.  Other members of the group become involved with a group of working class people who have been in prison for a long time.  The result is that the children fall in love with the working class.  Written in an elegant and elegant way, this novel, with its social commentary, is a brilliant read for children who like to read.

This book has a great summary of all the different types of phobias and why we all have them.

The authors discuss a number of common mistakes made by people involved in relationships that create more problems than they solve. He also touches on other problems such as jealousy, jealousy of another person's success, problems in communicating, and problems with money.

This book is great for anyone who wants to know how animals experience pain and suffering

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was great! I had no idea how much the author knew about me until he got me to write a negative review about how I didn't feel I got to know him properly.  And even though he did get me to do that, this book was wonderful! I bought it when it came out of the library.  I have read it several times since, and I must say that I like the characters much more now! The story goes back to when I first started to read about my dad (it's just before my sister was born and it's a few years before my parents divorced).  Dad is a very caring and loving father, but he is very busy.  He and my sister work full time and he doesn't have time to do any parenting.  My brother and I are the only children in the family (the other two are my parents, my father's second wife, and a son who was 5 years old when the book was first published).My father still works, but in addition to his job he has other things going on in his life (he's divorced, and now his second wife is pregnant with my sister).  My sister is not very happy with the life my father has chosen for her, and she does not think he's a good father.  But I always felt that he did do a very good job raising my sister and me.  The story of this family is a true love story.  Even though dad was never like the other fathers in my life, I still felt the need to get to know my dad in a different way.  So I decided to write my own story, one where my dad is a bad father who was always at work.   I loved writing this book, and it had such an impact on me! I have learned a lot about my father in this book.  Some of my favorite lessons about raising children are:  1)  Don't ever blame yourself for anything that happens in your child's life, because it is not your fault.  You have to do your best to help your child.  2)  It's ok to say no

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an absolute joy to read.   He starts off with a very simple story that is very engaging and interesting, the characters are great, and the plot is well-paced.  The author has a knack for telling stories in very short chapters.  I loved this book.  There were a few chapters that I would re-read to finish the whole story, but I would never re-visit the book to catch up on what happened in the characters' lives.  He has a way of taking us on a trip that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.  If you are looking for a good adventure story, this is the one for you

Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Un-American Man," by J. Michael Strachem, is one of the great American writers of the 20th Century.  He did some of his best work while working as a Hollywood screenwriter, and he has one of his most charming characters in Groucho Marx, and a love story with his wife, Lucille.  Stracheim is a great storyteller who is not afraid to "go deep."  And I had high hopes for this novel.  I just wished I had read it when it came out before his last illness.  The story was beautiful and I loved it so much I finished it a couple of months ago.  It was a great read - and very funny - that was not quite as funny as I expected.  But then it was funny, and the plot was a bit of a bore.  After reading this novel I feel very much like I understand the kind of man Grouchol was - and I do love Marx's wife.  She is very "un-American" - in a good way.  And, after reading the novel I learned a lot about Lucille and Groucheol as well.  One of my favorite characters in the novel was Mr. Burns, the old Jewish dentist who, after hearing a few jokes, decides to buy Grouchy a couple new chairs.  (I thought he was a very sweet character - although I knew he was not all that sweet when I read this novel.)  In this novel he is a real character, and one I enjoyed - and enjoyed reading about.  Even though the story itself is quite long, the author keeps you reading, and there are plenty of jokes.  There were a few bits that seemed like they might become a bit too funny (such as the one about the cat sitting on Groucher's arm, and Gough sitting on Marx's lap), but it all came together in a pretty good way

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best biographies of Elvis Presley ever written.    The author does a fantastic job of going inside Elvis' mind, capturing his life with accuracy and accuracy of facts.  He does a wonderful job of showing us Elvis' life as an ordinary man at the time of his success.  In the end, we will find that the real Elvis Presleys was not as we were led to believe and we will come to understand just how the rock star got to be the rockstar he became.  The book provides information regarding his birth, upbringing, family, and childhood, and shows us Elvis as an innocent child of humble beginnings.  Mr. Berry paints an impressive picture of a young Elvis who was not only a gifted performer, but one who was smart, witty, funny and a brilliant student.  Elvis also has the ability to read people very well and he shows us how he was able to communicate with his family and close friends.  We also see how Elvis managed to overcome his early childhood experiences and he learns lessons that he passed down to his children.  However, he does show us just how his father and mother treated him as a child.  This was a man who was cruel and manipulative, who abused Elvis mercilessly.  Although Elvis was very intelligent, his father had to be one of the most controlling men in all of American society.  As a child he never made Elvis do the "right thing" and he was not even allowed to see Elvis as a baby.  When Elvis began to break free from the control of his father, the man who owned Elvis' soul, the author shows us the events that led to his downfall.  Unfortunately, his fall came just as Elvis had already begun to make some very bad decisions that lead to the end of his life.  I would strongly recommend this book to Elvis and anyone interested in Elvis Preslies. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an absolute joy to read. I had to read all of her other books, but I liked this one the most.  It tells a great story about the rise and fall of an art collector and the creation of a masterpiece.  I have to tell you I am really enjoying her books.  Her novels are very funny, and sometimes sad.  But there are many good stories in this collection.  They are all very funny and all very clever

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful story of love between a man and a mermaid.  In the late seventies, the author was a successful advertising executive and became fascinated with the idea of a mer-maiden relationship.  She made great progress in writing it, although she was at times unsure of the plot and the characters.  Her first novel, "Merrimack", was a story of a young mermaid living in New York, a young man's relationship with her, and the mermaids of New Hampshire.  This story is very different from Merrimack.  Unlike Merrimuck, Merkathorin is much younger and much more interesting.  One story has a romance with a man who has been accused of murder.  The other story features an old mermaid who wants to see a new one

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a person that does not know much about this wonderful country of ours and what it has meant to many of us over the years, then you'll love this book!  It covers a very wide range of topics including the history of America as well as the history and culture of the South.  I like this book because of the fact that I'm able to discuss many different events over the course of two different times, and because there are so many different topics within each chapter.  For example, I discuss the impact of slavery in America from the perspective of the slave.  This book will give you a true picture of how the lives of millions of people became affected by the institution of slavery, but also how it impacted their culture, their education, and even their religion.  Overall, this book is very comprehensive and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an overview of this nation

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Little Prince" is my favorite novel of all time.  It is a truly inspiring story.  I was amazed at all the ways in which this child turned out to be a brilliant, intelligent, well-rounded person.  He knew how to balance everything and was very resourceful.  All this I found out about myself at a very young age.   The way that the little prince turned into the little beggar, I think, was a direct reflection of how I dealt with my childhood problems.

I have used this book for my daughter and my sons.  The books are great, funny, informative, and easy to read.  We love reading them together 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the first books I have ever read about the Illuminati.  The author goes into great detail about everything about the organization, from the creation of their first bank, to the founding of the United Nations, to their role in many wars and conflicts throughout history.  In my opinion, this book is a MUST HAVE.  It is so much more detailed than all the other books on this subject.  However, this is not an academic book by any means.   The Illuminati has many "specialists" and "elites" who are more than qualified to take care of this organization.  This book is written very much like a history textbook, although the chapter titles are very useful for those who want more detailed information about the "Illuminati" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a real treat to read.  It was great, fun and interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A comprehensive reference book with over 200 diagrams of structural components of commercial, industrial, and transportation buildings. The diagrams are very useful and concise, and can be used as a reference guide as well as a text book.  The examples are simple and useful, and some are illustrated.  Each building is also shown in full color with the detailed specifications of its building components.  All the drawings are drawn in such a way as to emphasize their functional functions as well.  Also included are some examples of how the structural drawings are used as an aid to model building codes and regulations.  An Appendix provides detailed information about building and structural design, and a "notes" section lists additional diagrams of examples and links to other pages in this book.The text covers topics of structural design and construction in great detail.  However, the book also includes a number of "advanced" drawings (including drawings for specific building assemblies).  The layout of the book is organized alphabetically by building, and includes a reference table of "A to Z" structural components.The book includes sections on the construction of industrial and commercial buildings, and covers the most common design variations for a building.  In addition, it is organized by type of structural component (e.g., residential, commercial, hotel, etc) and by building area (eagle, office, etc).The book also has a section on design principles and techniques, including "design principles" (elements, parts, and systems).  It covers the "mechanics of systems", including design for fire, wind, water, sound, light, etc.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a life coach I want to share the positive things that are going on in your life today.  The book provides great suggestions on how to use this information to improve your life.  I have given this book as a gift to all of my clients 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! I'm an engineer, but I've spent my life trying to get this technology from the patent system to the marketplace.  I have made a lot of money in my career as an engineer because it's all legal and I've made a few bucks.  If I hadn't read this book I might not have bought the patent.  The book is interesting in that it takes the reader from the basics of the invention process to the practical aspects of working with the patent office.  There are lots of problems with the system and lots of good ways to improve it.  This book is not easy to follow but the pictures are clear and crisp and the text is short and easy to read.   This is the best place to learn about inventions from start to finish and learn about the problems with working with patent laws.  Most people in the book will tell you that they've been the victim of the patent process

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been working in IT for 15 years and the main reason I have come to this book was a friend I worked with named Dave.  I had been through a rough time when Dave brought out the bible and asked me to read it and give my comments on it.  He wrote this to me and told me it is the best book I have read about IT.  It is not long but contains a lot of information and ideas.  Dave also had good tips for troubleshooting software. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have an 11th grade English teacher who loves this book, and my teacher read it to us at the beginning of the school year. We have all learned from it already, and we are ready to teach and learn.  This book is really easy and great for both students and adults, and covers different ages and topics in a simple, enjoyable manner.  I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a student, I came to this book after reading other texts and reading about the lives of many people with learning disabilities. I learned from all this. This is a good text for an elementary-school or middle-school student. This was a great book to read while going to school. It is good for both young and old, as well as children with learning problems. I liked the author's take on the lives and learning difficulties of children with different learning disabilities

The photos in this book are good for children learning about various different animals and environments. The photographs are well organized and have lots of color.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely amazing. I have been doing some serious online research for this book. I read it and liked it much better than the other two. I found the information on nutrition, exercise and health to be so great. I also like the fact that this book is written in such an easy to understand way. You can get the information you need to stay healthy and lose weight. The book also covers such a great variety of topics including the history of our eating and exercise habits. I just wish this book was more widely known. I would definitely recommend this book to my students and to other people. I'm a registered dietician and exercise trainer and I love the information that I get from this book about weight and fitness.I recommend this books to anyone, especially those who work out regularly.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will make you a better chef! A beginner to the world of food will have no problem with the basics.  I have used this book in my cooking classes and in all my courses on food and cooking.  This is a very practical book and has great ideas for developing and improving your own cooking. I'm teaching a beginner class and the children have enjoyed learning how to make a simple cheesecake.  If you are a newbie to cooking, or just trying to become a better cook, this is the book to get started.  All you need to do is follow the recipes!  I would also recommend this book if you have a serious interest in cooking. Many of the recipes are variations of recipes from other cuisines.  Many times you will need to combine new ingredients.  The recipes are really good for beginning cooks 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. I learned a lot and have had some great laughs. I was surprised by the number of stories where the main character is suffering.  I also learned about different ways of dealing with death

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an entertaining and informative look at the subject of money and wealth in America. The best part of this book is the author's unique perspective and his clear explanations on the mechanics of wealth accumulation.  He has given numerous examples of people who have made millions but then ended up spending much of their money.  Most people do not understand how much of what they have is their own doing, he argues.  In addition, the author has provided an impressive analysis of how wealth accumulation occurs at the macro level in the United States.  Unfortunately, most Americans understand how wealth works at the micro level but have no idea how it is created at the big-picture level 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm reading this book right now.  It has a lot of good information.  One of the most important chapters is about your child's relationship with your parent.  This is a great resource for parents who want to know more about their child's feelings about their parent.I had my son read this book, as a parent and as a non-parent, last night.  I also made some copies and gave one to my husband and one to the rest of my family.  The kids really like this book.  They like it much better than most of their textbooks.  Also, it is a little on the humorous side and the pictures are very good.  My children love this book and it gives some examples about how to deal with situations when they are having a difficult time with their parent 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not at all surprised that this book has gone "viral" among the more astute and sophisticated among us in recent years.  As the author, Ms. Nolen has a gift for explaining how we get from A to B and C to D, how we make decisions, and the pitfalls we find in the process 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first purchased this book in a used bookstore, and I read it in a class I taught on the American Revolution.    The students really got excited about the period.  I've been doing research on American Revolution propaganda in the past couple of weeks, and this book has proven to be the most in-depth and comprehensive study of the period to date.  Its topics are the best in its field.  The author has covered the period of the American War of Independence, the American Colonization Society, the Revolutionary War, and American propaganda.  He has also done a good job at identifying how and why propaganda was produced during these periods.  This book is a must-have for anyone who wishes to understand American history, American culture, or to promote positive American values. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book really helped me understand my own history and my family's history as well as the current state of California.  I have been on the hunt for this book for over two years and am finally finally able to buy it.   I am so glad my mother's generation knew the history of California in great detail.  And the stories the elders told to us about how the Indians lived are amazing.  The book is full of stories of war and of life during times of peace.  It's the first book in the California series that shows both sides of California's history.  This will be great for children and adults who want a good reference book about California.I received this book from a teacher that taught California history in the 8th grade.  She was so pleased with the stories and her students loved them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives an excellent summary of the various systems of classification that have existed through the ages.  Some of the systems have had considerable variations from each other.  There are many more systems today than just those given in this book.  A classification system needs to be reliable 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this first chapter, we're introduced to the basics of Japanese karate, along with an introduction to Japanese history, a study of karate's most important practitioners and techniques.  Although the chapters are organized chronologically, the focus of the book is not karate per se, but rather Japanese culture.  This approach allows the karate practitioner to gain an understanding of the Japanese psyche, history, and social structures in general that would be difficult to gain through just karate-related information.  In fact, some of the concepts explored in this book are also useful in everyday life, such as social hierarchies and cultural expectations.  It is also very easy to follow the progress of a karate student to the advanced stages of his or her training.  We see examples of how Japanese kendo practitioners are trained to deal with situations of extreme physical stress, and how they develop their personal identity.  I found the information on karate and Japanese history to be very helpful in both my own personal training and my work with a group of Western students at my college.  The introduction to karate culture and society and the introduction to the Japanese culture and history of the kata and their variations are invaluable resources for anyone who wants to learn Japanese koryu or aikido.  My own Japanese language studies as well as my studies of the language and history are based on these textbooks, which have served as the primary sources for my own training.If you enjoy this book, you will also enjoy some excellent karate instructional materials, such those in the two linked bokken manuals, from the Iaido and Kobudo dojos, the Iikutake system, or the Kodokan system 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so good and i found that a lot of useful tips in my own work on a very tight deadline.  The best tips are for those of us who are doing a lot more work than we had anticipated in our first projects.  We will find that we are doing more than the average freelancer 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite biography to date.  She tells the story of how a very bright and talented child developed a bad childhood, a difficult family, an unhealthy relationships with both parents, and a lack of social skills.  This young woman is so full of character.  We often forget how much our children contribute to the way we think and act, and how important the way they are brought up by parents can be.  For instance, in the book we see how Ms. Oakes was extremely close to her father who died when she was very young, and it is clear that she had some negative traits in her personality from this time as a child.  One of the reasons her mother wanted her to marry a rich man so that they could make a big difference in her life was that she did not want this girl growing up into a spoiled brat.  Ms. Jackson's book does a great job of showing the impact of early events on the children of her protagonists, as well as the impact it had on their parents.  It's a rare book that doesn't take the form of a play or a song.  The children are not "little adults", but are little people learning to be adults 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book a few months ago and have read it cover to cover.  I really enjoy reading it and can relate all too well to the experiences described.  In my family, for example, I have several friends who are also suffering from emotional and mental illness.  This book provides great insight and hope, and is a great way to educate parents, teachers, and others on emotional and psychological issues.  The chapters are short and to the point, making it very user friendly to teach young children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides the "insights" to make good sense out of the complex concepts and terms that are commonly used in the electronics industry.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to the concept of "inhumanity" early on in my school years, and I was hooked. I read this book for my 9th grade science class, and it was great!  This book covers everything.  Each chapter has a different topic covered, and each chapter is worth its weight in gold.  I wish I had this book when I was in high school!  I did learn more science in this book than I did in a 9th grad science class and I have a better understanding of the concepts of evolution and natural selection.  The first couple chapters were very frustrating, but the authors have managed to keep each chapter interesting, informative, and helpful. I was also very interested in the concept and development of this concept over the years 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first time I've read anything that makes me think the "haystack" of information is now even more overwhelming. It's a good read for the novice cook. There are no "gourmet" recipes in this book.  I used the recipe books in school but I was only half way through them before I learned how to use recipes and use other ingredients in my cooking.  If you're a pro like me and already know how to cook and prepare recipes, then this book is a great addition to your cookbook shelf 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first five chapters are about the evolution of the human race, from its earliest human forms to its present form.  The sixth chapter deals with the evolution to sex, then to sexuality.  Then to sexuality and sexual reproduction.  Sex and reproduction are not separate from the evolution, as some evolutionists have often claimed.  They go hand in hand.  We also get a short discussion of the creation of sexual humans.  And we get a long discussion of evolution in general.  This book is full of good ideas and good information that I use in my seminars 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book when it was in its original edition in 1998.  It is a beautiful book, with recipes, for breakfast, for dinner, for dessert, for lunch, and for snacks.  I have made many of these recipes from scratch with good results, and it is an excellent book for a beginner home cook.  Even seasoned home cooks will find it a pleasure to add a few of these ideas to their own recipes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a joy to read about the amazing things God's people have done throughout their history, and what God has done through the lives of the various nations. I love the stories and pictures so much that I am a bit taken back by my own life.   As an old Christian, I have had my share of trials and tribulations.  I am so grateful to God for my present life, and for the hope He has given me to share this book with my family.  The beauty of God's creation, and the challenges and opportunities God gives to every generation, are a testimony to God's sovereignty over His world.  And I am amazed that people still do things like build the pyramids and build the greatest cities of this world today - it's not just that God cares for us.  God cares about us on this Earth just as much as He cares for the dinosaurs.In my family, I teach each month in Bible Studies for our Sunday School class, and I am glad I read this book.  We were surprised to discover just how much we all share the same God - the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Peter.  It reminds us that there is no greater way to live in the world today, no greater work to do in this world, than by turning to Christ.  In this book, I hope that you will share the message and experience of what God's Word says in these pages.  Please share this with anyone who loves God, and with those who care about the beauty and the glory of the world!

Write a positive review about a good book:   "All The Same Old Stories," as the title says, tells the tale of how an important part of American history has been written down by men who are not from this country. This is an enlightening and entertaining story of how the United States began as a collection of colonies. Many Americans read it today as history books or textbooks, but I was so surprised by the many of the historical facts that it is the history of the United State of America and not just the history books. It is the stories of these early American colonies which make this book a valuable resource. The author has done a fine job of putting these facts in context.  I learned a great deal about our early colonies from the author. I am interested in these early Americans because I believe that this history is crucial to our understanding of how this country developed from 1776 to the present.  This is a great resource to have when one is learning about the early United States.  The author is not biased toward one side or the other in his book.  Each part of the story is true.  He describes what happened during and after each of the British occupations of America. Each colony had to make its own decisions to deal with the new environment.  In many cases, these decisions had to be made in the face of great hardship, and sometimes these choices were made with a heavy hand. But I am convinced that the story of these colonial settlers who chose to form colonies from what was then a broken, disorganized, and primitive society was written long before the United Sates as we know it today

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives a good overview of the history of the United States in the last four centuries. This is not a history book for first time readers but I think for those who are interested in the history and the challenges facing the U.S. in this century, this book is an excellent starting point 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book after I had my daughter.  She liked it and the photos in it were beautiful.  The pictures helped us understand what is happening and what our role is in all of it.  It's interesting how often we are not even aware of the problems our children face, or how they interact with the world around them.  We have to think about it and plan for it. We also need to learn from our children the skills and attitudes we need to be successful in this new generation of children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used this book as a companion to my recent reading of "The Devil's Dictionary."  I find it an excellent resource for those who are new to the subject.  My husband, who is an ordained minister, also uses it in his classes.  And my four and five year old children found it to be very helpful.  I was pleased with the pictures in this book and will be using the entire book in a future project.  It is well organized, complete with index, and complete with color photographs and illustrations.  The book is a pleasure to read.  If you are new or have no prior experience with the subject of the Devil in general, I would recommend this book.  In addition, the pictures are very helpful in teaching about the Devil.  Each subject and each type of Devil has its own style of dress, type of shoes, and other aspects of their appearance.  We have all experienced the Devil for ourselves, and it is best to have a basic idea of how he dresses and what he looks like.  For example, some of the pictures of the women's attire depict him in a dress, but not as he would be seen in the newspaper or other media.  His voice, for example, is usually deep, raspy, and resonates from behind a mask of deceit.  This book presents a look at this Devil of the English speaking world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is great in a lot of ways, but not only is it thorough and comprehensive, but it is also very descriptive of how we got to be where we are now.  We have a tendency to think about the future too narrowly when the future is being planned now, and think about it as if it already exists.  In this book, I found the past to be extremely helpful.  It was a great resource to learn about how people developed in Europe over the last 200 years 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an important book to have in your library, as well as in your class.  It covers the basic principles of a good program: 1) Identify all of your students needs, and tailor your program to meet those needs. 2) Use instructional strategies and materials that have been validated to be effective.  Using the most basic of principles, such as identifying and addressing student needs first, this book shows you how to do both.   Also, the author provides a lot of good ideas about how to modify the programs you currently use so they better meet the needs of your special needs students.  I learned a lot from this book, and now I teach this material 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers the history of American Indian issues from 1841 to the present, including the recent push to include the rights of the non-Indian races in the Constitution.  The book was written as a textbook for college students, but I found it very helpful for those interested in writing about the history and issues facing American Indian Americans.  However, if you want an academic treatise on the rights and responsibilities of American Indians, the book provides an excellent resource. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first time I have read the whole book.  The writing is well done and the subject matter is enlightening 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book first in high school.  We read the book during a summer of college in preparation for the bar exam.  The book is very easy to read and very detailed with examples and explanations.  This is the book that really helped me get into the "big picture" and how the system works.  It helps you visualize your bar exam score and help you understand how to prepare.  I wish all of my high school and college bar exams were read this way.   The best book I have read about the bar examination and preparing for it.  If you're ready for the test, this book is great

In the end, it's a book that feels like a family story in a way.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book, and it has given me great insight into the world of women's issues. I've been a fan of Judy Miller since she worked on the show.  She really knows what it's like to be a woman who works, and I think that the women in her books come across as real people, and not just some faceless cartoon.  That's great advice.  Thank you, Judy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "When I had a son, I was amazed at how different he seemed. He is now, at 22, one of my best friends.  I've watched him go through the same struggles and triumphs as all the other boys.  How does he manage?  He does so with his faith.  His story is not unique, but it does speak to some of the struggles of growing up.  And the struggles and successes of his faith are a blessing to the other children in his life.  God loves all children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read!  It will provide a wealth of information on the workings and workings of the stock market and the banking system.  This is a very interesting and easy read for anyone who is interested in financial analysis and business fundamentals.  In addition it provides an excellent look at the history of modern banking and the history and operations of the Bank of England.  The author gives a good overview of the history behind the banking institutions, the evolution of each institution's policies and regulations, and some good examples of how different countries have dealt with the banking situation.  He also gives a great overview of international banking, the banking crisis, and the current banking crises in other major economies.  For those of you who are interested in the history, this book provides great background 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just started reading this book last night, and I couldn't put it down!  It was just so funny and interesting, and the ending was soooo good.  The plot was pretty interesting, but the humor was really top notch.  I couldn  I just started to read this book, and as soon as I got to the part about how to handle a bad book, I was sold.  Great job!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author makes some very strong arguments that the current economic structure has been in place for far too long and that it has done damage to our democracy, health, and even the economy.  Her book is accessible and has the latest data and research to make her case.  My own view is that she offers an excellent analysis of why the economic system is failing the most disadvantaged groups 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was my first book and it was great! I just love how this book tells the true story behind the infamous "Cinderella Man" - a real-life hero who was persecuted and turned to the streets by a cruel society. I was so happy that I bought this book even though it was so expensive and I had so much fun reading it. It really helped me understand why someone would want to commit crimes in the first place and how they can get caught. The author writes about Cinderella Man from the point of view of the prosecutor - the one who prosecuted him. This story is also a true story, but it is a different type of story and not just about one man. Although the author does state that this story is not true (it was really done), the story has been written down with allusions to the real story of C.C. and her friends. I have read many other books about C. C. and I have to say, this one is my favorite. I loved it and it definitely helped me out and gave me some insight into why she did the things she did 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book. I loved the pictures, and I liked the story. The characters are very likable, and the book has wonderful pictures, many of them taken from old photos. I bought the book after a friend recommended it to me.  I had it in my car the other day to look at pictures and to do some research.  It was also the first book I have read which had pictures of the old "tapestries" at the end of the 19th century.  This book is a must read for anyone that likes vintage photographs, and who is into antique furniture.  Many of these pictures are still in use today.  The book was also good for the history lovers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this is a wonderful book. Its a very interesting look at the evolution of religion and its impact on culture. Its clear to me that religion has a long history and is currently changing. Its interesting to see how many different religions have existed throughout history. The bible itself tells us a great deal about how people have interpreted the bible in different ways.  My grandmother had a copy of the bible which had different translations to use. This book offers a new way of thinking about the evolution and development of religion. I was a Christian until I was 30 years old. I now believe that people have been creating religion for over a millenium, but the bible is the oldest book.  It was written and has been interpreted for thousands of years, and the evolution from one religion to another has been going on for quite a while. I learned a great lot about the bible during this process

Ms. Stott's writing style is clear, and her writing style has a clear, straightforward presentation.

This book is a wonderful addition to my reference book list for all levels of my graduate students 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers the basic principles of data structure and memory and algorithms. The book is well written and does a good job of showing the basics in terms of actual code.  Also, the book was very helpful for the students who were in the middle of a data analysis class and were starting to have trouble with data structures.  They used the book as a model of data structures and memory from the beginning of class and started building upon the book in class 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers a great deal about the human psyche and evolution.  It is not just the human mind that evolved, but the human species.  The author writes about the evolution of consciousness and the mind and discusses some of the ways in which these topics have changed over time.  Evolutionary Psychology also addresses how evolution shapes the development of cultures and societies.  This book is a great guide to those who are new to evolutionary psychology and a great reference for those interested in the subject

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book after my third grade teacher had used it as a text.  It's an excellent text book for first grade, second grade, and third grade.  Some people may prefer reading it to a book of rhymes.  Others may like to learn how to use common objects and basic math facts.  For example, a student who had problems with reading or writing may learn about colors by finding patterns in the book.  A student who's always wanted to make things might get a kick out of making and using things from this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have read by J.A. Jance and I love it! The story is told from Jance's perspective but she gives many examples of Jance from other writers.The plot is complex but I enjoyed the characters and the way Jance kept writing about them. I also liked how she introduced several new characters (the new book) who seem to be "real" and the author did an excellent job of introducing the "realness" to these characters that Jance didn't show in the TV series. I liked this new "real world" that Jances portrayed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book offers a comprehensive overview of the main concepts involved in developing and improving a language, from phonetics to phonology to phonemic analysis to the grammatical structure and syntax of words.  It also describes a number of important techniques and techniques-based materials for language training.  As a useful, comprehensive introduction to language training materials, this book is a valuable resource for teaching English as a second language.  While much of the material is based on primary materials, some is new to the reader, and some can be adapted for use in developing native speakers. The book is divided into three main sections: a phonetic overview; a phonology overview; and a grammar overview.  Each section contains a table of contents that provides a listing of the most useful language-related books and articles on the topic.  The book also contains a glossary of terms, cross-references, index and bibliography.  I highly recommend the book as a text for beginning students, advanced language teachers, and language-training program consultants 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's the best book I've read about running a successful business.  I purchased the book for myself and for my two sons 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been very helpful.  There are many different types of problems in this book.  I have been given many problems with my own children.  For example, with our baby, when she was crying, I was not able to find a book where I could write the correct answers.  Then my husband bought the book, and we started the homework on her.  She was a good reader, but she still needed help with some things.  By giving our children a book to read they are able to develop their own vocabulary and learn what they can use to help them with their problems 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent guidebook for anyone who is serious about their relationship. It is based on personal observations from myself and my marriage and a book written by a professional relationship therapist.  It is written with good humor and insight and practical advice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A truly excellent book.  I've read a lot of books on the subject of "The American Dream" and I've found it to be a very interesting study of capitalism and wealth and the way these two things play out in real life.  It doesn't get into the specifics of what made these two systems happen, just a general outline of the various features that make the system work.  While he goes on to discuss the "American Dream" in a lot more detail in other chapters, this one provides the best look at how the "The Dream" has been a consistent theme for America's history.  There are a few times that he uses the word "American" to mean "White" and the book becomes a little confusing when he does that, but I found it a good study of this very general phenomenon.  He also takes the time to examine the differences between the two American visions for how to govern: one of wealth and privilege that is centered on the elite and a vision that is grounded in the commons and democracy.  But the one that he discusses most in depth is the one we're in today, one that is based upon the notion of the American Dream.  The problem with both of those visions is that they rely upon a very narrow set of beliefs and values.  In fact, the entire idea of the "Dream" is based on a lie.  We're living in a nation of lies, of lies about how our society works and how our government works.  "The dream" has become an illusion, one of many that Americans have been lied into believing since the early 20th century.  Our very definition of what it means to be "American," the American dream, has no foundation in reality.  And, like the "dream," it's based on an image and a myth.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of all of Rhett's early works and his later ones. He is one of the funniest and most talented young novelists I have read in my life.  His humor, his writing and his storytelling are so original, I wish I could read everything he ever wrote. He has the best voice I have seen in a novel in years.  I have a hard time imagining anything better.  He has one of his own best mysteries (I wish this mystery was the first novel I read from Rhett), a great love story (I love "Gone To Heaven" and "The Heart Of The Sea") and his best historical novel, "The Last Days Of Rhett".  "The Age Of Aquarius" is the best history of the 20th Century I have ever read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in second grade, which was an exciting time.  As a girl who had a brother I was constantly thinking of him.  I liked everything about him.He liked to tell jokes, read a book, go to the beach.  My brother was my best friend's dad, but the more I read about him the more he reminded me of him (I'd like to have a book of stories from my own childhood and call it "my best friend").  It was always exciting to think about him and that's what makes it all the more exciting when he returns to New York.  The writing is gorgeous and the book keeps you guessing and guessing.  It will have you thinking about him in new and exciting ways.  Don't expect a happy ending.  In a way, this is a bittersweet story of the end of the great love of my life.  There were things about my brother I could not even imagine until he left.  He left everything behind and moved to New Jersey.  And as much as I love him, I'm glad he's gone.  His life was never the same as the life my brother lives in now.  That's not to say I won't miss him, but I don't miss the fun things he used to do, the parties he liked to throw, and the way he would try to do things right.  This book is about a man who had everything and is now the loser that he left everything for.  Even though he misses what he had, he has a deep need for love.  Love is the missing piece that he needs in his life.I found this book very inspirational.  If you are in love, don't go searching for it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fabulous book and I love it so much! I am so glad it has helped me and my clients!

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic collection of classic fairy tales that have been lovingly collected for the first time in an all new edition.  The stories range from the  topsy-turvy, to the hilarious to the  tragic, to bewitching to haunting, to mysterious to  enchanting.  For many, the fairy tale is a  formative childhood memory, a treasured memory of childhood, and  a formative source of love, imagination, and imagination.  These stories are often considered  to be "true" or "true to life" but are actually based on  folktales passed down from generation to generation.  They were not  written as children's stories, which are actually  very different from fairy tales.   The tales are rich, and not  so much historical documents, but rather  "old legends" based on the  "feelings" or  "narratives" that are very personal  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most thorough and well-organized guides to the history of New York City in the 1900s and early 1900s, written for the casual reader with a good sense of history and a good feel for the city. The book is well written with colorful photos, full color illustrations and all sorts of useful information such as a brief history of the city, the top ten most important landmarks, historical photos and maps, and more.  There is also a handy glossary of commonly used names.  The book ends with a chapter on the history and current state of New NYC and some ideas for improvements to the city such as increased bus service, increased public housing, more green spaces and better parks and recreational facilities.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the history or the city today.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "This book takes us on a tour of the history of the Catholic Church from its beginnings in the third century until the present. It covers the whole of the Church from the earliest times to the present day. It is a fascinating historical exploration, with over 1,000 photographs, most of which illustrate important events, important people, and important places and events. It provides an insight into the way the Church is organized and how it functions. It discusses many of the main aspects of the church's work and activity, including its constitution, administration, structures, doctrine and liturgy. It has an extensive index and provides bibliographies for the most useful sources on the history and practice of the Roman Catholic Church 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors take you through several different aspects of life in India today, from the lives of women to the lives and experiences of children. They also provide useful data about some aspects of India's economic and social development. The book is written in a non-technical style that will give a general idea of the various features of modern India.It is a must-read for any student of Indian history, as well as any student or person interested in India 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like the story, but I also like the illustrations of the book.  The story takes place in medieval Germany and uses German as its primary language.  This story uses different characters from the German King to the German peasants, as well as different events and people.  It also uses different words from one time to another to give a more realistic and colorful view of the Middle Ages.  I really liked this book.I wish there was more detail on the story of the King and Queen, but this book is about so much more than just the King.  There are also a couple other good books for children on King and his court

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great book and very helpful!  It was fun and easy to read and understand!  This is by far the best book I've come across for kids, and has given me the tips I need to make sure I've got my daughter eating healthy and happy. I have four other children, and my other two girls LOVE it!  The only problem is that we do need to spend a lot more time together eating.  Still, I would recommend this book for all the new moms who just have a small baby!  I'm so happy my daughter has made it through this without going to the hospital, and her eating and sleeping habits are starting to improve!  She's now eating healthy foods and playing with friends!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My mother's mother gave me this book a while back when I was visiting.  She knew the book well and had it with her for all of her granddaughters.  When my oldest was 9 or 10 years old, she decided that she wanted to "take a step back and look" at the world around her.  Her grandmother was very influential in her life, and she decided I would be a great role model.  This book was very helpful, and it gave me a lot of good insight.  I would definitely recommend it.  My grandmother had passed, and I had to buy the book to help me remember her as she had known.   She taught me to value things that others value, and how to be a positive influence on other people.  One of my granddaugthers and her brother are in law enforcement, and are both doing very well.  In fact, one of the books that I read with them has been a great tool in helping them to become good officers

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book does a great job of getting to know many of the various parts of a great book.  It's one of the best ways to learn about the various aspects of the "Big Questions" of the world, or, rather, the problems it's trying to solve.  The book also provides many tools to solve some of the more common problems you'll face as you learn more about these questions (especially in a college science curriculum).  The examples are in the book, but they are arranged in logical order that help students think about how different parts of the universe relate.  Students with advanced science backgrounds who are planning to become engineers or scientists also can benefit from the book.One reason I love this book is the way it uses examples to illustrate the main parts of these problems (often using pictures and diagrams) without boring the student with technical details.  This is a great way to make it easier for a student to understand how the parts of our universe relate to each other.  Although this book could be used by any science student, I found it most useful to the students of engineering, science, and the physical sciences (the latter of which is my major)

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book presents a compelling argument for a unified theory of the emergence of consciousness.  From basic physics and the basic laws of quantum mechanics to the development of consciousness itself, the evidence is clear.  But the theory remains elusive.  We know so little about how this process may have emerged.  What's more, there is no "solution" in sight.  However, this book offers many ways for researchers to get the answer they seek, and it also serves as a guide for researchers who are beginning to conduct experiments.  This is the definitive guide to the subject.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book tells us a great deal about the origins of the Christian Faith and Jesus Christ Himself.   The book is very complete in it's coverage of Early Christianity and discusses many different forms of Christianity in the Gospels.  Although the book contains a number of critical comments about the Gethsemane Incident, it focuses on the Passion in more detail than other recent works on the Gospel.  The author also offers several suggestions to improve the way we study Jesus.  He does not try to convince us that all Christian Scriptures have been correctly translated into the    form in which they are to be understood, but focuses on translating the  Passion in ways that are  pleasing to the reader and will enable the student to learn the  Gospel 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I'm still very confused about how to build wealth.  I thought this book was very helpful in helping me understand that.  While I still had some money in savings, it gave me a good overview on what I need to be thinking about.  My son is in first grade this year and is starting to learn the importance of saving money for the future.  This book gave me new ideas on how to save, invest, and plan for the next 5, 10, 15 years.  He even started to learn about stocks.  What a difference a year makes

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a lover of cookbooks, I love this one. It has great recipes for every meal! I have made a few of the recipes and they are great! The recipes are easy to make and so much better than the magazines or websites that I used to follow. I also like the story that has the recipes for the meals. I can make all of the main meals as I remember. I have also made a couple of different kinds of chicken, and added to the recipes a few other ingredients to make them more like home made. I will make some of the dishes that I will have for Christmas, my friend's Christmas, etc. I am making them soon. I would have liked to have seen more pictures of the family as I have gotten older, but it is still a wonderful book and I can recommend it to everyone. It is a great resource for anyone looking for simple and quick dinners

As usual, this book provides information in a concise and logical way that cat owners may easily use to improve their relationships with their feline companions 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A superb book about the origins of the Bible and Christianity.  The most thorough and convincing work on the topic I have ever read.  In a time when so much is taught about the Bible, this book will teach you what you need to know to understand the Bible.   There is enough material in this book to be considered a graduate text.  One reviewer said it had all the material of an advanced course in Biblical Studies.  This is a great book for the Bible class at my college or the Bible course at my church.  Anyone who is interested in the Bible for the first time will need to read this book.  A must-read for those who would like to know the original documents 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well-organized resource for all aspects of Jewish religious history. The author, himself, a Jew, has done the first two chapters, which cover the history of the faith for some 400-500 years.  The author presents many interesting and useful sources, and uses many new details in his text to make his work much more interesting than some of his earlier works.  I especially like the introduction, which provides a brief overview of the history and religious thought of Western Europe during the Renaissance period.  Most of his topics cover a period that is important in terms of Jewish history, but which often get short shrift in the literature.  He does a good job of drawing the reader into this interesting era, and this is one of the first texts in this field to focus on the period immediately following the fall of the Roman Empire.  In addition, he offers a brief historical overview of early Christianity, and an overview of religious history in general.  His book includes many notes, most of which are very useful.  It is a valuable and well-illustrated reference for anyone interested in the history, religion, and social mores of the Jewish people.  This work has a wealth of information on religious beliefs, customs, and culture.  Although the material is arranged chronologically, the author does not write in a linear style.  There is always some new source material that he uses.  Overall, this is a good introduction to the topic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used the words "deteriorating" and "inability" when describing the condition of America today.  This was written before the recession, so I expected that the economy was the primary problem.  But I also read several history books, and I have learned that America's problems stem from our culture, not the economy.  The culture is the most dangerous one in the world today.The book is organized in five chapters, one on each of the following topics:  1. Capitalism vs. Communism:  "This book is written in a way that, although it presents a broad overview of history, does not assume that history in the U.S. and Europe has been as linear as the author's own.  I would not suggest that the author views the current crisis as the inevitable result of capitalism versus communism.  It is a necessary step in a long process that has taken place over centuries." (p. vii) "Although the author does not use any data to support the thesis of his book, he presents his conclusions from a Marxist-Leninist framework." (pp. 12, 13)  2. The Great Depression:  This is the best book I have read on the Great Depression.  "The author does a masterful job of presenting a long-term view of the crisis that shows how the capitalist system is the cause of the economic problems that we face today. He also provides an excellent summary of the history of the labor movement, explaining how the labor movements of Europe have been co-opted by capitalist economics." (P. 12)  3. The Rise and Fall of the Communist States:  Here the author gives a history of communism throughout its long history and discusses how the Communist states failed due to a variety of problems, from bureaucratic control to economic and political underdevelopment.  He also discusses the "iron curtain" that the Soviet Union erected in East Germany.  In a few cases he includes some personal anecdotes.  (p xviii)  4. World War II:  There are some excellent observations on WWII in this book.  As I have said before, I find that the general consensus among the professional historians is that this was a war that was lost by the capitalist forces.  However, the author, in my opinion, makes a stronger case for the defeat of the Soviet and Nazi armies than anyone else in the field.  Although he does not explicitly state it in the book, this is the

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a fan of the author's previous novels, which have been listed and recommended by many of her students and teachers.  This is one of his best yet.  The story is told in first person, and the focus is on one student, Kori.  We learn about the character's family, childhood and education.  It is told mainly in first-person, with much information being conveyed to the reader in the form of photographs and anecdotes, and anecdotes to Kori herself.  A good way to learn about a very complex subject, and how to best help someone through that subject

His philosophy has practical applications not only for musicology, but for the analysis of music and for the music business.

This is very entertaining and fun to read, and it's a pleasure to learn about the history of music theory

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very interesting look at the concept of identity and a good read for anyone trying to understand their identity.   The author's take on identity seems to be one of those that is based on logic and facts, rather than emotions and ideas.  He offers good examples that support his point.  While the book contains a number of examples, the most useful for the average reader are the self-help and guidebooks which I have found useful in helping me to identify myself as an individual with a distinctive identity.This book also contains some good essays by Dr. Wren-Lewis on this concept of Identity, his concept of "Gut Feelings" and some other ways of looking at the Self

Write a positive review about a good book:   The best part of this book is the stories of these two girls that I know who lived together in a poor, immigrant neighborhood in Manhattan in the 1960s.  In a sense, I was one of them.   I would go to school for 2 to 3 hours each day, and then have my lunches and then go home and get my schoolwork done.  I never finished my homework.  My parents would call me to pick me up in the middle of the night, because I would be up all night working on it and they thought I was lazy.  They would get angry, and one of my parents would yell, "You know, she's a genius, she knows about all these things and she can solve anything.  She just doesn't do it in school.  All she does is study and study.  And then she just goes home and gets up and goes to sleep at night.  If she had been doing what she did when she was studying, this would never have happened

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive work of "old-time" lore and folklore for the 21st Century. The only difference now is that the creatures are different. Our modern understanding of the lore and history is largely based upon the writings of European witch doctors and alchemists, including those from England, France, Germany and Spain, as well as the Native American stories. The ancient lore and folk tales of the Native Americans have been lost forever.  Although much has been written about the subject by modern researchers, I have found only a few of these ancient texts that were not lost to history or lost to time. This is a superb introduction to Native American lore and lore-making as seen by the people who lived in this continent from time immemorial.  It is a complete compilation of "how-to" stories, as told by Native Americans.  Some of these stories have been modified, but the essence remains the same.  While not perfect, this is a guide for all ages and levels of understanding.  My son and I share the book with our grandson, who was thrilled to receive this as a gift.  The author takes you on a tour of the "old country" and tells of the amazing and ancient "old ways" in which our people practiced and celebrated life.  This book is not a history text in the traditional sense, but instead is a story-telling guide for the modern witch doctor 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in high school and thought it was fantastic and very informative.  I learned a lot about marketing and the financial world.  In particular, I learned about the "big fish" in the market:  They make very, very large profits.  If you own a small company that can produce some goods and/or services, you can probably make a lot of money in the short term.  But, in the long term, you are on your own.  You can only make so many mistakes, because eventually a large part of the company is going to fail or die.  So, you'll have to learn a lot more from making money than you would from simply making good stuff.  (This is a great book to learn from if you already are running a small business and/ or running a consulting firm.)The book is very informative and is very well organized.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a truly impressive group of authors, and each of them gives a new take on the "old story".  It is interesting and insightful, and I've always been interested in this subject in my youth.  It's important, and exciting, and it's fun to read.  I also appreciate that some authors are writing for adults, some are writing about kids.  There are so many great books out there to choose from, so choose from any of them, and enjoy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a long time fan of this series and have always felt there was a special place in our hearts for this young boy.  He had a special destiny and it was to get a second chance to live.  It's amazing that he was able to survive such a long, harsh childhood and that he came out the other side so bravely.  All the characters in this series, including the young boy, represent our best and worst qualities.  Our love for each other is unconditional and our hatred for eachother is deep, but the love that is most powerful in the last chapter is one between brothers that was shared long ago.  I just loved that it wasn't written from the perspective of a child.  The boys were adults then, and are adults now.  How can anyone think that this boy, this child in particular, would ever have come into such a horrible life with such a bad childhood 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is THE GREATEST cookbook in the world  It is a classic, and I wish every cook in the USA could read this book, because it will save you so much time, and all you need is a couple of spices, and a good blender. Everything you want to cook, and make for your next meal, can be prepared with just a couple simple ingredients.  The recipes are so wonderful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book when I was about 4 and the first chapter reminded me of growing up with my parents.  From then on I read every one of her books and was captivated from start to finish.  I never gave up and I still read these books over and over 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book.  I have had great success with women in my business and life.  It will give you all the information you need to make yourself and your clients successful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received this book for my husband's birthday. This book was fantastic, I think it's my new favorite.  I also have a son now (ages 4-5) that loves this book.  So many of the exercises, games and activities make my life a bit easier, and I enjoy helping him with his homework.  He loved it, and when I read the books we have together, he gets excited and asks for more.  A great book for new parents 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've used this book for several months of work and found it very useful.  I had always struggled with this topic, but with this book, I was able to quickly break down a topic and break it down with great visual examples.  There's so much material to cover and in addition, the authors are very informative and approach this topic with clear information.  For example, one of the main points is that a woman needs to create her image for herself, which is different than what a man is expected to do.  The first step in this process is to figure out what she likes and dislikes.  From this, the second step is the most important.  What women want to see in other women in order for them to be valued and desired in the marketplace.  This process is the key to any type of success.  In addition, many of the examples in the book show that women are constantly trying to create and sell their image, creating images and personalities that are different from the image that men are expected to create.  A man does not have to have a problem with this process because he's built to do it.  Women are constantly doing this in their heads, which causes a disconnect in the way they perceive the world and their image.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has helped me understand the root cause of cancer.    I am not only a medical student but also a wife and mother of 4 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the greatest book I've read so far.  I have spent a great deal of time in Africa and I have experienced the African way of life.  For example, the author describes the bushbaby as being part of a family that can protect it's children from being eaten by wolves and dogs.  The author also describes the importance of knowing how to handle cattle and cattle animals.  This chapter describes the different aspects of cattle handling, cattle training, and how to protect a cow from predators. The author shows how to train cattle to move in a slow moving cart to make it easier for the cattle to get food.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of fun activities for older children, along with stories and lessons to learn from the stories, activities to help the child figure out how to play and use the books.  The activities are simple enough for children to use, and also helpful for older preschoolers and elementary age children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book the most comprehensive study on the history and evolution of man from a Darwinian perspective.  I read a lot of evolution related literature before, but this book gives a good overview of the evolution process and shows how man and animals evolved in relation to each other.  The author also has a lot to say on the subject of morality in nature, but does so in a clear, accessible way, and never uses the term "evil" (as does the Darwinian process).  He gives an excellent example of how evolution has shaped the ethics of animals, and how our ethics have evolved to support life.  For example, the author explains the origin of altruism, how it is not necessarily the dominant behavior in animals, but it is the behavior that most rewards survival and reproduction, and it also supports the survival and survival of individuals.  This book also covers a lot on the origins of civilization (e.g., agricultural societies, animal husbandry, weapons), which also have contributed greatly to the survival of animals and the survival in humans of the various species of animals that have adapted to their habitat.  These two aspects of the book are quite different from those that I learned in high school. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first serious look at the history of the American Revolution.  It's been a long time coming.  I find this book very interesting and thought provoking.   It was a real eye opener to me as to how the Revolution took place 
Write a positive review about a good book:   First edition was a classic, then it was followed by two more fine volumes. The author has written about many subjects, from "The American Way of War" and "The Origins of Nazi Degeneration" to "War and Peace" and the Bible. Each chapter has a theme, and the book is full of ideas, but the writing is crisp, clear, and engaging. The book is written in short sentences, with lots of photos, graphs, charts and equations to illustrate ideas.  "War is a human institution", wrote the author in "A Nation's Wars", "not just a result of men's brains working out.  It is often a system designed to maximize exploitation of human resources for profit and political control."  "A good book", writes the author "is one with a clear point of view and a well-ordered framework of research".  This is a book that I will return to frequently to help understand the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  I would recommend it highly for any student who wants to learn more about the history of war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a valuable resource in learning about the current status of this ancient religion.  The author makes an impressive case for the existence of the religion in antiquity, but the evidence supporting this conclusion is strong.  If you have a particular interest in the religion, this is a good introduction to it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book.  I read it before my first exam (which I passed with flying colors).  This book also gives the reader an idea of how to get a high grade on a test.  It is a very practical book for anyone who needs help with a high school or college entrance exam.  A great book to have for the summer.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great book. The author goes into detail about the history of the early Church. He does a very good job summarizing the basic history of Christianity.  The author does a good job of explaining the basic doctrines of Christianity (the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Holy Ghost, baptism, etc).  There is a good deal of theology in the book.  There are some very nice illustrations, too.  All in all a nice book.I have found that when I have read other Church history, I often get bogged down in the details and miss the larger picture.  I found that the author's approach has helped me see the big picture. I would say that this is the book that the average person should read first if they are serious about being a member of the Church.  It may well be the best book I have seen on this subject.I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to the Church or to anyone interested in knowing more about the early history of Church history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a lot of research on the origin of the Roman Empire. I wanted to learn what the Roman people were like before they started building their empire.  What they were like after the fall.  I did not find anything that I found interesting enough to want to write about.  But the Roman books I found at the library, which had some interesting information, I was able to incorporate into my own writing.  The Romans, however, had no such books 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is an excellent reference book.  There are a few chapters on gardening and seed saving for me personally that were very helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an amazing book! I learned so much about this history, and I am more fascinated with the everyday lives and struggles of black people than any of the stories.  This book has a great deal of humor and entertainment as well.  The book is colorful, entertaining, and has some good information about what we have in common.  It reminds me of the TV show "Curb Your Enthusiasm", which I enjoyed watching as a child.  We have the same kind of lives, the same struggles, and the same problems in this country today.  There is no book like this one!  We all have our problems, but the book makes the reader understand that we all have problems.  A lot of the problems are not just financial, and we have to face our weaknesses rather than try to make our families "normal".  Some of the struggles of blacks today are more social than political and social problems are also taking place in the schools.  Although I don't think all black people are as successful as I, I learned a lot about the struggles black people in this society go through in the daily lives of each of us, and this is something I have never learned in school.  I hope this book will help readers to have a better understanding of their own lives 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book from the get-go.  I couldn't put it down.  It is very funny and is full of amazing recipes and ideas.  The humor and good recipes keep this cookbook interesting.  If you are looking for ideas and cooking techniques this book is the perfect recipe book to have as a starting point 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not easy read but very informative. I have always been interested in this subject for some time, but have had very little help, until now.  I am thrilled with the quality of the book, and the great index at the end.  You will not be disappointed.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. I have a lot of experience and I have used my experiences to make my teaching better.  I've also tried to give my students as many ideas as possible and to not get too bogged down in the scientific information.  The most useful way for a teacher to learn about science is to read the books, then go out and experiment.  This book does an excellent job of teaching the basics of chemistry with a good amount of information on the history of chemistry and what is happening now 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent source for information on the various options available to you, whether it be from your parents, family, friends, religious upbringing, or the government.  I used this book as a textbook for my third grade social studies class.  My students did very well in the social studies course and I used it again this year for an elective class. I think it is great for beginning readers and I believe it also has value for older students as well.  It is written from a Christian viewpoint, but it offers a healthy alternative to many of the standard references.  This is an absolute must have for Christians who have questions about the church, or those who want to learn more about Christianity 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a problem with some of the more recent books on business.  The book discusses some great books on the subject and the best part is, they all discuss different aspects of business. The best books cover the entire subject and also have great examples from actual business. These books provide very useful tips that can be used in a very general sense to help you get started in business. They can be a great first book on business, and then you can move into more specific books on specific subjects. I have had my fair share of success and failure in business and this is what I have learned from those books.  If you are planning to start a business in the future, this is an excellent book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great addition to my collection of classic children's books!  This is a wonderful book with many pictures and many words.  I read this book to my grandson, who is 2, and my daughter who is 9.  My son, who has just turned 5, read it with me.  It's funny, funny, and funny, all at the same time!  The pictures are beautiful and the text is simple.   If you are a parent, you should read this with your child 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a teacher and a parent of a child who is in first grade and my daughter is enjoying this book and her learning so much.

I would definitely recomment it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that I've read and I've enjoyed. It offers a lot of different ways of looking at the world and how to handle it and how you can use the wisdom of others to improve your life.

If you're stuck, or having problems with your relationship, or you just want to improve yourself, read this book.

I love this book and I will never forget how it helped me with my husband's problems and how he helped me handle them

The book includes lots of examples of the   styles and techniques of various types of weddings, with instructions  on how to get started.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book and I found myself very enjoying it. I had a couple of questions before I read the book. First, are there any pictures that don't show the real story.  Second, the main character's personality is such that she doesn't know all her letters 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this new edition of THE BIG DILDO OF HISTORY, Gary R. Johnson explores the lives of key contemporary American figures from William Henry Harrison to George Washington to Thomas Jefferson. Johnson writes in clear, concise prose and is always engaging the reader with wit, charm, and a deep appreciation of the human condition.  Johnson, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for the Los Angeles Times, explores the world of American history through the life of one of the greatest Americans, George Washington.  Washington, Johnson explains, was more of a soldier, poet, statesman, and philosopher than he was a general of the Continental Army.  The Big Book, a book of many essays, is an indispensable reference for anyone looking to understand American history today.  With this edition, Johnson's new bestseller is a book that will satisfy and entertain readers, no matter what their history background, age, or education level. Johnson's Big Book is also the only book to date to include a biographical essay on Thomas Jefferson and a discussion on the life and times of the Founding Fathers by John J. Barry.  Each of Johnson's previous books has captured the attention of American schoolchildren, and today his Big Book continues its tradition as the best reference on the most important people in American history.  This is a well-researched and entertaining account of America's past, a guidebook to the American Century.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my first book to introduce this technique in my own personal practice. It's a great book, and a great introduction to the concept! I would also like to thank the co-author of this book, Dr. Stephen D. Cohen, for his help in creating this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm very happy with this book, although I was initially put off by the title because I thought it had a lot of sex and nudity in it. However, it is very much about relationships, and it shows that sex can be a positive thing. For example, the mother and daughter relationship is quite a realistic one in this book. It is much more mature than the other mother-daughter relationships in literature, and the father is just as immature. This book has lots of practical things to teach all couples, such as when to eat together, how to sleep together, and when to go to the bathroom. The chapters that are about sex are very interesting, as well. It also gives some good ideas about how to handle jealousy and get along with your partner. As with many other romance authors, this author uses her protagonist as a metaphor for women in general. In most of her books, the heroine is very intelligent, intelligent enough to learn more about what they need to do to make their relationship work. I especially liked the way that the woman was described as a person who was "daddy's pet." This is another reason why I liked this book so much. This isn't a book that you read for pleasure, but rather for practical information 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really have enjoyed this book.  It is my favorite, as is this series!  Thanks so much for sharing them with us.  I read them all and have learned a lot!  I was able to get a lot of ideas for my own projects for my husband's office.  We are doing a lot together 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an absolute pleasure to read. I've read two (I'm currently at the second one, so I haven't even finished the first) and enjoyed them very much.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in or is in a dating relationship.  It covers everything I wish I'd known before I was in a serious relationship.This book is the easiest, most accessible, most practical approach to talking about a relationship. It also has the best tips on how to find a person of interest, and some helpful information on the best way to pick up people.  The book is very easy to read and is filled with many good tips on different aspects of relationships. I was able to implement most of these tips into my dating and personal life, and my relationship has gone from good to great since I read this book.My husband and I have had our share of challenges and successes, but I've learned a lot of great tips on being in a good relationship from this book - like the importance of communication and respect.  These tips have really been a game changer for us, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in a relationship 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must have book for every one of us!   I have a son 7 years old and I have used it a lot with my husband when he is on a parent-teacher conference or with my children on a trip.  It is such an excellent resource for anyone who loves animals and children.   It gives you a lot of ideas for new toys to buy for your children.Great ideas for animals and ideas for your child to play with.  I will use this book with all my children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a beautiful book to read with my daughter. It is great for reading to babies who are 3, 4, or even 5 and their parents as well.  My daughter LOVES the pictures and her explanations.  She is excited to see what her daddy does every day.  He uses some of his favorite toys and he has a lot of fun making the toy animals, but not all of the animals.  They have learned to be more aware of the things around them and of their behavior.  LOVED the book and was very pleased with her pictures. I recommend everyone's baby read this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that really helped me when I was in my late teens.   I will be getting my copy soon.  It will give me a better understanding of how to deal with stress in my life.  I'm going to recommend this book to my sister as well

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful story. The author has done a good job at giving each character their own story line and developing each one into a complete individual.  The writing flows nicely and there are no frills here, just character development and a very good plot.  All of the characters are great and well developed.  In addition, the author has a great sense of humor and her style is very amusing.  This book has really opened my eyes to the life of the North American Indians.  I love the North Americans and their customs, even though I grew up in Europe.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I were introduced to this book when it came out in 1990.  I was looking for a way to explain my relationship with my ex-husband and my daughter.  He is not perfect.  We are still in love, but I was trying to come up with some things I could use on my daughter to help her grow.  She loves all the recipes.  Some are simple and some are a bit more complicated.  Overall, the book is a treasure trove of tips, tips and tricks, and examples to help your family out!  Each recipe is unique and unique and the book ends with suggestions of other great books that can help you with your family

Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book for my class. I was able to teach the text in detail and get out the important words.  In addition, this text had much information on how to use audio books in your classroom.  This text was a real eye opener for my students and I was surprised at the positive changes in my classroom over the summer.  The students were able to pick up a lot of ideas on how I teach.  They had a lot more practice with text that we did last year 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great primer for getting started with any type of knitting project. The only book on this subject I have been able to finish (I did a sweater for my niece). The book was also helpful for developing and using techniques like picots, ribbing, and pliars. It was a great guide for beginners.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been following the book for a while. It has given me many new ideas. I found it as an excellent reference to teach an intermediate level introductory or intermediate level math course. The book covers the basic concepts as well as the math in a very detailed way. The author's explanations are clear and concise. The only problem I had with the book was that it didn't cover algebra and differential equations.  However, I will use this book on my math classes this semester. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a fan of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park: The Future of Dinosaurs, this book will put you on your way to knowing everything about dinosaurs.   There are many beautiful pictures in this book.  Each chapter tells about a different dinosaur and the many interesting facts and pictures that go with the animal's story.  If dinosaurs lived in the Middle Jurassic of the Triassic, it's possible that some small dinosaurs were the first to evolve.  But then the world-wide extinction that ended the Jurassic period happened and the dinosaurs went extinct.  Some of the other dinosaurs and early animals survived.  The dinosaurs that we know today developed their specializations because they were adapted to survive in different types of environments.  This book gives a good look at what these animals did, but also includes many interesting stories and facts about their lives.  It also helps you understand how dinosaurs were able to survive this extinction.  By the way, the stories in this story are true!  I love the fact that it mentions what happened when the dinosaurs were found, but doesn't give any dates.  I bought the book on the recommendation of my 7-year old son, and this was his first science book. He wanted to know more about dinosaurs and the way things evolved.  My son is now a pre-teen, and I read this book to him as part of his science fair projects 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in graduate school and had some time, so this was a must-read for me.  This is a great book!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for a good romance novel for about 10 years, and now I finally have it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was helpful, concise and easy to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the greatest guide to the basics of home building.  I have been using this book in my own projects since I started.  The instructions are simple and clear, making it easy to build a house with lots of room for children.  My family, my two grandchildren, my niece and nephew, and a friend of mine all live in a two-bedroom house.  It cost me $150 for the book.  There is a chapter for each stage of the construction process.  You can even see photos of the finished houses.  Each house has some "fun" features to give the illusion of a more "modern" house, like a living room with a couch, couch area, and bookcase.  Some of the houses are quite different from other homes in the area.  Many features were common to the early houses in my neighborhood.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a revelation for me. It was a great refresher in my thinking and techniques of working with my clients. I was also surprised to find so much of my work at work related to this book and found it to be extremely helpful.   I'm going to be purchasing this book again 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is comprehensive and easy to understand.  A quick reference will save your time in class 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A delightful collection of poetry and short stories with a dash of pop culture.  The first four poems are brilliant and very funny.  And the last poem is beautiful.  I particularly liked the last one, in which the narrator goes through the various stages of her relationship with her father, a retired schoolteacher.  It's beautifully written, and makes you see what the other side of these stories are like.  All of these tales are very different from one another, but each of them makes you wonder how much of your life you're missing.  In this case, you have to consider that your parents might be the ones missing. They were a wonderful combination--they were just different.  Some of the stories are heartbreaking.  Other tales are delightful.  Most are funny. Some are funny but very poignant.  None of the poems are very long--the stories are all short enough to pick up and read at the dinner table.  They are really quite short.  This book is truly a wonderful addition to the poetry collection.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a huge help in understanding the history of the American Jewish community in the past 100 years.  This has been an exhaustive history of Jewish life in America.  The first few chapters are useful and well done in explaining the early history of American Jewry.  After the Revolutionary War, and especially during World War I and World War II, this history of Jewry is told from the perspective of the European Jew.  From that perspective, American Jewries were forced to struggle for recognition, for acceptance, for inclusion.  American Jewesses were marginalized by other American cultures and religions.  In addition, the Jewish population was at times persecuted and had its rights and positions of power and authority restricted.  Throughout the course of the history, American Jewish Jews have fought and won their battles.  Most of these battles have been won, but there are still battles left to be fought.  For example, the book deals with issues that have affected the present and future of American Jews.  I am looking forward to the next 100 years of American Jewish history! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is not very difficult (the index provides the basic vocabulary) but covers a great many different aspects of French language, with examples and explanations.  The style is lively, the examples and examples are well written and easy to understand, and the examples of the words themselves are good examples.  There are not many words in French that have the equivalent in English but, at the same time, English words have more French equivalents.  This is a book for those who study French in France, or would like to learn French, or those who want to practice French with a native French speaker.  If you have some experience with French, this book will also teach you some basic French grammar.  Although this book is written in French, I would like French speakers to have a look at it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete history of women's suffrage ever written 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most important part of this book is when it gets down to the "nuts and bolts" of the development process.    I've read and watched enough of my father's development work that I know exactly how this happens in the first place.  The author presents many examples of how a "normal" child who is a little off-track can be "turned-on" and given the tools necessary to turn-off their parents.  In the next chapter, the author explains what causes these parents to "turn off".  This process of turning-off is a process that can be accelerated by the child's lack of parental discipline and positive interactions with their peers 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers many different subjects that can be very helpful for the beginner as well as experienced pilots. I recommend this book first to a student who has previously attempted a basic level of flight.  Also, it covers advanced topics such as altitude, air traffic control, GPS, etc. The author also has a few interesting diagrams to assist with the text.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book starts with an important and compelling question. The authors start by stating the obvious. The current political situation in the US is the most volatile in the modern era. The country is split in two. Those who want to preserve the status quo and those who want change.  This book brings together two of America's most influential writers to talk about the current political/social/economic crisis, and how the "new America" can be created.  The authors explain why and how America must choose between the two options.  As I read this book I was taken away by the simplicity, wisdom, humor and intelligence of the authors.  I believe I learned so much from the authors and will be a better writer in the future. I learned a lot of new strategies that I have used in writing books and articles that deal with this topic. One important tool I used in creating my "New America" concept is the power of fiction.  Fiction can help make one understand complex concepts and situations. The "new" America is not about the  New World Order or globalism.  In many ways it is the "old" America that was lost and is trying to re-create itself.  We were given this idea of an  "Old America" and it was not a perfect vision.  Today, the authors state that it is time to revive the old "America" with a new identity.  By resurrecting the old America we can start from scratch and build a new nation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A classic and most of the material can be found in some of the standard texts, but I think the best way to learn about the evolution of life on Earth is to read the book from beginning to end.  The authors use examples from several places in the world (in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa) to show the different ways in which life has evolved over time.  This is a very good introduction to the topic for students who already know how to read and do not yet have any biological or physical sciences training.  I have read most of them and the students who have been taught them understand the concepts.  My students have also been very excited about the material and have a much better grasp of the basic mechanisms behind the evolution process 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The history of modern medicine is a fascinating story. But it also provides some wonderful details on the actual processes of medical research in the 20th century. The evolution of this field has been described in detail and beautifully.

I just purchased a copy to keep for reference.  It's very practical and easy to understand business.I recommend this book to anyone who has already started a business.The author describes the "business fundamentals" which make you a success.  However, he provides real-life examples of the "hard business"

From there, the text gives useful tips and tricks as well as some guidelines for creating your own models 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best things I've read recently is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain.  While many other Twain books have been very good, I have to admit that Huckleberries has the best of all of them.  Unlike most of the other Twain works I have read, I didn't feel cheated when I read it.  Like I said, I've enjoyed all of the Huckleby books, but Hucklebury's has more adventure, more wit, more humor, more charm, and a better sense of his characters.  In all, I consider Hucklebery Finn the best American book, which is not a claim I made lightly.  I'll tell you what, I'm going to buy The Adventures and read it right now.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read for anyone that owns a dog, no matter how old.  I have two girls, ages 9 and 7, and they both loved it.  It is full of fascinating facts, and good ideas for different activities.  The exercises are very cute and have helpful activities. I would recommend this book to any parent.   It also has great illustrations with very descriptive pictures.  Overall, I would rate it an A+ 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has an interesting and useful section on "How to write better".  I especially liked the "how-to" portion and found it useful for writing more specific information.  The most important thing to me was the author's clear and straightforward style and his clear and concise explanation of different types of grammar, word choice, and word organization.  He also provides a short glossary and uses examples throughout the book to illustrate many of the grammatical terms in different contexts.  It is a good reference book for students who are beginning to learn how to write and/or for students in college who need a refresher on how to read.  I'm an English major at a small liberal-arts college and this is an excellent book to use in my writing practice 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book as a kid and the only negative thing I have to say is the one paragraph which talks about boys being dirty, messy, etc.  I still remember this paragraph because my dad just sat me down and started reading the whole book to me.  He just made me read.  This was when I began to understand that it wasn't about the big bad "dumb" boys, it was about the bad little "smart" boys who never learned how to wash themselves.  It didn't really hit home until I read that story of how the father taught his little boy to play hide and seek.  The big bad boys, the ones who had to be taught, had no chance.  They had to learn and it wasno good for them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I have lived a life with many of the same fears I had when I was a child.  I have lived with the knowledge that I would die in a fire if something were to happen to me or someone I love.  And that my loved ones would be torn apart before my eyes.  As I am writing this book I am trying to understand what the cause of these fears are and what I can do about them."  This is an excellent book that helps identify some of the factors that lead to this fear.  The first 3 chapters of this book are about each chapter of the fear and the steps to take to deal with it.  This book is for anyone who has this fear or is trying to find ways to control this fear

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent for someone who wishes to learn a little more about the history of the United States prior to the advent of the 20th Century.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite collection of short stories ever.  The quality of these stories is top notch.  They're original and witty and the dialogue flows beautifully.  I read all the stories before I started this collection.  As I continued reading, I kept asking questions about how to solve some of the problems of my family, and how to find out more about them.  In a way, the stories show that solving your problems isn't the only way, that there's a whole world out there for people who want to learn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an interesting and very informative account of how modern-day science has made advances in its search for the elusive fountain of life, and how this progress has led to more fundamental questions about the very nature of life itself.  This book also has a solid exposition of the historical background that has contributed to this progress.  Much of the information in this book is derived from many sources, including biochemistry, archaeology, philosophy, theology, and history.  However, each of these has been placed in a larger historical context, and given a more positive spin on the search for life in the Universe.  The book also contains a number of useful appendices with a number useful papers on the evolution of life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book on learning Japanese I have seen. It explains basic vocabulary and grammar, but the Japanese style of reading makes it very easy to understand and to learn.  This book makes learning easier than I had expected.  There are also numerous exercises.  As with the previous books, there is no need to look up words or anything in the dictionary.  Just follow along and memorize what is being said to you.  The illustrations are very colorful, fun, and interesting.  If you are looking for a reference book on Japanese, this is the one 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book and a great reference.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing look at the evolution of humanity from hunter-gatherers in Africa to an advanced and complex society.  As with most of the evolutionary stories, there are many questions about how we got here but very few answers.  He covers a lot of ground on all these different points and in an accessible style.  I highly recommend this as an interesting and essential book on the topic.   I found the other books by Rizzolatti to be interesting but not on this topic.The cover illustration and title are very well done and the book is beautifully illustrated.  The cover story in a nutshell:  Humans have been evolving for 150,000 years and from an unorganized and nomadic society, they became a farming culture.  They evolved agriculture, which then led to the invention of the wheel which led to a larger scale society.The evolution of technology led to great leaps in technology and thus, to larger scale societies and greater complexity.  We can trace many of these technological leaps back to hunter-gathers who evolved in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australasia.  This book takes us to the roots of our species as it has evolved.  It explains how the invention and use of these different technologies led to our current state of technology. It also explains the evolution and development of all our current ideas about what is and is not normal.  Some of the most intriguing parts of this book are the chapters dealing with sex and reproduction.  After explaining many of the biological mechanisms of reproduction, he goes on to discuss the social issues of reproduction in our society.This is an outstanding book for all of us interested in the evolution, and development, of technology and society. If you are interested in technology, evolution, or biology, you will enjoy this book.  If you have some other biological questions, or just want to understand the process of evolution in general, this book is a great starting point.  There is so much to be learned from studying the evolution (and development) of technology that it is very enlightening.  In addition, I found that Rizzo does not skimp on the math.  From his math-oriented chapter, you can gain an understanding of how our current technology functions.For those of you with an interest in evolutionary and biological anthropology, this is an excellent book. It is well organized and a very nice introduction to the field.

He explains how the government's efforts to combat piracy, drug smuggling, and immigration have produced what he sees as the most successful immigration policy since the 1980s.The best parts of the book are the chapters about the origins of America.  I was very impressed with this book.  As a long time American history student, I have often been interested in this topic, but it was my first reading of all the various documents involved in immigration policy and the history of immigration policy.  The book is well organized and provides a very useful look at the history and workings of the immigration system. The information presented is clear and understandable.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great.  This is a classic and has influenced a lot of people's thinking about how to get along.  The concept of love as a deep and powerful emotion is not new but the details of how to create it from our emotions and actions are new.  Love is a gift that we all need.  It is a way for us to connect with each other and love is not limited to the two of us but is a universal state of being for all people.  Our emotions are not the way we act but a reflection of who we are.  They are a deep part of who and what we are and we must learn how to love in order to make the best choices in life.  If we love, our minds and hearts are open to the gifts of other people. In this book you'll learn how and why this connection is created and how to cultivate that connection.  These ideas are based on the principles and teachings of the Buddhist religion but they can be applied to any situation.  Although we are often taught that we need to separate the feelings from the actions, our teachings show that this is not true.  As long as we are aware of this connection, it is possible to develop an attitude of loving-kindness towards others.  In the words of the Buddha, "To be compassionate is to feel and feel compassion towards all beings.  To love all beings is to know all beings

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great guide on how to approach your wedding with a sense of joy, contentment, and elegance, as well as a comprehensive look at all the different ways of celebrating the special day.  The author also offers tips on how the wedding planning process can be the most rewarding and stress-free activity for guests.  After spending hours perusing this book and reviewing the various wedding styles and traditions, guests can now plan and coordinate their own events with ease and confidence.  Many of the suggestions, such as the use of a "funeral theme" and "breathtaking" desserts, can be tailored to your own personal tastes and circumstances.  It is certainly a great resource for bridal-reception planning, as you'll find helpful hints on designing invitations, creating the best guest book, and creating a "wedding registry" for family and friends.  A number of pages on weddings in Africa, Asia, and Europe show examples of weddings using African or Asian traditions and customs; some of the tips also apply to weddings in the US and other places.The book was great for the first time brides and grooms alike who wanted an organized wedding planning experience that worked for their individual families.  I also liked how she included a wealth of other information on planning your wedding day. The author is not a "how to" bride, but a "what should I do?" type of person, and provides tips on what to buy for a great wedding and tips on wedding decor and decoration, with a special emphasis on using the right materials for a special wedding. She offers several tips on shopping for a wedding dress and accessories, or how to choose the perfect gift for your loved one. In addition to a few tips on decorating, the author also discusses important ways to celebrate the special occasion of your wedding that will help the guests have a great time while at the same time helping your family enjoy the day

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is one that everyone needs to read if they are even vaguely interested in understanding modern day capitalism.  I have read about 20-30 books on the subject and I still have never found one that does it all justice.  This book fills in the gaps and explains it all thoroughly.  There are some books that have all the right answers, but I read all the same books over and over again to be able to learn about the new ways we live in the capitalist system.  The author explains the new way of thinking and ways of thinking about our  selves and the world around us that the capitalist economic system creates.  These new ways of looking at the world and each other have contributed to the  decline  of a lot of the traditional values that we used to hold dear.  Capitalism is not just a set of laws or a set  of  preferences.  We all have to realize that it was never so simple, nor is it so  permanent.  It all depends on us, on the people who live it  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read in a long time, and it gives a very useful, practical technique for starting a new project.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read so far!  The best thing about this book is the "how to" chapters, where the author tells her own techniques and tricks.  She explains things like how to hold a camera in your hand or how to frame a picture so that it captures the best light.  The chapters are organized so that each chapter has pictures, text and charts, where you can reference your book for the information.  This book is great if you are looking to get a cheap camera, or just trying to learn how to take pictures.  It also has information for those who are serious about taking photographs but are not professionals.  There are some really great pictures and charts available for those looking to learn more.  I would recommend the book to anyone and everyone!  I am currently using this book for my graduate program in Photography

Write a positive review about a good book:   The basic idea is simple.   When a good bookshelf starts to become cluttered with books on every subject, we need some basic ideas to refresh our thinking.  This book was the "kitchen sink" of topics I needed to refresh my mind.  I have to admit that at first it looked a bit overwhelming and overwhelming at first.  But it's really easy to read and I enjoyed every page.  It was a great "getting to know you" book.  Every single chapter starts with an example to illustrate the concept

I was very impressed with this book as it contains many of the key information you need to be able to understand the basic steps in teaching composition and the development of musical concepts.  It explains the theory behind every musical scale and explains how to recognize musical intervals.  If you are a student with a music background, you will be able immediately to apply these concepts to your own composition 
Write a positive review about a good book:    What is it about a child that gives him the ability to become a leader?  How does this happen?  When does it happen? What happens when you're little and there's a bully or an angry mother?  Why does he grow out of this and what's so important about being a boy, why is he allowed to become leader? How does it affect his relationships with his parents, his friends and himself?  I find that this is an interesting read about a boy who becomes a leader

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after a recent trip to Egypt.  I had been very disapointed with some of the books I had read and, frankly, I did not get the experience that Ms. Burchin described in this book.  It was so good, I bought it for my husband and he loved it and I read it to him on an airplane the first time I landed.  And the next time I was in Egypt I bought a copy for my son.  Now, I would not describe this as a children's book, but I could not wait to teach my son the wonders of this place and the history and the traditions of the people.  This book is great for any child who has any interest in history or archaeology.  You will learn about the rich culture and the stories.  In addition, you will find an overview of the Nile and its riverine past, a guide to archaeological sites on the Nile, and even a chapter on how to photograph and photograph Egypt from the air.  Ms.Burchin has an engaging style that is easy to follow

My husband and I have cooked a couple of these recipes on many occasions and both are a hit. My son, 2, loves them and my daughters, ages 5 and 9, both love them! Great cookbook for kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Tens of thousands of Chinese men were sentenced to prison for crimes ranging from theft to murder." This book contains a plethora of very helpful information and examples on the various types of jail sentences and how they affect the men who go to prison. Many prisoners are mentally retarded and suffer from serious mental illness.  Many do not do well in the classroom.  The author explains that when the prison system began to receive much less funding, the system became even more brutal.  Prisoners are forced to work as guards and cooks.  Some are forced into the field and others become suicide bombers. The author describes various punishments and stresses experienced by prison prisoners.  "It is estimated that as many as 40 percent of prisoners go insane.  A third of all suicides occur within the first three months of incarceration." The authors describe the ways that the prison and the men themselves cope with the stresses and hardships of their incarceration.  He states that "The prison system, like many other institutions, becomes a prison of the mind.  People are trapped in a vicious cycle that leaves them mentally and physically disabled, not well trained to live or work in society." The prison system itself is a prison for the mind and the body.  This is an excellent book for those who are incarcerated.  If you have read the other two books in this series, I strongly recommend this one.  It may give you a better idea of what you are dealing with as a prison guard or as a family member with someone serving prison time.  I did a chapter on what to do about prisoners who are violent and suicidal 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I am a Christian who has been through some challenging times.  She has written about these challenges with grace and a smile.   Her stories show us that we can all grow from these challenges, and show how Christ can save us from our sin 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrific read and it covers all the basics of cardiology (as opposed to a separate specialty) along with an overview of cardiothoracic pathology, as seen through the eyes of those who have dealt with it.  The text covers topics such as  angiogram, angioplasty, carotid stent placement, stenting, thrombosis, embolization, hemorrhage and other aspects of the heart that may not be as familiar to cardiologists 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have been married before or have children, this book will be extremely useful to you in the new paradigm.  It will also serve as a refresher on the basics of marriage.  I found this book to be very helpful in helping me to understand my relationship.  Many times I read chapters, and found it difficult to put the book down.  This book was the best one I have ever read.  There is a lot to know, a lot of information in it.   My experience has taught me that my spouse is capable and faithful, that I will always be a part of him in the future.  My wife and I have had many struggles, but we are strong through the good and the bad.  We have learned how to be together through many struggles and have a strong foundation in the faith.  The book does not contain too much theology, but it does contain the basics.  A few things that I did find helpful when I have tried to understand the issues of my spouse.  One, the author states that a person does not have to choose a bad marriage to have one.  His wife did a wonderful job of getting up and moving ahead in life, and in my marriage is not a problem at all.  He has taught my wife how to talk with me and make me better about her needs and challenges.  She tells me that it is ok to be the husband and the father, as she is now.  Another, the book does a great job of helping me understand the issue of divorce.  If my wife can't handle the responsibilities of motherhood or the demands of our family, I have to accept that my marriage was not intended by God.  In addition, I must have the faith to stay in a good marriage.The author has done a great deal of research on marriage and divorce. He uses many interesting and valuable resources in the church, both current and historical.  Although he is not an expert on the topic, he is a very good source for understanding the issues that I face as a divorced man and a married man. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a wonderful addition to my studies.  She describes all of the features of the disease.  All of the things that I had read about in my textbooks had been true.  I learned that when someone with MS is given an anti-virus shot, his immune system begins to attack the cells.  If it is allowed to continue, the result is progressive dementia.  Many of the books I had looked at described this process and many of the details were accurate.  Ms. Eberhardt does a wonderful job of explaining the disease and how to reduce the burden of MS patients.  This was a book I could refer to in the classroom and use to answer my questions.  The examples were clear and concise and presented in an easy to understand fashion.  There were numerous pictures of MS and of MS symptoms.  Some of the images were very moving. Ms.Eberhardt goes to some great lengths to describe a person with MS who is not a bad person.  One of the most helpful things about this book was the chapter on diet and health.  Her description of how MS causes damage to the brain and the impact of this damage were particularly eye opening.  However, I still felt that it needed more in-depth discussions on nutrition and diet.  More detailed descriptions of food allergies were helpful, but were not as thorough.  As she points out, there are some very serious food allergies that are not identified in this book.  MS is also a disease of vitamin deficiencies, particularly in the brain.  Although the body can compensate for vitamin deficiencies by producing more cholesterol, there is also damage to certain brain cells. This chapter did a good job of summarizing these points

Write a positive review about a good book:    As I read this book, I found myself nodding and smiling all the time, I was really happy with my choice! It's a very easy read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The text is concise and clear but also provides much insight into the workings of a large international banking cabal, its methods of manipulation of national policy, and its methods for controlling the political system.The book is divided into four chapters:1) Introduction;2) The Internationalization of Banking;3) The World of the Banks; and4) The Political Use of the Bank.The first two chapters detail the evolution of international banking.The third chapter describes the World Bank as an organization that has not been properly reformed.The fourth chapter focuses on the role the World Economic Forum plays in promoting international banking by organizing the annual meeting of foreign and domestic CEOs.The fifth chapter discusses the development of the bank's "model" for the development model of countries in the developing world.The text continues with a discussion of the impact of the World Trade Organization and the World Banking Organization on the development process.This book is recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about international banking and its influence on the political process in the United States and beyond

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a lot of good info. I wish more doctors would share some of their thoughts, some of the tips and tricks on making the right diagnosis, and most importantly, some suggestions to help with patient's home problems. The information is straight forward but also thorough and up to date. I have been using these ideas to help my own home office. This book is great for the general practitioner to use and to share with colleagues

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the most informative and practical books on the piano ever written.  I have been playing and teaching for nearly 50 years and still use this book frequently.  This is a good basic book for anyone interested in learning how to play the piano.  My favorite part is the index which is a great reference for exercises.  There is a lot of basic information and exercises in this book, but you can also pick up on how to use the music theory later.  If you are just starting out learning the piano then you might want to start with the first two chapters.  One major drawback in the book is that it only deals with classical music.  The first 3 chapters deal with a lot more piano music in general.  Most people can pick up the basics easily enough with their basic piano experience, but if you are looking for some advanced techniques, try the exercises in the index for exercises 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never read a book this good in my life. The authors make it seem very easy to use a negative review about something bad book: The book is excellent, but there's too much info on the market for my taste (it was my favorite so far) and I needed the book for reference!The book contains information about a great deal of information, some good, some not so much. I purchased the book a year and a half after I finished graduate school and now it's my main reference for information on computers. I would highly recommend it as a supplement for someone who's just starting out with the programming language 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, in my opinion, is the best of its kind.  In fact, the only other book that I've read by this author is "The Art of the Deal".  I learned so much from this book, and I believe that I can now make smarter, more financially sound decisions.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most comprehensive histories of India I have seen.  It also presents interesting theories about Indian civilization that are far more plausible than the prevailing myths.  While the basic ideas of Buddhism are generally recognized as correct, this is a great synthesis of Buddhist theories and history.  As usual, Bhikkhu Bodhi is superb.  His research and analysis are first rate, and his knowledge is impressive.  The subject is vast and the style is easy to follow 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book covers everything that you need to know about software development from the book's authors experience. It contains practical tips that you can learn by doing.   I have used these tips in my own development.  I had some great help with this book from Bill Buggis, Steve Wozniak, and Chris Tse. The book is not written in a technical lingo, it is written in the   author's   jargon.  The author can understand the layman (I tried to use my  basic C  programming   to write the book and that helped the author write this book).   As an example, the author states "the  implementation is not a black box, the  data is not  static", and I use this to explain the software  development process 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because it is very well written. I am always interested in the lives of Native Americans.  I like the fact that the author was able to relate stories from both oral and written traditions.  The way he described the history of North American Indians is very interesting.  In fact, I really like the way he wrote about the early settlers.  He described a lot of hardships and hardships they faced.  It seems that the Indians and early settlers had much in common.  After reading this book, you will have a better understanding of the Indian problem

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very good, and I bought the book on the basis of its title, and a review of the book from a recent New Yorker article entitled 'The Art of Living', it gave me an inkling of the value of the concepts that are being presented in this book. I have been reading a lot of the 'Art of Living' book, and it has given me some interesting insights into what the value is of the things that I need to invest my time and energy in, and how I can invest that energy wisely.The concepts discussed within this book are those that I find the most useful for me personally, and those are also the concepts I found useful in my own life

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a fantastic book, but it was easy to understand how the "Halloween Candy" stories of the early 20th century were written.  It was interesting to see how the stories grew and developed into the original Halloween candy ads.  The stories are all based on real people, and most are humorous.  This book provides much background information on how candy companies came about, and what makes them different from one another.  I was very pleased with the level of detail.  Most of the book is written from the point of view of the company's executives and marketing professionals.   I will be purchasing a copy for my friends and family.  There were many photos as well.  A couple chapters were written from an editorial viewpoint (the stories are based on editorial cartoons), and many are short and pithy.  As I read this book, I realized that I have been missing a lot of the history of Halloween.  Thanks for providing this history of one of the world's most beloved holidays 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book, I see all of the  basic features of an infant brain -and they all appear in such a very early stage.  Early on the brain has all the structure it needs to do basic skills but is not yet mature enough to deal with any of these.  It is also important to note that as the baby develops, it may start to learn a few   new functions.  I saw this in my case in a very young child.  She was learning to use her  toy to get to things in her house, but she was only learning this new function on a daily basis.  A friend of mine who has a daughter of the same age  told me that this is true of most children and not just toddlers

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a student of business, business leadership, and entrepreneurship, I was interested in the lessons learned through the lives of these three women.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best one I have read in years. I am still finding new things to add to the text to make it even better and better and be sure that I am teaching the students the facts as they relate to the Bible. I find this to be a wonderful book to read to my child's class. I would love to give this book to the parents of the children who are not teaching, but who do have children in the class. This book contains such valuable insights that you will be able to teach your child all about the Bible and the facts about it and to begin your teaching of the Bible with the student. The book is a great resource for those who are looking to find answers and explanations for common questions about the Scriptures. There is more information on all things biblical in this book than I have found in most of my other Bible studies 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book presents the history of the American Revolution in a balanced fashion.  The book is a great resource for students, but also provides a history of slavery and the Revolutionary War.  I would also suggest this book for students who are learning the history history of science.  All of the primary writers who contributed to the founding of the United States were white, and most historians of science write about events in Europe.  However, in many ways, we can all trace a history from the founding through to present day, and this book presents a clear overview of events and historical development for all the nations involved in the events of the past.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a little obsessed with a lot of different things in my life over the years.  From this book, I have some ideas to get started.

She's funny, smart, and has a wonderful way of telling a little, yet big, story.  The stories are great.  Her descriptions are fantastic.  They're easy to read and follow

It is a great guidebook for people who are learning audio book text but have no audio book knowledge.  If you want to know how to improve your audio study this is a must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received the book as a gift for my 18th birthday from my mother and father.  I read this book over and over and it made a big difference in me.  It is a wonderful story of a man living through great adversity in his youth.  Although he had a troubled past, he overcame and overcame the bad things in his past and now is a man of great spiritual strength and wisdom.  His troubles were real and he knew them.  In addition, his faith was strengthened through the trials.  The story of Thomas Jefferson and his relationship with God were so inspiring and I decided I wanted to learn more about this relationship.  For that, I bought a copy of the Book of Mormon and read the pages of scripture concerning the fall of man.  If you've read about this, the story of the fall is repeated.  Yet there is a difference in the two accounts.  Both are about a man who had great faith in God.  However, the difference in Jefferson's account is that he experienced a change in attitude toward God and his faith in the power of God in his relationship to him.  Jefferson experienced a profound change in his life and the power he had to overcome adversity in order to achieve his spiritual goals.  This book gave me a greater appreciation for the power and strength of God through the teachings of Jesus Christ 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has the most complete and up-to-date research and provides information on each element and compound of each element.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I learned a lot about this book from this class. I was able to find more information about this subject matter from other sources.  While I enjoyed reading this book, the main thing I enjoyed was the author's approach to the topic.  He gives us very good information on how to read and write in general.  I especially liked his advice on how we can make use of the vocabulary we already know and learn.  The book has some excellent exercises.  They are simple enough that you can try them with your child 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I learned a lot about this book, even with its long format. I was reading this book right after the last few months of class, and I enjoyed it immensely. It's so good to have this book in your library, especially for a break!  The book is very complete, and the exercises are challenging.  The exercises in this book are very practical, and teach you how to manage your money, how to maintain a positive attitude, and how to create a positive work environment 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I teach a course on "American Ethnicity." This book offers a good look at the many ways Americans have been in conflict with each other throughout their history.  I highly recomend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author's personal story as a young woman who became an actress is a good one, and her insights into Hollywood, especially the film industry, are very good.  I have watched many of these films over and over as a child.  If you are thinking about making a big deal out of "what really happens," this book will help.  But as a writer, as an entertainer, I must say I was greatly inspired by the author's comments.  Her "troubled" childhood may be the only reason she can write the type of stories she does.  Hollywood has become a big, complicated business with a long list of rules and regulations which the author explains and exposes.  How does the industry work? Is it the same as a small business?  The authors explain how all of these rules can affect the average person, from how the writers are hired to the production schedule.  These rules, plus the pressure to produce films quickly, have caused many actors to become unhappy with their lives.  The book also explains what motivates the average writer and producer 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive work on the subject, with the only new additions, which are interesting and useful for everyday conversation.  I have used the book with my undergraduates at a high school and college, and with my adult children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful, well-organized reference that has a very good overview of all of the major theories of time and space in the world's religions and philosophies.  The author explains the various different religious and philosophical perspectives on time, and the religious implications of time travel and free will.  All of the authors address the question of what a universe must be like if we can act on our own free will, and how they each address it.  Most of these authors disagree with one another on whether time travel can be explained by some physical mechanism, or by some other metaphysical principle, such as the law of cause and effect.  As the discussion on this topic progresses, the author provides the reader with a more rigorous definition of free will that allows for the possibility of time traveler's behavior 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent, and you'll get a sense of how a little knowledge can make a big difference!  I've found that in my business life (and in my personal life) I am making better decisions and being more successful than I ever have.  I have read the same books and talked to my best clients about their successes.  There are a lot of business books on the market, but this one is different in its approach and in the lessons that it offers.  While most of the others focus on what you can change, this one teaches you how to learn the things that you already know.  It is not a formula for success, but a practical, step-by-step guide that I use to help my employees succeed.  This is especially helpful when my employees are confused and overwhelmed with a project or a client.  Some of my business clients have said to me "I used to be so overwhelmed with ideas, but I was able to identify a few good ones and put them into action.  Now I know what my customers need 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the best book I've ever read.  It gave me some great ideas about the "real" and the "illusion" of being married.  The whole story is very well written, and very funny.  I had a lot of laughs out of it.  My daughter who is 9 years old liked the book because she felt the same way I did when I read it.I bought a copy of the book for my mom and my ex-wife when they got married. They did great with it. I will be ordering this book again 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my favorite biography.  It has been a long time since I read anything about Hitler's childhood.  I read about it for pleasure and interest.  The pictures are excellent.  They give great detail about his upbringing and school.  There are some very graphic scenes of abuse and humiliation and cruelty.  A little graphic language in this book.  But all the details of Hitler's life are very well documented.  You learn about his father and mother, his grandmother, his aunt, his cousins and other relatives.  Hitler's father was very domineering and dictatorial.  He would never let anyone talk back to him.  However, he was a warm person who loved his son.  His mother died when he was ten years old.  When Hitler was ten he and his mother started an affair.  This relationship lasted until Hitler was thirteen.  Their child was born in April, 1933.  While he never liked the name "Adolf," he was raised to think he was "Adolph Hitler."  Hitler wanted to be a great man, but he was not like other boys.  Not only did he have to take care of his grandmother who was very sick, he had to care for his own mother who had a bad case of cancer.  She was the victim of a stroke at about age 13.  All in all, I feel this biography gives the reader a much better idea of what made Hitler.  If you have been interested in Hitler's early life, you need to read this book, even though you will not fully understand it.  For the rest of us, the main purpose of this book is to study Hitler's personality.  We need to understand what made him this way.  From this biography I learned that Hitler was a very intelligent child, but his mother was not.  In order to understand why Hitler became a Nazi, one has to see that his mother made a grave mistake and used her son as a pawn in her ambition.  Her desire for power led to him becoming a bully.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read everything from this book.  In my opinion this is by far the most complete and detailed biography of Robert M.B. Deans.  What a great addition to this amazing bibliography 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book, and the authors do a great job of exploring how the media shapes our culture, and our thoughts.  The only drawbacks I had were that the authors had to be very selective in their coverage - only about 20% of the cases covered in the book were actually trials and only a handful of media articles and reviews appeared in the margins.  Overall, I thought the book was very good, and I was surprised that there was no mention of the media in the American legal profession - an important omission.  There is some good information about the media that the reader can learn by looking at the media articles mentioned, but it was all very general.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the ways the media affects American society 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a wonderful collection.  This one is a must-read for anyone who's worked with kids, parents, teachers or any other adult who wants to understand the nuances of children, the joys of life, and what it means to grow up.  The book begins with a great list of definitions that cover all aspects of kids, from their earliest years of development to adulthood.  After that, we read a wonderful mix of real life examples of kids (and adults) to give kids some realistic examples of the issues we face everyday in life.  What I really like about this book are the wonderful examples that appear throughout.  For example, in the last chapter, the author talks about the differences in how parents interact with kids depending on where they live and their level of education.  I found this book useful for my work with clients.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is written very well and covers a vast number of different topics. The book is divided into sections. In sections A - D, the author gives several examples of how we can improve our relationships with our children. In section E - H, the book focuses on issues relating to work. We will discuss topics such as family and work situations that lead to children's emotional and cognitive challenges. The authors cover these topics and many more in this book. The entire book is organized by topic. This book has been very helpful in providing me with additional ideas on how to handle these challenges.I recommend this book to parents, teachers, therapists, and anyone with concerns about their child's emotional development 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a wonderful book, and what a great collection of stories from all over the world. I recommend the book in the summer for the children as well as for the adults who have had to deal with death on a daily basis and are looking for some ideas of how to cope with death.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful reference work and bookmarks are very useful. The table of contents will be of great use when studying.  The index will help in reading the text. The book is written by one of the world's leading experts in the field of child development.  It gives excellent practical and pedagogical information.  I have used this text several times when working with children on a number of projects.  As an introduction to child development, I have also given this text to several other child development experts to see how their own children were developed.  In this way, I believe it is useful for parents as well as professionals

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a delight to read. I used the book as a refresher in the course of my MSc. I like the story so much that I purchased it as my graduation present to my mother. I will be reading the rest of this book with my daughter when I have some time to spare and want to have a nice read.  I'm sure the book will provide some inspiration for parents and children. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best books on the "fringe" I have read. I think they can be read separately from each other.  I do recommend a copy of the earlier "Fringe" as it will give the reader some "inside" information on this area of science and medicine 
Write a positive review about a good book:    These are some very good books.  I have a lot to say, and I've got a lot of practice in saying it, and a lot more time.  That's good news, because I want to be better about speaking

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fabulous resource for the basics of sewing with instructions on how to apply, design, and use fabric.  The techniques used for sewing are easy to understand and are simple enough to use in most of the products produced by women today.  In addition, there are diagrams of how fabrics are laid out and illustrations illustrating the basic forms of appliqués and embroidery.  This book offers a wealth of ideas for basic fabric designs, with instructions for every step of the process including the basic construction of seams, fusing fabrics together, and making cuffs, pockets, and collars for coats, bags, and dresses 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As many of you know, I have been working with a lot of different groups over the last decade in my home school and professional life. This book is a real joy to read, and I cannot believe how much I have learned about different parenting styles and styles of children. I have also learned how to help my kids deal with the frustrations of everyday life. I think my children are now better equipped to deal with daily problems than ever before 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was in college and I loved it. It gave me some knowledge that I had never learned in school. I am learning things about life in the military that I never knew. I also learned the value of a book and the importance of reading. I have purchased this book and continue to read it regularly.  My brother was in the 82nd Airborne and I read the book to him when he was in his senior year of high school.  After reading this book, he wanted to join the Air Force.  Now that is a different kind of man that I know.  I am still a newbie, but I am a better man for having read this great book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers many subjects. The authors use common sense to illustrate subjects that are confusing. This is a great book for beginners as well as experienced people. I bought this book for my first graders 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born in Boston in 1948. I still have some of my first notes of this book.  I have been through life and can relate to many of the subjects of this work, but in my life I have come to appreciate the value of patience. I also recognize that our children can be born to suffer.  When they are born they may not have the same talents as my grandchildren.  Their development is delayed by factors such as their size and the stress of life, by being exposed to too much pain or illness.  Our children need more strength in their lives 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book to teach the basics of computer programming.  Each chapter starts with a few exercises and gives a short review of the topic

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book gives excellent guidelines on the basics of a good exercise book.   I was also pleased with some of the additional information that I purchased.  This will be a must for the fitness fan and fitness enthusiast.  It gives a comprehensive overview of strength training, including proper form for each exercise and different types of exercises.  The book does a good job of covering the fundamentals of proper technique for each individual exercise.  If you are interested in working out and strengthening your own muscles, this is a good start.  Some exercises and exercises in this book could be performed by athletes as well.  Overall this book is great.  I just wish I had more time to read it.  Great information for the average person who may be new to this or may be starting out in the gym.  You will find some basic exercises for each muscle group.  For example "a good basic exercise is the back squat" and "some basic exercises involve more than one muscle group 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that I have found useful.  I have used this book in several workshops for children and adults, for self-study and in my classes.  It contains exercises on many topics.  Many exercises have additional problems in addition to the information.  For example, it describes the role of a book: "It is not necessary to know a particular subject to understand it.  A well-known book, such as this one, is a valuable tool in developing and applying the basic skills described above"   
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read for anyone who has ever suffered from depression, who is experiencing suicidal thoughts or fears.

I received the book at Christmas and have used it with my son 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book and I enjoyed it so much I read through most of it in one sitting.    It was very interesting to read about the different types of personalities that were created on earth at different times in different cultures.  It's really helpful to see where each personality type came from in the past.  I really enjoyed reading about the development of the personality in boys and girls in the ancient and modern world.  The book discusses how people are not born to be like this, but are changed by life experiences and the environment they live in.  A personality type does not define you, but simply defines you through life experience and life lessons.  Personality traits are determined by how a person feels and reacts to things 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an invaluable resource for anyone in the United States, in either a personal, professional or educational context.  The author has done a superb job of giving an overview and providing the reader with a plethora of articles to learn from.  His first article provides a good general overview of the differences between the US and China.  This is followed by his article about "Ebola in Africa".  There are so many other articles in this book which I used in my teaching.  My students loved this book.  I found it to be a useful tool to use in my own classes.  It also helped me in writing my first report on the United Nations.  After writing the report, I began to learn a lot more about the history of the United Nation and its many international organizations.  As the United nations representative to the General Assembly, I was given the opportunity to take part in many international conferences.  Each of these conferences has a particular agenda and has its own organization.  What I learned from this book and the articles in the book helped me make sense of the discussions.  They helped me refine the report and guide my presentations of the report to make it more accurate, to the satisfaction of the member states.  Now that I have worked with the United states representative to many of the international organizations and the United State Ambassador to the United Nations, I feel that I understand how United States policies interact with each other and with the various other countries.  While this is a great resource for international and US-China relations, this book also provides valuable insight on other areas such as the health and medical field, education, human rights and the environment.I also found the author to be very insightful on the US-Japanese relationship.  A couple of my students found this book to be helpful in terms of their own university studies, and the topics were of interest to them.  However, the topics contained in this very comprehensive book are not only of great interest to foreign policy professionals and others involved in international affairs but also to anyone interested in improving or learning more about their own personal, personal, and professional lives 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It covers many different aspects of the evolution and behavior of animals, but it's the evolution of social behavior that is the most interesting and well documented. It explains why animals behave the way they do (and why some animals have many more offspring than others) by showing that it's not simply about the genes that cause these behaviors - rather, it's a matter of how that behavior is learned.  Many animals have been shown to respond to social influences, and some have even developed the ability to learn new behaviors.  Most importantly, it looks at how animals have responded to environmental change through their evolution, and in particular, the consequences of the major climatic shifts that have taken place over the past fifty million years.  It also looks at ways that new species are evolving through "natural selection" - the process whereby genetic changes are passed from one generation to the next.  This is very interesting because it takes into account the effect of genetic diversity on a species and looks at which traits make a difference (e.g., the ability of an animal to survive in a new environment), the differences between species that result in differences in the kinds of adaptations that are made, and how different species respond to environmental challenges.This is a superb book, especially for those who are beginning to delve into this area of study

It's great for anyone, especially people in the industry.  Lots of action, fun, action-packed, lots of action pictures!  It is a real page turner!  I bought this book for my friend who has just started at her job.  The pictures in the book are so good and funny.  And she has done such a wonderful job on her research.  Great job.And it's just plain fun!  The whole book is great, you really have to read this one!  Not a word goes by without the humor or action.  If you are looking for a fun read and some laughs, pick this up and be entertained 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My 5th grade history class got this book.  We read this book several times over the course of the year and loved it each and every time.  The stories, from the beginning of time to the present, were amazing.  Many people thought history was boring, but it was actually the most exciting subject I've ever studied!  The class had a lot of fun learning the history of the world.  A student wrote a positive book review about  my copy:  This book is one of my favorite classics from school.  It is the best book I've had in my grade.  I have read the book over and over again.  Each time it is a little different, but the main themes and stories remain the same

Write a positive review about a good book:   First of all, I love the format of the book. I really enjoy the ideas and concepts used in the book, including the idea of a set of five "rules" that a person who is trying to change his life is required to understand.  The author really helps you understand what you need to change and what is making you stuck.  As I said, you will have tons of ideas for change and ways to make change 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book as an adult, and found it a very enlightening read!  I had been through many changes and was starting to understand the importance of being a caring parent.   She gives great examples of how to care for your child, with the help of various books, activities, and websites 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is GREAT! I wish I read it before I went to college. I've read other books and thought about them, but I thought I'd really get an idea of what it was like to be in school, and the work environment, and to have parents who have a different outlook than mine.  My mother was a secretary to the Navy and my father was an engineer, and both of them were very practical and didn't want to invest in their children.  They wanted us to go into professions that would lead to good salaries, and we chose journalism because I have a lot of confidence in my writing.  Both parents are retired now and are still very active in their own lives, and I've learned a lot about family values.  I've also read more about education and about what it is to work at a newspaper

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is an excellent read about the early history of the Chinese empire in Central Asia. The chapter on the Kushan empire is a great guide on the history of Central Asia in general, and on the Chinese in particular.  I read all the details in the book (including the dates), and found the book to be great to read on my way to reading the History of Central Asian Minor by Daryush Mozaysh.  The Kushan Empire is described very well in the Kushans' own words, and also in the many chronicles of the ancient Greeks that refer to them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful novel that gives a good sense of the struggles and challenges faced by the various clans of the O'Bryan in the early nineteenth century.   Each clan was defined by its particular form of religiosity, its particular understanding of the world, and its particular method of fighting against their enemy.  There were three main religious leaders in the O'demari: the patriarch, the leader of the priests, and the leader  of the warriors.  I was greatly impressed with how each leader portrayed his vision of the God to which they adhered.  The O'Brien's clan's vision of a higher God gave them the ability to combat the clan's   physical    enemies in the most brutal manner, but their religious faith created a weakness in the clan as well.  Despite their physical power, the O'semari are spiritually weak and vulnerable.  Even though it seems obvious that each warrior should take a position of power within the clan, their religious beliefs and the   way they conducted themselves undermined the concept of their God and the clan.  It was only after the collapse of the clan system that the O.Briens discovered the true meaning of the name, Odin.  While Odin's original religion of Odinism was one of conquest, it was also one of submission.  God had come down to earth and created a new kind of god and a new way of fighting.  By giving up the idea of physical combat, and thus of the war that would define the clan for the next two hundred years, Odin made the O'temari the perfect clan to lead God to His people in the West.  For the O', the God of death, of destruction, of fire, and of peace, was to be reborn.  In fact, it is in this spiritual struggle between the warrior God and God of peace  that the story of O'BRYAN begins.  This battle was not fought on the battlefield, but on the fringes of the human world and by the human race.  But, because the clans had developed religious belief and belief in the warrior god as their God, they were doomed  to defeat by the warrior gods, God of the Earth and God  of Men.  At the beginning of this story, there is a glimpse of the future in the battle of Ragnarok.  When the O had the upper hand in the struggle to defeat their god, they fell  back on their
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a Christian who believes that God has a plan and that God will save you and you can believe that he is the only god, who is he to be disappointed about the mess we are in today?  If God exists, who are you to do a better job than to tell you what God wants for you and your family?  For me, this book is not only the best Christian book I've read but one of the best books I've ever read.  If your current beliefs are in question or need a refresher course, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is about a simple thing but, in many ways, has been a life saver.  I have used this book to track all my finances, my health, my savings, etc., all in a way that has increased my ability to keep my eyes on the prize.  The exercises are fun and doable and give you an overview of your current financial situation.  But this book, like my program, is not for everyone.   I would suggest the following resources if you need further help:  First, you may wish to see a copy of this book on the shelf of the library.  Then, take a course in Personal Finance

Write a positive review about a good book:   In addition to providing useful information about the history of money, he also provides a fascinating look at a number of American presidents from 1776 to present and presents historical money questions.  While many of his examples are of interest, he devotes a great deal of time to the Federal Reserve System and is able to explain how it was founded.  This book has helped me understand the Federal Reserves, and I have written two academic papers based on a Federal Reserve textbook.  The book is an excellent resource for students, and all grades 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a beginner to programming for more than 10 years.  The information was very easy to follow.  I learned how to code by myself.  It is not an introduction to programming.   It teaches what can be learned in a class or from books, but also includes coding examples on a web site 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great resource for new parents.  I bought it just as a refresher.  It's funny and practical.   It gives some very good ideas for how to make a baby (or child) more independent.  The baby section is really good, and the chapter about taking care of babies and children is one of my favorites.  This is a book for all new parents

I was amazed at her ability to read so well and her ability in math and reading and spelling.  We started the book with a math problem and I got excited to see her solving the problem.  She has been able to solve the problem in her math and spelling classes.   She just got better and better in math 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read other accounts of the battle, as well as the biographies of the commanders, which I found to be fascinating. The battle was fought with extreme precision. Many of the troops were commanded by officers who would later become famous. One such commander was Colonel Richard Roberts, known as "Cubby".  Roberts was a major in the British Second Army at the time.  The Battle of Passchendaele was a triumph of tactics and logistics, a major turning point in British military history. The British army had been forced into a hasty retreat, but the British lost badly.  Two British divisions were captured, and one of them, the Third, was badly mauled in the battle and was destroyed by the German infantry.  General Sir Alan Brooke's army, although well-supplied, was defeated. It had suffered heavy casualties, and was forced to retreat back to Dover. The German offensive against London began. The siege of London lasted for the next seven weeks. There were fierce battles at Northampton and Tewkesbury, and then, with no further major resistance, the British were victorious. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to this book after my first child was born, and she was a great joy. I've since given it to my other 3 children as well. I was so pleased with the explanations, especially for such a young child. I have a great appreciation for all the different types of things we've had in our lives so far, and why those choices affected the way we were with our children. The book also has useful tips on reading to your babies, and for the older children as they begin to interact with others.  Overall, this was a wonderful and inspiring book. I also enjoyed the illustrations. They are beautiful.  I enjoyed this book so much that I have made a number of copies for my children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was so much fun to read.  It was a fun read for all ages.  I loved the whole book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is a little more graphic than I expected, but there is a wonderful story in there about a real American hero, John Wayne.  This book will keep you guessing what will happen to Wayne as he nears 100 and when he will die.  It also has a strong storyline about a young boy named Mikey who is very sick, and a young man named John Wayne who is dying.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first of his novels I've read.  I found myself interested in this book after reading The Great Gatsby.  Both books share a love of the  American Southwest and a love for the author's native  California.  The Great Divide  was originally published in 1940, and tells the story of two  travelers who are traveling along the same route in different ways,  yet both find themselves at odds with  the time and place they live.  They both feel the need to leave behind their comfortable lives  to travel far afield.  This journey of discovery starts off in Los Angeles, the  gateway to Mexico.  These two travelers meet a little boy named Josef who claims to have the power to fly.  Unable to convince Josef's family  of this assertion, they are given a warning not to trust  their neighbors.  Later on in this story, Josef travels to a distant country to visit his uncle, who has been working for years on a giant secret project.  One of the workers in this project, named Peter, is a man who has the ability to make his eyes glow.  He is a secret government agent who goes by the alias "Davos." The rest of the book follows Davos as he travels across the border  in search of the man who is responsible for the glowing eyes and other strange abilities.  Peter's job is to kill the President of the United States, and this assignment falls to a young woman named Melinda.  While Peter is off killing Presidents, Davos is trying to prevent this mysterious project from coming to fruition 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm surprised how many people I know are interested in this subject, but we don't usually discuss it!  I love this book!  It really brings it to life in such a easy to understand way.  This book will help you improve your writing skills.  I have used it in my writing class as a guide for example.  It's also used as an example in my graduate writing class 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. I have read it 3 or 4 times and it keeps my interest for the story.  My only complaint about it is that I wish it had been written 20 years ago.  However, I enjoyed reading this book in preparation for my law exam in my senior year in college.  I had to read a lot of texts before I could pass the exam.  Now I have passed the exam, and it's been a great refresher.  Thanks for sharing your life.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful story 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I teach first grade.  The story follows the lives of two young people.  Their parents, father, a school bus driver, and mother, a high school administrator.  Both parents struggle to raise three children, with little financial aid.  When the boys' school schedules conflict, they make excuses to visit each other.  They go shopping together and do crossword puzzles.  Each of the boys is a member of an elite school baseball team, and both are struggling with what their parents expect of them.  A boy, named Michael, is an athlete who doesn't like to practice his hitting or fielding because he can't handle the pressure of hitting in front of the whole school, while a boy, called Johnny, can't hit, or doesn't want to, because his grades are so poor.  Johnny wants his father to come home from work, but the father tells his wife to leave him home.  At the end of the book, both the boys find solace in a relationship with a female schoolteacher.  She shows them how to be parents by making sure they are feeding the children and doing the homework.  Michael's sister, Lisa, becomes a high-school principal, and Johnny and Lisa become best friends.  I have taught many students with developmental disabilities over the years, and this is a very insightful and realistic way to look at their problems.    This book has given me hope.  With a little help, I believe the next generation can succeed.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I first read this book when I was in 8th grade. I still remember reading it over and over again. When I was a little girl, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I also knew who my father was, and so I wanted my father to be the role model I wanted him to be.  I didn't want my father's job as the director of the school newspaper to be a reason for me to become an overweight teenager.  Instead, I wanted a newspaper job that would help me do my work as a journalist.  This book did the trick. It helped me realize how little I knew about my father.  He was a big talker.  But in his life, he never talked about his weight.  His weight issues didn't define him as a man.  When he was struggling with weight and his health, he was a model father. He did his best to make sure his children had good parents and good friends.  Even after he passed away, he worked to make a difference in people's lives.  And he was able to talk about his own weight issues in such a positive way that he was seen as a role model 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book for those that are new to yoga.   The pictures and exercises and instructions are easy to understand and the examples are great and the text is a breeze to follow.  The book gives great advice on how to stay in shape without the gym.  If you like the exercises in this book but you have never done the actual moves you can still get some practice in with the exercises.  This book is also great for those who want a basic beginners workout.  I am learning a lot with this book and I find it is a lot more fun to do the exercises than to watch the pictures and videos.  Overall this is a great book to get started 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am the kind of person who likes history and art.  I had never read "Cicero's Commentaries" before this book, so I bought it and started reading immediately.  Cicero was an amazing writer and thinker, but it is important to note that he was a politician and statesman; he was not a poet, a philosopher or a historian.  His writings on politics and his thoughts on the history of the Roman Empire and art history, however, made him into a superb critic.  The reason I recommend this book is that Cicero was not writing to simply pass judgment on art. Cicardone has taken the time to write this biography in an attempt to give his readers some knowledge of the man so that we can see what kind of man he was and how he could be a better leader and better human being than others who have come before us.Cicardo has done a wonderful job of giving readers a look into the mind of the author.  He did not try to make this biography a straightforward recounting of Cicero's life; in this case, he tried to present Cicero as a thinker, a politician, a statesman and a Roman in all facets of his life.  All in all, a great book that I would recommend to anyone interested in Roman history 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book, a must have for all ages.  The illustrations are wonderful and the book tells interesting stories.  This book will entertain your little one and make them laugh 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book I was able to learn a lot about various subjects. It is short, but has loads of useful information. The chapter on "Lolita's Crimes" is particularly good. In "Homicides" he gives a description of the murders and lists some of the most common items in Lolita's wardrobe. This book, which was an amazing experience for me, helped me to learn about the lives of the people that I was photographing. I have had a wonderful time and I would suggest this book to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and very useful. I used it to teach my second graders about how to do their homework.  We used it together with our third graders, and I found it very helpful.  As a result of the book, my students learned the importance of math in the school.  I used this book to do my job in the library with my middle school children.  There are so many other books out there that tell the stories of a girl and her friends doing their math homework.But this one tells you about a girl who was an exceptional student.  She did not care what other people thought of her, and she had the patience to practice and learn by studying.  Her mother was always there to help her do math problems, and her father was always around to teach her math.  In this book, we were able to talk about and teach this special girl.  What a joy to learn how to learn mathematics from this wonderful girl!

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book and very complete and easy to understand.  If you like the movies, you will enjoy this book, if you haven't, you won't have any problems following along.  In addition to the great books that I am referencing, the other good books that you should be aware of are  "The Book of Numbers" by Alain Locke, "The Bible in Context" by Paul Grundy and "The Gospel According to St. Peter" by William Lane Craig 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so awesome! I love how this author writes in a "real" world rather than making up a fantasy world 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read this book I began to notice many patterns of life that had led me to the same place I am in.  The book has been extremely helpful in my own experience of being a single parent.  There are many tips on how to deal with the many problems faced by single parents such as having little control over your children and having difficulty in finding employment.  I recommend this book highly as I have used many of these tips myself.  It also provides helpful insight into single parenthood from a number of different perspectives.  Most importantly though, the book has helped me realize my need for help.  When I started my own life, my hope was not only that I would be accepted by the world but that I could be of help to those people that I love.  This is an uplifting book for all who are faced with a difficult situation.  One of my favorite chapters is "The Power of Positive Thinking" in which I find the key to a successful family.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn about this ancient and beautiful civilization of Sumerian civilization.  The best place to begin is with the "Era of King Gilgamesh."  The "Eras of Gilgameshi" are described as follows:  The story is about a young man born in Sumer, who lived through an extremely dark and violent time in Sumeria.  As an infant he was kidnapped and sold into slavery.  He was eventually rescued by a warrior queen, who adopted him as her own son.  Together, they lived a life of unimaginable hardship.  Gilgameshin was very strong and handsome but he had a severe physical handicap that limited his learning ability.  After being sold away, he was abandoned by his mother, who abandoned him at an early age.  One day he was found by a fisherman who took him home, gave him a bed and taught him the craft.  Then, at age eleven, Gilgameshim fell in love with a farmer's daughter named Eshmunu.  Eshmunu, who was not only a beautiful woman but also very intelligent, married an officer in her army.  Despite the fact that Gilgameshh was a child, the two fell in deeply love and decided that the best path for their son, who had limited intelligence, was to marry a woman with considerable learning.  In time, Gilgueshi learned how to read, write, and speak.  By age eighteen he was able to travel freely across the land and marry Eshu. The two were married for ten years, then Gilguhi began the "Great Captivity."The first two thirds of the story describe the marriage between Gilguhish and Eshunu.In the third and final third of the book, the narrative shifts focus to Gilgamesan society.  This section tells of the kings and nobles of Sumeria who ruled the land as monarchs and were ruled by a "god-king" named Utu.Utu was described by Sumerians as a "wild animal" with the head of a lion, the body of a fish, and the lower half of his body like a goat.  It is said that Utu lived in a large, open, tree cave.  Utu could walk on the back of his two-headed dog, Kura.In addition to being the "god king," Utu also became the king of the gods
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must for all who are working with autistic children.  There is also a wealth of information about autism from the medical, biological, and neuropsychological perspective.  In this book, the author offers excellent strategies for helping autistic children become more aware of their strengths and strengths.  The strategies in this book are also relevant for parents and professionals working with families with autistic adult children.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, by far, was the best.  I'm giving this book a great rating because it really explains everything we need to know in this topic.  It also provides many other helpful tidbits of information.  The only problem I had with this book was, it is long.  However, it's well worth the effort.  Many thanks to the author

Write a positive review about a good book:   An excellent read for first time vegans 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my absolute favorite. I used to have to look at the pictures of the children every day of my childhood and read the stories. I also loved this book, and when I found the original version in the library years ago, I went to the author and I asked if I could see all of the illustrations. I told him that I had some work to do at the time, and the illustrations really helped me put together the story, which was very easy to follow. I read this book for a college writing workshop (which I passed!), and it turned out to be a great help for both the students and the authors of this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who's child is on the autistic spectrum, or to anyone with an adult on the spectrum who hasn't read any books about their loved ones. I'll be referring to this book often in my own work, since it's so unique. The illustrations are just wonderful. It's a great book for anyone with a child with Asperger's to read aloud. I would give this book out for birthday gifts as well! I just hope that the author continues to write about her characters. I've noticed that I tend to forget what I've read before. I do remember the time when I really needed something to remind me that the kids in my life have needs, too, and they can't always do the things that they want to do. This book gives great suggestions for parents who work with their autistic kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an amazing book. I wish I could have been a bit older than I was but I really loved it! I have read several other books on love and marriage and love and relationships in my life, some of them are not great. However, all of them have provided valuable insight into the relationship. It is good to be reminded of how important these issues are in our everyday lives, especially since I myself have had to confront them myself.  This book has helped me understand my life in general and my current marriage. I found myself learning a lot about the basics of communication and conflict resolution, which was very helpful.  As a result, I have become much more comfortable discussing these issues with my wife and even find myself using them in our conversations 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a parent who has children in school and have not read this book, I highly recommend it.  It will change the way you think about your child.  I got the book the other day and used the examples from a play-by-play for the children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book provides a very good overview of the development of the concept of money as an abstract value and how the concept has evolved.  This book does a good job of describing how the value of money has evolved and explains how and why the concepts are evolving.  The author describes why it is so hard for us to grasp the nature of money and why we have such a bias in favor of an abstract concept, including why we make decisions based on what we consider to be good and bad money.  He also provides a good explanation of how money is a universal concept and how many different forms have been taken over the last 2,000 years.  Finally, the author explains why the concept is evolving so rapidly in our culture and why it continues to evolve and expand.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many of the books you mentioned in your question, and have been able to draw some helpful information on my own practice.  I used to have trouble getting my clients to the end of the book.  However, I found that by simply going through the process of answering questions, I was able to make myself a lot better at my job.  In addition, the book offers advice to clients as well as to teachers.  It is a great book for everyone and for everyone has to start from the beginning 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is probably my favorite biography of Lincoln.  This guy is way smarter and way better than my books.  He talks about Lincoln as if he were writing a biography of a real person.  I didn't realize there were any biographies of Lincoln out there that were actually based on historical research.  And this one is not only written by a historian but by Lincoln himself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very detailed biography of the founder and chief of the Mormon Church.  In addition, he gives a detailed historical synopsis of the rise of the Church in the 1800's and provides very informative background information on other early Mormon Church leaders.  He gives interesting historical accounts of the early Mormon pioneers, the Mormon Battalion, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  This book provides a very complete history of the Mormons and is very well illustrated.  I learned a great deal about the early Mormons from this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The author has given a good explanation for the current and previous political struggles of the Jewish people.  He also has given excellent information on the current political situation in Israel.  The book is divided into two parts, Part 1 and Part 2, dealing with the different Jewish religious traditions.  These sections are great in that the author gives a good overview of each of the religions.  I learned that many aspects of the religious texts can be applied to current political and socio-economic trends in Israel, but he also includes details on the history of each religion and their leaders, in a way that helps the reader understand Jewish religious culture. The author also covers the history, the current state of Israel, as well as the various religions within Judaism 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good book, with a very clear definition of the term "Hate Crime".

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book I've read on the topic.  There are many good books written on this subject, but this is by FAR the best.  The only problem I had with this book is that it is written in a much shorter format than the other books.  However, the information contained in this book provides a much more comprehensive and comprehensive approach to this topic than the book written on the same subject by the other authors.  I especially enjoyed the fact that this book contains recipes and has pictures.  This makes the book much more interesting and enjoyable to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite novel in this series is "The Lost Years."  This is a fantastic exploration of the roots of our society and our way of thinking.  It's not a love story, but a true historical account of how and why the British Empire in the early 20th Century, the very embodiment of all of the evils that modern man can inflict on himself and his world, has been forced to change its way of life.  "The British Empire" is an example of how a nation can turn from a land of peace to a land where it is being forced to fight.  This novel is the best book I've ever read that tells the tale of the early days of the British in India.  I could not have put it down and enjoyed the experience any more.  A must read for the history buffs, but also anyone that wishes to learn about the origins of Modern Europe 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have ever read.  I read it over lunch on my way to work, and I was so inspired that I decided I had to write.  The pictures of animals are so beautiful, and the way the writing flows is so easy to follow.  Most of the animals have names and personalities that are very much like us, but some are very different, and some just have a name but little history.  These animals are truly the wonders of nature.  All I want to do is write about them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born in the early 80's and did a lot of growing up. The children of my generation were very different from my parents. I spent many hours talking to my grandmother and my uncle.  This book was a real eye opener for me.  I also learned the word "narcissism" which was such a valuable word and it helped me understand how my grandmother was different and who my father was 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very helpful and informative.  If you like the TV show "Seinfeld" I think this book is a very good follow-up book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. I was born in 1980 in England. My family moved in 1986. I went to an English school for 5th graders and 7th grader, where we were required to read all the books that were on the subject. We did so very well.The main reason I purchased this book is that I have a friend with cerebral palsy (she is the same age I am) who is a gifted child who was placed in a special school. She does well in school, but her education has been limited by her condition.She has a very bright future. She has been allowed to learn all the other books that she reads (except a few I didn't read), so I thought it would be good for her to learn about this. The other reason that I bought this book was because I am learning a lot about a particular aspect of life with cerebral pudendal disorders - their education. She is an example of someone with cerebral disorders who learned all the right things about her condition - and she has a wonderful life! The other reasons that I liked this book are that I thought I might learn something useful about my child. I thought that this book would help my child as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic. It has lots of recipes and ideas that I have used with great success. I used the book as the basis for a 2 day cooking class in my home class.  It also helped me through a difficult time in my first year at college.  After studying this book I decided to make my first attempt at a recipe from this book and that turned out to be wonderful.  This is the book to use for your next cooking class or to cook for your family.  All in all, it is a great resource and great for learning new cooking techniques or to expand your existing recipes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as an undergraduate, and loved it.  I've never bought another of these books.  They are fantastic, and very accessible.  There is a chapter on writing about the Holocaust that is outstanding, as is the section on the history of music.  The information contained in these chapters is fantastic.  This book has some great tips on writing and how to research.  Most importantly, it teaches students about the basics of literary criticism

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very interesting look at the various forms of abuse. She also has a wonderful account of how she came to terms with her parents' behaviors in a very positive way. She's been through a lot and is in a better place mentally and emotionally now.  The book is about an age group who is often not spoken about in books about abuse.  She explains in a wonderful and simple way the types of behaviors that can be damaging to young children and outlines the steps parents have to take to change their ways.  I found this book very helpful, especially since my stepfather (who is now my husband) has been accused of sexual abuse and my mom has a long history of physical abuse and sexual harassment.  It was the first book I read about abuse and parenting that addressed this issue from a positive standpoint and gave me a better understanding of my parents and the way they behaved.I recommend this book highly to families 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so excited about the next book by this author!!  This is a fascinating and beautifully illustrated book on the basics of design and layout and all aspects of drawing and drawing in general, from the basics to creating simple designs and structures to advanced projects like abstract art, watercolor, and the like.  As an illustration artist, this book is the best I've seen for beginners.  The information and tips are very practical and easily understood by anyone, regardless of the level of experience or experience level of those reading.  I found it very easy to start drawing and learning drawing techniques by reading this book! I also found the design examples very useful as reference and practice.  These books are great for anyone who wants to create artwork of any type, and for those who are doing projects on their own.    If you are considering a new project, or you want to learn more about how to do something, there is a chapter on "Basic Drawings" which covers all of the fundamentals for designing drawings and basic layout principles.  This book is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists who have been drawing for a while and are looking to move on to advanced drawing lessons.  From basic tips to advanced techniques, this is a great book to learn from 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will be a great addition to your current bookmarks or any reference book.  It is very well organized and has a lot of color photos.  I use the photos to add to my grade school vocabulary.  If you have questions about a word or a new concept, just ask me, I know my book is up to date, and has the latest information.   There are many pictures in this book too.  Each concept is illustrated with a picture and a question.  The answers are given by Dr. Dora.  Although I learned all the concepts in this text before I went to grade school, I never really "learned" them.  They just "appeared" in my head, but only in retrospect.  This is a good resource for students and teachers in the first grade or below.  At the end of each lesson, students will learn several new words (I have many questions about all the new words I use in this textbook) 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent resource to help those who are new to yoga or those interested in learning the basics of the art

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book provides great information about how to build a good home with minimal expenses, how to save on a mortgage, and building a retirement portfolio. The author provides some of the best tips for DIYing projects you can actually afford, and for buying inexpensive, easy to assemble home decor items.  She also provides great advice for keeping your credit score up, building a credit-worthy home, building savings, and managing your finances.  Finally, she provides valuable tips for paying for college, college savings, a home, and more.The best part of the book is the recipes.  Each of the recipes is illustrated and provides great insight into how to use ingredients to make unique and tasty meals.  Some of the dishes are quick and easy to make, others are long-term projects requiring the ingredients you have.  I learned new recipes from the book on the fly, using one of my two crockpots that I had at home.  While some recipes are from the magazine, there is a wealth of additional information provided by the author about buying and using the ingredients.  If you use some of these recipes you will be surprised at the cost savings you can get.  The recipes also help you save money, and use the items in your kitchen more efficiently 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born into this family and was very fortunate. I grew up in South Jersey, went to school, became a nurse, loved my children and made wonderful friends with everyone.   This book is a wonderful collection of facts and figures about this fascinating family, and I find it interesting that the story of Abraham Lincoln does not mention any of them.  That may be because he wasn't as involved in his family life as many other people.  He had his two youngest children in his care when he was assassinated.  I would not have had the same life I had without my mother, my father, my siblings and my grandparents.  They made me a happy and well rounded young adult, and as a nurse I have a special insight into my children.  After reading this book I decided that I would like to go back and help out with their care once they have children of their own

Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing style is elegant, the story engaging, the images and stories vivid, the use of color is striking, and the plot and characters are compelling.  I especially liked this book after reading the other three.  This is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time, with many exciting twists and turns, suspenseful plot, and a very interesting plot.  The ending is just right, and I loved the fact that this mystery is about a man who is a murderer who is on the run from the law 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great, funny, informative and funny. I was very pleased with it.  The chapter on Meryl Streep, for example, was very funny.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful read, the first of its kind in the genre.  The author gives his best treatment to this topic (which I found very hard to put down and is definitely a must have book).  The book also includes a bibliography (although the author goes on a bit about this), and also a chapter on the author's experience with women in war and military service.  If you have not read this book yet, I highly recommend you pick it up (this is a great book and well worth your time).  If only you are interested in the subject, read this instead.    I found the book very easy to read and to follow, which made it very easy for me to visualize this subject as I read it.  My son has an interest in the military and had a lot of fun reading this book, and it helped me in my understanding and my understanding of the military service of my son

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I've ever read.  I've been reading this book for about a year now and it continues to improve as I learn more about different life stages and personalities 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best, most complete, and most thought-provoking discussions of the topic I have encountered yet.  It is truly unique in that it is both a descriptive work and an attempt to classify and explain all of the phenomena described in it.  Each chapter provides an introduction and then a discussion of a subset of a larger category.  The chapters are organized chronologically (a sort of "thesis") and the first 10 are the most comprehensive.  However, each chapter of the book is also a useful reference work and provides further insight into the various phenomena and their associated causes.The book also contains a very complete list of references and a bibliography.  As well, this edition includes a chapter of photographs that serves to illustrate various aspects of the subject.  An afterword lists some examples of other books that deal with the same topic and discusses the results of their research.  I particularly recommend this edition to those interested in the subject of space exploration.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book of the O'Neills. I have bought and read several copies of the first volume and enjoyed it immensely.   The O'Neill book is a delightful blend of humor, history, biography, and practical advice.  I bought a copy of this book for my husband after his birthday.  It has had an immense positive influence on both of us.  This book also contains a lot of interesting historical information regarding the O'donnell family.  There are a number of pictures of family history, and photos of the old O'donell home.  The home is located just west of the Mississippi river in Westport, Vermont.  They lived there from 1849-1947.  While they owned a home in Eastport, NY for nearly a decade, this home was the center of the family.They had a beautiful home, a big garden, and a large number of bookshelves.  As a child I thought their home was very charming and the family did have a good sense of humor.  My husband, who is now in his mid-30s, and his father loved reading this book and loved spending time in the home.One of the main reasons I decided to buy this book was the fact that I was taking a history of the United States History textbook course at the high school.  One of the problems the teacher had was that the students did not really have a grasp of the country history.  Many students did know the names of famous people, but this book gave a general history of Americans.  From the United Kingdom, a history which the students had a much better understanding of. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn about American History. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had this book in my library shelves for years now. I'm a huge fan and recommend it highly.

She is one of the funniest authors I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the most excellent books I've ever read!  The authors do a fantastic job of presenting a concise and easy-to-understand review of the key theories of thermodynamics, including those concerning entropy, Hamilton's principle of least energy, entropy in chemical bonds, entropic and kinetic energy, and the Boltzmann distribution.  It should be used by undergrad chemistry students and graduate students 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best biography I've read about the legendary baseball player and pitcher. I enjoyed the narrative style of the book. I especially liked the narrative of Ruth's marriage to Lou Gehrig, and Ruth's relationship with his family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a member of a Christian church for over a decade and a Christian for over 15 years.  I've read through all of his books and have enjoyed them all greatly.  He gives the reader the tools necessary to be successful in this world.  The Christian religion is the only religion I know that does not teach false doctrine.  What he teaches, however, is what the majority of people believe.  This is because he is the "one true prophet", as the Bible refers to Jesus.  Yes, he has a lot of critics, but the Lord Jesus Christ is the author of all of the Holy Scriptures, and not God or a man.  Thus, he is able to correct his followers on many issues and to give new insights on old topics.The Book of Mormon is a great place to start to understand the Christian religion.  It has some very good things that you won't find in most of the Christian books and is not overly complicated.  In addition, it offers many new insights into life and Christianity as a whole.  Many Christians I have come across have become confused about the Bible.  Some Christian books teach that Jesus is the Lord but not the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit.  While the Book of Moroni makes it abundantly clear that the Father and the Son are one.  One cannot have the Father without the Son.  To quote a Bible verse about this doctrine, the Lord's witness in the Book is: "I am Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God, the Creator and Redeemer of the world.I am the light and the life. The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three. The Son is not a creature; he is God, and the Father is not God. I am the Savior, the God and Father of Jesus Christ."

Write a positive review about a good book:   An extraordinary tribute to J.D. Salinger 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author has written a wonderful story about the death of his father.  The story is narrated by one of his sons, who was very young.  However, the book is written with great care and affection for the family.  I've read other books of this type, but this one has given me a much better understanding of what a very difficult time my father had.  He had no support system, and suffered from mental illness that he didn't understand.  Although he had many good friends, many of them did not help him with his issues.  My father suffered greatly from this illness, which led him to commit suicide in 1994, not long after his 37th birthday.  It took many years for him to finally get better, but many of my friends who were close to him were not able to help him.  One of the characters in this book, Mike, is my father's best friend.  Mike and my father used to work together, and Mike was able to keep my father from hurting himself in many ways.  In my father-in-law's eyes, Mike did everything he could to help my father and his family. Mike is described as "a good guy", but he has a difficult personality that doesn't always play well with others.  After Mike's father passed, my father made many mistakes in his life, and in my opinion, the author is right in depicting the man my father really was.  A tragedy of his life ended up creating a great family.My father also used to suffer from many other medical issues. However, these were rarely mentioned in this particular story.  Instead, Mike has to tell the story and is allowed to tell what his life was like at that time.  This book is about two brothers who were extremely close.  They were both my great-grandfathers, my grandfather and my grandmother, my mother, my aunt, my uncle, my wife, my friends, my family, and myself.    My mother was pregnant for a long time and I was born at 34 weeks, and I survived because I had a little brother named Mike.  Both my grandmother and my mother were extremely sick, and my grandfather died when I was in my 30s.  These two men suffered from chronic illnesses and they lived alone for years.  When my father passed away, his death was really a shock to me.  Even though my father did not have any medical support, my sister
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is excellent. It has a good blend of current topics and historical information.  The index lists books which have the information in them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   this book was extremely helpful. I have done lots of reading about the history of India and had always been very puzzled by the claims made about the 'Museum' at Kala Ghoda.  I began to read this book for a new approach to this subject.  It is a fascinating read and has many useful ideas.The book starts by explaining the origins of the'museum' in the 19th century, and describes its development over time.  The book is not an attempt to prove or disprove a theory of the museum.  On the contrary, this is a thorough and well documented work.  This is one of those books where the author actually demonstrates that the 'official history' was only half correct 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful book that explains the psychology of human interactions.  Its not only great for the beginner-to-intermediate level but I found it to be a very helpful text as I try to keep my business going.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been searching for this book since I first read about the destruction of the American West during the 20th century.  I was pleased to find it in a new, comprehensive edition.  This book is the result of an extensive and thoughtful research project of the author.  He covers the West in a balanced and meticulous manner.  Most of the information here can be found in other sources, but he has done his homework.  His research has revealed important information about the origins of the West and the consequences of western expansion in the 20 century. Many of the facts in this book could have been easily obtained if the author had not searched for them himself. The book offers a number of recommendations for the further development of the study of history in the West.  It is divided into four parts.  The first describes the growth of the westward movement.  For the next three chapters he describes the development of major West Coast cities in relation to their environment.  Part two details the growth and development of West Coast industry.  Then part three focuses on the development and influence of the California gold rush, which was the most powerful influence in the growth (and eventual demise) of the state of California.  From the early 18th century through the 1820s and 20s, the author presents an examination of some of the most influential West Coast politicians.  After a brief account of the development, occupation and decline of the Sierra Nevada, the book turns to the formation of the city of San Francisco and the growth from the 1870s on.  Finally, he presents a brief history of the end of the gold rush and the rise of the United States westward.In his introduction, Mr. Zahn offers some basic advice that I think is very important for researchers:  In seeking to answer the question of what has gone wrong with the West, do not be too eager to use one theory of development  or another.  There is simply no need to use only one approach.  Instead, each approach has strengths and weaknesses.  Therefore, it is important to look for the best theory that will explain the problems of the modern west

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fabulous book. My son is 5 and loves this book! I bought it on Tuesday and was reading it over the weekend. My husband has a 5 year old and was looking through the pages. It is very descriptive of each animal. He loves it. My 5 year-old is looking at pictures as well and has learned to name the animals and the things in the pictures. It has also helped our son with math and has shown him how to use the pictures in his books 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Great gift book for young people. Lots of ideas on how to create a good story, and how to write a good review about an interesting book: I am a high school English teacher and teacher of creative writing.  I have taught many creative writing workshops.  Most of the workshop participants have written novels, plays, essays and even short stories.  Some have written poetry and short stories and poems of essays and essays of plays and plays.  Many of the kids in my creative writing workshop have written fiction based on an assignment or project that happened to them.  When I first read "What Makes a Good Story," I was very impressed with the concept.   Most people think that good stories take place in the present or the future.  This book offers practical techniques and examples of how to structure your own stories, and discuss what makes a good plot.  In addition, there are some tips on how and why to structure and create a great plot. One of the major ideas in this book is how to identify your "star" characters in your story.  Good fiction is character study, not plot study.  You can identify your protagonist by their voice, by how they look or by their actions.  The reader must identify the author 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book after studying many of the basic principles of tai chi.  The main idea is to use the principles of the original style of tao chuan to develop your own style of movement.  As a student I found that the style of the book was easy to follow and practical.  I was surprised to find that it covered tai chuan in detail in a reasonable amount of detail.  Although the book is only 75 pages long, there are over 50 photographs and illustrations that cover the basic movements.  There are also many exercises with a variety of applications in the book.The basic principles are explained in simple English and then applied to various movements.I found the book's exercises very good.  They are designed to be simple and can be done by a beginner 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised and delighted with the quality of the book and it has been an inspiration to me for my own child.  We love it with our 3 1/2 year old.  I am very pleased with the way it came out

Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is the only book I've ever read that explained the real root of the problem (and how to fix it) - from a black man's perspective. A lot of the "why" is very logical, but it's soooo true, and all the "how" (how to be an educated black male in a white-dominated world) is soooo doable 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great little book, and it goes in depth on some of the common ways that children can be abused, and some of ways that they can be protected, but the main point of this book is that the best way to handle these problems is by providing children with healthy ways to understand the difference between good and evil.  I think this book provides excellent examples of these healthy ways of looking at the world, and how to learn from them, instead of being bombarded with information, or having it all spoon fed to them.  It is a wonderful resource for any child who needs this information 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will help anyone in any part of their life (but especially in this one), whether it is in business, school, or home. It will give you tons of ideas to help you with a project or problem, or give you ideas for a book or a magazine. And the chapters are arranged in categories.  This will help you choose the best book for the problem.  The sections are organized so that you can get a jumpstart on creating your own project. Each chapter contains information about the basics of computer programming (or any new subject) and how to make a good project.  Some examples are easy to follow, others are more difficult to follow. If you are trying to teach someone to program, this book will give a good start 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very entertaining book.   The author's insights and knowledge are invaluable to those of us in the business world.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best reference I have for creating character.  I have been playing for more than 20 years, and have created a number of my own characters.  Each of them is a different blend of the archetypes from other sources.  Although my characters are not always as well defined, the book is still an excellent reference.   It gives the basic rules for creating characters, and the history of how roleplaying and role-playing games have been developed.  The authors also go into more detail on developing archetypes, and giving them personalities.  This book is a must for any roleplayer who wants to play with their friends.  Even better if they play with children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book to learn the basics about HTML and CSS. The best part about this book is that you don't have to know HTML or CSS to learn it. In fact, I would recommend this book for anyone starting to build their first website.    It was great to see the HTML tags and classes laid out in this book.  There are a few more advanced tags in there too (like the <link> element) but HTML is the most simple and straight to the point.  This book has a lot of practical examples and explanations of some of the tags in HTML and some of their properties (i.e. <span>, <div>, etc.).  Also, it has a glossary section at the end that will give you some tips and information about what tags and how they work together.  Overall, this book has been extremely useful for my web development skills.  The only issue I have with this book: the book's format isn't that detailed.  I would love to see some more examples of HTML code so I can try to build a real website using this book as a guide 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read about life in America.  This book gives you insight into how the big changes that took place after WWII are taking place today, and explains what they will mean in the future.  Great for people who are new to America, or who are thinking of moving.   I had this book on the shelf all by myself for a while and enjoyed reading it.  I'm hoping others will, too!  I did not need to learn how to code!  It's interesting to see the difference in thinking when a large percentage of Americans learn code and when they do not.  We were taught a computer-centric view of the future in school, which has been replaced with an awareness of computers in general 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased this book for my husband and daughter and we have enjoyed reading it together.  I have read all of her books and will continue to buy them.  It gives wonderful information on how to deal with problems that occur in the home and in school.  My wife, however, is having some difficulties with her son.  There are some books she likes for that purpose, but I would also suggest this one for the whole family.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A true tribute to Groucho Marx and a great gift for the average person.

Marx is a writer who loves his work, as well as the society he wrote about 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent book, an interesting perspective.  I've been playing fantasy for some time but it always seemed to me that I was missing the main ingredient for a successful story.  The idea of the hero's quest or adventure to the ends of the world are so important in the imagination of the average person and in the imaginations of most fantasy writers.  In this respect, the author does an excellent job of describing this world which has many of its flaws and many of the main characters are flawed but also relatable.  Overall, this is an excellent story which has the feel of a pulp adventure story. It is not the greatest of all the James Bond stories but it is a good story to keep the imagination going and to get the reader involved 
Write a positive review about a good book:   An important book.  A must have for those of us who have been in the LDS Church.  I wish there were more of the kind of things that we did  to make that church work!  I was there for two years and the church was so wonderful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is by far the best book I have ever read about being a man.  Men are animals just like the rest of us, but we get so caught up in our own lives.  When a man goes into the office, he leaves behind a woman to pick up his papers.  She doesn't ask him to take a break from her job to help her mother or father with the grocery bill.  No, the office is the man's home.  The house is his wife's home, and the kids are his family.  So if a man can't help the family, how can he help himself?The only thing that keeps a man up at night is the thought that he is the only one left to do the family's housework.  It makes me so angry when I see guys who work long hours taking care of the kids when they're adults.   It's not right!  When men are busy doing the family work and trying to raise a family, they aren't working at their jobs.  They aren't really doing anything but raising a family.The author says it's no secret that I grew up on a farm.  I grew to love my mom, and I know it's not because I wanted to, I just had to.  But I still wish that I could do what my mom does with the kids and cook the meals.  This isn't something I just dreamed about.  That I could make and deliver a hot meal.  In my mind, she is the most amazing mother in the world.  What I wish I could tell her now is that I know her and I love her for all she's done.  And that I am going to do anything to help my kids.  Unfortunately, she has given up.  Her kids have moved away.  One of them has started a new family with a new partner.  My mom isn't doing well, and she knows it.  Even though she doesn't want to, she's just lost the will to keep going.I've had all these questions for myself.  How can I live like this?  How do I raise my boys?  Do I stay out of the house?  I want to live with my wife and kids like my mom and dad do.  We could both use a good friend to help us with our lives.A lot of times the problem with our fathers is that they have lost the ability to live

Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read this book I was reminded of another great book, one of the few "true" books on the subject.  A great deal of detail is given about the process of the brain in action in its many components and how it works in the developing brain.  The author also gives the reader a look at how the developing child's brain works and what can go wrong with it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the BEST book I've read in a long time.  It has great information on each of the major stages of a child's development.

I'm so glad it has been revised to meet the changing needs of today's families 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a fan of the tv show Star Trek: The Next Generation, I found this book a great way to visualize how we came to be in a space faring universe.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book starts with the story of Moses' wife Phinehas. Moses is jealous of his wife's beauty. This story is one of the most touching in the bible. Phineis' beauty is a major influence on Moses. Phinneas' beauty, on the other hand, is something that the Israelites cannot resist. When Moses was trying to obtain Phineas, Phinees tried to steal the beautiful Phinea from Phineces. The result was a horrible fight. Moses was badly wounded. Phines, however, was not killed in the fight. Phinema, Phinnea and Phineus fought their way to victory. Phinals and his wife Phines are featured prominently in this story. Phina and Phinnae's love story is also featured prominently. I've read and listened to this story hundreds of times and I love the beauty and love of the story. I especially loved the love between Phinein and Phines. Phia and Phini are great examples of God's love and how God used Phinee's daughter Phinean to love Moses. I would add that Phineans and Phinus were part of a group of Israelite women who used their beauty and beauty to gain the favor of God. This love was used for protection and worship. Phius and Phinaes are shown in this book to love God. They use their beauty to bring glory to God and help Moses and his men in their times of need. Phinus and Phino are featured as a couple in the book, which leads us to the theme of beauty in God's creation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title tells you right away what you are about to read, which is one of the most fascinating historical studies on the history of art in the Western World.  This is not just a book about art, however, it is an account of why and how art evolved.  The book is filled with examples of how art was produced in different periods and contexts throughout history, as well as many interesting stories of artists in both ancient Rome and the early modern period, and then the evolution of art from the Renaissance to the 20th century.  For the first time in the history class I took, this book was read and we enjoyed it immensely!  This was a fun read and a great addition to our class

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been using this book for over 20 years to help my clients.  I teach and have also given it to my students.   There are not many books like this one available.  Most have a specific focus and most have a limited number of chapters to use with clients.I have used this book as a reference to explain how to choose a career that is meaningful, profitable and rewarding in addition to being fulfilling.  This book has helped me select career options for my family.  It has also helped me as a client to help me identify what jobs are right for my children.The book has provided me with a set of strategies to work with my family to achieve financial security for our two boys.  They can understand the importance of financial planning, investing and making wise purchases.I use the first chapter of the book to help with clients that are applying to graduate school.  If you have a job interview at a bad time, I have found this chapter helpful to explain and discuss my career options.  Using the first half of the chapter I describe how to select a position.  The chapter provides examples of how to do this with clients in a variety of industries.  Then the second half of this book provides examples on how to use the concepts in the first and second chapter to help clients select a career.  My clients like this book because it helps them think about the choices they are making and why it is so important to take a step back and think about what they want to be in their retirement years.  By using this chapter as a way to select my career, I can see that the steps I am taking to help them achieve their goals are also useful in helping them with their retirement.By combining the first page of this chapter with the second page of the "Career Pathway" book, I teach students how to evaluate careers.  In my experience, I find that this book is a valuable resource in helping students to choose careers that are rewarding and providing career opportunities for themselves and their children.My students also find this book useful in identifying their skills needed to meet the demands of their careers and creating a plan to learn these skills.  As part of the training, my students also use this book to develop their own portfolio.  Each page has a set design so that students can learn at their own pace and build their skills as they progress. The book has not been reviewed before, and I plan on doing this.  Please check out the
Write a positive review about a good book:   An excellent book that explores the differences in children from cultures of Africa, North and South America and the differences from their parents.  The author also addresses the children from the Middle East who come from a culture of war that they do not have the opportunity to experience in their parents homes.  He also provides the children's names of the cultures in which they come from, which I have seen in the media (and in my research), so that children will have some idea of where they are coming from 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent read for students of a diverse range of languages.  I enjoyed the explanations and stories which are often funny, witty and poignant.    One of the highlights of this book is the story of the "Mama Bear."   The story follows a young woman named Mary Bear and her two young sons, Bear, 5, and Billy, 4.  Mary and Billy bear the burdens of their parents' divorce and separation.  They move from Maine to New Hampshire and New York City.  After Mary's mother remarries a man, her new husband remarriages the next two children, Mary and Bear.  It's interesting to see how Mary is affected by her new marriages and divorces.  She tries her best to support the two boys as much as possible.  But she is forced to make difficult choices which lead her to believe that Billy and Bear will not survive in the world on their own.  In addition, she also struggles with her own life choices, both with her children and her divorce.  Ultimately, Mary realizes that life is about choices and consequences.  The book is full of examples of real-life situations and life decisions that help us understand how we make and live our decisions

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read books and articles on the subject of mental illness since I was a child.  When I first read this book I was amazed at the many different and interesting aspects of this disorder, and how the symptoms often coexist with other medical problems such as arthritis, cancer, and digestive problems.  I learned about the neurological roots of mental health issues as well.  This book was a great addition to my library.  It is comprehensive and well written 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a comprehensive list of all the important terms, including all the common and abbreviated ones (e.g.,  "univormer,   socioculturalist,  sociological  researcher,  academic,  historical,  journalist").  He gives us some excellent examples of sociological research on a variety of subjects and provides an excellent explanation of sociobiology.  If you want to know more about how human beings evolved, this is an excellent  text 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author's knowledge of the military, the military culture, and the culture of the individual. He also has a way with words. The only reason why I am giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that many of the facts have been already discussed on the internet and it is a much more detailed look at the U.S. military 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this book. I'm a big fan of Dr. William Masterson as well. I read this book while at a conference on Masterson. I really enjoyed it and I got to meet Dr. Masterson in person and talk to him about some of the things I was going through. He was very generous in giving the time and information he gave me. Thank you, Dr. Drago 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was very helpful and made many points which we could all learn from!  There is a real chance that we are already experiencing life and death in the way that these authors describe it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "discovery" of the Higgs particle, the "mysterious" nature of our universe, and the role of consciousness within the universe.  Everything has a "theory" to it, and everything has "a consciousness" to its existence.  If the theory of evolution is to be believed, we're all born with the consciousness of the universe - consciousness, consciousness, conscious existence.In this book, I learned how a simple "thought experiment" of a person standing in a pile of rocks with only one rock for every one living being can be used to show that we "couldn't exist without consciousness" - and I am convinced that there was never an age where the universe was conscious (as opposed to conscious only of its own "information"), and there has never been a time where the life on earth did not evolve, adapt, evolve.  We live in a time of intense technological and scientific development, but our conscious existence on earth is still primitive.  I think there must be some "consciousness", the "conscious" part, in the universe, but how do we know?  As long as we don't know (or refuse to investigate), the mystery of the "origin of consciousness" will continue to exist.  In this book I learned the answer to that question - what we now call "intelligent design", and how our "life" is a product of its designer.  While our physical reality is physical, and has physical properties, "the conscious mind" is not.  It's the mind of a mind.  That's all.I have two thoughts about evolution.  First, evolution is the outcome of the process of creating consciousness.  This is no small feat - what a difficult thing to "make" evolve. The book discusses this in great detail, and explores the evolution of consciousness.I hope that this book will answer many questions that you may have 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I bought this book after we found it on the bookcase at our home.  It was a great reference, and our family enjoyed learning so much about the history of the area.  I wish the book had an index or bibliography.  Also, the photos in the book are very helpful.  They show the area through the eyes of the people who lived there and witnessed some of its history.  My two boys especially enjoyed learning about the different Native Americans and Indians that inhabited the area at different times.  Although the book is very comprehensive, there are still so many details that the book does not give the details about the many different languages and dialects of this area. This was a wonderful read, and I can see my sons growing up and studying history. The pictures in this book make the story come alive.  The author has done a great job of explaining everything, and he has left out very few words, but he has included everything needed for children to make sense of everything they see or hear.  He gives some good tips on how to teach history using pictures.  Even though the book has some pictures, my husband and the kids enjoyed this book and learned a lot!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives a great background of how and why so many American Indians had developed a negative view of their relations with Europeans. For many Indians of North America, the end of the 18th Century marked the point of no return. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the history of the American Indian and American Indian history. This is the text I used for my college level course on the history and cultures of North American Indians 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was wonderful. I had to read a lot of it, and I was impressed with the fact that I had already completed a basic degree. This book gave me the motivation I needed to get through a major career change.  There were a lot more references than in previous texts that had introduced this topic, and the text offered an interesting comparison of the jobs of a career analyst and a financial analyst.  This was an excellent book for a high school student who had a job interview or other important exam.  I used the information to complete my senior capstone project for a 4-credit honors project 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good guide to the different areas of the book which covers everything you might need in a beginner. You will also find a great index.  I bought this book for my husband and he has loved it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was raised a Roman Catholic, but I can read the New Testament and the gospels with my left hand, because my dad read the Bible to me.  The first chapter of Luke gives us some idea of Jesus' teaching and personality, as does the first chapter in Mark, but we have to do some detective work to find the greek and early Christian roots for Jesus' teachings in the letters of the New and Old Testament.   Jesus is clearly a prophet of God and a prophet for a good reason; and if we're honest with ourselves, we have an obligation to understand this.  Jesus' mission is clearly part of God's plan, and I suspect that if he'd lived and preached in the time of Paul, he'd have been crucified and judged.  It's interesting to read the epistles before they become the New & Old Testament; what a lot of the epistolary writings are teaching is a kind of theocracy that is a type of religious pluralism, not only of men, but also of women and of other religions.  I believe this kind of religious plurality would have been difficult to maintain in any one of the early Christian communities 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a great deal of respect for this author for bringing together this diverse group of African-Americans to discuss their experiences as they lived in an era before mass media, political power, and the "others" that were supposedly their enemies. In this book, they talk about their struggles and successes while sharing their own perspectives on their culture, history, and life as African Americans. I learned that I was not the only person in my family or in my community who experienced discrimination, prejudice, and racism. I began to understand and appreciate the struggles of my grandmother, a young woman who grew up in the 1930s and who, because of her gender and skin color, was forced to flee her home. I have read a great many books on the topic, but none have really touched on these struggles and the impact they had on her family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very surprised with the depth of knowledge of the subject, and the way that I could relate.I loved how they described what they saw and their reactions. I thought this book was amazing!I agree with what was said earlier about the age old adage - we are what we think. And what we consider to be wisdom can often be the same wisdom that we need the most, to live with others and deal with the issues that surround us in the real world.In some ways this is a "how to" book. It's written in the form of short stories, but with practical suggestions to living in a certain lifestyle.  The chapters cover some practical tips, like avoiding the "one true friend" and choosing to help someone when needed.  I found this book very helpful in getting through a difficult time in my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will take you on a journey into the world of high level poker.  The first 50 pages of the book are divided into 6 chapters.  Chapters 1-6 discuss the history of the game, the history and strategy of the best players of all time, and current strategies.  Chapter 7 deals with the current state of the sport and the current issues that poker faces today

It provides a wealth of information about Buddhism and its influence on the world.  An excellent reference book for people who are new to Buddhism.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a great overview of the many ways in which different species differ with regard to their behavior.   The behavior of each species can be seen in several different aspects of their anatomy and physiology, their behavior can be related to their evolution or their behavior is simply an adaptation to its ecological niche.  The authors discuss some of the differences between species with respect to behavior using simple examples of interactions between animals (e.g. an ant with a fish) and more complex examples (e-book edition) of interactions with their prey.  Each chapter covers some aspect of behavior, and each section discusses several aspects of the evolutionary history of each behavior and the evolutionary consequences of each of the adaptations that evolved.  There are examples of behavior from the most diverse organisms on earth and this provides an excellent framework for understanding the evolution of behaviors in different species 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was born and raised in South Africa, and my love of all things Afrikaans runs deep. My first book, "A Day at the Races" (Aldine) was an immediate success and I have written many more in this wonderful tongue of ours.  These days, I find that South African students are increasingly drawn to Afrikaan studies as a way of learning to see the past through their own eyes.  This is a beautiful, exciting, and informative book.  I have also enjoyed the comments of many of my fellow Afrikaantologists on the work of J. S. Lebrecht, and other Afrikan writers.    In the end, "Myths and Secrets" is a fascinating and insightful look at the development of myths from the times of man's first contact with Africa and Europe and the impact of the myths on the development and growth of Europe, and Africa.  If you are looking for something to teach your children about Africa or its peoples, this book is a must.  A superb resource for middle grade and older. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. I used to have this book for years and loved it as a child. My parents bought it and it was one of the best books that I ever had to read! I have so many fond memories of my childhood from reading this book. It was wonderful and I used it many times throughout my elementary school years. Now that I am an adult I still have many of the same fond memories from reading it. I love the way the author makes this work in chronological order so you can really see how children grow up.  This makes it much easier to understand the differences between my own childhood and other children's. I liked it a lot more as an adult because it gives me a better look at myself and the changes that I have gone through. My family, for example, has always been one of eight children.  We have a lot of different personalities and personalities in the family.  Each member of my family has a different set of values and habits and that makes it a challenge to stay close as a family and a friend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very nice book, and a nice reference book.  I have read it and will be using it as a text book for my Advanced Placement Mathematics course.   I purchased it on Amazon, and am very pleased with the reviews and comments!   The book contains some really nice illustrations that will teach you some useful techniques.  Some very useful facts about the Pythagorean Theorem, The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci numbers, and some Pythagoras's Theorem concepts.  A nice addition to my elementary school curriculum 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never read a book this well written, or with more practical information than the book.   This book is well worth the time it took to read.  If you have any doubts about buying a copy, I strongly recommend giving it a try.  It will give you the ideas to be successful with the children you are trying to help.  Good Luck 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very helpful in my experience in the Church.  I used to work for a bishop but I left the position after 3 years and went to graduate school.  There are not many Church history books that are written for the layman but this one was.  The information is always well organized, useful and entertaining.  It also has lots of good historical information.  This is a book that my wife and I both used to recommend for our young children

Write a positive review about a good book:   this is probably the best guide to being an artist 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a guide to the basic concepts, not detailed implementations.  It covers the majority of Unix processes in detail and includes a full-color table of time-consuming processes.  This book covers Unix operating system design and is particularly useful for those working with embedded systems.  The authors also address the problem of software defects by developing a test suite for a small number of popular Unix tools, including the diff utility and the date command.  They address the problems of managing memory and file systems in detail in addition to the design of Unix security mechanisms.  While the book covers the fundamentals of operating systems, the authors take a different approach from those that typically are written on the subject.  Unix operating systems are not just algorithms and data structures, but also complex applications, applications with multiple processes and data-structures on a single machine.  As a result, the book is well-suited for a comprehensive introduction to Unix system design. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, I have bought several copies.  Each time I read it I was amazed at the many different ways that women are presented.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for beginners! It provides a good introduction to string theory.  The text is short and easy to understand. The only problem is that this book contains an appendix containing a series of exercises and some of the examples do not contain all of the necessary concepts of string theory that you will need to know in order to complete this textbook.  You may find the exercises easier to solve than the text. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read about the Vietnam War yet.  This book is thorough, and includes much information about Operation Phoenix 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a new graduate in college. While writing this book I have discovered a great deal about myself. I would not have found this information unless I had first found this book.  There is a lot about me in this book - a lot of it I had forgotten or thought I did not realize. I think it is so good because it has so much to say and there is nothing but good tid-bits to share. It gives you some ideas and ideas for your future.  A great gift for grad students, grad-student brang-ups, and anyone else who is interested in self-understanding

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best guide to common cold symptoms ever written.  Many cold and flu deaths can be avoided with simple lifestyle changes and simple lifestyle modifications.  This guide should be helpful in developing a strong immune system and good exercise program.   For most children with chronic illnesses, it is especially beneficial.  For adults, the best approach is to get an immunologist or naturopath in-office.  The author is an excellent speaker at many meetings and can also be contacted for more information 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book of true stories of how a woman can turn a man's life around.  If you've been married, have children, or need a refresher course in "The Power of Woman" the only place to find this book is in a good bookshelf.  I purchased it, along with "The New Rules" by Mollena Williams.  They provide great insight and information on how to make the marriage process work.  "The Book of The Power of Women" will prove helpful to both the married and single life

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book provides a comprehensive overview of the "secularization of the religious elite" in the West since the 19th century.  The author is a well-known sociologist, whose work on the sociology of the West has made him a leading expert on the trends in the field.  What an outstanding and thorough book.  I also found it to be a very helpful tool in understanding the reasons why some Christians are able to become "New Age" leaders despite their atheism.  This is a book for all Christians - no matter their age, background, or experience - who want to understand the changes in American religion and society.  From my experience in the Christian faith and in working with people who are involved with the New Age movement, I have learned a great deal about the evolution of American religion over the past 100 years.  Many of the trends outlined by this book can be seen in our own society today.  While it is true that the author was born in the 1800's, he did not write this book until much later in his career.  He provides a broad overview and explains many aspects of this evolution in the "Christian-New Age movement."  This work will be a valuable resource for those engaged in New Age studies and other "faith healing" practices.  It will be useful for "reformers" looking for information about the Christian church.  Even those interested in other Christian sects will find this work to be valuable and informative 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that will change your life!  The author is very honest about her experiences with this illness, her life, her relationships and so much more

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most popular of all the books of her works is her autobiography, My Beautiful Son.  This is the book I refer to all the time when people ask me for help.  I recommend that all mothers read this before adopting or placing children, because the book has helped me many times, even though I never had a child.  Although this book has the most famous image of her son, I felt he needed the most help of all his siblings, and this book helped me through all the difficult periods that I saw my son go through.  My favorite chapter from this book is "When I Was a Little Boy".  In this chapter, my mom writes, "As a boy, I was very proud of my big sister's accomplishment.  In the picture of my brother and me, I thought I could never have done all that I did.  The pictures did not show all my accomplishments, and I felt a deep sense of disappointment and shame.  You know what?  The truth is that my brother had no idea.  He was just happy I was alive.  That was the least of his accomplishments.  As a man, I never forgot that the boy in the pictures didn't look like the boy I am now.  It was just his attitude that was different.  His joy, his pride, his faith, his energy, and his intelligence were all different.I always felt that my life was a disappointment in comparison to my brother's.  What a difference the loss of my baby made.  From that day to this day, I try to give him every chance I get to accomplish his dreams.  Of course he is a very difficult child, but I give him the best chance to make his dreams come true.   I think all the lessons I learned in this book apply to my life now, which is why I read and talk about my children every day 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is well organized. It's clear and concise.

It was helpful for my 9 year old and my 9-year old.  I would have bought this book even without the recipes, but it was a real treat for the 9 year olds 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful reference for an introductory level chemistry course or even for a chemistry graduate level course. I highly recommend the entire book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors take you from "the basics" of quantum mechanics to the very edge of what we know about the universe.  As a physicist, they are able to discuss the basics and not seem to lose sight of the "invisible hand" which, in quantum mechanics, has the power to create the universe and then destroy it.  In this book, they use the mathematical tools we've developed to make the most sophisticated mathematical models possible and discuss some of the most exotic examples of the universe yet.  The chapters are very engaging and will challenge your thinking.  I particularly liked the "quantum mechanics is cool" chapter.  This book has great pictures, and the "how to" section is very helpful. I have read all three of these and I'm still learning a lot

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, though very dry and graphic, is written in a clear, concise style that will help all readers gain insight into the world around us.  Mr. Stoner has written a book that provides insight on all aspects of family life including the role of the father in raising children.  I purchased this book and read it several times over.  Each chapter begins with a few brief facts and then Mr.Stoner takes us on a journey through the daily lives of the Stoners.  He shows the reader how to evaluate all aspects a situation and why it happens the way it does 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic, a must read for anyone that wants to learn how to deal with negative emotions, how to avoid a bad book: "The problem with the book is that he does not give you the right techniques.  I've read a lot of books about this, but this one is the best.  But if you are looking for a book to help you deal with a bad relationship with a partner, you will find that this one provides some solutions and techniques.But, as I said, the book gives you lots of advice on how to communicate with a woman:  It gives examples of bad communication and then uses good examples of good communication.  The bad communication  happens in your own head, and the good communication happens when you understand her and she understand you.  However, a bad communication between two people is usually the result of bad habits.  This book has lots of bad examples 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book to complete my own study of ancient Greece. I was amazed and delighted with the results of my research. The book was great fun and I was able to find out lots of useful information from my reading. I am now able to do my MA 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first chapter starts with a good overview of the state of the art of statistical analysis and data analysis as a research tool, starting with the most popular statistical packages for Unix and Linux. Chapters 2 and 3 present and discuss an overview of how to use statistical techniques to analyze financial information in a number of applications. Chapters 4 and 5 present and explain the fundamentals of statistical computing techniques on Linux. Chapter 6 covers regression models in the context of a regression problem, a large number of the algorithms discussed in chapter 3 have been applied to real-world problems. Chapter 7 discusses some common pitfalls in statistical analysis (including misapplication of statistics to non-routine data) and chapter 8 discusses an example of an error in regression in the wild and describes some strategies for dealing with the problem. Chapter 9 presents a statistical programming language based on the R language for creating regression and classification programs, as well as another version of the regression package with extensions for high-dimensional data. Chapter 10 explains the basics of estimating statistics with multiple regression models, which is a very useful technique for designing regression and multinomial models.  Chapter 11 provides a basic introduction to multivariate statistics. Chapters 12 and 13 present a more advanced statistical approach to regression, and Chapter 14 describes the data structures and algorithms for linear models and multivariate linear regression in greater detail.  It also discusses regression for other nonlinear data like time series, but does not cover that technique in detail. Chapter 15 provides a short overview of data modeling in R, using the model() function, and then goes on to present a complete example that uses model() to design regression and logistic regression models. Chapter 16 describes the techniques and algorithms used by regression, classifiers, and decision trees. The chapter also goes through an example that performs logistic regressions using the models provided with R. Chapter 17 describes some of the difficulties in producing good regression model results with different types of assumptions, and includes a discussion of a common strategy for handling those problems.  A more in-depth look at regression models with additional assumptions is given in Chapter 19.  This chapter discusses the basics in terms of design and implementation of basic regression models and the pitfalls encountered when modeling nonlinear and non-linear data.  Using the framework provided by the model-based regression package, Chapter 20 presents a number regression techniques that work well for large and heterogeneous datasets.  The package also contains a number regressions examples that are run in a R session.   Chapter 21

What an awesome book and I was so happy to have my book signed by her

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first of a new series.  After reading several of the previous books, I wanted to see if I could write a good novel.  I had done some writing before and thought I could do it again.  However, I had to re-read several of Mrs. Williams's books to figure out where to start.  She always starts with a negative review about something and then uses positive reviews to change things.  This was a challenge.  The book was extremely well written.    The plot is fun and exciting.  You never get tired of reading.  There are tons of surprises.  Ms. Williams is a superb writer.  What a pleasure to read!

The book starts out with several different topics.  One is about learning to play the piano, and some more general advice about how to get good practice and how to play more effectively.  In addition, the book also has sections on singing (which is a very important skill to master).   I also found the book useful in learning to read - for both the piano and reading.  Each chapter contains exercises and exercises in various parts of the book, and lists of vocabulary and other words that are useful.  The lessons are interesting, although sometimes the explanations are a bit dry.  Sometimes the exercises seem easy, but often they are not 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very happy with this book.  I would suggest that you read it first and then work it over for some time.  When you have finished reading the book you are going to learn a lot about business, finance and investing.  Then, after you have gotten some experience in this business you are also going to come across several important lessons that you can learn about life.  My favorite part of this book is the business development section which talks about getting more business developed.  The book also talks about the need for good mentors and how to develop good mentors.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very informative and very concise guide to the different styles and techniques in woodworking and how to achieve great results with them. This is a must for all woodworkers, beginner or advanced, that are serious about the hobby. There are numerous woodworking books out there, but this is the best in the field.

Also covers how to get started with various tools, which are all fairly easy to buy in the book and use

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of Dan Wells for many years, but I had not read this collection until recently.  Dan Wells is a master of the dramatic form and he continues to write brilliantly.  I read many of his early works when I was a child and thought they were fantastic.  Many of them are still in print today and he has been one of the best writers of the 20th Century.  His "The Life Aquatic" is in the top 3 of the most admired books I own

Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful read for those new to cooking, or for those of us who have been cooking for years, but did not know much about the science behind the process.  There is also an interesting theory about why some vegetables are much harder to turn out well than others, and how to tell what kind of vegetables are better for making meatballs.  I plan to buy this book to give to my students when they need help in cooking

Write a positive review about a good book:   A unique and very well-researched look at a problem which, for the most part, is unique to the United States, the first in this book (in the previous books) is an overview of the US military.  The chapters on the various military branches are well written and organized.  This is a good introductory book for people new to the military. The military is a "big fish in a small pond", and everyone has an angle, but as a whole this book is a valuable resource 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book starts out with a very helpful summary of some of the basic principles of "natural" evolution.  Some of the concepts in this book are new to me and I found them extremely helpful.  I was also able to learn much more about the history of the development of "evolution" theory and the evolution of "scientific" methods in the 20th century.  The history of science, for example, is often presented in a very misleading way; the "science" that is taught in colleges and universities is just one part of a much larger story.  Evolutionary theory has become the dominant theory in many fields, including biology, and this theory is based on a lot of "logical" leaps.  When evolutionary theory is presented correctly, it has a lot to teach us about the development and evolution of our species.  If Darwin's theory were correct, we wouldn't be seeing evolution in the world today.  Unfortunately, Darwin's "faulty" theories about evolution have been heavily criticized by Darwin's critics.  Many of his critics argued that he believed in a few evolutionary mechanisms and some "theories" that are not consistent with the evidence.  But, Darwin was trying to understand the mechanisms that allowed life to evolve, which is exactly what evolution has been teaching for thousands of years.  Even though this theory was wrong, Darwin believed that there are evolutionary laws and that his theory provides a better explanation of the evolution and development of species and species groups than the theories of creationists.  By presenting Darwin's view, this book explains why the evolution process is based in the principles of natural selection and natural selection in action.  This book has been very helpful to me in understanding the development, history, and theory of evolution in general.  For my final evolution class in high school, I used this book as a reference and was amazed that evolution has such widespread appeal in the scientific community.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very much enjoying this book as an update to my previous history of the United States, especially as it pertains to the period of Reconstruction.  I was very pleased with the research, as well as the style of writing.  The first edition of this book has sold well, even in its revised second edition, which I believe has many new findings, particularly concerning the influence of "Americanism" on American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read on the subject of money.  This book is absolutely fascinating and the concepts covered are really useful.  I would recommend this book highly.  It was really easy to read.  If you are looking for a book on the topic of money and want to learn more about the "business basics" or the "market cycle" this is the one to get.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not only extremely helpful in preparing for your state certification test but it will give you insight into what you need to learn in your exam.  The most important sections are those on business continuity, IT & Network Security, and Human Resources.  These sections are the most important parts of this book.  However, as with many other self-study books, the "how to" sections are very helpful but it is important to read the chapter on the exam itself to ensure that you can do all the reading required to understand the exam questions.  It is not a full text book, but a chapter in which you can review all the questions with the answers to make sure that you understand each section of the exam 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of this series. I first read it when I was studying for my MBA and wanted to refresh my memory.

I recommend it highly to all college students who have a problem with their business 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is written by a trained forensic pathologist, and I recommend it to anyone interested in forensic pathology or any other topic relating to a forensic pathology-related subject.  The author is an experienced pathologist and has been writing for many years and teaches at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.  While the subject of forensic pathology has been the subject for quite a while, very little attention has been paid to the subject by the layperson.  His book is a must-have for those interested in the subject

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and was thoroughly entertained.  My 8th grade English teacher used it in a reading assignment.  I had no idea it had such a strong message.  We were encouraged to seek our passions and fulfill our potential.  She reminded us that even when our passions were not our own, we could still be successful and happy if we had the desire.  It would have been interesting for the reader to know more about how my brother developed his passion for basketball.  Perhaps the author could have added a chapter on this topic.  For example, I have seen him play and do well.  However, the author did not spend much time on this subject

It's all of the "big questions" of life.  From the origins of life to the meaning of life, the origin of the universe, the nature of life in its many forms, the future, the past, the origins and evolution of intelligence, the physical and chemical nature of the Universe.  I'll read them all 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many of these before and will again this year.  They were great fun, and the recipes were simple and easy to make.  Although the recipes for prawns are quite elaborate, I find they are easy and quick to make and are great on a hot summer's day.  The book is in a series of six parts, and there are a great many more recipes in the series.  I found that all parts were well worth the time.    The photos of the dishes were very good, and most were very beautiful.  There is a great amount of food to choose from and I loved the variety and the ingredients.  Recipes for different types of prawn are listed in the book and are easy to adapt to suit the different tastes of the people who like these dishes.  My husband and I each ate several of the recipes, and I have made them several times.  For the family, I suggest reading the recipes as a family and making a small number of pauldrons in one day. The prawn stew is my most favourite!  If your family is new to making prawn, I would suggest that they start with the recipes that I have given above, and move on from there.  If anyone wants more ideas, I'd highly recommend this book.  Great family activity with the kids, and good books.  Very popular children's book.Great for families

Write a positive review about a good book:    Great story about a guy named Joe Bauk who was trying to pick a fight with someone and who was being chased all over his town by these two girls. Joe got pissed off at one point, but he didn't back down. After a good deal of action, suspense, and humor, he finally gets to the truth about his love life.  I like it and have loved it since the first chapter.  He finally gets it, finally.  The only criticism I would have of this book is that it reads like the ending of an old western.  Still, that does not keep me from recommending it to friends.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book that I've ever read that explains the psychology of jealousy to a normal, everyday person.  It does so in an entertaining, easy to understand, and  practical manner.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that is in a relationship.  In addition, I highly  recommend that you give this book a try before you try your jealousy.  If you're looking to understand why you love someone, but find that you love them in spite of their  actions or personality, then this book is for you.   If, however, you are looking for answers about why someone is jealous and how to deal with jealousy yourself, this book might not be for you

I have learned so much about myself, and my thoughts, feelings, and emotions.  The book provides great ideas on a daily basis on how to get things done.  If you are new to a concept or idea, this is a great book to start with.  There is no need to buy any more books on the subject of the Art of Life from this author.  He writes great books and there are so many  ideas on how we can all live better with our thoughts.  This book is a MUST read for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a young adult you might be interested in this novel.  The main character, James, is a self absorbed college student who is having some difficulty with her identity.  She is the first in her family to graduate from college and she is living with her father in a small town.  Her mother, Mrs. Ewing, is the primary breadwinner in the family and her relationship with her husband has become strained.  Although Mr. Evert is a very nice man and has a good job, he is in his 40s and Mrs. James, in her 40s, feels guilty about her husband and daughter's age difference.  So much so that she decides to move away from the city to another small town in Ohio where he works in a large steel mill.  After a while she begins to write a negative review about the unfairness of her life and about how her husband is more concerned about the money he earns than their daughter.  But after one night she is able to come to terms with his desire to divorce her and they come together.  They begin a slow romantic relationship.  This book is about how a young couple's life changes when their relationship grows more complicated 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a GREAT book!! I just had to laugh a lot of it. I am always surprised at what I have learned over the years about the importance of your children. I have read many books about parenting, but this book truly is the BEST book I have ever read on the subject. The photos and descriptions are wonderful. This is the book I wish I had read when I was a young mom. I would have loved to have had this knowledge back then. It is really important 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very interesting. There is a book in my copy of the bible that I was asked to read as a 6th grader that had a great chapter on the beginning of creation, and I was amazed at the similarities between the story and the book of Genesis

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have been following the news, or reading the blogosphere, you have come across a great many  examples of how the same techniques that are being used in many different programs are being applied by large corporations, by the education system, by corporate espionage, by government agencies. And I thought, what if we were to make this one an instructional text, rather than just a study guide?  As you read through this book, you will begin to realize that this is indeed the way that things are going to get worse and worse for our children.  We may not realize it at the time, but they are already doing some of these things, and are doing so in ways that are causing real damage.  It is time for us to begin using the same tactics that these corporate entities have used and we must learn to detect them when they come up 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best reference book on the basics of organic chemistry I've used.  The book covers all areas of organic synthesis and chemical analysis in more detail than any book I've seen.  It also lists a number of "organic chemistry" textbooks, giving an overview of each chemistry text.  While I was preparing my graduate organic chemistry course, I purchased all of this book and read the book cover to cover.  I took the required organic chemistry labs and then read the textbook as well as the textbook text, but my professor's course was written by someone with no chemistry background, which made it much easier for me to learn.  This book is written in a clear and easy to understand manner.  You really can do basic chemistry with this book, it covers basic elements, nuclei, molecules, and the basic chemical bonding rules.  Many other books I've read, such as "The Chemistry of Life" and "The Science of Life", are great for basic chemistry, but the authors don't cover the basics at all.  If you're serious about organic chemistry, this is a good starting point.    If your aim is to specialize, this book covers a few useful topics, such a boron bromide and carbonate, but it's not comprehensive.  Each chapter includes a table with a list of the chemical bonding laws and also a few helpful "lessons" on the "rules" of chemical reaction.  Some good starting "lesson" material for organic synthesis is found in "The Chemicals", but it covers some very basic principles, such "bonding rules".  Some of the books I used in my graduate school were more concise, but they did not cover the basic principles that make organic synthesis possible.  For example, "Chemistry for Engineers" is good for the students who need to learn how to use a calculator and to work with organic systems and reactions, but does not cover basic rules for chemical reactions.  "The Principles of Organic Chemistry" is excellent for the advanced student and covers the basic rules of chemical reactions very well.  But the authors have the same goal, to teach you organic chemistry 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book for fun and for the new information it contained. I also liked the author's other books, in particular The Truth About Murder and The Murder of Mary Kelly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very informative and very well written book.  I would suggest this as a basic book to anyone just starting out.  She has a great way of showing the basics that are essential.  If you are a beginner, or even if you are just a little more advanced, this is a great book to look at.  You can also find a lot of good information in this book. I learned that I have to understand the fundamentals of all sorts of things.  After I studied her book, I purchased all of her CDs 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just read this book and I was so moved by the beauty of the book.  I purchased the entire book and read it cover to cover.  The illustrations are beautifully done.  While I purchased this book after I had purchased my graduate degree I found it to be a very helpful guide to understanding the beauty and the complexities of the human heart.  This was a book that really opened my eyes as a grad student.  One of the things I really enjoyed about it was the depth of description of the hearts of the patients.  They are described in detail and their hearts are described through images, words, and stories.  Many times the drawings and drawings depict the heart as if from another planet and not as an organ that just runs on its own.  Heart disease, like everything else in life, is a result of the complex interactions between the heart, the brain, the kidneys, and the other organs.  It is a complex and fascinating subject that is often misunderstood.  We have made some major advances in heart surgery, but heart disease remains a serious and often misunderstood problem.  Although heart disease is not a cancer, many patients do still die of it.  But I think this book shows us a lot more about how hearts work.  As you read this guide, keep in mind that there is a great deal of heart disease in the general population.  However, heart disease has many causes.  In the section on the human body, the heart is one of the most complicated organs in the body and is affected by many factors including genetics, nutrition, stress, exercise, and medical treatment.  After reading this book, I feel much more confident about my ability to treat heart disease.  You may also find this book of the heart fascinating, since it gives an interesting look at the workings of the whole heart.I found it very inspirational and very helpful for my research.    It was an honor to write this book with a dear friend, Dr. Alan M. Cribb who passed away from heart failure in June of this year.  Dr. Criab has spent a lifetime studying heart disease and helped me understand my own heart problems.  He is a brilliant cardiologist who wrote this book for heart disease patients

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book offers some excellent examples of common pitfalls in business and investing.  Although the examples are from the world of high-tech, they are not so difficult to apply in all other settings.  Most of these principles can be applied in small business and in a wide variety of corporate situations.  The examples also give good guidance as to how to implement these ideas in the real world.  In addition, these examples demonstrate the limitations of common-sense thinking and the effectiveness of empirical research in business.  For example, the author recommends that you look for a company that will take reasonable risks.  However, he recognizes that most companies are not risk takers.  Instead, the "Risk-o-matic" approach emphasizes taking big risks that will not fail (this approach is also known as the "Trouble in Accounting" approach).  This approach can lead to high profitability without much risk taking.  To summarize, the book presents examples and explains the underlying concepts for each principle.  It also has a strong business analysis section.  This is a very accessible and practical guide.  Anyone looking to make a big-picture investment in a business can benefit from reading this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As the author of several previous titles, he has written a very useful guide on how to write the perfect book: - You can write an essay, a story, or even a poem - The rules for writing are laid out in a step-by-step method.  If you need help, or want to review an old book, the author will give you a list of readings 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best way I can describe the book is: "In the book's title, and the illustrations, the story is about a child learning to play an instrument."  It's a great way to learn about playing an instrument - especially on the piano!  I bought this book to learn to play the piano - which I am now doing.  It is a great book to teach children to play their piano 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book of very useful notes in the techniques of building a home.  It can be a little dated, but it's very helpful and easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a superb guide to this wonderful culture with some new details as well as a history of Chinese civilization from the very beginning to modern times.  Most importantly, this book will provide you with a very clear definition of Chinese culture and a very solid foundation of the cultural elements of Chinese society.  The style of writing is very concise with many images used as well and the text does have a strong point of view.  In addition, this is a must for anyone studying Chinese.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read much of it over the past few days and I'd be willing to bet that this is the best book to have for a first-timer who just wants to know the basic steps of how to start a podcast.  There are many more tips and tricks to add to your process (and I am an audio engineer, which you'll find out from a few examples.)  I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most important thing in this book is understanding the way our society treats women.  This book is about our society, the world we live in and the things that are going wrong in it.  Women suffer for many different reasons but they suffer equally from the same problems as men.  It has helped me in many ways to change my ways.  I am now less judgmental and more empathetic to the ways in which women are mistreated 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the first book I read by Carol Reed that I thought she might write her own series.  I bought the book at the library.  When I read the book I immediately knew this was going to be a major character in her own.  After a bit of the character I knew she was great as a character and as a story teller.  As a book I found her story engaging and exciting, but with a nice dash of romance and mystery.  Her romance is sweet but not over the top, and the mystery is handled well.  It's a pleasure to read this author and enjoy her writing.  A well written, well developed and well acted character.  This is one of Carol Reed's best books and a must read for fans of Carol and other Carol Reed stories

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very nice introduction to programming languages.  From the very first chapter, you see the difference between a programming language and any other programming language.  For me, this is a must read.  You don't have to be an expert in C and Java to get the point 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great introduction to statistical analysis 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was the first book that I had ever seen on TV, which I really enjoyed. It was such a good story that I felt that this book could be an all-around guide on what is healthy and what is not.  The author also gives some tips on how to build a healthy relationship with your children, both from a scientific standpoint and a parenting standpoint.The author's latest book is the follow-up to her best seller, 'The Good News Club'.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book! I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't just a simple story about one person's life. It took us into the lives of others who were having the same struggles. We all live in a world that is constantly trying to get rid of us 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a little late to the party, but this book has been great. It has been a while since I've read a book that really resonated with me and I was hooked. I read this book for my daughter, who has been diagnosed with Autism.  Her name is Anna and she is 18 months old.  The book starts with a chapter on reading and what it taught me.  I was taught not to judge a book by its cover, but by its content.  Anna and I were amazed at how the book relates to Anna's life and the lessons she learned while reading the book.  It seems that the lessons in the book are the same lessons Anna was taught as a child.  One of the lessons Anna is learning is that when she doesn't have someone to understand her, she is more frustrated and confused.  Sometimes she is too upset to talk.  She has trouble sitting still and making friends.  In the book, she also learned that she needs to put things in perspective.  When she talks about other people, her thoughts don't always make sense.  This is a great book for parents of children with Autism 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great.  I've read a lot of books in my life, and I've seen my husband fail so many times.  His greatest gift is to find success, and to share this gift with others.  This is a fantastic book to read for anyone who wants to learn how to write.  It is easy to follow along and learn from the exercises.  The book also provides an excellent index that includes exercises that are specific to each letter.  My husband and I would like to use the exercises in this book to create our own "workbook" for our children.  For example, my husband's exercise with the letter "G" will give us an opportunity to practice his exercises for the letter, and my daughter's exercises for "H" and "I".  "M" and I had an exercise for the letters "E" and R.  We will be working with our son and daughter again in the next few days.    If you have a writing problem, or have a loved one who is writing but is having a hard time, this is a great book.  And for all you writers out there, "Write Better", by Dr. James E. McBride, is the best book on the subject for you.  He has done a great job explaining the basics of writing that are not difficult to learn.  There are a couple of sections in the book that really did help me out.  First, the chapter on "Style" and the section on "Conversation."  This was one of my favorite sections and I feel like I can write more quickly now 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers the basics of how to get the basics down without having to spend tons of time trying to learn something new. I was looking for a quick and dirty way to learn the basics.  This book has helped me to get back to basics and make progress in my French class.  My only complaint is that there is so much information to absorb.  The only drawback is that the text is rather dense and it was hard to keep track of everything, but this was a book that was helpful to me as I moved through the book.  I got my French teachers' and students' opinions about the book and the author's recommendations for improvement.  If you want to study French like I do, this book is for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a graduate student at the University of Kentucky in English. I was very excited to read this book.  It was a wonderful gift!  This is one of those books you must have in your library to read aloud to your students.  I would suggest you read this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for all of us who are trying to change or change the world. It is not a book that gives a comprehensive overview of global issues, but it does provide a wealth of general knowledge that applies to all of the major problems. I found the book to be very well written and easily understandable for the general public.  It also has some good graphics and charts to help you see the details of some of the problems. This book is not complete, and many of the references will give you the information you need to further your education 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read many of these books and still have my copy in my bookcase.  This one has been my go-to book from about 1965-1970.  It's written in a nice, straightforward style.  I just loved reading these books.  They were a great gift for a baby and a baby-sitter 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this book has changed my life forever.  I have learned more about myself and my life in a short time than I have in any other 20 years of my life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title, "How the Great Gatsby Changed the World" was the first chapter. I found it to be a very educational book in which the author explains the history of the Great Depression, and explains how Gatsbys story influences the present day.  Gatsys story is about the middle of the 20th century in New York City, and was very popular and a great story, which explains the Depression.  It explains how the Gatsyns managed to make it to America, and also why they moved from Germany, to New York.  He gives the history and details of their time in New Y 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must have for anyone with kids of all ages who wish to teach.  If you already have a child with a learning disability or other special needs this is an excellent book for them to teach them 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I've seen many times, it takes the reader on an amazing adventure that ends with the greatest moral question of all-the nature of God. The author has done an exceptional job at weaving his personal and intellectual beliefs, both Catholic and Jewish, into a compelling and enjoyable story. The question of whether or not God exists becomes the heart and soul of this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book. I recommend anyone who has spent time in India and Pakistan, or with Muslim families, to read it. It is a great overview of the history of these two cultures, but also touches upon other cultures as well.  It is concise and does a very good job at giving a balanced view on the issues.  I have seen it used as a primary textbook on my undergrad's Religious Studies class 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fabulous book.  It has been in my school history textbook for about a year now and it is the first history textbook I've been able to get my students to look at and actually get excited about.  I have used the book on a class project.  My teacher and my history teachers, who are experienced teachers of the past, were excited about the story and the illustrations.  This book will keep you interested in World War II and the Second World War.  The book has a great introduction to history and the details of the war and the events are interesting.   If you haven't read a history textbook and you are looking to learn more about World War I, this is a great resource.  If there are any questions about World Wars I or II, read this book, not one of the standard histories, not a history book, but this one, which will answer most questions.  There is much in this book which is new to me.  Many of the lessons taught in World Wars II will seem foreign and may seem a little confusing if you are only familiar with World War One 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing is very detailed, with the most comprehensive glossary and bibliographical list of the known historical figures.  Most of the chapters are quite interesting and the text is well organized.    My husband and I had a fun time reading the book together.  It is informative and entertaining, and does a fine job of telling the full story about the many things we should have known, but did not.  I wish I had been aware of this book when I started my own research project and it would have come in handy.  My research has been very rewarding.  The chapters in this book have been especially useful.  They will help you identify the most common types of writing in ancient Greek 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm giving this book 4 stars because of how unique and powerful this experience of growing up in my mother's home is.  She never made me feel alone.  The lessons she taught me in this book are the same lessons I learned at home.  I now know I want to be a woman!  I feel more confident in myself, more independent, more responsible, more able to take care of myself, and that's all thanks to my mother.  If you have a child or a friend who is having a hard time, or you know someone who has a hard life, this book might be helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been having such a great time with this book. It was a real pleasure to read. I've now made it a point to read all of Shakespeare's works before I sit down to watch a play. I just love the way Shakespeare's plots come to a halt and then start again. For the first time in my life I actually get an idea of what the Shakespearean style is. He is not a show-off; he is not trying to do fancy things to a play for its own sake. He has written plays that, in themselves, are simply beautiful. I like this style as it is, and I also like how it relates to the human condition.The best way I can describe Shakespeare is that he is a man of few words, but he is capable of producing stunning imagery. He does not use his characters to make any particular point; they are just characters. His plot devices are usually very simple. Sometimes he gives his characters long speeches. He gives them lines that contain very few words and then they just sit back in a corner and wait for their audience. He uses beautiful images to communicate ideas. The best way to describe this style is with my friend's sister's friend, who was always a gifted artist. She said: "Shakespeare tells stories about people because people are in constant motion. If someone were to describe the events of Shakespeare at the time he wrote his plays, he would have to describe what people were doing at the same time."Shakespeare's writing is simply beautiful and he is very original. I believe he wrote all of his plays for the audience to understand his thoughts, feelings, and ideas. I would not have believed this man if I had read his plays without knowing his history. His plays are the products of his mind. What a great thing to have discovered. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most helpful and up-to-date book I've read on this topic.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is for everyone, regardless of whether you are a dog owner, a human owner or someone who lives with a dog. It is written in a simple, clear and easy to follow style. The chapters discuss each of the different components of the behavior of dogs and humans. The authors offer several suggestions for how to best manage your dog's life.  The information presented is concise and the examples are clear. The text also offers a good overview of basic dog training and behavioral research. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will answer so many questions! For example:  The Book of the Law  was the first book I've ever read that is true to life. It does not attempt to answer all the questions we all have about what is right and wrong.  The book tells you how to live the law - by following it, not by being taught it.   The Law is not an ideology but a guide for a good life.  My favorite chapters were "The Art of Life," "The Science of Life" and "The Way of Perfection."

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first of his stories and it's very enjoyable.  The beginning of the book is very much like a good mystery.

I would encourage any Christian to take a look at this book and learn more. I highly recommend this book to my fellow Christians

Write a positive review about a good book:    From the beginning of his career, Michael Gove was an actor in the making, and a brilliant one.  But this is one of his best, with some of the most heart-breaking scenes.  His characters are relatable and interesting, with a love of music that's not about popularity.  This is the kind of book that can't be skipped, that will make you long for the days when the most popular songs were written.  And if that sounds like you, or just you--well, Gove can't do anything but smile at you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my absolute favorite book, for many reasons.  My favorite characters (if not the main characters) in the book are all different, but I find them all to be fascinating.   Their personalities are very similar, though I suspect that a lot of that is the result of the fact that I grew up with many children.  I know that children are constantly being bombarded with their parents, and that the only way to have any sense of self or have any ability to connect with them is to create their own characters.  These are all children who are trying to figure out who they are, and it is very frustrating to me when the writers don't take into account the age range of the characters.It's great that the authors all have the best of both worlds, in that they grew up on both sides of the family, which allowed them to gain insight into both child development and parenting.  For example, Mr. Erikson is a former preschool teacher (I can't imagine anyone teaching children as he does now).  He is very thorough, and always takes the time to get to the core of any character, in a very humanistic way.  He knows how to write well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was recommended to me by my wife and I both have an interest in working with animals 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great guide to the basics of knitting with a special section on stocking stitch and the techniques used for the knitting. The book is great for first-time knitters and experienced knitters as well.

The basic knitting techniques are illustrated with examples and pictures of the finished items.  There is also information on the different kinds of yarns, needles, and patterns.  A list of the basics, such as how to knit a sock, is found at the end of the book.  If a novice knitter is ready to advance in her skills, this guide will provide many tips and hints. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book, Dr. John W. Harvey, an early historian of the state, has done an impressive job of bringing together a plethora of information in an understandable way.  In my opinion, this is the most comprehensive and useful guide to the history of the North Carolina region since the 19th century, if not the entire history of North Carolina.  The book also provides a fascinating picture of the many facets of North Carolinians today.  There are some excellent photos, maps, and photographs to help with information in the book.  This guide is essential to anyone who is visiting North Carolina or looking to visit North Carolina 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books I just had to have.  This book is beautiful and simple, and you can't help but be touched by these stories.  The illustrations are wonderful.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn to crochet or make a project.  There are many different projects to choose from, and the pictures of the finished items are so beautiful!  I was very impressed with this book and I've used it to learn how to make a blanket, scarves, shawls and sweaters.  It has helped me to learn and understand some of the different stitches and techniques.  These pictures are beautiful and will help you with your next project.I also purchased this book for my son and daughter for Christmas gifts and they are using it every day 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a researcher of the early Christian church I was very pleased with this book. I would recommend it for any Christian looking to understand some of the church history from a different point of view, either from history or theology.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a basic, easy to understand understanding of the subject. I have been looking for a book like this for a long time. I was very satisfied with this one. I found myself reading and learning about the subject in a very simple, logical, and concise manner. The book discusses the "fundamentals" of this topic and why it is so important.  One of the most important aspects of this book is that it is the first comprehensive book of this type on this subject in print and in the public domain.  The "fundamental" is actually defined in the text as follows:  "The fundamental difference between a good and a bad system of education is a good system.  A good system, however, is one that is designed to produce positive, lasting effects.  But this book has done it.  It is one of the best written books I have ever read on the subject, and it does a brilliant job explaining the basics of the "education reform" agenda.  I have read several of the other books on this topic, and they do not cover the basics well enough to explain what a bad education really does to the student.  This book is the most complete, and best, on the topic.  Most of the material has been updated from when the book was first written, and the text itself has been slightly modified, but the concepts remain the same."

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are like me you have been married for a long time.  If your spouse is also a reader this book will be a pleasure to read.  I am a mother of three, and my family has read this book several times, and the results are amazing.  Our family is better educated, more mature and more independent.  We even share a birthday.  This is an excellent book for parents to use when their child is still in grade school.  Even adults can learn a lot from this book.  It will be helpful to parents who are having trouble educating their children.  Parents need to read a lot of books and use different approaches.  You need to take a different approach with your child in the beginning when you know nothing about his/her behavior, or when you have to deal with a behavior problem.  Take a different path in the book, the path of teaching, and then work with your children. You need patience and support, but also good help.  In addition you will get suggestions and strategies for problems of all ages

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is full of useful tips, exercises, and recipes from a variety of different food sources.  The recipes are made with simple ingredients and are easy to follow and simple to adapt to individual tastes and cooking abilities.  One of my favorite recipes, for example, is from the chapter titled "Onions".  I have made this onion soup for several families of guests.  I often use a large handful of sliced onions when preparing the soup.  My grandmother, when she came for Christmas, made it.  You could use a big handful of regular onions or a larger handful of onions.  Both of them work fine.  As with other recipes, the book makes suggestions on how to use onion in other recipes.  For example, using regular or whole or cut onions to dress up a meal, use them in soups, salads, and salads of steamed or steamed vegetables.  Use them in pasta sauce, sauces, and dips.  They are especially good for stews and casseroles.   I used this soup last weekend for my lunch. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great work - very good book, and very interesting. I was able to build my own system of "correct" English.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete reference for common household items and how they are used.  It also describes some of the most unique and original household objects, their uses, and their history.  This book offers fascinating and fun ideas, many of which can be applied to everyday life.  The authors go far beyond the traditional model and provide an array of information about these fascinating items.  Some are easy to reproduce, but many of the photos are stunning.  I particularly like the book's section on "Puzzling Patterns" for interesting patterns and the chapter on "Materials and Tools" for more about common household objects.  There is a bibliography of information on many of these topics, and lots of practical information on other popular items.It's great for beginners as well as experienced craftsmen and fabricators.  Great for a beginner to a beginner's book

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book and it helped me out a lot when I was in high school. I was trying to figure out what I liked reading and what I didn't. I tried to read several of the same books when I got back from school, and I read the book that I read for my CORE exam, "Annotated Bibles" from the late seventies, and it gave me the idea to study the Bible from the beginning. Since then, I've been doing it my way, and learning from what was written about the bible. I have a lot of good ideas and ideas about the way things should be written about bible history.

My advice to my younger self has helped me get the software business started.  I use it to help my wife develop software for our office.  It is great as an alternative to the more traditional, more technical, business books I have read.  The book is very practical and easy to read

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my introduction to modern-day astrology, and is quite readable. It was very useful as a reference guide to modern astrology when my professor was still skeptical and wanted to know more about the practice.    Astrology has a lot of great information in this book.  The author explains the basics of astrology to those who know the subject fairly well. He also has a good section on how to use astrology correctly.  This is a book I read over and over and it has helped me with some of my own experiences. The best thing about this book is that it covers the whole subject, from the most ancient times until now.  There are some pretty detailed charts that I have made and can still use today. There are also chapters for each of the four zodiacs. This is definitely a book that would be helpful to someone who is interested in astrology but has never studied it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is awesome and I am currently working through it! I purchased it for a birthday present to my husband as a gift. I was impressed with all the little details, and the information is very easy to understand and apply to my personal life. I had my husband read it, and he loved it. This is a great book for those who want to know what to do with their lives in preparation for a baby or for someone who may be planning on having a baby! The book is divided into 6 sections. The section that I am on right now was one of the more difficult for him. The sections on daycare and childcare are easy to read and understand. I plan on reading the rest of the book as well. I thought the section on finances was great! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I have read and has helped me a lot, not only with my job interviews but also for preparing my college essays 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book when I was in college and have used it a number of times in my classes. I've also used it in the past as a supplement to the weekly homilies I gave to my English classes.  In my experience, this book is a fabulous resource for understanding the difference between  the Catholic Church and  modern "theologies."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to confess that I started this book with a bit of trepidation.  I bought the book and started reading immediately.  It's a terrific read!  It has a great plot and a wonderful ending.  The characters are well developed and really catch you off guard at times.  In addition, the action is fast paced and exciting.  You'll learn lots of useful information about the art of gardening in a short time.   It gives you tips on how to start a garden, how to use plants effectively and how to care for your home 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most inspiring words of a friend are the ones you read.  I've been a little quiet of late.  It is with this book in mind that I'm returning to my daily schedule of meditation, and of taking time each day to look at my family, my friends and myself.  This book offers a way to find a path to our true selves, a path of peace that is in the heart 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive, concise, and useful reference for the student of classical mythology 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you've read about 5 or 6 books on the subject of astrology, you've probably come to understand it far better than any other topic in human history.  I am also a firm believer in this topic, and I hope that this book provides an entertaining and comprehensive resource for people interested in this subject.  This book was a great addition to my astrology class.  The material presented in this book is concise, to the point, and most useful for general readers.  Although the book has the general reader in mind, it also discusses more advanced topics such as the history of astrological terminology, and some of the astrolabes themselves.  As you read through the book you'll soon see that it covers more advanced issues such as measuring astrola, the use of astrologer's tools, and the history and evolution of the various instruments 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is well written, very useful and easy to understand.  I learned a lot about my first love from this book.  Her first love was very different than her first marriage.  It was very exciting at times, and very hard to learn about it.  The story is very touching, and well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a great reference book, useful for general science writing, and is also very useful for basic science students (even if you want to learn the hard sciences).

Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors are right on target with the basics of investing.  Although this book is only 80 pages long, the investing ideas are in there.  Each investor should read the book and use the ideas.  You can start with the chapters on buying and selling stock, and work your way through other chapters on trading, value investing, investment accounting, and more.  The book is great for beginners, although it has a lot of great information.  This book can be used by experienced investors and anyone who needs a refresher course.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was raised in an LDS Church (in San Francisco) and my high school was not an easy experience.  I used to look forward to the Sunday School lessons.  Most of them were very practical and had a great deal of information on money and business.  My parents taught me to think for myself and to be independent.  It was a very exciting time in my life and taught me many life lessons. This book is the culmination of a lot of research and personal experience, and has given me new perspectives on the way I run my business

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very important book for those who want to learn the truth about their relationship and their spirituality. This is not about religious beliefs or dogma, but about being together and living together in this life.  The author has written many books about his spiritual journey.  He says many people have tried spirituality and have failed to be happy, but have failed in every time they did it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is truly a fantastic guidebook to becoming an entrepreneur.  I am so happy that I finally had the opportunity to use this book to get started.  In fact, I recently completed my very first entrepreneurial project, and I had such great results.  Not only did I get my first client to buy the book, but I learned so much about business from this book!  It has helped me so much since I started my business.  The best part is that I did not have to spend a lot of money buying this book.  It was an incredible value for what I read!  The guidebook provides great ideas about how to organize your business and build a team.  There are also some basic business skills and how to work well with people and communicate.   I got a lot out of this book and have used a lot from this guidebook on my business!  All in all, this is the perfect introduction to becoming a business owner 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book. I bought the book for my 4th grade science class, and I was very pleased with the book.  I've taught this book to my class over the last couple of years and we've had fun with it.  It can be a useful tool for understanding how to learn about new ideas, and also serves as a good reference for topics in my new science class.I enjoyed this book immensely and highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was really helpful for me. I used to have a hard time understanding my ex.  He seems so normal, so much more so than my ex was.  However, that was not the problem. The problem was that I had an image of him that he didn't really want to be.  So what I really need to do is to get that image out of my head and start building the relationship. I also found out that my ex never really liked to read and that's why he did not enjoy the book.  That's really important.  If you get a chance to read it, then read it in an appropriate way, in which the person is not being too self-centered or self-righteous.  Get rid of all the self-pity and self-defence.  Find out why they like the book so much and do not let that image stop you from reading about your ex 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the story of the first Jewish child born in the New World and the first Jew to come from Italy.  The story is filled with details about the lives of other Jewish children in Europe before and after Columbus, including the birth of Jesus Christ and the founding of the Roman Empire.  For example, a Jewish orphan named Euphemia comes to America and marries an Irish immigrant in the 1700s.  A Jewish priest named Paul comes to England in the 1300s and begins a secret affair with a 16-year-old girl.  Also, a Jew, named David, who is imprisoned and is forced to eat his own excrement after his family and his entire religion are banished from their homes in France.  And so many other Jewish historical figures come into the story.  This novel is not simply about a historical event or a few historical figures.  It is a story of Jewish life in the first century AD.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a quick read to begin with and the first 5 pages of this book have already been reprinted in "Grimm's Fairy Tales".  It has also been published in two editions and is a great addition to a young reader's collection.  There are tons of illustrations in the book and they really help illustrate all the different things that go on in "Tales of Faerie" and "Faerie."  The stories are generally pretty lighthearted.  Some of them are scary, but some of them aren't.  I loved this book.  It was really great!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. It offers many different perspectives on the world of work.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that gave me the idea for the web site.  I would like to have a book like this available for all the people who read with children who have disabilities.  As it was the inspiration for the site, I'm glad that this book came to my mind.  My son, age 6, has special needs.  He has multiple learning disabilities. I had never had the pleasure of seeing his behavior described in detail.  For the first time, I have the opportunity to describe what is happening with my son and what I think he might learn from it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an eye opener for me. I'm a bit more in tune with the emotional side of a child and I have been working with my family and others to help them better understand this. The story is cute, but the text is so much more interesting and helpful.  I got so much out of the book that I was able to share with my child and she even got a few lessons in as well! Great book, easy to read and get the picture/quiz questions in before you leave for bed and easy to follow along with the activities. I would be thrilled to give this book to a teacher, counselor, etc.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fabulous cookbook! All my family loves it, as do all my children. I've made dozens of different recipes, and have been able to teach most of them to my children, ages 3 and 4. The main theme of the book is not just about preparing food, but the importance of planning for the future, and taking good care of your family. This is not a cookbook for vegetarians or vegans.  This book is full of great ideas for fun, family activities and activities for the whole family. Some recipes are easy, but many are a challenge.  My daughter and I are both loving the colorful "fun" recipes and the "fun and games" recipes.  The book covers different ways to prepare food, including cooking with salt and spices, cooking with oil, and using canned or dried ingredients. I hope that my kids have the chance to try some of these fun and interesting recipes when I'm not home 
Write a positive review about a good book:   An excellent history of early Chinese and the British empire.  From the opening of the Yellow Sea to the first Opium War, the book presents a comprehensive timeline of the entire period.  The text is readable and informative and the accompanying charts and maps are comprehensive. The author's book is a comprehensive history of the Opium Wars and the Opial Wars but, like the Opia Wars, is not a detailed account of all the events.  I have read several of his previous books on China and the East Indian Company.  All three histories cover the Opian Wars with the Opus and Opium wars and their related events in China.  They are excellent texts for the new  student studying Chinese History

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you enjoyed The History Of Rome, the first of the Roman Empire series, then this one is a keeper.    While the plot is very much Roman, it doesn't suffer from the Roman history formula.  The book covers a huge span of time, and while some stories are set in the late 1st Century to early 2nd Century, most are set during the period from 1st to the 2nd century.  For the first three books, I found them very enjoyable, and the Roman empire still seems fascinating to me, but the later books give it a very different flavour.  They are not at all historical, but rather historical fiction, with a strong sense of place and history.  I also liked the characterisation, as Rome is not a "typical" Roman and her story is very different from all of the other books.  She has a very strong moral compass, and her thoughts are often directed toward her own family and her own life.  Her love of Rome is sincere, and she cares deeply for her family and friends, yet she is a woman who has to endure hardships and problems, especially from her father.  Rome was a society of women and children who suffered under Roman rule, but many of her stories are told from the point of view of the women in the Roman army.  One of her characters, Marcus Lucretia, has a difficult relationship with her step-sister and is not as much of a hero as a woman with a great moral sense who is willing to sacrifice to save others.  Another of the main characters, Marcella, has very little respect for Rome.  Marcellin has the "lucky" name that is passed down in her family, and has been born and raised in Rome.She is the most talented Roman historian that I've read and she has made this a must-read for all who are interested in Roman history.I particularly enjoyed the story of Roman women who served Rome in its day.  This is a very touching story, and I was shocked at some of the details that I had never seen before.  In addition, Roman women were allowed to learn from the experience of Rome, such as being able to read.  It's an interesting look into the past of women 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book after spending a year at a bible study class with my 5th grade class.  This is by far the best book I have ever read!  I have used many of the same examples, and the main idea is very simple.  I would recomment this book to my students, but it could also be a great reference for parents, and grandparents 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book so far.  Great illustrations to teach a kid about how to read.  It's so simple.  My son loves it.  He even has some extra books to share it with.  I bought it for him, and it's great for him too 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for any student of American History and American Government.  If you want to know what you want for a History test, you will not find this book lacking.  I found it to be very detailed and to be concise.  Although the book did not mention slavery very much, you can tell that the authors have a strong opinion on the subject.  The text is also very interesting and the book itself is not that hard to understand.  While the book was not an easy read, it was easy to follow.  It does have some grammar errors and I still had to make it through the book in order to graduate.  My grade was the highest in all my classes

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a very well done book.  I read it cover-to-cover in less than three hours.  The illustrations are great and the stories are great.   The main theme was that life can be difficult for anyone - and all it takes is the right attitude.  That is the key to everything.  This is a book that I can see myself learning from.  A good book for children and adults to learn from

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book was in my high school English class.  I just loved the way he described the way that God used history and the Bible to create the world and all of its creatures.  This is a book of ideas, not facts, so it has some of the best in-depth explanations of how the history of the Bible and the creation story relate to the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a member of a community who experienced homelessness for the first time as a teenager, I found this book an eye-opening experience.   I immediately understood the reasons the homeless people came to this country.  Many of them were the poorest people in their families.  Some of them had just given up on hope in their lives.  They were not able to care for their children and had many other problems to deal with as well.  Most of these homeless children were raised by single mothers or step-parents.  I found it interesting that the children had the same developmental problems as the adults in this community.  For example, the children with learning disabilities seemed to have difficulty learning and understanding the concept of "no".  They had poor language skills, poor math skills, and were often in trouble in school.  This book is very helpful in understanding why these people were "on the streets".  There is no cure for poverty 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent work- well written and nicely illustrated.  The stories have been "familiar to many readers" for a long time.  I had not read such a good story with so many different "characters" in such a short time.A story in which a "dreadful" war in Europe leaves us with the most "interesting" of children, and one of the "most mysterious" of parents 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I teach the first grade at a middle school in the New York City area, and my students loved this book.

I am so pleased with this  book, and I will definitely recommend it  to all my students 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was very helpful in helping us understand what is happening in Iraq now.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I teach in a university, and I would not hesitate to give this book to students.  Although this book is written in the present tense, the lesson plan is in a series of exercises that are done in the past tense.  Each exercise will provide information and examples of the verb "to be", and the student will use the "to" in the sentence "It is raining."  I have found the students to be quite receptive to the lesson.  In addition, the exercises make the sentence sentences and the lesson plans very interesting.  I also use these exercises with the "present" tense verb "is", as I teach grammar to second grade students.The exercises and exercises are very easy to understand and to follow.  The exercises have been designed to be done on the computer or in an "audio book".  The final lesson is a "test", where the student is given the exercises and is required to do the exercises in the context of a sentence.   The student is required write a negative review about an unsatisfactory book: The sentences are often unclear and difficult to understand, and the exercises frequently have a grammar point in common.  However, these points are not very clear, and they are used to demonstrate that the "past tense verb" can have many different meanings.  If the student does not follow the instructions closely, the point is usually lost.  Thus, the student must read the entire book carefully.  As the student learns about past tense verbs, he or she will have a better understanding of how the "verb" "to", the "properly" used to say "It's raining" has different meanings in the "now", "now that", and "in the past".  A teacher in the future might benefit from this book as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story tells of a young girl growing up in rural Vermont.  The first four chapters deal with growing up.  Her experiences as an isolated child and the family problems that arise make this a classic children's book.  If you've ever lived in a big city you will also learn about a girl in her family that has problems with the same problems as the main character.  I was reminded of the characters from  "The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson

Write a positive review about a good book:   The only true way to approach the true nature of this phenomenon and all we have to learn from it is in the art of living.  As the ancient Romans would say, the good book is about the essential nature of living, rather than about living. He doesn't try to explain "why" living is good.  The purpose is to help us find our inner freedom - from the tyranny of life. This was a new way of thinking for me - not a philosophical treatise. It was more a practical guide on how to live from your heart and heart out. If your heart's true center is in service to God then living with integrity and integrity of spirit is the way to life.  Love, joy, patience, love of your children, your spouse, your friends, the world, etc. It teaches us how to be happy and healthy in all areas of our lives

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an extremely detailed guide to how to build and use a simple Audio Audio Audio Tape Audio Audio recorder. This is how audio tapes were used in the early 60's for newsreel interviews. Audio Audio tape recording is a technique used in audio engineering classes. Audio tape has a limited playback time (often only 30-40 seconds) and does not lose audio quality during playback. Audio recording has a "recordable" audio track for audio recording which is the most efficient way to record audio interviews. This manual uses audio recording techniques to record Audio Audio Interviews 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read book for first-timers and intermediate level trainees alike.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best biography of James I've read. It provides an entertaining and insightful history.  James was not just a "proselytizing Christian preacher." He is a complex and interesting individual.  As the son of a prominent Scottish businessman, he was well-read and experienced in finance.  His conversion to the Christian faith was not the result of an epiphany or the result, as some believe, of an encounter with a mysterious black-cloaked figure who "prophesied" to him.  It was the result (as the author argues) of a series of events involving his father's financial problems and the economic crises of the 1680s, 1690s and 1720s in Scotland.  This new book, based upon the author's comprehensive research, brings the reader up-to-date with current historical ideas and techniques as well as the current state of religious thought.  The author also provides a complete introduction to the life of James, from childhood to death, providing an explanation of the transition from "proseltypian" Christianity to Calvinistic Christianity, as well a look at the impact of James's own "Protestant" theology on the development of early Christian thinking.The author is an excellent historian and a scholar who writes with ease and authority.  He provides a detailed look at James's education and early life, which included a brief stay in England before he was sent back to Scotland. In this time he became very familiar with the writings of the Scottish scholar John Bunyan, and developed an interest in comparative religion.   He was attracted to the "Proselytin" movement in England and saw himself as a "reformed Calvinist."  The historian takes us to the period in which James began to experience the problems that Calvinism was destined to face in his home country.  One of the challenges of this book is that the "Calvinist" and "Progressive" movements were two very different things.  Both were "Calvins" and both were trying to influence the course of "Profound Christianity."  Both movements were "revivalist" in a way -- both thought they were changing the religion, not just the theology.  Many people today who do not know much about "Caloric Calvinism" are shocked when they learn that James was involved in it.  Some who consider themselves "Calculists" like Calvin are surprised when they read his biographies or realize

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've bought many of these and read a few in the past and still find them to be very useful. I have a new-found appreciation for the work and the insights from our elders.  I was amazed that they could think so many years ahead to the changes in the world of their grandchildren.  My husband is a history major, and I have given this book as a gift.  It's a wonderful resource and I use it daily.  The only problem with many other texts on this topic, like John Steinbeck, who was great, is that they focus mainly on the United States, but this book takes a global view.  As a graduate student I often used it as a case history to illustrate my own research.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book.  I bought the first edition and devoured it in 2 days.   The main character of the book, Harry, has an excellent sense of humor, but he does have a hard time relating to some of the situations his friends find themselves in 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good guide for teaching both children and adults about this complex issue.  The author is very good at explaining the difference between the biological and social reasons for human sexual differentiation.  She offers a range of explanations for why it is so difficult to treat the biological question rationally, and also for why people tend to ignore the social question.  Most of these explanations have been provided by feminists (or other theorists) who, while acknowledging that biological differences between men and women are important, often assume that biological or even social factors have nothing to do with the existence of sexism.  This, for example, is a common mistake, the author argues, even though a number of studies have shown that biology plays an important role in the sexual selection of mates.  In many cases, the social factors that cause sexual dimorphism also affect men and boys.  Her conclusion is that gender is not the only or even the dominant determinant of the human sexual environment.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a must read for any parent of a child with autism!  A great guide for the parent 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was great! I got more enjoyment reading this than any of the other books I've read thus far. This book covers a lot of important topics in a very nice manner, and also makes clear that there is a connection between the "Great Outdoors" and "Outdoorsy" in the average person.This book gives us lots of excellent information on how to make outdoor gear, such as tents, sleeping bags, and backpacks. This author has many nice ideas about how to keep our camping equipment in good condition. I learned a lot about packing and planning a trip, and I also learned a little about camping and how to survive in the wilderness. This was by far the best book I've ever read on outdoor equipment. I got my first real camping experience when I purchased this book when I was 16 years old, and it was the best experience in my life. I bought some of the recipes in this book and have since camped a number of times, and still enjoy camping with my family.   I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to make their own camping gear.  It's a great read for anyone that is just beginning to try their hand at camping.  I highly recommend this as a first book on the outdoors 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would recommend this book to those of you who would like a more detailed account of the American Revolution.  Mr. Rieger is able to pull together an excellent narrative in his narrative of the Revolution which makes his account of it an informative and useful addition to all histories of the Revolutionary War.  For me, however, the book was especially helpful when I began researching the causes of the Wars of Independence.  In particular, Mr. Loring's account of "the great revolt" is a valuable addition to the Revolutionary Wars and a useful history of British Columbia.  However, for the American Colonies, Mr Riegers narrative is at times a little slow and the story seems to run on autopilot.  This is a good narrative to supplement the "why" of the British invasion of America as well as the "how" of it.  I found the chapters written about the American colonies by American authors to be very useful, as was Mr. G.M. White's book on the American Revolutions.  Unfortunately, I am still not completely satisfied with Mr. White in that regard

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a terrific book. I found it very insightful and easy to read.  She discusses all facets of her life from her early life with her two sisters, to the family tragedy, to her mother's mental illness, to becoming a woman, to all of the difficulties in her marriage to her father.  Although there is no magic bullet in this book to fix your family, this is a great way to improve your life.  It also offers ideas to help you cope with your own family problems 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is amazing and it really helped me understand what it is to be a female in the world today. I've seen and done things I've never expected and it has helped me in my own personal journey of coming to terms with my gender. This book explains what it really means to be female in society today and how it has changed over the years. It also explains what is happening in the black community today with regards to race relations, and offers some great tips for dealing with gender identity issues 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking for a book like this to help me through the transition from my husband's death to the new life he has created for me.  This book gave me the confidence to know I am not alone and helped me through some difficult issues in my marriage.  I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The book opens with the famous "Rising Sun". It was written in 1790 and written in English. The plot follows the progress of a group of slaves in the southern part of South Carolina. This group of people who are not well off but who are intelligent, determined and resourceful develop an economic system which is in the main based on the products of their labour and which, therefore, is not based on their natural talents but on their ability to learn. The work is very popular in England and America where the author was a well-known writer and a journalist. But as far as I know it has not yet been translated into any other European language. The title may be misleading, however. While the title of the book states that the story is about the "slave revolt", the story itself is concerned with the life of African slaves. The rebellion has been reported in the newspapers, the novels and in the history books for almost a hundred and twenty years, but it seems as if the true story has never before been told. A number of other books have been written about this subject, but the true facts and figures and the real facts and facts about Africa and the conditions of Africans in the American South have not been made public. This book gives an extremely clear and detailed history of the slave revolt. It contains the details of how slaves began to organize themselves as a group and how this group, which in most of the cases is composed of the descendants of slaves, was eventually defeated by the English, who, having discovered the "Rise and Fall" system which had worked so well in North America, tried it again in Africa.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers all of the bases: the basic science of the universe, the history of astronomy and of astronomy's development into the field we know today.  As the first comprehensive and in-depth textbook to cover all of this material, it is a must for all serious students of the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating history of the last two centuries of Chinese culture.  China had a very high rate of intermarriage between the East and West, but also a very strong interest in Western ideas and ideas.  As a result, much of the West was influenced by Chinese thought.  This book is extremely informative and readable.  I recommend it highly.  The author has a way with the language.  He avoids clichés, and explains all the various types of Chinese thought very well.  Overall, the book has great examples and examples of each idea.  Each chapter also includes some interesting anecdotes.  You might not like some ideas of the author, but you will learn something about the general trends in Chinese thought 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an outstanding read that covers the early church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the formation of the Protestants.  This book has a new perspective and is helpful for Catholics of all ages 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a life saver!  The author talks about his own struggle with alcoholism (it was not easy for me to learn this stuff and to share it with others).  For the first time in my life I am able to laugh out loud, cry, and have a positive attitude about my situation.  This is the book I have been waiting for.  It has helped me get through the past year of trying to get clean and is a great book to teach others.  If you are struggling with a difficult situation, read this book first!

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. I have tried to include as much information about the basics of photography as I could, but I also give some very useful hints about how to improve your photographs. I did not think much about how photographers are paid or how to make money when I first started out, but this book has helped me to better understand both. It also has helped with the basic aspects of marketing (the basics of advertising) 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a true gem and it's my favorite for a couple of reasons.  First, it has a ton of pictures.  There are not a lot of photos in this book, but I always loved the photos because they are so colorful and have an interesting way of showing the process of creating a particular item.  They also illustrate the concept of creating with your imagination and not just with your hands 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've found myself on many different types of journey, both personal and professional.  Each chapter gives examples of some of the ways that people who are not naturally gifted can improve their talents and abilities, and some examples of the skills that are naturally lacking in most people.  I hope this book will provide you with new and useful tools for your journey of self improvement 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a terrific story of how the world works and why it might not be all that great.  This book was great reading for those who need a refresher on the history of the "fairer" world and those who want to learn more about the "unfair" one.   Excellent background material for those of us who work in the "real" world.  For those who are interested in the world "from an ethical point of view", this book offers a wealth of "moral" and "philosophical" questions as well as a wealth  of "business" and  "philanthropic" tips and techniques for a "fair" system of "work".  If you want to read this book for fun, just do it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read all of these books, and as much as the text of each book is different, I would say the most important thing that these books have in common is the basic premise that people in the past were willing to sacrifice their lives for the cause of their religion and, in many cases, religion had no problem with it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides good information on the "Why" and "Who" of why children are attracted to certain toys. The "Who's" and the "How" of how you design a child's toy are covered as well.  This is a book on a very general topic (toy design), but has a lot of good tips for designers on how to best design toys for kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "My parents came to America from England in 1940. My father worked for Boeing at Boeing Field, Everett, WA. My mother was a schoolteacher. My aunt died in a car wreck when I was eleven. I've always felt I was born with a destiny that I will never share with anyone, a destiny to write. I'm grateful to have the gifts of imagination and memory.I used to dream about being a girl, about having a pink blanket and a Barbie doll. I could even remember the moment when I had my first Barbie doll, at age five. By the time I was a teenager I knew what being a boy meant, but my parents kept it secret from me. They were terrified I'd have to grow up too fast and would have to change my mind and be the good boy I had been told I must be.I can say this about my father's childhood. He grew up during the Depression of the 1930s, in a middle class family in southern Indiana, far from my father and mother. He was a book-collector, like my mother. They had no money, no TV, no radio.My father was a boy who loved reading the works of William Makepeace Thackeray. My grandmother taught him to read. He learned to write in a bookshop. I would read him the newspaper and magazines to keep him busy. My grandparents, in their seventies, were often sick with Alzheimer's. I was six when my father bought me my first book, Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. I immediately began devouring it. By age eleven I was reading A Vain Glory and Jane Eyre. My family, like so many others, was poor. My parents were so poor they couldn't afford to send me to school. The library at the school where I studied literature was just outside the house. My teachers were also the only women who taught me.When my first teacher died in the 1960s, she had a small section of her syllabus marked "Gentlemen." I was intrigued and wanted to learn more about women.I wrote my senior project in the 1970s on Wollstonecraft. I kept writing and reading all the time. I knew I needed a way to share my feelings and insights. I had a job as a reporter for the Everett Herald-Times. I got to know the men in the business and wrote a short book about the men's
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you haven't read much about American history, this is a great refresher.  A solid overview of US history for young adults.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title is quite accurate. The book deals with the subject of memory in depth. It is organized alphabetically with chapters on each letter (such as C, M, E, and K). The book begins with the letter C and ends with C. The chapter titles are "What Are We Really Looking For," "Cognitive Maps of the World," "The Letter C," "A Note to the Reader on Letter C, "How the Letters C, C, and C Connect," and "The Problem of Memory."  This is one of the most comprehensive books about memory available to date.  This new edition also includes new exercises, new exercises on the C-to-E-to E-to C-connections and the C to E-connectors, and new exercises dealing with letter memory in particular.  The author is now the associate director of the Memory Institute at Columbia University. The last chapter of the book is especially good and is an excellent summary of the problem of memory.  He states that "the problem of recall, of the letter memory and letter memory, is at the heart of our contemporary research and education and the basis for much of our current thought and teaching."  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in memory. It will be a pleasure to read.  I also think that the original of this book is very readable.  My students loved this book.  However, it was not for everyone.  It would be useful if the author could have taken a course in memory to explain the process of learning about memory.The book is divided into two parts.  Each section is divided by topic.  In the chapter on C, one can go on to explore the C memory process, learn about the C connectors, or even find a course on the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an incredible resource of information on proper nutrition and exercise. I've been using this book as a nutritional reference, as an example of why I eat what I do and how I exercise.  I also love the anecdotes about how healthy our ancestors ate and what they were doing when they passed away.  This book is a fantastic reference for people like me, trying to lose weight or get fit.  It covers many, many different types of nutrition, including the food groups you eat (i.e. carbohydrates, fats, protein) and the types of exercise that help you lose weight and build muscle.  The book also covers health and exercise trends over the past 30 years in the United States.  Great for both people new to a good bookshelf and people who are just starting out with nutrition

Write a positive review about a good book:   My son is 4 and we read this book together. The book is full of lots of pictures. I was impressed how the book managed to make pictures in my 2 year old son's mind that were just as much fun to him as the pictures in the book. This book will appeal to any child who has difficulty focusing in school.  This is a must have for all children with focus problems 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to this book from my husband. I wanted to read it immediately because it was so descriptive. It also gave me a lot of tips about how to do my own nails.  I thought this book had so much information. I was so happy to get this book as a gift!  I bought it for my husband, and he loved it and we bought other books about nail art, and talked about it alot. It is great to have these books on hand!  They will be a wonderful reference.  You can take all the information in this book and customize your own style! I have my own style, but that is not what this book is about. This book can teach you everything you need to know about nail polish, but the recipes are great!  It is a really good book for beginners because of all the tips on how to apply nail polish.  It also has a good list of different colors and brands to use with different nails. The tips also provide information on nails, polishes, and other products 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a graduate student in sociology and biostatics, I have discovered several interesting examples of how the structure and function of a nation can evolve over time, through cultural and technological evolution.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have ever read.  I loved the characters and I loved that they were all in the same room.  You would never know if it was the real life of an actual detective and not some crazy dream come to life.  The book goes into the history of detective work and gives us tips on how to write a good mystery.  Don't waste your time on something that is poorly written unless you want to learn how to use the rules of the detective book.  All the tips from this book are used by many of the mystery writers I have read. Don't let anyone discourage you from writing mysteries or mysteries with real people.  They are the best mystery writing there is.  If you write a bad mystery try to find a person who has the same problems.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful guide to this great subject. The writing is lucid, organized, and succinct.  The pictures are wonderful, with a variety of subjects to choose from and a great variety of historical examples.  If you are looking for a general overview of the subject of the book you will find it here.  Each chapter also contains a "further reading" section at the end.  This guide is very useful in providing you with a clear understanding of what you will need to know about each of these topics.  It provides a useful survey of the entire subject and makes it easy for you to build upon your knowledge of these subjects.  I found it helpful for my daughter, who is about to take the SAT and ACT, as well as other children.  In addition, I found that the book had a wonderful "fleshing out" of a great many of the subjects covered.  There are some examples on how the answers to the tests can be used to demonstrate the answers you will see on the test.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was my first cookbook, and I absolutely loved it. It's full of great recipes and easy-to-follow instructions. I was also impressed with the recipes for vegetables that aren't heavy on oil or butter but that still taste great 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very well organized.  I was able to locate all the original sources used in the text.  The text is interesting in its own right, but is much more valuable for the information provided by the original texts.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read book for all the men that do NOT wish to be married. It is a short but inspiring read that explains many of the most common problems that men have in marriage and the many good things that marriage can offer.  All in all, I would recommend this book to any man that is not married and who wants to improve his marriage.  It can help men improve their marriage 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've ever read.  It is packed with information and useful examples to do the job you are doing for your business.  I teach this book to every business student I have.  For example, I teach my students that, in general, if a client wants a new business project, they need to know what a good project will look like, the price, etc.  This book is a must for every business owner.  The best part of this book is the fact that the author has done his research!  The only problem with other books is that they only give examples.  He has compiled information that is based on fact.  If you can read the book and not be impressed with what you read, then you are missing out on the whole concept!  Most business books tell how to do a project, but do not give the reader the information that he/she needs to do an actual project 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have used this book with my daughter for many years.  It's great to read books for younger children.  This is a great book, and it's been a great help in helping my daughter understand concepts.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent, concise reference that gives you step by step instructions and a short guide to finding common stock, which is often overlooked in most corporate transactions.  The text covers a number of common corporate structures from the stock exchange to a board room and offers suggestions on how to structure an internal structure as well.  It also provides guidelines for how to write up a corporate prospectus, how to design the company's balance sheet, and how to price the stock.  A great introduction to corporate finance 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A well-researched and comprehensive history of the United States from the early 17th century until the twentieth century 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First published in 1971, this book is written from the point of view of an American woman in the mid-70s, living in the United States. The narrative style is brisk and engaging. The author is well versed in all areas of American history and sociology. The main character in this novel is Carol Pyle. Ms. Pyle is a self-made millionaire, successful on her own terms, yet she still wants a life of true intimacy and love.  Although Carol is well-educated and well-read, she is an immigrant who never learned English.  Despite the best efforts of her parents, Carol still craves the same things her parents did, like love, freedom and stability. Ms Pyle's life is a struggle to adjust to her changing times.  Throughout the course of her life, Carol's hopes and dreams are constantly thwarted by the same problems and struggles of her forebears of the 20th Century.  The main plotline of the novel follows Carol's relationship with Mr. P.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main theme in this book is the changing face of our country in the last thirty years.  What is it that makes America great now?  Is it the new energy and innovation that have made us a better nation? Is it immigration? Is America's role in the world changing, or has the US been doing the job the world is now needing and has been the envy of the world in the past? These are the big questions to think about.  The answers are different, but the trends remain the same.  These are big changes in our culture, and these changes are driving the changes in the rest of the nation as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book in elementary school, and loved it.  The whole book is full of fun, colorful pictures of the children and their activities.  It is not very technical, but is full with lots of good illustrations.  I recommend this book highly, especially for the older children, because of the "how-to" information.  This book has also been very good for younger children, but the illustrations of the little guys and gals are the best part.  My youngest has even learned some of the basic skills he learns in the picture book, such as making his bed, doing his homework, etc.  Overall, the book is very good, and has been recommended for all ages.  If you like "how to" books, this one is a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book to help parents, children, and even people who are struggling with addiction.  The author was very helpful with all the resources and tips that she found while researching this book.    The chapter on the effects of alcohol on the brain is fantastic.  As the author points out, when the brain stops functioning as it should due to alcohol, a child becomes vulnerable to other problems, and an adult can easily get depressed or anxious.  This book has given a new perspective on this subject.  I have a son with a serious drinking problem.  He has a tough time concentrating at school and can make friends.  But he is also a very bright and active boy who loves sports.  We still have a long way to go to help him!   He is my hero, and I have the confidence to help other parents like him.

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of my all-time favorites.  It covers everything you need to know about being a woman and a parent, and about being in a relationship - the good, the bad and the ugly.  I've always wondered what my parents were like.  This book is great at shedding light on all this.  Very informative and useful.  The illustrations are cute and colorful, and I especially loved the photos of my grandmother - and that's just one of her many personalities.  There are also some nice photos of the great women in the history of this country.  Great books like this are needed in our schools today, and there are so many of them out there.  If you like children's books, this is a great one for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book I learned a lot about marketing.  There are two main reasons why I recommend this book: 1) Because I have been doing business development at a big company for 3 years now, and 2) Because this is my first business development book.   I learned so much!  It is the only business development I have ever read that has a good mix of theory and examples, and it is not too complex.  It provides good examples of things I have seen in the market (and this is what I will apply in my own projects).  I would recomend this book to other business development professionals who are just starting out 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a lot of great info on cooking, cleaning and home life. It's funny to read the books before starting my own cooking. They both seem like a lot more helpful with recipes than general info on kitchen techniques. If you want to learn a lot about cooking and home living from a couple good books then this is the one to get it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of this book. It is one of the most informative and well-written biographies I've read about WWI.The book covers the entire war from beginning to end and covers all important aspects of it. It also gives a good look into what WWI was like from the British viewpoint.  He is very descriptive about the battles as well. The British did a good job in their overall strategy, but the British also had many mistakes.  In my opinion, one of WWI's greatest mistakes was their belief that the allies needed to fight one great front at one time, ignoring the fact that in the end there were no great fronts, but only endless fronts.  The Germans never understood the concept of a front until the spring of 1918 and never knew what a unified front would really look like.I will admit, the book had its problems, however.  It was a bit of a historical tour de force and he was writing in first person, but he was very good at portraying the British mind at the time.  I like this book a lot and it's a must read.  If you like WWI and are into history you will like it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most comprehensive treatment of the Merton-Davies debate on the purpose of art as an end in itself. The two writers are on quite different ends of the scale. However, what makes this book so enjoyable is that it provides an overview of each of these debates with historical information and contemporary examples. The examples are drawn from many different areas, such as art history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, the sciences, film, literature and opera. The book does not touch on the Mertons' famous debate on whether the purpose-of-art debate is really worth debating. This book is recommended for anyone interested in the Mersons and Davies debates. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read for anyone looking to understand the basics of how to build a website, marketing strategy, or just a better understanding of how marketing works.  Excellent read for those looking to learn to sell to corporate clients 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always enjoyed reading this book. I have made many of the recipes based on a previous cookbook, but now I use many of my own "ingredients" and ideas.I really think this is an excellent guide to "how to make" several popular recipes and the many variations on them. I found this book very useful while learning about how to prepare some of the most popular dishes.  Many times, I could find new variations on old recipes!  The best part of this book is that it is organized alphabetically and in its own section for those who are just getting started in cooking 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very informative guide to the history and archaeology of Ancient Egypt.  It offers a wealth of information about the Egyptians' architectural and artistic evolution as well as their cultural and social interactions throughout their time on Earth.  This book covers many interesting topics such as the origins of the pyramids, the nature and role of kings, the evolution of the pharaohs, religion, politics, culture and economy.  I highly recommend this as a companion text for both an individual and a graduate course in Ancient Egypt 
Write a positive review about a good book:   First published in 1991, this is the definitive history of the Holocaust.  The author is a prominent Holocaust scholar, but he has not gone over any text in great detail, nor does he use the term 'Holocaust' without qualification.  He tells of the atrocities that took place in Germany, Austria, and the territories occupied by Germany from 1945 to 1949, and he also tells of what happened in other countries during the Holocaust, including the Warsaw Ghetto and the Treblinka death camp.  This book is especially appropriate for Holocaust studies undergraduates.  It is well organized, with index and index notes, which make it very user-friendly for the first time since the publication of Bormann's book, The Final Solution, in 1945.  Unlike Bormans book, this book offers much more detailed information on each topic.  Many of the chapters also discuss other aspects of the Nazi regime, including its role in other crimes against humanity.The book offers a good overview of the Jewish people as a whole during the war years.  After the publication in 1942 of the Nuremberg Laws, the SS was granted the power to carry out mass deportations.  Jews were not exempt from this new law, which made the laws more effective than the laws applied previously, and it enabled the SS to use the courts to issue orders on Jews throughout the Reich.  In addition, Jews were deprived of their political rights, and many were deported to other countries where their fate after deportation would be uncertain 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book to learn about the intricacies of the legal profession, particularly about how the legal community views the practice of law and its legal profession.    The author clearly explains the history of the profession, how it evolved and why it changed.  The book provides a very thorough and comprehensive account of the role of the attorney and his or her role in the law.  It explains the evolution of the practice from colonial times through the twentieth century.  He also provides a good look at the differences between attorneys and judges, the advantages and disadvantages of different types of law firms, and describes the different aspects of the lawyer's practice 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "It is an excellent book, written by an accomplished historian.  The subject is so fascinating that it can be difficult to keep up with everything."  This was the first book by a prominent American general in the War of 1812, and the most important in the author's career.  This book will be of great interest to anyone interested in the battle of New Orleans.   The author covers a huge amount of territory.  We will see what we need to see.  He does a fine job of summing up the entire war by listing events in chronological order and focusing on major events.  Great attention is given to the strategic and tactical issues that concerned both sides, especially the Americans.  While there are several points that need a little revision, this book does a good job of giving us the best we can.  I enjoyed the historical background, the political and military decisions made, and in some cases the personalities involved.  But the most fascinating part of the battle is the battle itself.  It is a battle that was fought in complete darkness, in which the British and the British generals were not able to see what the Americans were fighting for.  What a beautiful, terrible mess this battle is in the history books.  If this battle were to be covered today, no one would be able to make sense of it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you want to learn something about how to talk to people in a non-threatening way, this is the book for you! It is a quick read, but it packs a lot of useful information in it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "All the old masters were good storytellers. But no one has been able to do it as brilliantly in modern times as the Chinese writer." This is one of the greatest tales ever told and one of my favorites 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a lot of books by the great masters.  This book, however, is one of the best books written about the history of China and is the most detailed and accurate written on the subject ever written.  I bought this book the other day at the library and read it in one sitting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will be extremely useful for anyone working in sales, marketing, or business.  Lots of fun and practical tips on how to be more successful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used to be afraid of going to the library.  The books you find there help you build your confidence.  They show you how to be the best version of yourself.  My mother always taught me this.  And so did my sister.  When I was growing up, my father would not read books with a plot.  He just wanted to read stories.  We had a good life growing up.  Now, my children can build their own lives and are able to be confident and happy.  I hope they can do the same for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad you are here today, and the reason for this review is that I am a long-time reader of this book.  I read it over and over and it was one of the first books that I read in college about being a woman.  You would think I am some kind of special case but I am not.  It is really good to have some guidelines on how to be a woman and this book provides many of them.  The fact that this book is by a man is the biggest positive that I can think of.  His experience and wisdom is invaluable to women who are dealing with this situation and the book is beautifully written.  If you are going through a crisis, or trying to figure out a problem that you have with yourself or a loved one, this book will provide great insight and help 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My daughter and I have both loved this book and our children have been able to enjoy it as well.  This book is one of the best gifts a parent could get for their kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a complete history of the Spanish-American war from the U.S. side, from the capture of Porto Rico to the surrender of Port Royal in April 1877. It covers all the battles and skirmishes, and covers what was the major battles of the war.  I would say, without any doubt, that this book is one of the best available accounts of what happened, and explains some things that are puzzling to some and not to others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great book that is an absolute essential guide to all the things we need to know about sex, dating, romance, etc. A great resource for anyone that's a little nervous about having sex or dating.  And great for newbie/novice/casual-sex types

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book will help you understand how to manage financial matters correctly.  This is a wonderful book.  The principles in this book are timeless.  They are as applicable today as they were in the beginning of the 20th Century.  It is easy to understand and use.  Don't let anyone tell you the book is outdated or unimportant.  If the principles in the book still hold true today, you will be able to manage your finances just as efficiently today.  I was very pleased with the level of detail in the text and the level and detail in exercises.  You will gain insight into financial topics that are currently the subject of debate and academic analysis. I think this book will be of great value to anyone who is serious about financial management.  As I use the principles from this book to manage my own financial affairs, I have had a good success.  When I use this book, I am able to take advantage of the new trends in banking practice, and apply them to my own circumstances 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first book, but it is not only a fine collection, but a great introduction for beginning players.  The techniques are concise, easy to understand, and the examples are full of ideas and useful applications of a lot of different board games 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful book. I read a few of her articles and they are very informative. It would be great to see this in action at the   San Francisco Academy, but I will wait to see if she becomes interested  in the role of a parent

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a wonderful time with this book.  Its not just a bunch of boring recipes, its also an informative and funny look at our relationship as parents and children.  I love it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As the years went by I read and re-read these books as my own.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a long time fan of Robert E. Howard and I bought this book after hearing a few of his books.  Howard was a great writer and I highly recommend the collection of short stories 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very informative and very entertaining. I've been doing research and watching the news for some time and this book has been very helpful in terms of making educated guesses. I really enjoyed the fact that most of the people who predicted the stock market crash in 1929 did not foresee the effect it would have on their own investments.  Most failed to take into account how people react when things change.  The crash was a wake-up call for America.  In many ways, it was a harbinger of the current economic recession.  This is a book with good information and some humor.  It is entertaining.  I purchased the book in paperback and have read it several times.  Overall, this is a very informative, yet informative, book.  Good for anyone who wants to learn more about this subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very good, although a bit difficult to read in it. As a non-believer, I like it a lot because it is easy to understand what this whole belief system is all about and how it started with the Bible.  There are many ways of explaining the Bible (although the author presents most of them) but the main reason that I like the book is because he clearly and convincingly demonstrates that this is what all religions are based on.  The author goes to great lengths to prove that Christianity is true, that God exists and has sent Jesus Christ to Earth to die for our sins, and that his church is the only true one on Earth.  It is a very easy read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand why people believe what they do.  I've done a lot of research into the origins of Christianity and believe it to be true based on what I've learned.  This is one of the best books I've read on this subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great.  I have read a lot of books on meditation, and some of the information is very useful.  This is a very well written book, not a book you have to sit through, but one you can just glance through and get the information.  It would be great to have this book as a part of our curriculum 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has changed my life!  It is such a great read, with lots of great recipes.  I'm hoping to give it as a gift, and it's a great gift to any teen!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book! I am so excited to have this book and be able to share some of my favorite recipes with you!  This book was written by a real genius! It is full of recipes that are easy to make and great for parties or birthdays.  The only drawback is that some of the recipes are slightly pricey...but, if you are going to try them, don't be discouraged.  You can learn all these tasty treats and then come back to the house and share them with your family.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different flavors and ingredients...and if you ever come up with a good one, share it with everyone! I have used many of these recipes on several occasions to make a wonderful meal and have always loved them! I do have a couple that I will share with you here and there. This book has a few tips on how to get a good night's rest. The recipes are great for getting rid of your cravings

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in the late 80's after hearing about her. Her first autobiography was just a collection of stories. It was a book which captured the early years of a young, but very bright, woman. The pictures of the home and the family which came after were of a very different story. Her husband was an engineer but the family had a very simple life and no formal training. I have read her other autobiographies and this one is my favorite. The photographs also show the beauty of life, and this book is also very charming. The descriptions of the meals and events that happened over the years made me feel that I had a lot to learn from her.  She has a clear and well-rounded idea of what you need to know and when to learn it.  I love this book and would recommend it to any young person who wants to learn about their family

Write a positive review about a good book:   A must-have for anyone serious about learning Japanese.  In a way it is a "pre-course" to the Japanese Language Institute 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A terrific guide to many of the basic techniques and tips that have been handed down from the masters for thousands of years.  Many of the techniques have been copied by other instructors but not as well documented.  A good place to start or continue learning.   This is one of the few books I've used and taught myself that is useful for both the experienced lifter and the newbie.  It can be a good resource for those beginning and returning to training 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and I am going to start my own book club in my church to read all the book.    My son who is now 6 years old is very interested in his dolls.  I would give this book as a gift to all the new parents.  He has no interest in the old doll's he still loves to play with and even though they are old and in poor condition, he still wants them.  The new parents will find it hard to keep up.  My only disappointment is that the book is not divided into chapters.  There are many lessons in the book and these lessons need to be included in our homes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read if you have not read "The Devil's Dictionary" or "The Art of Word-Art." I use this as a teaching text and it is very helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read on the subject.  It is well written and comprehensive in all aspects.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic book for anyone, young or old, who have a dog.  The author shares all of her dog training tips in a concise but comprehensive guide to making your dog trainable.  She also tells you about a few of the things to look for when trying to get your dog to train properly, and gives great information on food selection, handling your dog and training techniques.  This book provides great insight into the process of getting a dog to stop barking when someone comes home.  It also has a few tips to help you with training your dog in a day care setting and some tips for getting your dog used to going to daycare and then training him in a real environment.  There is also a section on training for people with disabilities and it gives information about how to train your dog for use in an emergency situation.  Many people also find the tips of using clicker training to be very helpful, and some people use aversive training techniques to teach dogs to avoid certain types of people.  Overall, this is a very informative book and an excellent guide to get started with dog training!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book. It offers some unique information and some great tips on how to build a home, create a credit card, get a mortgage, do business banking, etc. This is just the right book to read in between jobs and jobs of the day.I loved the way the author describes the concept of "business" banking as a different industry altogether, an industry in which the bank is an organization of accountants, accountants like the lawyers and doctors. He describes the history of the bank, the "fairy tale" of the first national bank, B.C.H. Morgan, and how it created the modern financial world. In addition to giving lots of new and valuable information, he includes some nice color photos of the banks today.I like to think of the books in this series as being "prelude" books to the future. As the business world develops, I have to say that I am a little jealous of the "business banker" and of how they got started in the business. I want to thank the author for helping me through my bank (Citibank) loan when I was 23. In all, I'm a "business banker", but I have a lot of "fantasy" banking stories to tell. My bank has a loan program to buy and sell new and used real estate and I hope he'll post more of these soon. He really has provided some really helpful and "informative" details.I am very pleased with how this book is written. It's very clear, easy to understand and it's funny. My husband says he bought this book for my wedding. He and my children love it. It does have some good tips on creating a creditcard, building a home and how to do business.  The only negative review I have read is from an older woman who said "all bankers, including the author, know the rules and regulations of the banking system and will break them on a regular basis for profit." I bought this story to teach my children about banks and I'm glad that they love the book as much as I do 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for people who want to learn about finance, particularly from someone who does it professionally. This book is very practical but has some very useful financial concepts 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has changed my life dramatically.  I am no longer an alcoholic.  A friend of mine suggested it to me after I had a hard time coming to terms with my wife's death.  We had a similar story to tell, and I wanted to find out more about the process of healing after a loss.  She died on Christmas Eve 1999.  My daughter was four and my son was three, and at that time it seemed as if the book had to be written.  When we finished reading, I felt that the loss had stopped bothering me.  The book has been a blessing for me 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a complete overview of the history of the Middle Ages.  The first five chapters cover the period from the late Roman Empire to the early modern period.  This is a great introduction to the period and it provides a solid basis for further study.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is told in two sections.  I found it to be a good place to begin with the basics of the art.   From there I found some of the best of the books by Frank O'Hara

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a great addition to my family!  We enjoyed reading the stories.  The illustrations are very nice and cute.  I learned about my Dad's work with the handicapped and my Grandpa's story telling as he made coffee.  Both of these skills would come in handy when I became a reporter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on the subject.  I bought it on the way to work and took notes while I worked.  It is comprehensive.  The author gives you the basics of basic computer programming with exercises, quizzes, and assignments.  You will be able to program in any operating system (Windows, DOS, Linux, Solaris, etc.), and you will find the answers for almost all the programming problems in this book.  Many of the exercises and tests are difficult, but they provide the basis for more advanced programming exercises and exercises for the exam in this text.  One thing that I found really helpful was the way the author divided the book into the topics of "How to Program" and "Advanced Software Design."  In this way, you get to learn about the programming process from the very beginning to the end.  This book has been extremely useful for my own practice and teaching.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Great guidebook. I plan to order and use this book as my reference for all my classes this year. I find it helpful to identify and describe common and uncommon patterns that are also useful for identifying children with special needs 
Write a positive review about a good book:   First of all, I've been doing research on this book and find it very interesting.  It is an original story, with unique and creative characters.  The book is not just one thing - the characters and events unfold, in various phases of history and in various locations throughout the world.  Each event is written as if it were a single narrative, not a sequence of connected events.  A novel of such depth and scope can only be written by someone with great literary and cultural experience 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books. The author's insights are concise and well thought out, but there is no need to memorize the whole book to be successful 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book covers the history of American baseball from the beginning to the present, and it is the most comprehensive guide to the game to date. The chapters are organized into five distinct time periods: 1776-1912; 1921-1949; 1956-2005; and 2005-present.  This book will help beginners and veterans alike in their quest to learn about the origins and development of the American Baseball Association

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best, in my opinion, on "how to get a woman's panties off".  You will see her, all in all, who is your friend.  You can tell from her looks and her personality whether you can trust her.  The whole book is about this, the hows and whys of women, and their attitudes about sex and how to get girls into bed 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book as a present for a birthday gift for my daughter.  She loved it, and her family really enjoyed the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm glad this book is out, because I've been reading a lot of different books in my life, but I didn't see any one that gave me as much information about my personal life and how I'm going about making the most of my life as an adult.  This one covers almost everything you need to know about what you need in life.  I highly reccomend this book.  It is concise and easy to understand.  Don't be put off by the very technical language, it's all part of life.I will definitely buy the next book I read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of information on how to handle common business problems.  It is comprehensive and practical for many types of business.  The book also contains many of the best strategies and practices used by successful entrepreneurs 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best. I bought this book because I wanted to have something to teach myself about these topics.  I am currently teaching my ninth grade class about the "war on drugs" and "drug policy" in the United States.  My students are very excited and have really enjoyed learning this information.  Although they were not all interested in the war on drugs and the role of the federal government in the drug war, I have been able to draw a few lessons that I can use with my other students 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read all four of these books in about eight months. They were both amazing. I found it easy to read the text. The pictures and illustrations were both fascinating and humorous. Some of the illustrations were very creative. I even found the stories quite enjoyable. I liked all four books.  I found the books enjoyable to read. They had good use of wordplay. Many of the books also have some humor in them. I like the way that the stories were organized.  The author tells the stories in chronological order.    However, I did find it a little confusing at times.  However I could figure out the plot from the text (which made sense to me). This makes the book a little easier to read than the earlier books I have read.  All of the stories are good in their own right.  Each story was funny, but also had a different ending.  Sometimes the ending was funny but also depressing or sad. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a first year student at my college. I read this book and was really impressed by how the author had taught me a lot about my parents. I started thinking about what my parents did in the 80's and I had no idea what was going on in my life until I was about 30. The book was great and I have learned more about my mom since I started reading this book.  The only problem is I was starting to be interested in boys from the age of 8 and I couldn't wait for the "Sibling Code" to be published. I was excited to hear about all the different things my mom did in her spare time. I had read a few books about my childhood and was still having problems relating to the things I was doing. But I was getting closer and closer to my parents... I think it's because I was reading about them and trying to figure out what they were thinking.  If you are having difficulty with things, your parents, and have trouble with your personality, I strongly recommend this book!! My parents did not expect me to be successful in life, but they were very proud of me. They were there for me when I needed a friend, but my brother got to know me through reading this amazing book. He told me his mom was very strict, my dad had a hard time with me because he was too smart for his son. The books are very helpful to people like me. This book is a great read and it will open up a lot of doors for you

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent read for anyone who is new to this sport.  She begins with a brief history of the game, explains some fundamentals, and then moves on to detailed, beginner level lessons.  Each chapter ends with a series of exercises that can be used to enhance your skill in the game.  Many of the exercises are based on standard strength training routines.  Others are based solely on basic movements, and still others utilize games or tricks from the video games to reinforce the fundamentals

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a GREAT book. I first read the book in high school, and since then, I have always felt that I should have gone to law school. This is one of those books that I look forward to every summer and read for enjoyment. This book explains everything you ever wanted to know about law school - and much, much more! This book will also give you some great ideas about what to do after law school, such as what to study, how to prepare for the bar, and more importantly, what to get started with your practice as an attorney. The book contains information on many topics, ranging from preparing for your state bar exam to how to select a good law firm to working with clients. I have been practicing law for ten years, and I use all of this information in my practice. For anyone who wants to go into law after high school and law school experience will provide you with more valuable information about the job, business, and life. Many of these ideas will also be useful in your graduate school application.This book is essential for anyone who would like to go to law. Although it contains information about law schools and law students, it has much, MUCH more information about what it is like to be a law student in the real world. The information is presented in the context of a college/university student - although many of these topics are very applicable to working professionals as well! If you need to get an idea of the actual job and life of a law school student, this book gives you all of the info you need.

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of my first readings was a book called "The Mythology of Easter Island" by George Macdonald.  I was a young girl, still in third grade, in the 1960's.  It's such a compelling read.  And, like I say, we are now, more than 70 years after Macdonald's death, re-examining the history of Easter island with renewed interest and enthusiasm.  Our children are now in the midst of learning about the story.  They are in the middle school/high school curricula.  But there is more that can be learned.  This book, and much of the information it contains, is still in the public domain, published in full before 1900.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book I have had in my library for over ten years. I was surprised by how much I liked it when I bought it from amazon in 2007.  I had never read about a woman becoming a mother.   My husband was interested in it and recommended it for our anniversary this year.  We started reading together and after finishing the book, we became friends.  Since I was looking for a baby shower gift for my son and my husband, I read this book together and he gave it to me.  He was happy that I got this book and is proud of me for becoming a parent.  Now I can't wait to read about another woman becoming mother.Thanks for sharing your story 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I first read this book while I was studying the life of Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Elizabeth II.  After that I read and read and never looked back.  I am so grateful for this wonderful book!  This is one of the most beautiful and fascinating of all the Elizabethan biographies.  Elizabeth I was a queen, Queen Elizabeth was a princess, Elizabeth II was a king, Elizabeth's royal court was not unlike the Roman Coliseum.  Her life was not easy and this book is full of wonderful details about Elizabeth I.  It is amazing how many times Elizabeth is mentioned in other historical biographies, but I really don't think she was ever fully integrated into history books.  She wasn't well known and her story is certainly not told very well.  Even so, this book does a great job at bringing Elizabeth I to life, and giving us a glimpse into her life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Truth about Guns", written by Michael Moore, is my favorite book ever. I have a degree in psychology and was raised in the area of mental health and guns, and this book has helped me so much. I recommend it highly to anyone that wants to learn more about guns. "The truth about guns" was written with a great deal of insight and was very readable. I highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has many ways of helping parents deal with their children. It helps parents find what works and it helps parents learn what does not work.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a difficult time coming to terms with a life that seemed to come together as a happy accident.  It would be impossible for anyone to do such a thing, and in many ways, the love between two women who lived in the same town was one of the first loves between the two of us.  I was not only an infant, but a toddler, and yet I was able to experience and understand the love and trust in those relationships, as well as the lessons I learned from them.   It seems that this is what all of life is about - relationships and lessons.  If I ever come to regret my lack of time to practice my relationship skills and practice in a relationship, I think this book is for me.  She is very kind to the readers, but very frank and practical in her methods of teaching relationship skills.  For those of you who want to practice relationship skills, or if you are interested in creating new friendships, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   An extremely informative guide to preparing a successful project for production.  From concept to execution, the authors have extensive experience and success in both media and on-set 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only reason this book has any success is that it tells you where to get the best books.  I have read a lot of these books over the past decade and I recommend them all to my son.  What I also recommend is that you learn what is important to your child.  It is important for a child to know about family and relationships, about the future, and about health and well-being.  Your child needs to know all of this so that he will grow into a healthy person who can handle any situation in life.  For example, my daughter is learning about how to make food from the age of 3.  You need to know where to look for this information if you want your child to enjoy this important topic.  Don't skip the beginning.  Do a lot more research, and then use the books to build your child's understanding of family dynamics.  In other words, don't just read about this stuff, you need to experience it for yourself

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best one I've ever read.  The only reason I hadn't read this before now was because I wanted to see how it would be interpreted.  It is so well done.  I wish there was a second edition.  If only for the pictures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the definitive history of the Civil War that has not been written.  The text is a delight to read.  It covers all aspects of the war, from the military leaders who made and implemented decisions to the civilians and their views.  This book is concise, clear, and informative.  I was thoroughly entertained and learned a great deal about the war.   I can say with confidence that if you were to read any other book on the topic of the War, it would be difficult to know where to begin, or in which direction to turn.  However, I will say this:  As an active soldier in the South, I found this book to be very helpful in understanding my actions during the war and the issues I faced.  As a civilian who lived through the war with my family, I was delighted by its information about the Civilians who fought the war as well as the Soldiers who fought in it.  My brother served in the war in the Pacific for a short time as a Major and was deeply affected by it. I learned from this book and the soldiers who fought there that I was wrong to believe in the "Greater Good." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like fantasy but don't think it can be all things. I recommend this book.  I just can't get enough. I read this for pleasure, not to learn.  So far I've learned quite a lot about the Middle Ages.  It's interesting how many different ways people in the world see the Middle Age.  The main point I make is that in most peoples' minds, the Middle ages are a myth.  And I agree with that.  A myth only tells us the story of the decline of the Roman empire, not all aspects of the Middle-Age.  They don't tell us all of the ways people thought of the middle ages.  Some people think of the dark ages as a time of decline because of all the wars.  Others think of it as a glorious age, with the golden age of the knights and kings.  Yet, in the middle of all of this darkness, a great hero was born... and we'll never forget him.  Not really

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was raised by a mother with an open and loving heart. I read this book to my son when he was very little, and to my daughter when she was 4. I think it will help her to understand how to express her feelings, her thoughts and how to deal with problems 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a great read, in its original form. The story has a very sad ending but the whole thing is very charming and entertaining 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read. The title is a little misleading and the book is a bit dated but it is a must have for all of us to read.  It teaches us that God is love, not "God's way or the highway."  God's love has a history of creating and destroying.  God uses love to give us the tools to live out of balance.  Our God is also the creator of evil.  His plan to love us was imperfect from the beginning but we are the result of that plan.  So why are we so quick to judge others?  We need to stop thinking that we are doing it all to make ourselves right.  This may seem like a difficult problem.  We often see other Christians (particularly Protestants) who seem to be doing just fine without God, without knowing God, just by looking inward.  If you want to know more about God, read this book.  I have shared this book with many of my young children, with some of my adults, and even with some who live with me.  You will learn that God loves them as much as they love themselves.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a superb guide to the early Christian Church.    While this book provides information and explanations in its entirety, the author takes care to provide details that are more or less in a chronological order.  This book offers not only a detailed description of the early Church, but also of its members' lives.  By the end of the book the reader has learned more about early Christianity in general and early Christian history in particular than he would by any other single book.  The material presented here is presented in the form of a history of Christianity.  It has been compiled using primary sources.  What makes the book such an excellent work is the author's thorough research, her deep knowledge of early Church history, her understanding of the Church, and her ability to convey the information presented.  Her book is useful for laymen as well as for church leaders.  If one has read a book on the Church before, one should read this one first. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great information in a concise and fun to read.  I am learning about these amazing animals and sharing my passion with you.  This book has had a tremendous impact on my life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very happy with this book. The pictures are great and the illustrations are very funny.  It is very well organized and easy to follow.   The best part is the information on all the different types of plants.  The authors cover the plant life in detail.  Many of the plants have specific uses in various household items.  I particularly enjoyed the sections on kitchen plants, the animals and the birds.  There are many different animals that eat plants and their use of plants has been studied.  Plants that are useful in medicine and pest control have been described.  We also learn how to tell which plants have been used to build the pyramids.  All of this is important information on a very important topic that most people don't know.  Overall this book is great!  I have not seen an illustrated book like this in any other book.  While most of the information is in terms of pictures, I like the way the information has been written.  This is a great book for people who would like to learn more about plants. I am buying this book now and will read it to my children 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is very informative.  I purchased the book and then read it for fun.  This book is for anyone who is having problems with the concept of an exclusive sexual relationship.  The main point of this book is to show that exclusive sexual relationships do not make a good long term relationship. The author provides good advice on what to do when things get really out of control.  He gives a good explanation of what happens when the partners fall apart.  You must be very clear on your boundaries, what you will do, and when you will break your boundaries.  One important thing to remember is that the "special" relationship that one person has with another is not a special bond, a special love, or anything that a human being is born with.  Human beings are born with two kinds of brains, which are not interchangeable.  We evolved from animals with this problem that made them.  It is not an easy problem to solve!  If this is an important problem to you, it is important that you learn to solve it.  There are some people who are naturally born to be with someone.  Then there are people who must learn how to be happy with someone they cannot have, by learning to be contented and faithful, so that they are not hurt by their partners.  If you are happy with your current mate, this book will help you learn how.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is comprehensive and easy to understand.  There is a whole chapter about the history of the Russian Revolution.  It's a fascinating read, very well done, very concise.  I found myself going back and rereading the same chapters over and over.  This is one of my favorite books of all time!  It is so comprehensive and complete that you can read it in a couple of hours or a day.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that my graduate students used to help explain what they learned in calculus.

Although it is written for college students, I would suggest that graduate students with calculus backgrounds also use this book as a text or reference.  I'm looking forward to seeing your graduate course 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great start to understanding the evolution of language. I purchased this book for a birthday gift, and I used it as a child's guide to the basics. The chapters were not too difficult. My son learned about four basic elements of language: the sounds, the sounds that make sentences, the grammar, and the rules. He was given a book full of words, a picture book, and a toy box. He could write and read by the time he turned 3. He can now understand grammar and write without an aid. I have a good understanding of evolution, and this book made it easier to understand my child's understanding. I am now teaching my three-year-old about language.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great addition to my study of the late 20th century.  It gives a history of the Soviet Union in a style that is accessible and informative.  I found the content to be very informative.This book is great for those who are new to the topic and also for those familiar with the topic, as it provides many examples of how the Soviet system functioned.  If you are an academic and are looking for a way to teach or just to have a refresher course on this topic, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a valuable addition to the subject of marriage.  The author describes what is going on in the marriages of the top income families in the United States.  He goes into great detail of the ways in which these marriages fail.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you are married or single.  It is a great resource for understanding how these marriages function.  As an ex-husband, I know that marriage is much different today from what it was a generation ago.  This book was very helpful to me in my divorce.

My daughter loves the animal pictures and is very interested in animals at the park.  She has made friends with many of the animals.The book is full of fun facts and useful tips on caring for your animal friend.  I have recommended this book to many of my friends and have given it to my children.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book contains some of the most beautiful and poignant poems of this poet.  I purchased the book in December of 2005 after I purchased all of his previous work and have been thoroughly enjoying it ever since.  His writing is graceful and poetic.  It's a joy to read.   His prose is very funny and whimsical.  Many of the poems are well-known but very original.  The book also contains a wonderful glossary of the words.  If you are a serious poet or lover of poetry I strongly suggest that you buy this book and get started with all of the great poems of  this poet 
Write a positive review about a good book:   First published in 1979, this is a very well-researched work on the topic of the historical origins of the "War of 1812."    In this work, David L. Hall offers the most comprehensive and convincing theory of why the war started and how it developed, using the latest historical scholarship and the most contemporary materials.  This book is by far the best treatment of the origins of war to have been published.   This is truly a work of great importance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful resource to learn how to deal with difficult people when you're in a relationship.  The tips from this book are excellent for dealing with difficult relationships and a wonderful guide to dealing with people who will only ever want to see you succeed.  Even though many of the tips are specific to your relationship, it is useful to know more general tips on how to handle people in general.  Many of the concepts covered here are used in the relationship tips found in my book "Doing It For You".

Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with everything Mr. Babbitt writes. I have read and enjoyed most of his books before, but he takes his time to really develop a character who has not only gone through a lot, but is still stuck in a position in life that does not require him to make great choices.  Mr.Babbitt has a keen eye for what we humans need in order to move on with our lives, and in order for us to move past our fears and problems.  He does not simply take on this challenge, he takes a stand in the face of adversity and does not give in.  I have not read much historical fiction, but I highly recommend this one 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great introduction to the subject.  I have not yet read the best book on the subject, but this one is a lot better, and is written in a concise but informative manner.  A great resource. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book provides good insights about how to create a business, but its also a lot about marketing strategy and customer acquisition.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite historical detective of all time, although his best books are less successful in this regard.  Arthur Conan Doyle is a great storyteller, a great teacher, and a very witty man.  If you want to understand this detective, read about him, not read about Conan Doyle.  But if you want a good detective novel, read Doyle.I was a detective for almost my entire life.  My first book was The Blue Carbuncle when I was eleven and I was about 11.  I was still in love with the book, and still loved the detective's job.  After that, I read everything Conan Doyle wrote and every novel except for two of his best detective novels, which I had never read until recently.  That's why I was very surprised when I read the first half of this book.  This was my first foray into Arthur Conan's work and I couldn't believe how well he wrote these detective novels.  The mysteries are engaging and fascinating, the characters are interesting and the storyline is intriguing.  These books are also good if you are interested in early American history.  What I liked most about this book is that it provides you with the backstory of this brilliant detective.  He is a product of his time and environment.   He grew up in a small town in upstate New York.  His father was a wealthy butler to the family.  Doyle has created an atmosphere in this book that allows you to connect with him 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always wanted to read this book but never had the opportunity.  I couldn't wait to get this book.  It was wonderful.   The author explains everything about the health benefits of vegetables and fruits and explains why these plants help protect against diseases and protect against disease in general.  He also lists out some very important reasons why these crops protect the human body.  The last part of the book goes over what you should be eating to obtain the maximum benefits.  This book gave me so many ideas.  And I found that vegetables really were a better choice for me than the usual fruits and meats.  Of course, not everything I wanted to eat is in this book...I'll have to get some other books to find out the best recipes!I just finished the book and can honestly say it is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the health of the body 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've ever read, both in print and on the web. Great illustrations!  If you've never taken a biology course before and want to learn more about the evolution of life, this is the book for you.  It can also be used for science fair projects

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this fascinating look at the historical and religious roots of the world, Prof. Tisdall shows that, from the dawn of history to the advent of Christianity, there has always been a battle between orthodoxy and science. He explains the reasons for this conflict in the Bible and the great scientists who fought for scientific truth. In his engaging, engaging and highly readable story, Professor Tisdell demonstrates how the battle over science in the twentieth century led to the destruction of the ancient world's greatest scientific institutions, culminating in the Cold War and the destruction and decline of science in Europe. The book begins with the great Greek scientist and logician Archimedes, who is responsible for the development of modern analytical methods for the detection of irregularities in the Earth's rotation. Archimede found that the earth has three times more matter in its core than the present-day Earth, and was the first to use this idea to calculate the size of the earth and its orbit. Tied into this is the fact that Archimedes also invented the first mechanical calculator, and, like many other early scientists, had an intellectual vision which saw the future as full of new technologies of communication, analysis and control. However, the development in Europe of a scientific philosophy in which science was not held to be a religious mission was one of the greatest developments in the Western World for at least two hundred years. Tying into this concept, Professor Rene Descartes (1496-1541) proposed that the mind of God is nothing more than a process of logic and mathematics. The development of scientific method in the modern world was viewed by many as the end of religion as we know it. However with his mathematical and scientific thinking, Descarte argued, man becomes a part of the universe. As a result, DesCartes proposed that science must be kept as far as possible separate from religion. This view has been controversial for two hundred and fifty years. The scientific revolution was accompanied by the development and growth of a new Christian Church, the Roman Catholic Church, which became the Church of the Catholic Church. The result of this split in the faith was an end to the search for a scientific explanation of natural events and, by extension, to all scientific inquiry. This period of the decline of the West in science, Tisdick explains, was known as the dark ages, which, in his words, is the most significant historical period in the history of science. Ties into this story of the beginning

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great reference book for first year medical students. I got the entire series over a year ago and it is still the most useful of the series. It will give you an insight to the medical profession and how to prepare. I would highly recomend it to any medical student. It gives you a lot of great ideas on how to get started in your medical career, but also gives you lots of good ways to approach medical practice. I used a lot different examples from real clinical cases to illustrate how different diseases and procedures are treated. The book is very easy to read and a great place to start.I found the book to be very informative 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good book. My children are now using it at bedtime, and they learn the alphabet and shapes from it. The pictures and book illustrations are a great help, and the text makes sense. It's an inexpensive book and great for home, or for use with an older child. I will read to my 5-year-old and a 6-year old. It also works well for younger children as a "learn-by-doing" activity. It covers how to draw animals and figures and animals in the alphabet. The book is illustrated by several animal illustrators. My daughter is learning to draw "Greebles", a simple bird, and "Kangaroos". She is beginning to draw letters and other things, but it is so fun and easy to follow the pictures.  She is also learning about shapes and how to use letters and numbers.The illustrations help to remind my daughter of the letters of the alphabet

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best on the topic of  the occult in a long while.   I purchased this book after spending time with my  grandmother, who is a witch.

Dr. Kelly Jones's professional experience as a mother of two children ages four and five and her personal life as a professional working with preschool children and older children has given her unique insight into how to assist them.  She also shares her professional perspectives on some of the challenges parents encounter in working with children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. It has lots of ideas for different types of games, but it focuses mostly on games which have a high level of complexity. Most of the ideas are easy to implement, and most of them are easy enough to learn by reading. This is especially useful for beginners.I learned a lot of new tricks, such as the "solution" of a Sudoku puzzle. I had always thought the solution could be based on the rules of the game, but my instructor pointed out that the rules could be simplified by including all of the rules. This book made the rules for the game look so simple, and also made the solution easy to learn and implement.This book is also very good for getting started with game design 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had just watched this show and wanted to read this book.  The best part was that she kept everything in order - the book has more than 300 pictures.  You won't be able to put it down!  In this book,  you'll get to see your favorite  characters and see the  most  of the set.   If you're looking for a funny book, look no further than this one.  My 4-year-old enjoyed the book  more than I did, but  it was fun for everyone!

My daughter enjoyed this book and I found it easy to read to my daughter and she liked it! She wanted to learn how to do some simple stitches. I would say this book is perfect for either beginner/intermediate knitters or anyone else that is wanting to get into knitting. The pictures in this book are great, very nice and colorful. If you are looking for a book that covers many different types of stitches, this is the book for you. It's a great reference book, as well as a great resource for making a new baby blanket

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I read it because I'm a woman and I wanted to be brave, but I also wanted to find my strength and confidence. It is my greatest joy to see a person that I used to be afraid of finally have the courage to stand up and be their true self. She explains the "truth" about being a woman, being a mother and being a Christian, as well as the truth about the "love" of Christ.  For someone like me who had not seen much of her church for the last 25 years, it was a wonderful "coming home." The book includes wonderful stories of how women have helped other women overcome their fears of their children.The story of the "little boy" who loved the Little Mermaid was a real eye opener to me! It also taught me about the importance of keeping God's Word and using that truth to help the woman who we are. It also helped me recognize and overcome the "scared" voice within my heart that has kept me down my whole life! I have had a long struggle with fear for myself and other people.  It has taken me many years to realize that my struggle wasn't because of me, but because of the way my heart was. It will take even more time and effort to heal and to live the truth 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Big Money is an eye-opening, jaw-droppingly fascinating account of the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry's exploitation of poor populations around the world."  The main character, William Thompson, is the executive vice president of a major pharmaceutical company, which makes the deadly blood pressure medication, Dilaudid.  He was also in charge of the company's aggressive marketing campaign, which promised to turn the company into "the world's greatest drug company."  His interest was in the potential for a new generation of cheap drugs.  Thompson writes about his first time taking Dilaudids:  "I didn't like them.  I had to lie down.  They worked!  I've been addicted ever since."  By now, Thompson has made a fortune, and is trying to keep his addiction a secret from his wife and children.  But the drug industry is still the target of much public outrage and much political attention.  A major campaign is on the way to make FDA drug approval mandatory for all drugs, and the FDA has started to approve new drugs for high-risk conditions.  The problem is, as Thompson points out, a major drug company already owns a big chunk of the FDA, making its decision-making power even more powerful.  For a start, the FDA already has no regulations for Dilaudis, so it can approve these new products with the least amount of public oversight. Thompson describes the FDA's process in detail:  The FDA has the power to refuse to approve any drug for a given indication if the drug is unsafe or ineffective.  If the FDA does not issue a new drug for any reason, the manufacturer can simply put new labels on old, defective, or recalled products.  As a result, these new, dangerous products, with their "off-label" use, are still available to the public.  After all, the original product was approved for millions of people, but now it is the only drug that is widely available for low-risk uses in low-income populations around Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  This story shows the FDA not to be an agency for "safe drugs" but an agency that routinely pushes risky drugs onto the public and into the hands of irresponsible doctors.  It tells us, first, that the FDA can do a lot to protect its market share by denying approval for drugs to which a drug company is unwilling to submit a risk-benefit analysis.  (Thompson's account of

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on the subject of building a great business.  I'm a member of the Business Owners Council of Florida and have been with this book since it first came out in 1985.  It's the book I read and used for my MBA.  You won't find a better resource on the topic than this book.   For the rest of your MBA studies, I would recommend this book over and over again

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful, wonderful book.  This collection, much of which is about Shakespeare's sonnets, is one of the most informative and entertaining I've seen on the subject.  I especially enjoyed the chapter on "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and the chapter "A Winter's Tale" that goes into great detail on the "The Winter's Lover" and "Much Ado About Nothing" and discusses the origins of the King Lear tragedy.  A friend who teaches Shakespeare has also shared a great interest in the historical context in which these plays were written.  She's been searching for the origins for a very long time and this book has been the key to her finding.  My only hesitation is with "The Tempest".  It seems that many scholars have concluded that "The Man on the Rocks" is a prelude to the play "The Merchant of Venice".  Others suggest that it is simply a story about a mad, cruel young man that is written to deal with the problems of being a ruler in 16th century England.  What I believe is more probable is that the play is an allegory for the problems the King of England is having with his courtly court.  There is no question in my mind that this play is about the King's growing concern about his own children.  His father, who has died a long time ago and left him with three daughters, has gone insane and lost his mind.  The King's daughters are the most unfortunate.  Their marriages are not the sort of affairs that one expects to be stable with the King having three sons who do not share his vision for the kingdom.  In this case, their parents are more concerned about pleasing their husbands than their children. The play is therefore an allegorical retelling of Shakespeare's "A King's Speech".  The play continues to deal very closely with incest.  While I did not find this play to be incestuous per se, I did find it to be quite bizarre and in some parts very difficult to watch.  One thing that was particularly difficult for me to watch was the fact that the King does not respond at all.  He's clearly not comfortable with having his children married and his actions demonstrate that he's completely detached from his children.When he returns home from his tour of the world, the King spends very little time with his three daughters.  As I read this play, the one that really got me thinking was the play's third act
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful, funny collection that has great humor about a wide variety of topics - especially parenting.  It has beautiful illustrations that make you smile.  I would have loved to read this as a child, as this is a book I wish I had read as a kid.   I wish this book had been a staple in school instead of something that I was assigned to read and enjoyed the pictures more 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I learned so much about my own childhood from these photos. They were amazing, and I never forgot the pictures. In one of my first coloring books I was allowed to color all of the photographs. It made learning about the past fun and educational! It's a great book for younger or older children. The photographs are of such a nice size and have a good flow to them, the captions are helpful, and some interesting facts are included. I was able to put the book to good use when I was coloring with my older sister as well

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Bestiary" is a very informative text to anyone who has never seen a real animal, and a good reference book on this subject.  The book begins with an excellent chapter on "The Unbelievers," which discusses the concept of the "supernatural" more thoroughly than anything I have seen in this genre.  It also includes a great bibliography, which includes many of the other works I have cited in this chapter.  I recommend this book highly.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved the pictures in this book.  The book is full of great stories.  I found the characters funny, and funny enough.  Although all are very different, it is easy to identify with some of them.  Other characters were well-drawn, and did a great job of explaining to the reader what they had experienced.  Overall, the illustrations are lovely, and the story flows nicely.   The story was a bit slow, however.  My favorite chapters were those where the characters were talking to their children.  It was a good story for anyone who has a child who is about to leave home

Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've read in a long time! It will have you wondering how many ways you can "make" a bad book better. It is about the difference between good and bad books - how to make a good one.   It's a wonderful book with the author's personality coming through clearly - his stories are funny but they don't rely on a plot or plot twists.  Instead they are simple and clear.  I liked his take on the war in Iraq and his take of the war crimes trial in Germany.  He's a great military man

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am an RN in a long-term marriage and have struggled with issues related to work-life balance in our family. I was particularly interested in learning about how this affects our children.  As you read, you will notice that I have found it difficult to find any good books on this topic.  I have read several books on the importance of good child care.  Unfortunately, I have also found many resources to the contrary.  In my practice, I feel a lot of pressure to care for my children at a younger age.  Although I find it interesting and valuable to learn about this issue, I felt this book was written specifically for RN's with children in the home.  However, it has also been useful for people who just want to be better parents.   This book also contains a wealth of useful tips on how to work with your spouse and make your relationship work better

As someone who used to have the same problems in college that Ms. Binkley mentions in her book, I have been able to write more effectively.  Ms.Binkley teaches me how to structure a book and how to write my own.  Her strategies and techniques are easy to understand and have been very helpful to me.

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a member of the staff of the National Book Critics Circle and as the co-author of a book on the New Testament, I can say that Professor Niebuhr is the best and most insightful writer on the topic.  He takes us beyond the New Testaments to the New Church and the New World.  His is not a dry, scholarly treatment of the Bible, but a compelling history of a vibrant religious culture which, until recently, had never been given its due 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides an excellent description of the role of Islam in the Western World.  Many other books have dealt with the Islamic presence in the West, but the authors do a much better job of showing how Islam has been implemented throughout Europe and America.  I would have given this book 5 stars if I had read it in its original, complete form.  The introduction provides a quick overview of Islamic history.  It includes historical facts about the Muslim presence in Western Europe, as well as descriptions of Islamic practice and teachings.  After describing the history of European-style Islam, the authors go on to discuss the current Muslim population in Europe and the USA.  These two chapters are excellent in their entirety.  For a more in-depth study of the current Muslims in the United States, I would recommend the work of Mark Steyn.  In the United Kingdom, Dr. John Esposito has written a very positive book on Islamic law.  Dr. Espositto, a Muslim convert, uses the example of the Koran to explain how the Koran has been enforced in England since the mid-eighteenth century.  He also shows how the Islamic State was created in Syria and Iraq by means of a conspiracy of Western politicians, business people and military intelligence.  Although this book discusses the history and practice of Islam throughout Europe, there are plenty of pages that go into the workings of Muslim immigration into Europe.  By far, the most complete book I have read on the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book offers an alternative to both the secularism promoted by the left and the conservative religion of the right.  It presents conservative views on the basics of the universe and their relationship to our daily lives.  They are not in conflict.  The book is not simply an academic study of religion but a critical and entertaining look at the relationship between religion and science.  All of the religious views of evolution are presented from the perspective of faith and not science.The author offers some interesting facts and opinions on the relationship of religious thinking to science, but the most fascinating sections of the book involve religion and the evolution of the Bible.  In the Bible, there are many contradictions and inconsistencies between scientific information and biblical interpretations.  These problems can be found in many other early writers, such as the New Testament authors, as well.  However, evolution in the Bible is presented in a context with a Christian interpretation, based on the Bible's scientific information.  There are many flaws with Darwin's and Harris' interpretations of the science and the authors' attempts to explain these problems are amusing to read.  A few chapters on the evolutionary origins of the Christian faith can be read as a companion to this book.  Both the book and the book of Genesis are the only major examples of a text that is used to explain the origin of all life and the origins of mankind.  This is one of the most important chapters of all the scientific information available to date on the origins and history of life on earth.  Readers will not be disappointed with the conclusions drawn from these chapters.  I recommend this book highly 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is for the beginner as well as the advanced and is organized in chapters.

Great for anyone who wants to save money on expenses or on meals.  I would say this book is well done 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book in 1994 and was instantly hooked!  I had never read a story so good.  I enjoyed reading about these women because I have experienced the same struggles.  They also gave me insight into the other problems I was having at that time in my life.  It is not an easy read but it makes you think about these issues in a different way.  These are all stories of love and life. I found the language to be beautiful and the story telling very captivating 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of this book.  I purchased it in a local book store in 2004.  The title is self-explanatory, but this novel gives us a lot of insight on this crazy, beautiful, funny and strange culture that is the state of Hawaii.  For the most part, this is a novel that can be enjoyed by both Hawaiiites and non-Hawaiians.  We are introduced to many interesting characters as well as some interesting events and facts.  From my perspective, this book is the most accurate, comprehensive and helpful portrayal of Hawaii that I have seen to date.  While this is not a novel with any profane language, it does contain many examples of swear words.  However, I think that this is probably the best representation of what people in Hawaii actually talk about and do.  This book contains several scenes with very explicit language that are used to describe sexual activity.  There are many sexual and violent incidents that take place in this novel, but it is also extremely detailed about the island of Oahu.  It also gives us several details about how Hawaii differs from its U.S. neighbor.  Although Oahu is a small state, it is by far the most populated island in the contiguous U. States and is, by far, the most industrialized.  Its economy is based heavily on tourism and entertainment.  Hawaiians are not allowed to own guns, have a state legislature, or hold political office.  Consequently, it seems that there are no real conflicts between native Hawaiians and non Hawaiians as one would expect in the U. S.  Also, Hawaii does not use the word "Hawai" in its constitution to indicate the territory's citizenship.  In fact, the island is a U.N. member, although it is not recognized by the United States.  Thus, Hawaii's constitution is entirely separate from the U,S. Constitution.The book also contains interesting facts about native Hawaiian culture that are not included in the census.   For example, the indigenous population is said to have made up between 30 to 35 percent of Hawaii's population of 2.8 million in 1900.  If they were listed as a separate ethnic group, then the state's population would have dropped to between 2 and 3 million.  Even the people of Maui, Hawaii, are listed in the 1900 census as native Hawaiicans.  On the other hand, the majority of native Hawaians today
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is really good and easy to follow.  There are lots of good illustrations.  Some of the concepts are very simple, but the exercises are very difficult.  The text uses a lot of charts and charts are really useful.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best source for my own personal beliefs.  I have been reading her books for years and have been growing and changing.  This is a well written, very interesting book.  If you believe, like me, that Jesus Christ had a wife, that this was not the Christ of the Bible and that He is not the one to whom the Bible was given.  It is an excellent reference for the Christian believer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was one of the best in my childhood. It was interesting how I was taught that the stars came into being, and that people could see them. I learned that these stars came in and out as the sun went through its cycles. As the sun goes around the earth, the stars appear to come in and go out, and when the sun moves through the earth.  I learned how to measure and measure up.  It's been a while since I got this book when I was a little kid, and it's given me a much better understanding of my family and my ancestors, and I also know a lot more about what goes on in the big picture.  If you are curious about your own family's history, read this book and you will understand.  This is a great book to have on your shelf when you go to sleep.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book about love and sex and how love and sexual desire can be healthy and good in a relationship.  This book is not just about love, however, it is a very thorough reference book on the anatomy of the genitals.  The author discusses the normal and abnormal genitalia as well as common problems in sexual desire.  His book is based on experience and scientific data, with a few examples and suggestions to increase sexual desire and sexual performance.  It also includes an appendices section that contains common problems with sexual desire, as well a glossary that includes the terms sexual frustration, masturbation, orgasms, orgasmic function and orgasmic disorder.  Although this book is geared towards couples with children, it covers all ages.  I would recommend this book to any couple who has problems with their sexual desire or dysfunction of some kind.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, I got to know a number of great authors, and I learned a lot about these authors, who in the past wrote about their own struggles, or about other struggles of others.  I learned about how difficult it can be to come up with a great book on one's own, and how difficult and time consuming it can really be.  This book is wonderful, and as I read it, I kept wanting to share with other writers  all of the tips and tricks I have learned, and to learn from those authors.  So I bought a book for the first time in a while, and was able to pick up some more tips from them.  That is how I learned everything I know about writing, from here on out.  And I would recommend this book to anyone who writes,  from beginning to end.

It was great that I was able to read this book before trying to implement the concepts in my first major programming project.  I got some pointers along the way that were helpful.

The best chapters, to my mind, are "A Sports Fan's Guide to the Greatest Games Ever Played," "Inside the Mind of Michael Jordan," "The Game in Your Mind," "How I Saved Myself from a Bad Book: The Secrets of a Master Sports Psychologist" and "The Sport Psychology of Winning: Why You Win More Than You Think and What You Can Do to Achieve the Same Results

What kinds of things are wrong in your marriage?  You will learn that sometimes you have to get rid of an unpleasant spouse. I recommend reading the first few chapters.

The recipes are very good, too.  They cover both indoor and outdoor plants

It is certainly a must for Roman history students, especially for those who are beginning or continuing their studies 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As an introduction to the subject, the book provides a wealth of examples of different approaches to the problem.  Although each chapter focuses on a single example, the discussion is broad and covers a wide range of important ideas, terminology and approaches.  From the first chapter, the author explains what he means by the problem of designing an efficient implementation of some complex system, and how to determine when a problem is one-sided or two-sided.  The book also covers some of the most important approaches to efficiency in the literature and the challenges associated with designing such systems.  After introducing the terminology and the methodology, the chapters on implementation and design go into more detail.  These sections are well written and very informative.   The text is organized in four parts.  Each part contains several practical examples that illustrate the ideas covered in the previous two parts of the book.  Chapters 7 to 10, the "design examples," are organized in a way that provides an overview of design methodology as it applies to a specific system.  Chapter 7, "The Design Process," deals with specific software components.  In addition, chapter 12 discusses some examples from the real world and some software problems that can help us evaluate the approach to design problems.

I was very pleased with this one.She talks about the many ways that women have influenced the course of history and the development of the universe, and I thought that she did a great job of showing how women are changing society.  In addition, she explains how women's history has changed in response to the needs of the time.  The importance of science to women and society has also played a key role in her analysis, as has the evolution of female leadership and the decline of traditional family structures.  She is one of the first to explore women's power in the global economy, which has been a long time coming.  Her work covers some of the great changes that have occurred in the world in the last 100 years, and it is one for the ages

Write a positive review about a good book:   A classic work of investigative journalism, "The Big Catch" takes a look at the "big fish" - the very rich and powerful - in order to expose their misdeeds, their misappropriations of public resources, and the resulting damage to the environment and the public.  This is one of the most fascinating and comprehensive works on the subject ever published, and has received great acclaim from many other journalists and other authors.  One must read this book in its entirety - from cover to cover - to fully understand the problem of the super rich and their misuse of the environment.  It is also a great introduction to investigative journalism

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best and most complete work on this subject I have seen.  In addition to a wealth of examples, the author has written an excellent general introduction to the subject.  He provides his own examples of such situations.  The best of all, however, are the "philosophical" cases.  As a result, the text has an extremely lively style.  One finds oneself thinking out loud in many cases, even though the author is careful to include the most important philosophical terms and ideas.  This approach is so useful for both students and teachers

Each chapter is more informative than the previous chapter, and is written very clearly and effectively.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has great insight into the workings of the mind.  It is an excellent overview of what we know about the brain's function.  I have a lot of experience working with people with brain injuries, and I can attest that this book is an invaluable tool for helping people understand why their brains function the way they do.   I like this book because it is organized as a series of puzzles, with a few main challenges for each puzzle.  The book begins with a review of some basic concepts that may not be fully understood by the lay person, and then goes into more depth on a few of the most important.  Although each problem is addressed using the concepts I discuss in this book, each puzzle is somewhat different, so it is a fun book to use and is well organized for use in my own work.  This is the most comprehensive resource that I've seen for learning about the neuroanatomy of the brain.  While many other books do an adequate job covering this material, this is the best that I have seen.  You can get all the information from this book without spending any money.  Many of the problems are simple, but some are quite difficult.  Each problem is divided into 2 or 3 parts, and each part has 2-3 problems with 2 or more variations in the solution.  If you have any experience working on a brain injury or a problem that is related to your brain, you'll have a head start with these puzzles

Write a positive review about a good book:   Great fun to read about the real life of a crazy cat woman in a small Texas town.  I read this book when I was living in the South, and have recommended it to anyone wanting to learn about a real town or culture.  The title refers to the name of the town, but the book has much more to do with the town itself than the townspeople.  It's about the history of a town, as well as its people, the food and the people who live in the town.In this novel, the town is named "Buckeye", not because it's just the town in the novel, but because its inhabitants are obsessed with the word "Buck", which in turn is associated with the name Buck Rogers.  There's also a scene with a "BUCK-NOBLE" poster that is a common sight in town. The novel is divided into two sections, beginning in 1907 and continuing to 1939.  In the 1910s, Buck Rogers' daughter is a girl living in a foster home.    This book also gives an account of the death of Buck Rogers in 1933, and the aftermath of the Great Depression, the war of the 1930's and the Great War.  Buck Rogers was a character created by Jules Verne and is one of the best examples of the pulp fiction writer.  This novel is not a romance.  He also created the character Buck Rogers/Captain Marvel.  When a new edition of this novel was published in 1930, Jules Victor Verne's daughter gave the author a copy of a book called "Bucksaw" which Buck Rogers wrote in 1884 about a cowboy named Buck Rogers and his dog "Buddy".  The author was so impressed with Buck Rogers, he decided to write him.  At the beginning of the novel Buck Rogers learns the alphabet, and becomes the hero of the story.  By the end of the book, Captain Marvel and Buck Rogers are living in Bucky's world of Buck-N-Buck in Texas.Bucky and Buck are traveling in a train car on a train.  One of the passengers, a man named "Eddie", is a former gangster and gang leader.  After Buck Rogers leaves his farm, he is given his own small shack on the outskirts of town.Buck Rogers tells Buck his story, and tells that story back to his old friend Eddie.  Bucky tells the story to Eddie

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  As a pre-teen I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, and was advised that this would end up costing me a lot of time and money.  I was not very surprised at the negative reviews this book received.  Many people with Type I Diabetes had a difficult time learning about Type 1 diabetes in school, because they did not see it as a normal disease, and did not know much about it.  The authors show how Type 1 could happen at any age, and how to make diabetes a normal part of the child's life.  This book is great for anyone that has a child with Type II Diabetes, or anyone with Type III Diabetes.  Type I is the more common type, but sometimes a child can also have Type II.The book covers the various medical, and medical history of Diabetes, as well as how diabetes can affect children.  For example, in the first chapter, it is explained that there is a type of diabetes called Pregnant or Postpartum Diabetes, which results in severe complications for the mother and child.  After explaining the type of Diabetes the author goes into detail about the treatment of diabetes in a child. After this the book becomes interesting.  It starts with how Type I and Type II are not as much alike as people would think, and goes on to discuss the differences between Type I, Type II, and Type III. It also includes how Type II and Type I differ in the diet, the medical testing a child gets, and more information about how to deal with a child who has a disease. I was amazed at how many other diabetic children I knew, but I felt that it would be very helpful for me to know about it and understand.  In the second half of the book the authors go into more details about diabetes, including how to manage the diabetes at home.  Then the authors cover everything that happens when a child has Type I or Type II diabetes, and show how this affects them.  They go into detail on medications, how they use food and the environment in order to manage their diabetes.  There are some good pictures throughout the book.One of the best parts about the book for me was that it gave me a little better insight into what it feels like to have a diabetes in my own body.  Having diabetes I was taught to look for ways to deal, but there is no easy way to control it. This book will help you understand what it is
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The New Politics of American History" offers a more systematic, historically oriented treatment of the changes in the American polity from the colonial period through the post-Civil War period.  Its chapters cover the period as a whole, but each chapter focuses on a key change in the state in which it examines.  These changes reflect the changing relationships between federal and state powers in the 20th century.  Although the book focuses on the state of the union in the postbellum period, the emphasis is on the 19th century as the dominant "period" in American history.   The focus on the development of a new state system reflects the changing dynamics of power among the states and the emergence of a national economy.  This book is of great historical and critical value

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just got to meet my nephew and his family for the first time in 6 months and they are just as fascinating as my family. We live in an age of extraordinary technology and extraordinary changes in the way our planet works, but humans still have the ability to be truly beautiful in their everyday lives. I am a huge fan of Michael Crichton and love his "The Forever War". I also read "Jaws" and "The Godfather". "War" is the one for the children because it has a lot of great stories. It's the best of all the science fiction novels and is the best book I have ever read with my own children. I love the "Saga", "Dragon", "Fables", "The Graveyard Book" and most of Crichtons novels, all of which have wonderful pictures. I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to read more of his books for my daughter as well.

In addition, there are some essays on why certain areas of life and situations are more or less likely to produce positive effects.  If you are looking for an "old fashioned" look at life, this book is great 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is GREAT!!!  I learned a lot of different strategies to win the big game.  I used to be very bad at the big games, I have to say this book changed my outlook on the big issues.  Some of my favorite strategies are listed here:  I use a game theory approach that has been proven to work in real-world situations.  This approach allows me to understand the factors that determine outcome, which leads to a better understanding of the game. This approach is based on the idea that each player in the game plays the same game, and the outcome of the games they play are different based on a number of factors that they cannot control.  Players use different strategies because they are not in control of all factors.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My daughter and I got excited about this book. The illustrations are amazing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been using this book regularly with my 6th grader for the last month.  It provides excellent suggestions for activities that your child can learn about.  My 4th graders in particular like reading it as a class book.  Our teacher recently recommended using the book as part of the curriculum for the upcoming year.  Her 5th grade students have enjoyed it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm teaching this book at a second grade reading level and have found it helpful in my own research into this subject.  It gives excellent information and examples, and the structure of this book is simple and clear.    The text is divided into 8 chapters and each chapter begins with a list of questions and then proceeds to a quiz.  The book is clearly written, and each section contains a list or table of exercises which students can practice to improve their reading.  Although the book is intended to be a guide, students will also need to practice their reading skills in their everyday lives as well.  However, the questions and exercises allow students to develop a basic understanding of how different types of reading problems occur in daily life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read this book, I started to really understand why my family has been in this terrible situation for so long.  I was amazed that my grandpa spent so much time, energy and money to build this house.  Then he spent the rest of his life trying to get the credit card companies to pay him back and the mortgage companies.  My mom, however, was a strong woman, she did everything right.  She went to school.  Now, she had no problem working, and when it was time to take care of her family she took on the house with no help.  For me, this book gave me a much better understanding of how this house could have been used to help the family.  The author does an amazing job describing all the steps the family went through to build a house for themselves.  Each chapter has a nice little story on the subject to give more background on the building process.  It makes you feel like you're actually part of the family building the house. The story starts with a realtor who tries to sell the house to my grandfather.  He doesn't even want to get started.  In the next chapter, my grandma gets an assignment from my granddad that she can't pass up.  His credit card company is having a huge problem paying back the mortgage.  Her credit card number is used for all of the payments.  One chapter has my grandmom explaining how they built the house and what was wrong with it.  And finally, in chapter seven, my grandmother goes on a trip to Hawaii and starts looking for a house of her own.  Before she left, she bought a large boat and a new boat.  This book helped me understand why I spent so long in this house, and how I could have avoided such a terrible situation.  As a bonus, the book is funny.  Some of the humor comes from the author's style.  When reading this book my family and I were laughing our a**es off.  What a great book!   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was amazing! I would definitely reccomend it if you're in the mood for some funny stories.

Write a positive review about a good book:   First I've read all of his books in succession, including "How to Live with Your Body" and "Body Ecology".  I have a lot of positive comments about each.  He's the only one who is really out there giving practical answers, based on his observations and his studies.  If you're just starting out, you'll be a lot better off reading the books in order.  You'll find some common themes in each, such as overtraining, muscle gain, fat gain, and the best way to manage and diet.  His books cover all of these topics.  The books are available in bookstores and on Amazon.  In addition, he's been teaching a lot about this topic on his online webcast for over 15 years.  So if you want to learn the most recent findings, this is the best place to get started 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic. I was introduced to the term "fascination" in school, which my first-grader class, all boys, used in class discussions. When I was in high school, I realized that this term applied to a whole range of phenomena. My own curiosity was what I'd refer to as "stupid", which led me to research the history of science as a whole. The topic of science education has a long history in the United States, from Thomas Jefferson's ideas, which were popularized during the 19th century, to the formation of the American Institute of Physics in the 1940s. In the 1980s, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to include science instruction as part of the public schools, and this has been a priority for the National Science Education Standards since the 1960s. The standards were revised in 2000 and reflect the current standards for mathematics. While this work focuses on the history and development of science and mathematics in the US, it is much broader than that. The book presents a history of the development of U. S. history courses as well as science instruction in US history classes, and provides a good overview of the history in high schools.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think I read all of these in one sitting.  Each book offers a different twist on the same themes.  Some books delve into the subject in depth (Lionel Brown's Lion in New York) while others offer only brief, superficial analyses.  As you read all these books, you should keep in mind that they are all very popular and well-received books.  They are all written by men, about men, who had very limited experience in their lives, and therefore their views and opinions on the subject are likely colored by their experiences and their own experiences.  But in general, these authors were all influenced by their own personal tragedies (they all had their share of both personal tragedies and personal success) and as a result they wrote books that are very good for understanding life.  This is what I hope to do with this blog.  Please read these books (they have all been in print) and learn about the basics of the business world, the stock market, and the stock exchange.  After reading these books and other books by authors with the same or similar experience, you may find that you have a new insight into this fascinating subject.  The real business world is nothing like the world depicted in those books and yet, in some way, you will learn to deal with the people involved and the problems they present.

My dancing teacher had some great suggestions for exercises in addition to the book and the DVD.  Her book contains a good amount of dancing video for the novice and advanced dancers.  It can be used by dancers looking to improve their skills. I have used the material she taught me on a number of occasions for my beginner and intermediate dancers.I would recommend this book to students and dancers looking for exercises, drills, or specific directions for basic moves

As I studied the work of Michael & Jean Koster, I learned a lot about the relationship between people and the earth.  I have always been fascinated with this type of study and I love how the authors were able to connect the past to the present.  The earth and people of the past were influenced by the earth and environment.  As the earth has become more vulnerable, so too have we been.  Many people believe that earth is going to become uninhabitable in the next 200 years.  Some are concerned about their own health and well being.  What are the key issues in understanding the issues with Earth?  The answers are not to be found in the Bible.  In addition, Michael & J&Koster did a great job connecting the study of plants, animals, minerals, and humans with the studies of earth sciences.  We should begin to look for answers through the study and understanding of the earth!  I truly believe that Earth Science and Earth Systems will be the primary areas of research and practice of the next twenty years.It is a shame that this is the type of work that the NAMBLA leadership chooses to promote.  This is the only organization in the country that offers a science based alternative to their fundamentalist, cultic, and patriarchal world view 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a MUST READ for all dog lovers! I have seen many dog lovers in their homes around the country.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I wanted to understand more about what was going on in the 1960's. The book has a lot of information about what I was doing, and what I learned from it.  I learned that I wasn't always correct, but there were many points when I was right, and when I made some of the best observations I have ever seen. I also learned that what I didn't know, I was forced to learn. I hope people like this book. I think there is much more to be learned from reading books about this time period than just how things were.  What we don't know may be a big part of the reason we continue to be in the same situation now, with much of what we see in the media.  The book was very informative. I did find one error in it, but it was just an honest mistake on my part.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a truly outstanding work of historical research on this ancient culture, which I read with great pleasure.  The book is organized chronologically and is organized in four parts, the first two covering the early period (from about 1200 B.C. to 1200 A.D.) and the last two cover the end of the civilization and the development of its distinctive architectural features.  Each section includes an appendix.  It is well written and well organized and provides an excellent description of the architectural style of a city-state which has come to be known as the Ur III city-states.  Much of the research is original and original research.    A useful supplement to any school-level history curriculum 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a regular reader, this is an excellent book.  It is short and practical.  I love the pictures.  Some of them are new and unique to this collection of stories.   There are also new characters (and new situations) with their own problems and problems of their parents.  The stories have a "feel" and "flow" that is perfect for children.  You will not be disappointed with this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers most of the common medical problems, but it is written in a way that is easy to understand for those that are new to the field.  It is full of new medical discoveries and strategies that are effective and cost effective in the clinic

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a fan of Stephen Hawking when I was in junior high.  I went to his high school reunion.  We talked about his new book (which he co-authored with Dr. Alan Guth) and a lot of things we talked about in the book didn't surprise me much.  For example, Hawking explains the Universe with great precision and his theories are very useful, even for scientists in the 21st century.  And while his views are based on "fundamental" laws of physics, his scientific method is not dogmatic.  He does not believe in God (or an afterlife), but he does have a lot to say about the existence of the Universe 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very readable and entertaining guide to the anatomy of all living organisms and all its relationships with one another.  There is so much good information about the body in general and the functions of each organ in particular.  This book also has good photos of each individual organ with explanations of their function.  It covers the entire range of the body with a good understanding of the anatomy.  The book is very practical, concise, and easily understood.  If you are interested in having a basic anatomical knowledge, this is a great book for that 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a lot of useful tips for starting a business.  Some of the tips are pretty obvious, but some are more helpful than others.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.  Her writing style is unique and easy to follow.  She uses humor to entertain and explains scientific concepts in a very simple way.  This book is excellent for both children and adults 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Walking Dead" series has been a cultural phenomenon. The art direction, and the storytelling, are absolutely top-notch, and Stephen King, one of the best American writers, brings a wealth of story and character to the pages of this novel. The book also introduces us to three new characters who are intriguing and likeable.  I will be purchasing this title when it is released next month. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for anyone that is interested in being an active and productive member of their community.

All of the pictures will be helpful for the grade level.  I did not learn anything new from this book, but I did use the information to make better decisions when choosing my childrens' activities.  This would be a wonderful book for children who are in third grade or below 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to read this book after watching the movie, and it really gave me a fresh view on life.  It's a very good book to have on a first date if you are looking for a good one to learn something about yourself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A book that describes an amazing thing - human evolution - is still new to a number of scientists.  It is the only textbook to cover human evolution.  I have used this book with many high school and college biology teachers 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my second trip through the book. I read this book during my time in the United States Military.  It is a very good book for anyone who has any questions or doubts about the military and how to better handle your life when deployed.  The military has its own culture and its own rules.  I have a cousin who served for 14 years in the army, and I know how he copes with the lifestyle he has been placed in and the emotions that he must constantly deal with.  These are the questions I would have had after reading this book.  Even my brother, who is a Navy SEAL, struggles with some of these issues 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book.  I learned a lot about how to grow as a human being, my first grader, and as a parent of three.   I thought this book was excellent and very insightful.  She gives step by step instructions and strategies for how to raise your child as an individual who will be successful in life.  As a parent this book really helped me out and gave me a lot of ideas on how to help my little girl grow up 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a long time fan, I was surprised that she didn't do a similar book for men.  I've read plenty of books with male characters, but I thought she did a nice job of introducing and exploring the female character.  While the male characters are great, I really liked that Ms. Hines went in depth on the male psyche and the female psyche and how that relates to each other.  Even with the women, I felt that her book was a nice refresher course on male psychology.  In the female characters, she brought in a female psychiatrist, a female neurosurgeon, a professor, and other female characters who are not at all common people who just happen to be in the public eye.  Ms.Hines also has plenty of female characters that were not always happy with their roles in life and are just trying to stay alive.  Her characters aren't always all sunshine and rainbows, and sometimes even men.I found Ms. Jones' research to be interesting and her writing style to be compelling and easy to follow 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent introduction to the subject.  I highly recommend reading this book first before you attempt anything with C&E 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an important book for anyone who uses "the word" for the first time in a conversation.  If you are an ESL student or language learner, it will change your way of looking at words, and how you use them.  It will help you communicate in the real world as well as the one you may envision 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent resource!  I am currently looking for a book that I can use to teach other people.  My family is not very interested in history and I don't have the book with me in the house at the moment.  However, I look forward to looking for one on my shelf.  This book has a lot of pictures in it and even more great tips and ideas 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn more about this important religious and philosophical debate.  I would suggest this book for any high school or college class.  It provides information on the basic history and key players in the debate.The book is very informative, and a great read for young people as well as adults 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a book!! I have read and heard this story before but I had never seen the movie version.  And, it was wonderful to see so many people of my family, especially my mom and my sister, so happy to see the movie.  This was the one that I wanted to teach my children.  I thought this story was great for the ages and my children loved it.  My kids loved it so much, I would have never thought they needed to learn about it, much less watch it. I just wanted them to understand that people can be good and bad and the world has different views about some of them.  People will judge you and make a bad judgment about people and that is okay.  You just have to figure out why and if you want to do right, you have to try to love people.  That is my whole message and message to my kids.  It is a message I have tried to pass on to them.I am always a little afraid when my kids tell me that they have read this story.   But, I am always happy when they tell me it's their favorite book.  If we all can learn to love and forgive, the world will be a better place 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very interesting look at the origins of America, and the development of the U.S. into the most powerful economic and military power in the world.  Mr. Brunkley provides a very clear, concise and well-sourced look at this topic, but he also explores other aspects of our country such as the relationship between religion and politics.  He also gives excellent information on the history of the founding fathers, as well as the founding myths surrounding our founding.  Finally, he gives excellent descriptions of the development and evolution of the Constitution.  I would definitely recommend this book to both people who are interested in the history, or the mythology behind the Constitution and its development.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is outstanding in the way that it shows the progression of evolution from bacteria to humans.  There is so much in this book that is still new to the average person.  The way evolution has progressed in this country is absolutely amazing.  Our military scientists are actually looking at bacteria today (and probably do not even know this) as if they were the present day, with some serious insight.  I am looking forward to reading some of the rest of the books in this series.  They are great ways to look at evolution in the future 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been married for 19 years, and I have never experienced more love in my life!

It was a great book to share with my kids, and it is a great gift for any child in your family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very nice collection of interesting and enlightening books about a wide range of subjects.  One of the best books I have read so far.

Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent reference book for first time and experienced anglophones.  I am a recent graduate from a baccalaureate program in English.

In addition, the book offers a helpful lexicon, a glossary, and glossary lists of common words, and a glossaries of more common terms in other languages 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is written in the first person by a woman who has experienced rape and sexual assault.   Although this book is about a person's life, it is about many other things - not just rape.  The story is told from the perspective of the narrator, and is told in the third person for the reader's comfort

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a true depiction of a brutal time that has changed our society to a much darker place. It takes place during the 1960's and is written from a true war hero's perspective.  He was never able to fully accept the tragedy of what he suffered and the damage done to his family during WW II.  For the most part he refused to accept the truth and the horrors he had witnessed.  This book is a powerful testimony of the pain, suffering, and loss of innocence that he experienced.  The author tells the story of this incredible war hero who did not give in to the evil that was in his heart until he realized the only way to stop this madness was to do what no other man in the war had ever done-he joined up with the Army Air Force.  His courage is inspiring and his strength of will is astounding.    The book is based on a true story, but it is not just about that person, nor about the war.  It also offers a deeper look into the psychology of the men in the Korean War as well as a great deal of insight into the human condition and the mind of a leader.I read the book for my senior honors thesis and it was a great teaching tool 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the definitive guidebook for the new breed of birders

Write a positive review about a good book:    Excellent book! It has given me hope for a brighter tomorrow. I am now reading the bible in my home for pleasure. I was surprised by the beauty of the bible as it was written by God. I think I had read it before but was looking for something new and different.This book was written before the modern world and before modern technology. This book has given all people and all societies an opportunity to be their best. The bible was written in the 6th century BC. It was an amazing time and I hope that its message can still be of help to the world today

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best biography ever written of one of the most mysterious and dangerous men in history. It does an amazing job of telling us the truth about a man who created a modern-day version of the ancient Roman empire and ended up dying under mysterious circumstances.  He was a brilliant and charismatic military commander who had the best interest of his soldiers at heart, but one who had his own agenda and was willing to do anything to preserve his power. He will be most remembered by history for his policies of conquest, which destroyed much of the diversity of his empire. His political agenda was to unite Europe under the most powerful empire the world had ever seen. The reader never really learns the full extent of the Roman conspiracy, only the most important bits and pieces.  The first part of the book provides the background and explains what we know about the conspirators and their plans and actions.  We then learn what the conspirator may have thought and done, from his love for women to his hatred of Christianity, which led him to believe his empire was God's kingdom.  In addition, a chapter describes what we now know about Roman attitudes toward religious and ethnic minorities, as well as his relationship with the Jews, and an interesting chapter is dedicated to the Jewish conspirators 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has helped me through the toughest situations and has allowed me to gain the skills I need to make a good life for myself. I have learned how to negotiate the most complex of projects.  I have gained the confidence and experience to start a business, a new job or another business.  It has also helped me learn how to handle some of my clients.  For example, I used to try and negotiate my fees to my new clients. I now have the confidence to negotiate my own fees as I am working my way through the course. This book also helps me learn to be more in control of my own financial resources

Write a positive review about a good book:   Great work, excellent addition to your craft, and this one is great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great for anyone who's ever felt like an outsider or not accepted in a good group of people.  Although this book deals with issues of gender and sexuality, the authors do not fall into the "sissy vs. masculine" camp.  While the "feminine" and "masculine" terms are used loosely throughout the book, the author goes to great lengths to describe the differences between these two gender roles.    The gender roles listed are not mutually exclusive.  As a side note, this book is absolutely fabulous!  The writing is beautifully done and the information is easy to understand.  There is a good chapter on what "sissies" and how they fit into everyday life (and sometimes even into marriage) and a good overview of the "masculated" and feminine roles in society.  I was so pleased with the style and structure of the book that I decided to buy the paperback edition.  If you are interested in reading more books on this topic, I'd recommend a good starting point is the chapter on Gender Stereotypes in Children by A.S. Beland 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to this book while on my honeymoon in Italy.  I have since read the entire book in Italian (and have read the other books).  In Italy, it was a great help in figuring out how to behave in an Italian society

Write a positive review about a good book:    In his new book, Robert B. Tucker takes a new approach to our understanding of God, religion and morality.  Instead of making specific claims about how to improve society, he offers a whole new approach by which to approach all this.  His first volume, The Case for Faith: The Case against Belief, first appeared in the 1990s.  Now he takes a fresh look at what he calls "The Case for the Real."  "The case for the real" is a way of thinking and looking at the universe.  It offers a new, positive outlook that leads to a new and healthier way of life.  Tucker is a highly respected author of fiction and non-fiction, and he is also a Professor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University.  He was the editor of a well-known periodical called "The Virginian."  The Case in Brief consists of the stories of six friends, each with his own reason for believing in God.  The first three volumes of The Case, as well as the other works in the case series, have been published in more than 30 languages, and have sold nearly 100 million copies in 31 languages worldwide 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a teacher of History, I enjoyed this book!  It is great for first graders.

I also used it as a teaching aid during class.  A great addition to any classroom 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book, in my opinion.  A good read, to get to know and understand the culture and politics of North Korea!  This book is written in simple, easy to understand, language that is friendly and inviting.  It also provides excellent, practical, information about how to navigate this complex situation.  My favorite part of this book is the photos of the Kim family.  Although Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are dead and gone, the children of the current Kim dynasty are being raised and trained in the image of Kim Il Un.  North Korea is a military dictatorship under the law, and a police state under the command of Kim Jong Un.The book offers tips and information about survival, first aid, and emergency preparedness for North Koreans.  I would highly recomend this book to anyone who has a passion for the North Korean culture

But it's about more than just an intro to the business

Write a positive review about a good book:    First person by a first person perspective and then a more general treatment of the human condition in the world.

I've been looking for a book on this topic

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful, clear and useful guide to basic financial terms.  This book is also an excellent resource for further study into finance terms. The author provides an introduction to basic stock and bond terms, as well as a thorough review of financial theory as it applies to the business world.  The book is divided into two parts: Part 1 focuses on stocks and bond issues, and discusses the importance of basic terms like dividend, price to earnings ratio, price-to-book, price/book ratio and price/cash ratio. Part 2 covers various other terms in the business/financial world 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would have given this book 5 stars if I had had it as a little book instead of a full book. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I feel it needs more depth in some sections to really get the story, but the basic idea of this story is amazing.  You will love this book, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it

Great addition to any baseball fan 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've ever read on personal development.  The "Big Picture" method is so much better than the "Cluster Method", which has a very poor track record.  While Big Picture is a great method for personal development, it's a lot easier to use than Cluster, and this book is a gem.  I found the Big Picture method helpful in understanding my wife's chronic health problems as well as her anger issues.  We've used the Big Box Method and it worked very well for me and I had a good guide for each phase of my work.  As a professional, it has helped me improve my business skills, relationships and personal relationships.  Even if you use Big Picture for personal and personal development you need to be prepared for the Big Question (for example, "How does my spouse feel about my job?") 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent!  I'm a novice, but I was very impressed with this book!

There's plenty of tips on scales, scales for songs and chord progressions, tablature, tab, charts and tablature.  I have not found a single beginner's book quite like this one 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As an engineer I used to build a radio station for my grandmother in my home town in South Africa.  While living in the United States I visited my sister in South Australia and the author has done a great job of capturing the beauty, history, culture and history of my home state.  From there he goes on to discuss the great diversity of American towns and rural life and the problems that they face with the changing face of society and economy.  These are a few of the cities and towns I have visited.  The book also discusses how various cities and areas, from Baltimore to Detroit to Raleigh, N.C. have adapted to the new energy economy, from gas boom towns to renewable energy cities.  But these changes have not come without challenges, as the author writes about the struggles of those left behind by the current economic times.  And he has also written some great insights about building and maintaining community.  It's a great look into the everyday struggles that rural Americans are experiencing in a tough economic environment.  I love how this book is written in a way that makes the reader feel as though he/she is traveling with me as I spend time in some of my favorite places 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an excellent book to begin with.  In this time of crisis for humanity, our species, we learn how to do more with less.  What a blessing to be alive to witness this.  We are fortunate to be human, not because we are a race, but because we have such a rich history, and knowledge of what is possible.  It is important to remember that there are no shortcuts to knowledge.  The best way to learn is to observe.  Let us learn from each other 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like the author's approach to this particular topic.  He has written a number of previous articles about his daughter.   He discusses her eating disorders and her treatment with the psychiatric services and his opinion about how they are treating these patients.  I liked his approach in this particular book.  It is a helpful guide for anyone who is seeking information about eating disorders, family, and treatment.  There are also several other books on this subject that I have purchased and read as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like "The Great Gatsby" then this is the perfect companion to "Gatsby".  For my money this is one of the best introductions to the book written by a modern author.  I found myself not only agreeing with the author but understanding more about the "Gentleman".  From his time in China as a young man, the author became a successful and successful "Gentry" and made his fortune 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a classic. The first half gives examples, and the second half offers solutions.  I was interested in the examples, but I learned a lot about problem solving from this book, and I find the solutions to be very helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had no idea of all this stuff until I took these classes as a child. This is a comprehensive introduction to all aspects of life from a very young age. The book explains the basics of evolution to some of the most difficult aspects of our own lives.  If you want to learn more about evolution, this is a great book!   Also useful is the Appendix on the Common Mindset.  This gives a basic overview of the Common Sense Philosophy.   It also contains a bibliography of textbooks that cover the basic concepts of this philosophy.  I was surprised at how well this philosophy works on a young child.  It is clear and concise but still provides a basis for understanding life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent, well written story. The only problem is that a lot of the details are a little repetitive, but that was intentional. This story has some good action, and some very well drawn characters. I especially liked the action of the ship scene where the young girl has a chance encounter with an old man with a mysterious cargo of gold and learns that this man could be the captain of her ship. That scene in particular has been a favorite in my mind and I really like the fact that the book has a happy ending, the character is finally able to leave the ship. The book is a good one to start a new story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the most comprehensive book on the subject. The authors cover everything from basic anatomy to the differences between species. This is the textbook that I use for my class. The first chapter provides a good introduction and gives a brief description of the different types of vertebrae.  I purchased this book a while ago and am very pleased with the thorough coverage

I have been working for over 35 years, and have learned many new tricks.  The tips can help you in a variety of projects from simple joinery to very complicated.  You will find a comprehensive guide to all aspects of the trade from woodworking books, but you will find more information in this book.  All information is categorized by task, from wood framing to staining and repairs.  It includes woodworking tips, tools, and information on all aspects.This book is great for both the beginning or intermediate woodworker

This book explains the concept of negative reviews in a very concise way. I used the chapter on negative reviews to explain what this book offers that negative reviews do not 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had high hopes for this one.  This book has been on my book shelf for months and I love it.  It has helped me immensely and I wish it were longer.  But what it lacks in length it makes up for in depth coverage.  Most of the time there are photos accompanying the text which is very helpful and helps to visualize the scenes.  The photos help with the structure of the text.  I have read the book twice and have enjoyed reading about 70-90 pages of the book per day.   This is a great book for ages 10-18 
Write a positive review about a good book:   First,  you learn the basic structure of the Roman system and how the Empire went from being a regional power to a global power. I'm a big fan of some of the less well known details, like the fact that Rome adopted Christianity and didn't convert the Roman population. If you're new to the subject, you'll learn a lot about Roman history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at my husband's recommendation and have been thoroughly enjoying the fun stories.  My husband is very into science and has been for over 40 years.  He loves reading and has now taught this book to our 9 and 10 year old.  We find that the stories of our grandchildren are most amusing and are often of interest to our adult grandchildren.  I highly recommend this book and my husband would love to read some of the other titles in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As the title states, this is a very good book for a beginner.  I really enjoyed it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a teen in the late 80's and early 90's. I loved this book.I agree with everything you said about my youth. I was very sheltered, but was still very active. My high school was very religious. The most wonderful time of my life was when my dad moved us to a small town near a Baptist church.I loved being an active child and was very well adjusted. It wasn't until I was about 14 that I started to question all of this, and began exploring the Bible. The truth about Jesus is there for everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's an amazing book - it's written with wit, intelligence, and humor.  It has everything: history, culture, economics, science, and a touch of humor - and an answer to your prayers!  I'd reccomend it highly 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great read and has helped me a great deal. I now know more about this woman, her husband, and her son. I also know why she married Bill. She didn't want to be "just one more woman." She wanted a husband with whom he would be able to do his own thinking and work. Bill and Hillary had such different personalities. They had to deal with the same problems but found themselves to be different solutions 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very informative.  I have been buying it for my husband and children to read with me.  They love it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an incredible and inspiring read.  Her stories have always been extremely good but this book gives a lot more in the way of depth and detail.  She explains much more about the various phases of the moon and the earth from the ancient time.  I also found it interesting how people can be so surprised about all the miracles that God has performed.  If you're looking for a way to help people through prayer, this is a great book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is outstanding 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have bought this book as a gift for my nephew.  If you are not a student, you will really enjoy this book.  He was in 7th grade.  I also bought it for my grandmother to share with my wife and kids when I was visiting.  This book was great!  I've bought it over and over for all my family.  It's wonderful to read about what is going on with your family and friends and the culture, and even more important, the language.  You will see some of the ways in which you can help your family.One of the great things about this book, besides its excellent book title, is that it gives practical tips and ideas on how to speak to your family in their own dialect 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great because it teaches how to build a successful business and how to grow a customer base.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my favorite book to date.  It's a quick read, but packs a lot of ideas.  Great fun for ages 9 to 12 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The original source for this book is the New Testament of the Catholic Church and has been adapted from the  Catholic Church's own translation and other sources.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it's great that this author took the time to get to know real families. I can't wait to read more of her novels. The recipes are great and there is a very positive message in each of the family recipes. I'm looking forward to reading her next book, "The Garden." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have not read this book, then you have no idea of what is happening to the American population. This book is an incredible, amazing, and invaluable reference.  It contains a complete, concise, and comprehensive history of our country from Colonial times to the present. The first two chapters of this book will get you started, and the rest of the book will explain the major changes that have taken place in the nation's demographics and political culture over the past century. The book covers the various historical developments that led to this dramatic shift in our demographic balance of power, and explains how it has led to the disastrous consequences we have witnessed in the past few decades 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a new student of the game and enjoy the latest edition.  I also teach in this book, and I enjoyed it.  The game has always been fascinating and fun to learn about.  While this book does discuss how to learn the game, it also delves into many of the different forms of the rules.  It is interesting to see how the rules of the original game were developed and some of the ideas and techniques that were used to develop the rules 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great read. I have a hard time believing that anyone would not be amazed at the number of children born with disabilities in this nation, especially in low-income areas.  We have children born without arms or legs, without eyes, without ears or lungs.  These children are in desperate need of special help.  Their parents and pediatricians are not helping.  The lack of social services is an important contributing factor.  This book gives hope and gives practical steps to help children with disabilities.  I wish I had read this book as a child 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you haven't read a book like this before, you will gain new insight into the way you deal with life and relationships.  If, on the other hand, you are thinking about problems, you may be more successful.  My favorite part of the book is the fact that this is the story of two men who, while sharing a certain chemistry, developed their relationship in quite a different way.  Both grew up in poverty.  Mr. and Mrs. Jones had very different interests and habits, but the Joneses are similar in that they were always struggling to develop relationships and friendships.  This book is a wonderful guide for people who want to build successful relationships and who are going through a tough time.  I enjoyed the book greatly and learned a lot about how to make friendships work.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have never had an abortion, I recommend this book as you might need an abortion yourself and need some help.  It may not be necessary for everyone, but some people with abortions may need additional help. Many of the tips and techniques in this book will help you to have an abortion.  A friend of mine had an early abortion which is a good starting point.  Other people with abortion may not find it easy, but you'll get help from this book to help you through your abortion. I would strongly recommend this as a first book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that really made a difference to me.  This was one of the first of her books to focus on my experience as a white child.  She used the example of a black friend in the eighth grade.  We became friends and she talked to my parents about what it was like to grow up in the South.  My parents said it made them realize the prejudices in their mind.  They didn't have to face them directly.  It showed that my mother had her fair share of prejudices and she also had a big role in my early years.  I also learned that I wasn't the only child to have had a problem growing up in this part of the country.   It was a great book.  The examples given of my mother were really good.  Everything I went through in school really had a negative impact on me. I have really gone from hating myself to realizing that I can't change my family and being aware of my race.  Thanks, Mom and Dad!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a copy of this book in my hands the first day I decided to write my dissertation on this topic and I have kept it all these years. This is one of the best books I have ever read on this subject

Write a positive review about a good book:   I will be the first to agree with all of the positive reviews:  This is a great read and very enjoyable to read. The stories are quite long, but I found them very entertaining.  I enjoyed them all, but my favorite story was "A Good Book" by George Bernard Shaw.  If you like George Bernard Shaws' works, you will like this one 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is no single "tried" and there are so many examples of ways the two worlds came to be - the old world with its hierarchical structure and rigidly defined roles; the new world in which the people of the West are trying to change the way they operate with each other and with their environment.  The new world of globalization (globalization  is also called "change").  The story of globalization from the West's perspective, though, is not only about the Western world, but also about the other parts of the world.  From the start, the "new world" is not an "American story."  There are "new" people in the developing world. From the West, the people who are trying and often failing to change have the same kinds of problems  that America has 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the most comprehensive reference on the subject and covers all the major issues of the day. I found the book to be of great value as a refresher course for students. I recommend it to both high school and college students, and of course to parents 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a fascinating book. The first few chapters are very easy to understand and follow. However, the book is not meant to be an all-inclusive guide to the Bible. It covers many of the major themes of the Bible and is organized in such a way that it is easy to comprehend. I did not find it boring at all. Many of the chapters were very informative and I found them very entertaining 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a history major, but the ideas in this book are timeless.  I teach in a very liberal, international high school (the students all get involved in political and cultural matters) and I really like the way they all work together.  It's not necessary to know much about the past (unless you're an expert in history, and even then, it's not imperative), but you can certainly understand the present and look to the future.  This is the book that I used to give to my first class.  In many ways, it reminds me of what I was taught in my elementary school science class and also of my own thinking back then.  The students at our school would always love to write to the teacher and to each other!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best one that I have read on the subject so far.  It is informative and helpful and has a lot of information on how to do the exercises.  I would also like to know more about this topic.  This will be my first book, so I really enjoy reading about this subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best books I've read this year. This is the best resource you will ever have.  I'm a graduate student in my program's history and philosophy of science classes.  This is an excellent guide for students and professors of the history of science to do their own reading.  The book is very organized and very informative.  A must have for anyone in the field 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I learned so much about the Bible from this book. I thought it was excellent.  I loved the historical background and the different versions of the Bible. The pictures are beautiful and very educational. I learned that many people in different countries think their version of the bible is the ONLY one. That is why it is so hard for some to read the Bible and make the connection between its different stories and teachings 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best work of fiction I have ever read.   I read this book and immediately fell in love with it!  The prose is smooth, the plot is captivating and the characters are soooooo lovable.  If you are a fan of Disney, I suggest this as an introduction to the series 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great for first graders who are new to school and want to learn about new school practices.  This is a great book to give to parents or teachers to give a parent's handbook to a child who is new to reading.  My son's class just loved this book!  He got some extra practice with the new vocabulary in the book.  It has lots of pictures 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book for my daughter and grandchild. We loved it.  It has taught us more about how the world works. It has also taught me a few things I would never have thought of by myself. I'm looking forward to doing more writing in this genre as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a sophomore in college, working for a publishing house (as is common for students at this age).  I couldn't believe what I was reading, but I kept reading it all the way through.  It wasn't until a few years later that I discovered that the author had attended and graduated from a Catholic school and was very close to the parish priest in his home town.  He kept coming back to the parishes in his youth with his brother, and now he writes books with his father

Write a positive review about a good book:   The text is a great resource for learning about the evolution of life on Earth, in the form of a story and a set of examples.  Some of the examples are simple to the point of being amusing, while others are more complex.  This text is of great use for an Introduction to Biology course in high school, and is very accessible to all.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful, inspiring, and easy-to-read book!

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely wonderful and very helpful.  I have a question about the two examples which I found to be the most helpful. The first one is the book on the Cenozoic.  The second example is a book on "The Physics of Cosmology" by Peter Atkins.  If you have a serious interest in the theory of the universe this is a great book.   He explains some of the main ideas of the theory and also explains how they apply to our solar system.  He also explains the relationship between these and other scientific theories.  His examples are also very informative.  What makes this book very helpful is that he uses examples to illustrate the various ideas and explanations so that you get an idea of how the underlying ideas are developed 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent book! I'm a teacher, not a historian.  But I've spent my life as a fan of history books, and I find these books very helpful in my teaching.  They help students to understand how history is made.  I think my students would be surprised at how much they missed the real history in the twentieth century.  One of the best things about reading history books is they give us an overview of the past and help us understand where the present and the future are.  This book will give you the names and facts, but it's the information contained in the "History of a Modern School" that really interests me.  The "History" of the twentieth-century school has been very different from what you see on television and in movies.  Many of the books I review today are written for children, and this is true of many history books in the  twentieth century 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book describes the creation of a number of ancient Greek coinage types from a variety of sources including ancient coins. The book also gives information on ancient Greek coins of later periods.  The author also discusses the evolution of the coinage type as a whole, and discusses the different issues with the types.  It is a very comprehensive, useful, well-organized and well-illustrated study that should be of interest to anyone interested in ancient Greek issues and coinage.  If you are interested in finding Greek coins, this is the book to buy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent work with pictures!  I just want to see and read all of these images.  I wish this book had come out 20 years ago.  This is the way to go through life, I have been told.  As you know, many times, we look for a person's weaknesses or flaws, but the beauty of God's creation is its beauty and beauty only because of His perfect design.  All that is there to show us is that this image of God cannot be hidden in our hearts.  It is not easy to learn this.  But if we try to learn through the Word, we will become more self aware and realize the beauty in the Word.  There is a way to see the beauty and simplicity of God in our lives.  God gives us the grace to see Him, and He is waiting for us to see His face.  He shows Himself in the Holy Scriptures and He offers us hope by revealing Himself in our daily lives through the Holy Spirit. I have learned from this book, and have come to realize many things about my life that I have had not seen, which have helped me to see better what God wants for me. I am beginning to realize what the Bible teaches me and I have a greater appreciation for the beauty within.  Many of the points that have been made by this author are quite interesting and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an opportunity to receive this knowledge 
Write a positive review about a good book:   An excellent resource for learning about the history of the Armenian Genocide and Armenian-Aryan relations, this book is an excellent overview of the history, politics, culture and politics of the Armenians and Aryan peoples in general.  This book is not for people who are new to the topic.  The author makes the topic simple to understand with numerous examples and charts.  If you are looking for a comprehensive overview of a historical subject, then this is the book for you

This book is great for anyone who wants to increase their personal financial security.  I have taken this book on several trips and have enjoyed it immensely 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is written from a medical point of view, but it is very good, and informative.  It is a collection of stories about people, their illnesses, their treatments and their successes.  The author uses the words "disease" and "treatments" in a specific order, from the most common to the most uncommon.  Each of these stories is accompanied by beautiful drawings of the same disease, disease process and results 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author offers a useful perspective on the social fabric of our world.  She provides an overview of social movements over the past two decades with a focus on movements in the United States.  While her analysis of movements is not overly detailed, she also provides an examination of the history of social-movement organizing in the U.S.  A primary concern of this book is to help us understand social movements.  We know that many movements have been organized around economic problems, race, immigration, and sexism, to name a few.  However, the focus of most movements is often at least partly rooted in other issues 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn about how to use Excel in Microsoft Office. I have been learning this format since 1997 and now use it everyday and love it. It is easy to follow along with the exercises as you learn the basics of Excel and I was amazed at how fast I got through them! If you are looking for a quick Excel review I would recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great.  I really enjoyed reading the "Moral Imagination" first, and I just could not put it down.  It has all the tools needed to understand what is going on right now in today's world, including the "moral imagination".  I enjoyed reading "The Mantle of the Great One" as well, but I did not get as bogged down as this book in my "moral" thinking.  But I thought this book was very insightful and interesting in that regard as well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives a clear, concise overview of the various factors that have contributed to the recent increase in the percentage of people with diabetes in the US.  The overall approach used in this book is a common one in medical journals and books but this one gives the reader a practical, concrete overview of what people with T1D need to do in order to control their condition.  While this book deals with the individual factors that contribute to the rising prevalence of T1Ds, there are chapters on various aspects of care and treatment for T1DM.  This is an excellent book for doctors and other health care professionals looking to increase their ability to identify and respond to the various components of the T1DD/T2DM syndrome 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very informative book to have for any child that is currently learning to read. This is one of the first books I've seen that does the alphabet.  This book does an excellent job of providing a general overview of reading and learning to reading.  While many of the basic concepts are common knowledge, the concepts presented in this book are presented in a concise manner that is easy to understand.  I enjoyed this book a great deal.  The book was excellent and easy to read for a child with dyslexia.  Overall, this is a great book for all ages.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorite science fiction books ever!  The first few pages are incredible and the story is interesting.  I have seen this book read by other authors, as well, and they all have a good plotline, great characters, and interesting science.  The plot line is different in each of the novels, and one book might take place in space, the next in a future Earth where human life has gone extinct, the third in a time ship, and the next a colony in a distant galaxy.  They all have their "flavor" of the future.  As a science fiction fan, I would say this is the best of all the current sci-fi movies 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read about love in the bible.  I recommend this book very highly for Christians looking to understand this love.  It will help you get to know God better.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for those that do not have children and are looking to adopt a child.  It also covers all aspects of adoption from pre-adoption counseling through post-adoptive experiences.  This book is written from the adoption experience and offers helpful tips for adoption counselors and adoptive parents.  I was very pleased with the information I received from my adoptive family and it made adopting a lot easier 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great help in preparing for my first class. I bought this book to look at the images that appeared in the book and to practice my drawing. I think the book would make a good text book for anyone who wants to learn to draw. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, but I also like the other two, especially The Great Depression, in a different way 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a good story. I have enjoyed so many of Michael Connelly's short stories and this one is just brilliant. I loved how the author portrayed the life of William Henry Joad. He shows William Henry and his friends at times having great times, yet at times being so desperate for food, that it's clear that they had to commit to crime and commit violence in order to survive. It's such a tragedy that William Henry is in the way of William Joad's plans for the future. This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time, and I love Connelly. It is truly a great read. It also provides a wonderful look at what happened to the poor, hungry, and beaten William Henry. His character has become more human over the years as he has seen his friends and family go through the same struggles, and what his wife and mother have gone through. The main character of this story, and the main character for my reading group, is William Henry, Jr.The best thing about this story is that you don't need to have read Michael Connolly's other books in order for this one to be useful to you. The characters are well developed, and even though some of the dialogue is difficult, it is very entertaining. In my mind, Connelly is writing this story to show readers about how difficult life was for the Joad family. Many of us have experienced similar circumstances as William Henry in our own families, and it's nice to see Connelly capture that emotion in this story. It was a bit difficult for me to get through this story without crying at least twice. It really was an amazing story, as well as a sad one. But it was wonderful and informative.If you like short stories, you'll like this one. I bought this book when I was studying for an English degree and loved it! I recommend this story for anyone interested in the Jafo family and the crime that led them to this position in society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read, and my book of the same title, written by Dr. Andrew Cohen, was the most popular of the two.  Although Cohen has done extensive research on the relationship between intelligence and religious belief and practice, he does not discuss religious beliefs and practices in isolation from other human endeavors.  Cohen discusses religion as a part of a "whole" culture and society.  His book is an excellent resource for students, but also as a general overview of "intellectual history of ideas".  A very interesting read that provides a good overview of the current scientific debates about religion.  An interesting book, especially for students

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very useful primer on a number of techniques and how to best use them. I have been using this book over the past two years and find myself developing a number new techniques of my own.  The authors also have very good information on other useful subjects such as audio audio and audio audio production.I purchased this book on my trip to Thailand.  It was very helpful on my audio production course at the Audio Audio Audio Academy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great! I read it last year and found it really helpful when I was trying to work my way through the SAT's. I loved reading the details and diagrams from the book, but I did find it to be a good "cheat sheet" for those struggling with the test! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As usual the book begins with an intriguing question. Why do we have religious experiences? And what about those who have not had such experiences. How can we tell the difference between experience and imagination in religious consciousness? This book is an excellent guide for all those interested in religious experience, but particularly for those who wish to study such experiences and their causes, especially with reference to the study of religion.  The book contains many useful examples of religious experience and explores many different religious traditions and religions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent refresher in basic principles of Quantum Mechanics and its applications.  I have used these concepts in my own Quantum Theory and have been able to describe a number of well known phenomena that I know from my undergraduate physics studies.  In my next chapter I will cover some of the problems in Quantum Mechanics from the viewpoint of Quantum Probability.  It has given me new insights into the way that many of the phenomena occur and how we can use the equations of Quantum Physics to describe them.I have used Quantum Mechanics as a tool to describe the behaviour of atoms, subatomic particles, and particles and systems at the macroscopic level.  The application of Quantum Theory to the behavior of the macro world is described in terms of the concept of Quantum State and the various kinds of states that can be found in the quantum state space 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you enjoy fiction and you are a sports fan, this is a must-have novel.   A sports lover's dream.  This was written when I was in my pre-teen years.  I'm amazed I still have so much fun reading sports and reading fiction.  Both are very entertaining.  The writing is easy to follow and it was just the kind of book I wished I had read as a teen-aged sports fan.  It is a wonderful novel that takes you on an exhilarating ride from sports to love. I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good book to help you understand how to do business with your clients. The book is divided into chapters and the examples are used in a number of ways by using the client to explain the business, the client's problems, the role of the consultant, and how to perform basic and advanced consulting services. There is also some use of common sense techniques such as using a business card to help explain concepts to a client. It covers the entire gamut from basic skills to advanced skills and explains how to provide a service to clients of all types. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an interesting look into the world of high fashion and couture.  I think this is where the real story begins.  The author does a good job of covering the business of the industry and the culture as well.  While not entirely original, the author has an excellent grasp on the history of the women who make the clothes.  Although this is a great starting point for anyone interested in the business, it also provides insight into the marketing side of the business.  As with all books in this series, this one is a must read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first of a series of historical fiction. In the beginning, the characters are fictional.  However, in the story itself, a certain historical veracity is introduced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in 8th grade.  It has helped me tremendously with my studies and also with my attitude in class.    It is not all "blah blah blah blah".  I am very impressed with it.  I also enjoyed the illustrated chapter on "The Secret", as it relates to the  concept of "good".  If you can  get through this chapter, then you  have completed all of the steps  necessary to understand  Goodness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "When I saw the photos, my mind went back to an old photograph I had when I was very young, of my grandmother and my great-aunt. The story unfolds with the same grace and style as the photos--my grandmother used to take pictures when she was young and she has a great story to tell.  It is truly beautiful and it has given me a wonderful insight into family life in the Caribbean at the turn of the century."

If I could give it 5 stars, I would

Write a positive review about a good book:    There is nothing more satisfying than to read about a real life person. It is the complete and most comprehensive resource on the subject. It provides detailed information on the entire medical history of each patient. For instance, most are known to the author prior to autopsy. All have their own stories. I was amazed to learn how many other people there are with cancer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book gives a brief history of the Roman Empire.  It does a good job of describing how Roman soldiers were recruited, equipped, trained, and deployed.  A brief history is needed for people to understand the Roman military machine.    I was a military history major.  I liked the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book when I was just beginning to read it.  I found the pictures in this book to be beautiful.  They give a wonderful picture of what an  everyday life is like 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very clear-cut and concise guide to developing a solid web development toolset from scratch.  The book contains the essential tools, tips, and tricks for building simple, lightweight applications using the latest C/C++ technologies in a fast, easy-to-use environment.  Each of the chapters includes code samples illustrating how to accomplish a basic task.  This book is a great complement to any other C/S or C/Java development text, but it also has some more advanced topics that focus on web development.  Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone looking to learn web development

Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't believe that people still don't understand how the Holocaust could happen in Europe and in the Jewish community. The reader will also learn about the Jews in Russia, Germany, Hungary, Poland and other countries.  If you like history and this book is great, buy other books by Prof. Moser and her co-author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used to have a large crush on this book. The art book, however, does have it's own charms. The drawings of the book are original.  I love the colors and the vibrant colors.  It's a delight to read this book, but I did find the story a bit hard to understand.  While I understand the romance of these characters, the plot line of the story was a bit too convoluted and confusing.  The characters seemed to be changing from one scene to another, and I found myself wanting to read it, rather than watching the movie.  However, it's a great story and I suggest you check it out.  This is a book I highly recommend.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It gives great insight into this little known art form.  It really is amazing what an effect it has on people.  I found it very inspirational, and made a point to look at some of my own work 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best of the many great novels in the "Book of Mormon" series, it's true to life in the land of the Book of Mormon.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very thorough, well written resource for teaching "new math".  I've given this book to several math students and it is a hit with them.  They are so excited about the subject!  The book also has an index, and it explains the basics of many topics in "new Math".  The index is well organized and easy to read.  It is an excellent resource for all math majors, as it has a nice "general" section for everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book I was completely shocked. It is an amazing book and I learned so much about my husband's illness, which I never knew.I thought that this was very helpful for my husband, because he has the same illnesses that I have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fabulous book! The whole series is superbly written and beautifully illustrated. The characters are well developed and lively.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not a parent, so I'll skip some of the parts that will concern you. I am, however, a parent and have read several parenting books.

I am a graphic designer by trade, and am constantly in need of new skills and equipment, but in the world I live in, I do not have any. This book will be a lifesaver for anyone starting a new design business. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as an adult.  I used it as a source of knowledge.  In addition to the book's historical information and information on the current financial crisis, I have used it to learn something about my family history.  The author has made it very easy to read the letters written by my grandmother when she was young and as she grew older, the letters became increasingly more personal, even romantic.  She often used language that the younger generation will not understand.  While this book may be over 200 pages long, I read through it all in one sitting.  It was very easy for me to read.  Although I had seen these letters several times before, I had never seen the letters as they are shown in the movie version.  This is the book for adults that love to read about family history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this is a fantastic book! Its full of practical tips and practical exercises. it is written in a clear, easy to follow style. it has lots of pictures in the book, and a lot of information to use in your day to day activities.  i bought this book for my senior year of highschool, and i bought it again for my daughter, who is 9. her school has many students that need to start taking some self defense. it helped her a lot in the beginning of her learning process and is still a helpful resource for today. the first chapter of this book was a little confusing to me, but i picked up the basics very quickly. i have a few tips that i use with my students, and some great exercises to implement my tips. i highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a long time coming.  I've read a lot of fiction and a little non-fiction, and I was still looking for something that would allow me to share my feelings about a relationship with a boy who seems to have his life in the balance, who doesn't love me at all, but who will always be there.  This is the book that allowed me to finally do it.  It was like a gift from the universe to me and I'm so glad I got it. This book is beautifully written, very humorous and touching.  The stories are great but the illustrations are just as good.  There are some really beautiful drawings in the book and there is a very good lesson to be learned by taking care of a baby who is at the beginning of the road to parenthood.  So, it is for this reason and others that I wish this book was my first, the third, or tenth attempt at writing a story about parenthood 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that I use as a primary text on the college level. It is excellent, even for a first or second year student.  It provides you with plenty of information about different types of computer programming.  But the book does go into more depth about various programming languages and how they differ from each other.  The book has a very good index and many helpful appendices for further reading.I received this book as a gift, and I used it in my own programming classes in high school and college.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is my "old friend" and I am happy that I found it and had a great time reading it.  There are so many wonderful recipes to look forward to.  The book also has beautiful pictures and beautiful photos of a family of all ages.  It has really helped me with my son and the recipes are fun and easy to make.  This was such a great book and I would be happy to add more to it. I have read all the other recipes in my family book and loved them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book when it was listed in my library and I was delighted with its good layout, the great writing style and the fact that it is divided into a number of chapters (rather than simply one) that each present a very different angle on the same topic.  In this edition there are only two chapters dedicated to the topic of love in any religious context; the other six offer views on other matters of sexual ethics.  Overall this is an engaging and thought-provoking book for those who seek a broader perspective on the topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like historical fiction that features good characterizations and a plot to make you cry.  This is a MUST read 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am an English teacher in an urban middle school. I was thrilled with this book. It has some excellent illustrations.  I was able to learn some useful tricks about using color with color pencils and markers.  Most of all I enjoyed learning about how to create visual stories.  And I love the fact that this book offers an excellent example of how a picture book was actually used in the 1800's.  This book also offers suggestions about coloring with markers. In fact, the book is so well organized that I have been able to use the books from the beginning of my studies in the first grade.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best biographies I have ever read of Marilyn Monroe.  From her early years in New York to her early struggles with her parents, her friends, her job, her health, and her personal life.  I have never read anything so complete and so personal as this, and I have read everything about her that has been written so far, as I did not know the full story until now.  If you are a fan of her, this is a must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers every aspect of the art industry, from marketing and advertising to the mechanics of running a studio.  The author also explains what happens to successful artists when their art becomes very popular, which is more like a public art gallery than a personal one.  After a period of creative decline, some artists are able to move past their personal problems and make a comeback.  This is a great book to begin with the reader in a very advanced technical skill set 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book.  I use this book as an introduction to the basics of how to build and repair a house.  The book also includes a full-page color illustration that is used throughout the text.  As this book is a reference book, this is a great way to keep yourself up to date with all things house building.  If you would like a basic beginner's guide to house-building, this book should help you gain a basic understanding of the house-making process.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   An excellent reference book that I have been using at work for many years.  My co-workers and graduate students are excited to learn about some of the basic ideas used in a range of industries, with special attention to management and information technologies.  Each chapter contains a summary of information on a particular topic which is followed by a review of the current state of the art in the relevant field.  This book was especially useful for our web site development class in 2007.  It is also very useful for a graduate level course in Information Systems Management

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book over all of the others I have read.  It is soooo helpful!  I was in this very same boat for 3 months!! I bought a copy on my way to work one morning and read it cover to cover.  This book has a great structure to it.   It starts with the basics but the exercises go into more detail.  The exercises in this book are the best exercises I have ever used in my own personal workouts.  I find the books that have exercises that have pre-workouts are generally better.  However I have found that there are exercises on page 12 that you can do to prepare for your first day of a new job, your first date, or the next big event in your life.  You get a good workout in while still keeping it short and sweet.  So, get a copy of this book and start learning some good basic exercises.  Then, start your next adventure!!   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The text in general gives a good overview of the key concepts of linear algebra with some examples. However, I feel it is worth mentioning the following points: 1) I used the term'matrix multiplication' for the first time, and so did most of the text, and I have to say this is the right term. The concept is central to the mathematics of all branches of mathematics, and it is a major theme in the history of mathematics 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great and has great pictures.  It was a life changing event for me and it is a must read.  The book is full of pictures and stories and the pictures are wonderful.   The stories in this book are great too.  I found this book to be a good way to pass the time before going back to school.  If you are planning to go back to college, this book would help you with some information about the class you are taking.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a fascinating insight into the psychology of child development and how parents can influence their child.  The writing style is engaging and entertaining.   This is the book for anyone involved in parenting to read.  My child is 7 years old now and is a very happy and healthy child. He is a joy to play with and he likes to read and is well-behaved.  He reads all the time.  We use all the tips in the book and my wife and I use some of them on our own children as well.My son has some reading comprehension skills and he reads a lot.  When he is in bed we use a different approach to reading and we start with the baby book and move on to the books with the picture book section.  It's the best approach to learning and is great for anyone who wants to teach reading to their child 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a native of New England, and for the most part I never learned much about my parents' heritage.  I know where their roots lie, and I see why they are so proud to be here.  It is a great book, a must-read for all Americans.  But what it is best about is that I had a great grandmother who taught me about her Irish roots, and she also taught me that if you want to be an American, the roots are all in your head.  And I do mean all in you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am trying to keep up with a number of books by my 5th grade class today.  I was really looking forward to reading this book because this was my first introduction to the topic.  Since my friend and I are both in 3rd grade I wanted to give this book a try, but my friend had already read it.  The book is very helpful in explaining how the science works and how it compares with the theory of relativity

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book covers a lot of important topics: human biology, the evolution of brain function, and social evolution.  This is the definitive work on all the issues I have been trying to understand the last 20 years of my life.  As I read the book I realized that I was looking for an answer on the evolutionary front when I first started grad school.  The concepts covered were not abstract ideas or mathematical models, but real, verifiable, testable, and simple biology.  I am not a scientist, but I felt that I could understand the topic better if I knew the background material. This book is organized so that new concepts are introduced slowly as you go along, and are then explored by comparing biological and social life from the simplest organisms to the most complex.  One of the best things I found in this book is that it uses the scientific method, the same scientific method that all scientists use and that allows a student to "explain" the facts I already know. I learned a lot more about evolution in about 20 years than in 20 years on my own.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was very informative, but also very funny.  She also has a way with words, and I loved this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recommend this book for children from about 2 years to 12.  It is very well done and has lots of fun illustrations.  Some of the stories are quite scary, but also entertaining.   It will also teach you about some of the basic concepts and letters of the alphabet.  I have used the book to teach the letter S and the number 4.  As the author says, "It was a pleasure to create and present a book that has been loved and enjoyed for many generations 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased this book last year. I've always been amazed at how people are so bad at explaining what they don't know.

Write a positive review about a good book:   this is one of my favorites.  It covers everything you need to know about designing websites from the basics to advanced topics.

Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent book.  There are so many good recipes, I found most of them from my grandmother's books (my mother-in-law makes them).  They have always been a pleasure to make for my grandchildren, and they are always a big hit.  The recipes for both the original and the New York versions are wonderful and easy to follow.  My grandmother's French recipes are fabulous.  I have to admit I make a few tweaks to the ingredients to make them more current.  This is a book I would recommend to everyone

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a high school teacher and teacher training advisor.  This book has been great!  My 8th grader has the most basic science knowledge and is eager to learn more about the physical world!  I've taught physics to other 8th grade students and I see the improvement in each year that I have taught physics.  Now the students have basic knowledge and some skills to apply to the physical, physical sciences.  I like the book because it provides an introduction to the sciences for young high school students.  The text contains some challenging questions to ask and includes links to the website of the National Physical Education Standards.  It was a great resource to help my students with their homework.  What a great book to start with!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book I've read on the topic of love and dating in China. It is not about the love-hate relationship we have in China, but about the positive qualities of Chinese culture.  In fact, I was very surprised how much of the book focused on the positive aspects of Chinese people.  I found the book to be a wonderful introduction to the subject.  Although, I still need to get to know more about Chinese culture in general.  This book does a fantastic job of providing a good overview on dating and love in China 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a beautiful tribute to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World.  The artwork, by Alan Lee and Joe Staton, was stunning and the story flowed smoothly through the chapters.  I really enjoyed the adventure, the adventure of the two kids and their wizarding world.  This was a good story to share with my son and it did give some interesting insight into the wizarding society.  While the story was fun, I found myself wondering what would happen to Harry and Ron and their friends if they left their magical world behind.  Maybe their lives would be as normal as other kids and maybe their friends would be a little more adventurous.  Of course, Rowling uses magic and the mystical to her advantage in the story and gives us some of the most beautiful images that have ever graced the pages of a book.  In addition, this is a great introduction for new readers of the series to the concept of magic and why the wizards use it.  As we learned in her earlier story, Harry and Hermione were not the only children to be raised by magic, many magical children were born.  Harry is one such example, but he is the main character of the story.  We learn of his childhood, his relationships with his magical friends and family, and his own magic.  It is nice to see the wizard community and the way they live.  Much of it was familiar to me, but I was impressed with how Rowling added a new twist to many things in the original stories.  She also gives us a wonderful insight into magical creatures

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best of Ms. O'Connor's books, she has done a great job of describing her life and career, and also giving a history of how the book covers all of these things.   I especially like the section where she describes the impact of reading and writing in the military.  I also really like this section where Ms. Hester has a little section on poetry, and a little bit about the writing process.  This part of the book was fantastic, she got a lot of history and a lot about the military right in her hands, and she has given so much personal information about how she writes about her books.  Her writing is very personal, but it is not her personal life, or her own personal experience.  Rather, Ms. Macdonald has written about many of her battles and many of the people she knows.  When she goes into the personal details of her life, she does not attempt to portray the characters like the characters in the stories in her novels, or the stories she reads.  In this part of her book, she writes of her writing as if she is speaking for her audience.  So the characters and her point of view are her own.  There are parts of the story that are very moving and moving in the beginning and very funny at times, but the middle part is really very touching, and very moving.  She has a great sense of humor, and although the book is very funny, the humor comes from a real place.  Ms. MacDonald has been a long time friend of Ms Hester's, and Ms. Kline and Ms O'Donnell and Ms Macdonald and Ms Hetrick are all her friends and her friends of friends, so she can talk to them about life

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book that covers both the biological and emotional aspects of human sexuality. It will be a favorite of many of my students in this topic-specific  and human sexuality course 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best part of this book for me is the "inside story."  In this version, there is some good stuff about baseball that I would never see in movies, but the book was an enjoyable read for me.  If you're looking for information about the game of baseball, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first of her novels, and she does an excellent job of portraying her characters.  The story revolves around four friends, three women and two men who live in the rural Canadian town of Kipurnia.  Each member of the group has a personal relationship with a young woman who lives elsewhere.  One of the women's son was killed by a stray bullet.  Another member has a boy who was molested by a male babysitter.  Her brother committed suicide.  And one of the men's best friend, Tom, is an alcoholic and a drug addict.  At first, each of these characters seem like caricatures.  But as the book progresses, the characters become more human and relatable 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is amazing, but not to just learn about making a great book: this book is also really useful for all levels of artists.  A simple to follow step by step guide to creating beautiful books.  This guide is easy to follow and the quality of the work is superb.  Each section has an explanation and some tips.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must have book for the average Christian, who is not "christian" but "is christian".  It offers a great overview of many issues, including a good discussion on "Theology" and "The Spirit".  This book is also helpful for those who are trying to learn about the faith 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "As I walked along the streets, I found it hard not to think of my own life as I walked. My parents were both murdered as children. My mother was killed at age 14. My father died at age 37. These deaths shattered my parents' dreams and my childhood."  This story focuses on a man who is also suffering from a debilitating disease, but is trying his best to hold on to his wife, who he feels needs his support. His wife, although very sick, manages to stay strong. This story is a heart-breaking story of love, loss and redemption.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking for ways to "reform" the traditional Mormon doctrine of baptism as an event rather than as a sign of membership in the Church.  This book is full of interesting and helpful examples.  One of my favorite parts was a little history lesson on baptism.  For instance, it explains why the first-born were expected to "wash away" the sins of their parents.  Or why only male children were baptized until very recently.  Another example of a bad practice is the fact that when a male infant dies, a brother is allowed to be baptized, but not a sister.  I found that part very interesting.  The authors point out the many differences between the Mormon Church and the others and give reasonable, practical suggestions for the way that the Mormon church can be reformed.  Most of the ideas are new or have not been developed in the past.  They cover things like baptism, mission trips, missionary work, ordination, etc.   This is a "must-have" book for Mormons 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read some other reviews that are similar and found this book to be a great addition to my current class 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, however, is not just a work of autobiography, it's an investigation into two distinct but equally important topics: 1) The nature and origin of the United States and the impact of European immigration on American life, and 2) The relationship between Europe and the United Nations.In order to adequately discuss the latter, I've included some biographical sketches of important personalities in history, as well as a good bit of text about the history of the UN. In addition, there are a number of appendices, making it a much more useful work for a wide range of students 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book as a gift for my son and he enjoyed reading it! It contains many of the skills and concepts I have learned over the years in my classes. This book is a great addition to my curriculum.  It is not only entertaining, but useful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read all this book in one sitting and found it to be absolutely great.  The pictures were beautifully rendered and the text is short and straightforward.  My only complaint is that I find the subject of the book quite daunting and difficult to grasp.  This is definitely the most popular book of its kind on this subject of  anatomy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been such a great help in my spiritual journey and in finding the right answer to my own questions!  This is such a wonderful resource for understanding why I have been "caught up in the whirling currents of love".  If you are struggling with a difficult relationship, or are suffering a loss of faith or a loss in faith, this book offers wonderful tools for understanding the root of all the problems 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book and I'm learning a lot.  It has a lot to do with understanding how we are influenced by our environment and also how we create our environment.  I recommend this book to everyone, but especially parents, teachers, and children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have seen some great books, but these are my favorite!  The best thing about each of these authors is their ability to draw you into their worlds.  You feel like you're visiting their world.  They make you feel as if you are there, experiencing their emotions and feelings.  Sometimes this creates problems because the characters can be rather unrealistic.  But when you have experienced this, you will be able to write your own emotions.  I can't wait for you to try these 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is great.  I've read several reviews about it but I couldn't wait to get to the book and read it.  This book has a very positive review rate and I was a new reader.  As a teacher, I found myself thinking about how my students could approach the subject differently.  The authors present the material in a very easy to understand, very engaging, and helpful manner.  My students loved this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good guidebook to finding a good cookbook to use as a starting point. I have a copy and I am reading it daily.  I've been cooking for my husband (who has a PhD in molecular biology) for the past 7 months and he has been pleased

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that was recommended to me by my college English professor and I immediately began reading.  I enjoyed the book immensely and was able to complete a very well written college level exam in just 6 weeks.  The chapter that introduces "What's Wrong With Education" is one of the most important in the book.  It is so informative and practical that I was able write a long essay on the topic in just 2 weeks.The best part of the book is the list of "Common Core Concepts" which includes many examples and links to further information on each of the concepts.  All in all, the Common Core is very easy to follow and is in many cases very easy math to learn.  But, it does require the student to be involved in a learning environment where many of the "common sense" rules are replaced with much more complex rules and/or where the rules are constantly being modified.  A good book on this topic is "Common Sense Math: The Common Core State Standards for Elementary and Secondary Reading & Writing" by David Anderson 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read in this genre in a long time. It's like watching a great film (and it really is a film), but without the usual melodrama and cliched plot. I really enjoyed this novel, and I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series. I had a lot of fun reading this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is written in a simple, friendly, understandable style.  I have had a child who has learned all the concepts from this book.  When she was younger, she also did a great job of learning more about her mother and grandmother.  This is an excellent book for children between the ages of 4 and 8 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book, my mom and I were reading it together and we kept asking one another questions that I could not answer at the time but it just made sense from a very young age.It is a story of a very ordinary boy named Arthur who likes to play sports with his friends, loves his family and his dog, and wants very much to be like his father. Unfortunately he did not grow up like his dad but he has to deal with the fact that his dad has been sick since the day he was born and this has affected him greatly.When I was about 10 or 11 years old, my father developed Alzhiemers.  It was very hard for us all but fortunately there was a loving nurse named Meryl who did a wonderful job of helping him through this difficult time in his life.It was also very good for me when I was 13 years old to understand that I, too, needed to be strong for my father, and that it was OK to cry when my dad cried.  For some reason when I read about Arthur I understood his pain and my dad and Meryl did too. The book also taught me the value of family, friendship, and faith.When you read about a child being sick, you will learn more about how to love one another than you ever dreamed possible. Arthur has a special gift and I feel that he has it with the other children in the book as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book that has helped so many people, from children to adults.  It is very practical in providing useful ideas to help you with your projects.  I have used some of these ideas myself, and have used them as an example in my class 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in the series, but I will be reviewing later in the books in which the story is set.  It is a great read and a great introduction to the series.  This book was recommended to me by several of my students (some of whom are my students).  It was an extremely fun read - lots of action - but there was also a great deal of historical information.  I particularly liked the details on the war, the politics and the culture of 1776.  You may want to look up the historical reference book for this series, which has many historical entries.  One of my favorite things about this book is the look on many faces of the main characters.  They all are flawed - and you can see them growing in their relationship and becoming a couple as the series progresses.  Most of the characters, including the King and Queen of England, are still in their twenties in 1776 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have written about 5 of these books and I plan to write at least 5 more before I retire in the spring.  These are great for those who are starting their own business and are considering starting an LLC 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most detailed, comprehensive, and thorough account of the evolution of language to date.  This book provides a unified explanation for how the evolution process works and how the modern languages emerged.  I recommend this book to everyone from an undergraduate linguistics student to a graduate student in linguistics.   It is a superb resource for those who wish to learn more about this topic.  It provides useful information and many illustrations.  For example, the evolution and development of syntax is covered in the chapter on "The Structure of Syllables" and the chapter titled "Syllabology" in the second edition.  "Syntax" provides an interesting look at the evolution in detail.  The text goes on to cover a variety of topics in the evolution.  Some of the chapters on "Syntactic Systems" and "Symbol-Phrasing Systems" deal with the evolution, evolution of phonology and phonetic systems.  Other chapters have information on the evolution from the simplest "basic" phonological units (the phoneme and syllable) to complex units with many phonemes, the emergence of vowel sounds, the origin of consonantal systems, and the development of the different forms of vowel in different languages. The text on "Linguistics" deals with a number of important topics such as the structure of a language, phonological systems, phonetic system evolution, phonemic perception, and communication.  Also included in the text are several appendices that provide details about the evolution related to language and grammar in a wide variety of different languages, including the evolution within a language such as English.  Overall, the book is a great resource that anyone with an interest in linguistic topics can use 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well researched and written text.  The examples provided will inspire the student to think.  I wish more textbooks covered this material 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a great introduction to the science of sound and audio engineering as well as the basic sound equipment used today.  As with most audio texts, it is divided into eight chapters which provide information on audio audio design, audio audio audio engineering and audio audio Audio Audio Engineering.  Audio Audio has a large and growing impact in our daily lives and can provide audio solutions that improve audio audio devices and audio Audio Engineering Audio Audio Design.

I always use the recipe from the book and it is usually the first thing I try 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book as a gift for my nephew.  I really like the idea that this story and its characters have lived through great hardship.  The author's stories are not for children; however, I liked the characterizations and the general themes in this book.  They are a bit dated, but I still liked the story and the characters.  My nephew was very engaged in the book, and loved the characters' personalities.  He was excited about the story's ending and the ending of some of the other characters.If you are a parent, a friend, a sibling, or just someone you know well-all ages have faced great hardship in their lives, you can read this book and learn from this book's lessons 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in 3rd grade and I had it on the curriculum. I wanted to learn and this book has made me a better student. It teaches us about how to read and write and how to think and talk. I still remember when I first read this I had a great teacher that I liked. He got our class started and I still miss him today.  I'm glad I got to know this book and I'm proud of this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The concept of the 'Lolita Complex' originated in the mid 20th century and is the result of an ongoing cultural, political, and social crisis in the United States. The novel is, in many ways, a history of the U.S. and, at its heart, is about the love life of an American girl. For this reason, it's also a love story. But there's also an historical element in the story: the rise of the "Hollywood Studio System," the relationship between film producer, director, screenwriter and actress. It is not a love-story novel, but the author clearly identifies with the role of film and film history. This is one of the most important novels written by a young American writer of this period. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first book about the subject of the relationship of a dog and its owner to each other.  The title describes a typical scenario - and is a good description of this type of situation.  In the following chapters, I introduce the dog to its owner, as a normal human companion.  This section of the book has several chapters that contain many more photos and illustrations than the "normal" book.  Each chapter presents a case of a happy and healthy dog who has a wonderful relationship with its owner.  One can only hope that this book will help readers of all ages and dogs.  There are, in fact, many dogs that are happy and normal dogs who are being abused in the same manner as the above mentioned dog.  Hopefully the book will assist pet-abuse victims to be more understanding and to stop the abusive behaviors.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used to live on the edge of civilization. My friend gave me this book, and I loved it. It gave me some ideas and ideas on how I am better.I had to read this book for my husband to buy a copy for me. He used to be really jealous of my knowledge. He said I read this a lot, but he has never had a teacher's assignment or homework in high school.He said his teacher used to get upset with me, but I have a better memory than he does.My husband and I both work with children. I used this book as a reference when we did our homework.I use this book with my son when he does his homework.My son likes the book and has a good grade. He does not get mad at me about not writing his science homework.It gives a lot of tips on how to prepare for exams, on how not to get yelled at. I just wish I had the time to write a positive negative review about some book: he was very impressed with some of the material, but the story is very long and it is not a step-by-step guide to taking care of your pet, or cooking, or anything like that 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great refresher on all the basics of computer science, especially network programming.  There are some other interesting and helpful books in the field as well, but I can't say enough good things about this one.  I wish it was out of print.  In fact, I've been wanting to read this book since I started this project 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "For all who would be a great deal more than they are, they are here. It is to be enjoyed by all ages.  It contains a treasure of wonderful stories of life, of God's creatures, and of His people.  The stories are funny, often heartbreaking.  But God's plan for them, in which God would be the Creator and Jesus Christ would become the incarnate Son of God, is the same as His plan for every other human being.  Every one of them is a picture book of the gospel, but there are no pictures in it.  Everything is made by God's design and written for us.  This is a book that teaches the way of joy in Jesus Christ.  Joy in Jesus, in all that we need and long for in life, joy in the Lord's service, joy with God, in God's people 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such an outstanding book!  You will never look at your favorite television shows the same again.  It covers EVERYTHING!!

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have read ANYTHING about the ancient world this is THE BOOK TO PURCHASE!!!! The book was very good in giving us a description of the ancient Egyptians as people and as a society.  He writes about the way the Pharaohs dealt with slaves, and the Pharaoh's attitude toward women.  The Pharaohs' attitude toward slaves was very different from how many today see slavery.  In this book you will find the following information about slaves in ancient Egypt:* Ancient Egyptian culture had a definite preference for female slaves.* A slave was allowed to become a wife, but was NOT allowed to hold property.* Female slaves were usually permitted to work.* Egyptian laws forbade slaves to leave their homes.* Slaves were allowed to own property.The Pharaohs treated slaves better than other societies did.  For example, Egyptian slave women owned slaves who were not physically abused or mistreated.* Many slaves were allowed access to education, art, and a variety of other skills.Egyptian slaves were permitted to attend school, and they were given a high-ranking place in society.Slavery was not a very profitable business, and it had its pros and cons.  This book tells us what slaves had to go through to keep their families together.The book also tells us about the slaves who became slave owners (like Pharaoh Tut).  Pharaoh Tut is seen in many ancient Egyptian paintings, paintings that depict him with other male slaves.  According to Herodotus, he had sex with at least one female slave every few days.  These paintings may tell us a little about Tut's wife, who is described as being beautiful and beautiful-seeming.Silly story - but when a man has sex with a woman, he is NOT married.  And even if he had had children, he did not give his wife as his wife, because he preferred the pleasure of the other slaves.The ancient Egyptians knew how to exploit a slave to make him useful to their family.  One of the things that amazed the ancient Greeks and Romans (as well as Egyptians), was that the ancient Egyptian slaves were highly skilled and loyal.  Many slaves became priests, accountants, priests, etc.The slaves had more rights and freedoms than any other Greek or Roman slave.  They could speak their minds.Sons were NOT slaves, however.  Some of the slaves were given sons.  Egyptian males could not own women, but could marry the wives of other men
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. I loved it and will purchase any book that is written by a man of faith and good character. I would have purchased this book several times if it came to the States. He has such a funny way of writing, but he has such beautiful stories and I truly enjoyed his stories 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that I read as a junior. I still consider myself an adult. I find it to be an excellent resource for parents of children, especially children who are at risk for abuse. I wish more books like this were available, because the information provided is essential to the development of your child's self-esteem, your parent's ability to be there for your child, and the understanding of their values. It is a great resource for children, and an excellent book to start with. However, in the case of a child who is suffering abuse, there are several additional points of information that will help you as a parent to be as supportive of your children as possible 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in college. It was the first "expert" book I read in high school. I was obsessed with this book even at 17. This book opened my eyes to the true extent of my father's alcoholism, my mom's drug addiction and my sister's drug use. I am now an active supporter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and the book is an eye opener. My dad is no longer working for the oil company because he was too ashamed to tell his supervisor what was going on in his life. He has been sober for 6 months and still has to face his problems. He was shocked that he had such a positive reaction to the book, as did most of the other members of my family. I can say that I now fully appreciate the depth and enormity of my parents' problems.  My sister had to spend months in rehab because she was using meth and crack cocaine. My father used to spend time in the hospital for alcohol abuse. My sister and my mom had their lives ruined as a result of this drug problem 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a wonderful book, a must read, I loved the illustrations. I also enjoyed the wonderful insight and knowledge about some of the most popular children's books available.  I learned a lot about my own child and what my child was interested in 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was able to absorb this book in a very brief time. I like its story-telling more than the "science" of it.  However, I still found it extremely educational.  In my opinion, this book is one of the best out there.  I really enjoyed it.I agree with most of the reviewers here.   It is a quick read, but it is full of great examples.  It even has pictures!  I think this book has saved me a lot of trouble in making a number of errors in my tests.I recommend this book for both the new and the experienced scientist.  For those that study in college or in their own research.  This book has the benefit of being short and clear.  With it you can avoid the jargon and acronyms,  which are very confusing for the non-expert.I am amazed that this book received such a wide readership.  The reviewers have all praised its clear-minded, straightforward explanations 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a writer, I found this book a really helpful guide to learning English.  This book was great for my 1st year and my 2nd and 3rd year English classes.  I recommend this book to anyone who is just starting a new language course or English class and has no experience in that field.  There are lots of tips and tips for the beginning and intermediate level students.   Many other useful books on this topic are out there, but this is the best resource I have 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book!  I am also a huge fan of the new Star Wars trilogy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of Mr. D'Ormond's writing style. In my opinion, it is the best book on the topic of "The New Church."

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is amazing, and I have read some similar books in the past.  I really like this one a lot.  One of my favorite scenes in the book is the one where Burt Lancaster and Gene Kelly have sex in front of a crowd of tourists on the beach.  This scene really reminded me of some scenes in films like "Sexy Beast".  The beach scene also reminded me that movies and TV shows can portray sex as anything from exciting and fun to extremely graphic, violent, and boring and boring.  In this book, the sex is just as real, just as much fun and exciting, just like movies.  It's just different.  The sex scenes in these books are more graphic and violent than they are in real life, but the action and passion in the movies is just so amazing.  Burt and Gene Lancaster make the sex scenes more exciting by not showing any kissing or physical contact (well, kissing and physical contact).  The scenes are very hot and exciting to read.  As long as Burt has Burt in this book and the camera and Burt are on top of the action, I think this scene really shows why Burt was so popular as a star in movies. The sex is as fun and hot and funny as the action scenes in movies and B&N's "Cinderella".  I wish I had read this book when I was a kid.  They do a great job of portraying what makes Burt a star.  He's a great actor and director.  Plus he is a great writer

Write a positive review about a good book:   It provides an excellent overview of the evolution of the human brain, how it evolved over time.  This book is well organized and the book is very useful for all who have a particular interest in the evolution and function of the brain.  The chapters on the evolution, organization, and function can be combined, with those on human development, and vice versa.  Chapters are well organized for students and readers with basic high school biology or middle school biology, and for those with a general scientific background 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a freshman in college, studying Japanese Culture and Culture-In-Motion and its relation to Modern Japanese.  I find that most people have this understanding of the differences between the two cultures and are not aware of the positive aspects of the Japanese. This book is for people who are interested in the culture, but do not have experience living in Japan.  It is written in a style that is very easy to read.  The subject is easy to understand and easy to grasp.  In addition, it provides many ways to get the basics of a language at an affordable price.  For instance, I have been able to learn my first Japanese phrases for studying and reading in the last two weeks, in just two days.  This book provides good reading material that can be used in Japanese class.  Although the author is fluent in Japanese, he has written this book in English

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating book, written in a very easy-to-understand style.  It covers the development of the human eye, from its first primitive ancestor, through the different types of eyes developed, and the various anatomical variations of the eye that have been identified, from the single-lens species like the cephalopod to the triple-lenses of primates, the eyes of the great apes, and finally to the optical systems of animals in our own environment.  This book is great in getting the reader up to date with what's going on with the eye in the last 40 years

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you've ever wanted to read some good booklets on guitar then this is the one you've been looking for.  Easy to understand and very well illustrated.  Each lesson begins with a basic technique lesson (for example "How to Play Left Hand Guitar" has a series of exercises that use the left hand, "How To Tune a Audio Audio Audio Player" has exercises that are based on the Audio Audio Tuner on Audio Audio Equipment and the Audio Music Manuals (Audio Audio Audio Players) of Audio Audio Systems 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A little about history is a good thing, a little about human beings is an excellent thing. I learned a lot about the history of the people I grew up with, and the lessons I got from them... My experience with history has given me a deep understanding of how my life has been shaped by events which I consider to be the result of our collective unconscious. When I talk to my mother, or grandmother, or father about these things I have to know I am not taking it for granted. These are not things which are just "historical" events. These things are part of the story of how the world was meant to be. This is also my first book, as I mention in the book, in which I address a political theme: the need for a more conscious, proactive attitude regarding the evolution of human society and our collective destiny 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book and the photos and stories are absolutely fantastic.  I read this book for my third grade teacher.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book.  The details and illustrations are detailed and accurate.   The book is organized into 5 sections:  First, the basics of the Hebrew and Aramaic languages, and the names and functions of letters; Second, the grammar and vocabulary of the Old Testament; Third, the Old Testamental texts; Fourth, the Christian writings; and, Fifth, the Pentateuchal texts.  As I read the Hebrew Bible, I learned a great deal about the history of Israel, history of the people of Israel and of the Bible.  I learned about the origin of the Pentaueans and the origin and destruction of the nations.  It was an eye opening book to me 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, and my class are required to use it.  The best way to learn about how to do the basics is through doing them first.  We start out with some basic exercises and gradually work our way up to the advanced exercises.  By the end of this book, you should be able to do basic exercises such as "tuck" and "stretch," advanced exercises such like "pull-up," and you should understand how to apply the principles of leverage and timing to a problem, and how to combine them for "muscle-ups."  You'll learn a lot about the science behind how we develop muscles and how you can use that knowledge to your own training.  If you have any interest in training for sports like soccer, basketball, or golf, you'll need to know the basics of how muscles work and how their position relates to that of the joints in your body.  It's great information to have on your shelf to give to your personal trainer or coach.  There are a number of exercises and questions along the way to help you with your basic work.  I've seen my clients benefit immensely from using this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm always interested to learn more about this topic, and this book is excellent.  In the spirit of J. Michael Bailey, the authors explore the subject of bisexuality and its impact on a variety of psychological, social, and physical problems in this community.  This is an excellent book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book begins with a series of chapters showing how to cook with real ingredients.  It shows the step-by-step process of making a simple, authentic, healthy and delicious meal.  I've made several of these recipes myself, and they are fabulous.  We also get a nice selection of other recipes and recipes of interest.  There are also several other recipes in this book that include ingredients that you may not have at home.  The main recipe in this chapter, for example, is a very simple stew, which is a nice quick dish to have on hand and use.  One of the most fun aspects of this book, in my opinion, is the recipes.  They are usually very easy to make and the photographs are nice and clear.  Most recipes are from the cookbook or from other books that I have been working with 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never read anything by Margaret Wise Brown before, but when I picked up this book I was so glad I did! The first three chapters tell the story of Margaret Wise as she tells it. The rest of the book covers the various ways in which Margaret Wise has had to deal with her life. And in her own words, she has given insight into how she has dealt with her health problems and her own mortality

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a new mother to my youngest daughter, it's nice to have a good reference book on baby steps from the beginning. I love the recipes with a dash of seasonal ingredients. I also like the color photos and informative step-by-step photos. My daughter (who is still very young) can be in the book at the same time as her family at home. It will be fun and exciting!This is a great book for first-time parents (and sometimes even some experienced parents) to share with baby!

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great, a great collection of interesting facts, including, but not limited to:  The number of stars in the sky that can be seen in a night, the total number of planets in our galaxy, the largest stars in our universe, and the ages of the universe's first stars and planets. I've never read anything like this before and am quite enjoying the book. I would say this book will prove interesting reading for anyone interested in the Universe, as it provides a good overview. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used to be a big proponent of the "doctrine of grace". I never thought it was necessary to define it in a comprehensive way in the body of the Bible. It certainly is defined in Paul's letters. The word grace comes from Greek, but the term grace is used throughout the Bible to refer to God's unmerited love (John 3:16; Rom 8:28; Rom 1:16) and our ability to experience the gift of eternal life through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ (Rom 3:23).The chapter on grace begins with what might be considered the most famous passage from the Bible, Matthew 25:45-46: "Now the Son of Man is going to repay everyone for everything."It is true that the passage refers specifically to Christ's obedience and is not a condemnation of sin. Jesus is the One who has the authority to do what He desires. However, the text also speaks of God's gracious plan to bless those who obey the gospel (John 10:10-13; Acts 3:19-21; 1 Peter 1:20-21). In the book of Romans, Paul writes, "For we share in the divine nature, since a mans righteousness is by faith apart from works" (Rom 4:5).Paul speaks of two types of obedience--one is a result of the gospel and the other a result from God's grace. The term grace can be found in Romans 6:11-24 as the source for justification through faith (John 1:12). Paul uses the term in Romans 4:11, 12 and 16 (1 Corinthians 4:7-11, 1 Timothy 2:5; 2 Peter 2:8; 1 John 3:8). The grace of God gives us the ability to obey and love (Rom 8:29), and this will result in salvation (1 John 2:2-3).I learned that the concept of grace is found throughout the Old and New Testaments. However many passages use the term "grace" without specifically defining it. The author takes a step back to give us a comprehensive definition that all of us can use. He gives his own definition of grace in the book. God's power is the source of our ability and the cause of our righteousness in heaven (Eph 4:6-8; 2 Cor 5:21). This grace is "gracious and everlasting" (John 6:36). "Grace is God's sustaining love. Grace enables
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been teaching English in Italy for about ten years now.  This is a great reference book for those who need to know the basics.  The book is organized in chapters with sub-chapters.  You can get the details on any given subject by using the index.  It has a section on the basics of Italian grammar.  I wish that this book had been available during the time I spent studying.  Since I've written my dissertation, however, I have found it to be a very useful reference for my students.  My students are often looking for an updated reference book but do not know where to begin.  They have great success with the information contained in this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A well-written and very interesting look at the history of the British Empire in its infancy.  The author covers some of the most important events of the 19th century from this time period, which he describes with a keen eye.  There is much about the British empire that has been forgotten by its new owners, but we need to know more about its origins

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a fantastic resource and I've been using it since I was learning about "Rio". It provides an explanation about the origins of the Olympics and provides useful facts and information about it's history. Rio de Janeiro is not just a "Rumble in the Jungle" or "Richest Olympian of All Time" (as many of the articles state, "The original Olympic Games were in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest". So where did the idea come from? The author also has an interesting take on the Olympic symbol. I really liked this book and was very happy with it. I plan on learning more about the "Olympic Games" and will be purchasing more books about the subject in the future. The book contains a lot of nice images that I can reference to learn more about "Oval". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating exploration of some very important aspects of the way the "Christian Mind" works.  It also offers several ways the author does try to change this way of thinking.  Although this book is not meant to be read by everyone, I think it will be of value to those who are in conflict with their own religious beliefs, and also those who wish to understand why certain ideas resonate with certain people.  This book is written in a conversational style, which the reader will enjoy reading because it is full of insight and humor.  One of the best parts of this book are the chapters written by the author about his own religious upbringing, which will be interesting to those of us who have been exposed to Christianity as children and have grown up to disagree with it

Write a positive review about a good book:    From the beginning of my pregnancy I became concerned about the future of our family. I learned that my husband was planning to move to California, leaving the girls, age nine, at the care of a grandmother, and I decided that the best thing for them would be to spend their summer with my mother, and that plan, when it worked, was that my mother would travel up from the South East.  So while my husband planned for a future in California, I decided it was time for me to plan for a new beginning.  I decided to learn the French language and go back to school.  After the birth of my daughter, I returned to teaching.  The following year I went back to university.  While I was in college, I bought and read this book, and in the process of doing so, I began to realize what my life was lacking.  It was in that book, I thought, that I began my journey through life.  Although I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, I am from a long line of French Huguenots and I am very much a product of the French influence on Louisiana.   For years, I lived in New York City, New Orleans and I spent my childhood studying with a school-aged child from New Orleans.  From that experience I also learned that the French have a rich language, rich culture, and a great deal of wisdom.  In fact, the French culture was such that I was able to speak, understand, and appreciate many aspects of Western civilization, a culture that was not always as we believe it to be today.  A woman named Marie-Louise Pache, for example, was considered by many to be the best French teacher ever in her generation.  She taught, and still teaches, my daughter to this day.  However, when I came home from college I found that I no longer had a teacher.  Instead, my family had become scattered all over the place, and my family was having problems in the family's home.  One of my daughters had a great love of books.  Her father gave her books, but the books that he gave her were the books she liked.  That meant that she read the English translation of this book in French and that helped her tremendously in her early years in life.At the end of this first book, Marie-Louis, the grandmother, tells the story of what her family went through.  My daughter and
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book to learn about the history of ancient China.  The author gives a brief overview of the evolution of the Chinese state.  He shows the emergence of political control by the central government, the introduction of the state bureaucracy, and its role in consolidating political power.   China's first emperor, Yang Hsien, is credited with introducing the bureaucracy and the state. However, the author also discusses the history and evolution of various government structures in ancient China, including those that were centralized and those that developed from local communities.  Overall, the book is well written, and gives an insight into Chinese history which many people today fail to see 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A brilliant blend of facts, history and observations, this book is fascinating 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read all the previous editions in detail, but have only just now come to this one.  I bought the book on a whim and have been able to learn a great deal more about this wonderful and difficult subject.  In addition to some of the earlier chapters dealing with the creation of Adam and Eve from the dust of the ground, there is now a chapter about the Fall.  This is the first of its kind.  It's a wonderful book for children, and for adults with a scientific bent, for those who wish to gain an understanding of Genesis.  From what I gather from my children and other Christians who read this, this book is very helpful and useful in getting to know both sides of the issue.  The authors also give some information on the Creation Museum in Cincinnati, a place where many people are trying to reconcile Genesis with the story of creation in Genesis. The museum is a great place to learn more about Genesis and the many other scriptures.  But I must say, if you are a scientist, and the creationists try to get in touch with Genesis, this is a good guide for you.  They do get a number of facts correct in this book (I suspect it is due to the careful study of the Creation science, which is based on a lot of data rather than personal speculation)  but I agree with the reviewers on this page, that the book is not a very good work for children.  However, if the topic is a very difficult one for children to grasp, then this book works for them.  While this book isn't a perfect guide to the topic, its approach is fairly close.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "If you love learning about the history of the American people, the American experience, the social and political foundations of the country, the state of the West, the role of the Second Amendment in American history, and the role the United States has played in the affairs of the world - you will find an array of fascinating facts and charts in this text. You will also learn the lessons we need today in order to preserve and improve upon the founding principles and the freedoms the American People enjoyed from 1776 to 1791.  You will find that history teaches us that individuals should never be judged by their looks or skin color, nor by their nationality or race - only by the content of their character 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read since I was in grade school, and I had a good time reading it.

Not many mysteries get to the point of mystery, and this one does 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very, very comprehensive book covering most of the main areas of the subject.  I had seen a lot of the information, but I had to find out all the details to get my own research started.  In my opinion, this is the BEST reference book on this subject.My recommendation is that you buy this book in its entirety, read through and then take all of the info you can and use it to make your own case in an academic setting.  My own research has proven many of the ideas presented in the book (in addition to a few of the facts) to be true.  A word about the format: The book is organized according to the number of topics covered, and divided into two sections of 40 each.  The information is listed in the chronological order of its appearance in the text, as is common in academic works

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was the book I was waiting for when I wanted to go to law school and this was the best guide I could find on the web.  I used a combination of my undergraduate course notes and this book.  The book is easy to understand and contains much good information.  One reason I love this book is because it tells the law school students about all the ways they can improve and how they can make law school much more enjoyable and less painful!  Each chapter is focused on a particular topic, like the relationship between the law and society, the importance of an independent academic life, and the role of the professor in the law profession 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book.  It is very interesting and insightful.  The chapters are organized so that the main ideas are not repeated often in different ways.  However, several recurring ideas are covered and some examples are used in different forms.  As a student, I had a hard time taking a class on this subject, because it felt like it was full of common sense, but as a teacher, it was a very interesting topic to cover in class.  I do not understand the reasons why so many people have trouble grasping it, but there are reasons.  A good book is one that is well written and interesting enough to make you think, or at least come to a conclusion about a difficult topic.  My teacher used this book in the first year of her English class, and I used it in the second and third year of my writing class.I would say that this is a book worth reading.

It will help them learn how to talk to their child about their own emotions and how to get them to understand their child's emotions. It will provide great information on how to handle anger, anger management, how to communicate well with your child.  If you have a younger child, you will learn about how to cope with your own child's problems

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Mantle of the Sun" is an insightful examination of the early Christianity's attempts to understand the cosmos, which is a subject I had never learned much about before.  If the author is correct, the early Christians understood that there are fundamental, unifying principles that unify the universe--such as the eternal laws of cause and effect and the eternity of God.  This understanding gave rise to the belief that God would make human beings out of "divine dust" (Gen. 3:19) and that God is the creator of all matter and energy.  They believed in the virgin birth of Christ and the incarnation.  The author does an excellent job of showing that the early Christian understanding of the cosmos was not based on any of the major scientific theories of their time.  As a result, it was much more likely to be accurate than some of the theories they came up with, such as evolution.  But the authors don't just tell us that early Christianity was right.  Rather, they present evidence for a common thread of shared experience between Christianity and the ancient scientists of their day.  There is also much information that the modern scientific community is unaware of that can help us understand what happened to the early christian worldview
