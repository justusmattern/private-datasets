Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been eyeing this book for a while but didn't think I would find the time for a full marathon.  When I finally finished it, it was like I had known it all along.   In a word, the author is incredibly good at crafting character, the prose flows very well and she uses a wide range of sources, including both historical events and modern day history.  I look forward to reading more from her, which is really hard when I have a lot of reading to do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most interesting thing about this book is the fact that I've never read about any of these issues before, even though I've been interested in women's issues for many years. I had the distinct feeling that the author would take things in a different direction from the way the previous authors tackled them. Her voice is much more like a woman talking about the realities of being a woman. I found myself thinking of how the same things could have been written by a man, though, because she is just so relatable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book from the library and have enjoyed it very much! It was interesting and fun to read about the history of astronomy. It was definitely a little long for my liking, but it was definitely worth the wait. The illustrations in this book are great!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited to see this book when I saw it was about an ex-nun, and I was definitely not disappointed.   A strong female character is always welcome, even if her situation is difficult. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was amazing!   My wife is a fan of The Lord of the Rings and has seen every single one of them   but this book takes her there   with her own little adventure.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it is excellent and a good introduction to the literature of the occult. I will be using this to help my students learn the occult for their next course in magick. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful book! I am a professional bookbinder, and I have used this book as a resource for many of my projects. It is easy to read and has very little material. The binder pattern is very clear and easy to follow. I will definitely be using this pattern. Thank you!!
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful, well researched and interesting book, well written, with great pictures. I found this interesting and thought it was a very good book and worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a really useful guide on a subject I've never quite understood. It doesn't really explain it but it shows it. It is quite easy to get a good general grasp of the subject without getting bogged down in details so it is a solid book.    
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed the book. I liked that he uses several different sources to show why people believe certain things, and how this makes his conclusions more convincing.   If you're looking for a book that will help you better understand the science of climate change, look no further than this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  The book describes the early life of a dog who's been bred and then selectively bred to be a show dog.  After watching the training video the breeder gave to the dog, it became my first foray into the world of selective breeding.  I am an owner of a German Shepherd and have had my show dogs since before I even knew what "show" meant.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of the book was quite good. I liked the use of science and medicine in the book. There were quite a few real-life situations discussed as well as science based advice for how to cope with the effects of a broken marriage (if you have one).   There were many scientific aspects of the situation that are important to know and to be aware of.   I would recommend this book to anyone who is in a relationship that is dysfunctional. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fun read! The best thing about it is that there is so much information in it.   I really like the variety of the animals and their abilities.  It also has some very good humor in it and good advice.  The author explains very well what the animals can do, and it makes for interesting discussions with the kids.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the writing. I've read a lot of fantasy books, but this was the first book in the genre that really got me interested in the subject. The main characters were the best parts. The world was well thought out, and there were plenty of twists to keep my interest. If you're looking for a fast read, this is definitely a great read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of the books that I read, but I've always been a little more leery of reading romance novels because they always seem to make me cry. Well, I finally found one that wasn't as cheesy as I thought it was going to be.   The main reason I picked up this one was for my niece.    She's been trying to decide which book to read and I told her this one might work for her.  I had no idea the book was as good as it is!   She absolutely loves the character, and the romance.  It's really interesting, it's a very good book, and I hope my niece picks it up as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It was very well written, well structured, well paced, and I'm a huge fan of the books in the series.  It's a great idea to write a book about a fantasy world that's real.  I also liked the idea of the characters living in a world that is the same one they're used to in their everyday lives.  If you're looking for a nice light read, this might be a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book made me think deeply about the moral and social dilemmas that are facing us in the contemporary world.   It has a unique understanding of history and sociology.  I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the problems that face us and the questions that need to be answered.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read "A Very Short Introduction to Clojure" by John Dyer, and it's an excellent overview of the core technologies of the Lisp-based programming language Clojure.   There are numerous other introductions and resources available that cover a wide range of aspects of Lisp and Clojure, but this is the only one I've found so far that covers a good deal of what I need to know in order to get started.  I haven't found any documentation on the core libraries that are discussed in the book, and I think it's worth it to read the book for that.  It also is a nice overview of Clojure's syntax, which I was never really a fan of but have found more user-friendly than most languages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book very late one night because I was out and my roommates were not home. I was completely turned off by this book and never read it again but I did enjoy it very much. This book was funny and clever and really was an eye opener on the world of vampires, which is something that I wasn't really interested in.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The story takes the concept of the book and makes it better and more interesting and it makes you care."   I'm really excited to read the next book in the series and I can't wait to read this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is about an early 20th century woman who was a member of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union during World War 2. Her book has a lot of depth and information about what it was like being a communist during that time. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in Communism and politics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm sorry to say, but this is not a book that I've been able to read more than once or twice. My first encounter with it was at a used bookstore, and then I found a used copy at a yard sale for around $20, and finally a second copy for around 25 cents. I'm really glad I got the second copy. It's an interesting read, as well as being a lot of fun to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great and has great stories from all around the world. I really like the concept of traveling the world, meeting people, learning something new each time, and being free to explore the culture that surrounds you.   Also, I was able to get myself up the mountains and walk the beaches of the Pacific Islands. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. The author uses her own family to make a strong point about how being in your own head can lead you to be an overly self-involved person. I loved the story and thought it was written in a very positive light. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've learned a lot in the last five years from having my own business.    This book gives you an excellent framework to create and run a successful, profitable business. I'm a long-time reader of books on personal growth, self-improvement, and business, but I had to stop buying them because I just couldn't put the knowledge into practice.  I learned from this book what I needed to know and get started.  It's not a great reference book, but it does get you started in your business, and that's all I care about.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on what makes an online dating site successful.  The author does a great job of showing you what to expect, what to do, and how to succeed on a site like OKCupid.  I never thought I was good at meeting people on other sites.  A great read!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book and found it a pleasant surprise.  The story is very well paced and is not a typical adventure story.  It has a lot of heart and humor and is a quick read.   It may not have many action moments, but the writing is solid.   -Kurt from the UK
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book, and I would read it again, but I have other books that are better, and this one is worth your time, even if you do not read science fiction. The book was good. A good solid novel about a young woman who is trying to understand her own emotions in a society that is completely unaware of them. If you are interested in science fiction, and/or the psychology of the individual, this is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a bit reluctant to purchase this book, but once I saw the nice illustrations and the description I decided to give it a try. I'm pretty picky with books. This book wasn't too badly written, although it didn't really capture my interest for the first half. However, the second half was very interesting and I can't wait to continue reading this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is good and there's not many others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've just bought   The  ..   a very enjoyable read... It   is a wonderful retelling of the   events in the lives of Joseph Smith and the members of the Smith family, from the rise of the Church in the 1840's to its  dissolution in 1844.   All in all, this is a great book to have in your  library  !
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit skeptical of the book at first, but the more I read the more impressed I became. I loved how well the author explained things and why they are so important to human survival.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story was well-paced and well-crafted. I was actually really surprised by some of the things that the characters do. They're not stupid, but they're very intelligent and are generally a very clever bunch.   I really liked the way they talked, especially the way that most of the dialogue was delivered in a monotone voice.  This novel may not be for everyone, but I enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the next book in the series!
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is my favorite book I have read in a long time, and I love the author, who is a very good, intelligent and fun person.    I would recommend it to people who enjoy science fiction or fantasy, just because it is such a well written book, especially in terms of writing, characters and plot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can now tell my children to always read The Great Gatsby.   There was no story that I could tell about it or one that I didn't like.  I loved the book but my kids found it difficult to get through it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's one of the best books I've ever read and I found it to be very well researched.  It also has a nice mix of humor and depth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book!   While not entirely new to me, I was pleasantly surprised by the richness of this book.  It is full of information and is written from a female perspective with the help of a male friend who speaks in a "good cop, bad cop" style style.   He also gives detailed advice about doing what is right for you at the same time as doing what you think will be best for your baby.  So in that regard, this book is a great read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most entertaining and informative book that I have ever read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book I was looking for, as I have never read anything in the realm of science fiction that I liked.   I am a big sci fi fan, and this book fits nicely into my collection of great books.  The author explains his work as science fiction, and it is accurate and plausible.  I liked that he included a synopsis of the events in the novel, as well as what a typical day might be like for the characters.  A book that is interesting in a scientific way and entertaining to read.  Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite books about religion:  The Way of the Pilgrim: A Journey to Christ,  and the Pilgrim's Progress (with Michael R. Hughes):   This book shows that "Pilgrim" is really just a good description of Christianity. It is also quite good about life.  I was surprised that I found this book as good as I did.  The Pilgrim's journey is not about how much Jesus Christ saved, it is about how Christ changed me, and that changed me so much that I want to change the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It had me excited and I liked the characters.   The book is well researched and I enjoyed it!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not a great reader, but I am an excellent book reader.   This book is a great read.  I liked the fact that it is different from the traditional "how to write" books.  The author uses a few different styles, from technical to narrative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this was a very nice and well written book.   The subject matter and the writing style are very interesting and a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was never sure about this book, but this is what I've been looking for. I have a tendency to skip a good story in favor of another one. This book is just that good. I never got bored with the plot, or the characters. It has a lot of character development and I liked the relationship of Harry and Ginny (my favorite pair in all of Harry Potter). I think I'll read more of these books as this is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had not read much historical fiction before reading this one. I really liked it. The first paragraph really got me. It is short and easy to read and the story is engaging. The main character is a good person and I'm looking forward to his future adventures.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great work of social history, the author has taken a great deal of care in drawing our attention to the social circumstances that have created and nurtured the modern American family as it exists today. I find it fascinating that all the leading economists of the 19th century were not feminists. This book is a great introduction to feminism, and shows how feminists helped bring about the development of the modern workplace. For that reason, I would highly recommend this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read the "A Guide for the Perplexed", and I enjoyed it.  The "Guide" for the mentally handicapped is a great collection of information and information about life.   It's just the right length and depth to make you feel understood and to give you the sense you are part of the "Guru's inner circle."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. A good old fashioned look at the history of the Soviet Union. A lot of good stories and I enjoyed reading it thoroughly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would not hesitate to read more of the books in the collection by this author.   The author has made many interesting observations about different cultures and religions.  A great resource. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good, solid work on the subject of religion.   It is easy to understand and I found myself learning a good deal from the discussion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very intelligent and well researched book. A great reference on the current state of Islam and how it relates to the current world   "A timely, well-researched and comprehensive work that helps explain to people of all faiths why they should care about what happens in the Middle East."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of this book. The book was well written and interesting, and I hope more people read it.   (My daughter has not yet finished it and I'm looking forward to her reading it. This is the first time I've heard about the book and now I want to know more about it.)
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book and enjoyed it a lot. I read the last 50% of the book in 3 days because I loved the characters and the story. I highly recommend this book. I am hoping to have an author I like for sure in the future.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really very good. It is a good reference book for students or people who want to become better programmers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read the entire book, and I have found it to be highly enjoyable. I am a fan of fantasy, and had no idea that the book could be so well written. I will not buy another book in this series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I had a little trouble getting this book for our wedding night because it's written in third person and doesn't really explain what the book is about so we were hoping the author would fill in the blanks. We found that it explained all the "why" and "how" very well but if it's a bit too hard to explain the why we could have just read the book. The wedding itself was a blast.   The wedding photos were incredible 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a book like this the author does an excellent job of explaining the basic science behind most diseases.   I was actually surprised at how well this information was put together as I didn't always understand it.  The author also includes lots of interesting information about the history and current status of the disease and the other diseases it affects.  I definitely recommend this book to those who are interested in knowing more about certain illnesses.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most compelling account of what the Internet is doing to the public sphere.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was fantastic! This is the first I have read that can give you an idea of what a Daoist cultivation program looks like, and what it is like to live and practice it, from the perspective of someone with no previous experience. The author also has a great way of describing the physical body and how to cultivate it, which is very helpful in getting started.   In a sense, I would have given this book 5 stars (in addition to being a great read) if not for the minor flaw of the chapter on the "Five Treasures", which was a bit hard to follow, but I think that could be the author's fault, not the book's. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to keep buying this one to stay informed on the latest in the world of cannabis research.   The author, Dr. Robert Bruce (doubled down by starting a second book) is a pioneer.  He had a lot of things to say, but I found the way he was presenting them to be a bit too technical for me. The material that was presented in a clear fashion by Dr. Bruce was quite good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The story was very good, and the ending was good as well. " The story is told from the point of view of the protagonist, who has been a member of the Church of Scientology for thirty years and has always been a devout Scientologist. After the death of his wife, he goes to Los Angeles to start a new life but is disappointed at the lack of "good" jobs. After spending time with several other Scientologists, he becomes the leader of a small church and begins his quest for salvation.   This book was very interesting, and is a good story.    I had no idea how Scientology's practices could work for people.  The book also explains how Scientology "trains" its members, which is why the church is so successful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have found this to be one of the most rewarding books I have read in a very long time. I have enjoyed it more than any other I have seen.   The author makes us care about each character and it is very interesting and enjoyable to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not perfect and it takes some getting used to, but for me, it was a great read.   I am a bit of a horror buff, and I am definitely looking forward to reading the other installments in this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an amazing book for anyone who is not afraid to challenge the status quo and who is interested in an alternate view of the world. I've read several books about evolution, and this was definitely my favorite.   -  JB -- September 9, 2014
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book was a great read. There was a lot of information to be gathered and I was able to put it together. I think a lot is being learned." -Bella.com "I have loved everything about this book. Not only does it provide an in depth look at my past, but also at some of the difficulties I have been through. I will be recommending this book to anyone." -Riley.com   A very unique book.   I am a little baffled by the title, but I will admit it works for me. It gives an insight into a past that most of us may never really understand.  From that past I have had to change, change some more and have had the chance to grow up and learn. I have seen the world from a different point of view and the world is much different than I remember it. It is easy for me to relate to his characters and their thoughts and struggles. I can see how they are similar to myself, which is something I really like, it was very refreshing to read a book written from the perspective of an ex-porn star. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      The best of the bunch. I love how this story has some amazing moments!   I have a ton of family stories to tell and this story gave me some much needed closure to the tragedy of my mother passing in 2007.    I really enjoyed this story as I don't think I can ever fully understand what happened in my mother's life. However, I feel as though I do now because I know it was a really long and tough road that led to her death. I was reading the story last night and I knew exactly what was going to happen next.   I think I have found my new favorite YA book! The main character is a beautiful, quirky, and quirky girl who is very smart. She's the last one of her family and I felt like I was just going to have to read it all over again.  Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing in this book is excellent.   It makes use of various techniques which are often overlooked by most writers, but which are very helpful in developing character and empathy.  I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been looking for something similar to the Harry Potter series since I read the first Harry Potter book in 1990.   The books have become more realistic and the characters are more complex. I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised and glad I picked this up. It's really hard to know how to read a biography with an author who hasn't written a novel, but this book is fascinating and I learned a lot about how the lives of people like J.C. Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison formed, evolved, and exploded. I've always found Hendrix fascinating as a musician (he was such a perfectionist that he got a lot of things wrong). But I never knew that Hendrix was a very troubled man. I didn't really realize that Morrison's early life was so dysfunctional. I read this book after the concert and listened to it in one sitting. Thanks so much for doing a good job!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It's a good read.  It's short, so it is great for a quick read."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read three of the books in the collection so far (Saga, Blood Song and The Last Wish) and I've enjoyed them all.  The Last Worn Ring by Mark Lawrence   This is one of those books that you have to read in one sitting and you have some trouble finishing it as it starts to get a bit too complex.   But once you get to the end you feel like you've seen a lot and that you can't put it down.  An extremely enjoyable read!   I really liked this book.  A wonderful story and one that has me wanting to keep reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read that really made me think and ponder a topic I'd only skimmed over in the past. The discussion on the morality of science is an interesting one. The book is not entirely well written (e.g. there are more grammar and spelling errors than I expected) but it is a must read. I liked the author's take on how people use social media and technology to further their self-image. For the most part I didn't really like the book, but there are several things that stuck out. First, there are a few bits that are well-written and funny (such as the chapter titled "The Worst of It all", which is about people who like to brag about how they are in the best shape of their life but can't afford a new car). Second, there is a bit of a meta-analysis in this book that is really neat and worthwhile (see page 38 for a bit more on it). Third, there's an intriguing discussion about how humans are often unaware of the value of things we consume. There are some points about how we become overly-involved in the purchase of things that aren't very good for us, but I'm sure that's true for most of us as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was a good read, well written. I will definitely be buying the rest.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My parents took me to the library to read. This book was one of the books that helped us understand the basics of the Bible. It's a simple and easy to understand book for those who have an interest in learning about the Bible and Bible stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It took me a bit to get through the first 50 pages or so, but once I did it was a real pleasure and well worth the time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book back in the summer, and I liked it quite a bit. It's not a classic, but the stories are well-told and the characters were well-developed. It took me a while to get into it, but once I did, I really enjoyed the story. My main problem was that I have a terrible memory (I forgot how I got the title of the book I was reading), and I was trying to remember the names of characters (which I don't remember from previous books I've read, so this was really annoying). But I had a lot of fun, and it's one of those books I will read again in the future!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed the "Dune" series by Frank Herbert. There has been a lot of criticism and derision toward the books, but I found them both very enjoyable. I was especially taken with the dialogue between the three main characters, the characters with a good deal of wit and intellect. I would suggest any fan of Frank Herbert and science fiction get the books and get to reading."
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a fun read and good for adults and teenagers. It is more about the characters, and there is a lot of good writing in this book. I enjoyed it very much.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My son enjoyed reading this book. We had the same opinions before he started reading it, but now he agrees with me and his mom, as well. I really enjoyed it and will definitely recommend it to others who love this kind of stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased with this book.  It is an introduction to evolutionary biology.  One thing I particularly like is the description of how evolution works in the book. It explains things in an easy to understand way.  Also, it shows that evolution happens on all fours (a great way to explain the origins of the human body) and it explains how evolution of a species is linked to evolution of the entire species.  Overall, this is a really good book to read if you are already well versed in the basics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am really enjoying this book. The first half was interesting and fascinating, but after the first few chapters it gets bogged down in the more technical side of the field. However, the book still does a good job explaining the basics and what's involved in doing a good genome sequencing experiment. I also really like the author's enthusiasm and enthusiasm for the field, and for science. The second half is a bit more boring, and I have no idea why the first half is so interesting. The authors discuss their main results and results for the rest of the world in their first part, and then come back to discuss a different set of data (in this case in a different country) and explain the results for that, but not really for the first part. It just feels that if you want to read about something that's actually useful, read the second part. The second half was a bit better than the first, but still not enough to justify the price.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most complete edition of a great classic on the subject, the history of the American Indian. I've been thinking about this book since I read it, and I've always been satisfied with the information. There were a couple of sections where the research was lacking, but these were minor.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter gives us an introduction to this book. I was intrigued by the subject of the book and the topic of the series, and the author did a great job covering the topics of science and religion, with an even bigger emphasis on science.   I am glad I read the book.  A good review for this book: I enjoyed this book a lot. It was good, well written, and informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author was able to create a very rich and detailed world. The character development was smooth and enjoyable. The book is well written.   I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would definitely read the second book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  It contains useful information about a subject I don't understand and is extremely well written.   The subject of human sexuality is definitely one of the more taboo ones but if you have any interest in that area of interest, this book would be a good start.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't stress enough how much I loved this book.  The book is well written and well organized, with many great illustrations, and it really makes you feel like you are there.   This book is definitely worth the price if you like historical fantasy, especially if you are looking for an interesting alternative to the more modern settings in some of the recent fantasy novels I've read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am always fascinated by the strange, bizarre, fascinating and often terrifying things that humans can do with computers.   The best way to do that is to read about a group of people who are trying to do something impossible with computers, the people who have made their living in the computer field since the 80s and now, after years of trying, have come up with a working computer that could make their computers obsolete in the process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished this. The first half was a bit dry. But then it picked back up. I read it in a couple of sittings and it didn't take too long to get going.   This book is worth the read for anyone interested in the subject matter.  I think I may have been a bit too old for this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was one of the most interesting things I've read in a while. I have a large collection of historical novels (all of them) but this was one the best. Very good writing, a story that is really worth reading. A true story about a very controversial time in time. I am glad this book was published. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The one thing I dislike about a lot of book review articles is the general negativity that is implied. In most cases, they are just negative summaries, with some judicious use of the negative word. The book review article is more like a review of a movie that you are pretty sure you've seen before, so you skip it without really knowing why. A book review is a good summary of the movie, so it's a fine article, though it tends to be a bit too positive."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of The Giver and the book is fantastic.    It's got some great imagery and is one of the few works I've read where the protagonist has a really solid outlook on the world (and even if it's a fantasy world, it doesn't end up being a fantasy that I can't relate to), even though his world is not exactly like mine.  The Giver is a great book and I look forward to reading more.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just recently been introduced to this wonderful book! It is filled with a great deal of information on many different types of cancer and how they are affected by lifestyle. I have been told that I have multiple types of cancers so I have become more knowledgeable on how to be proactive and manage the risks of them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the book immensely and learned a lot from it, including that it is often not the best book to read that day.   It gave me an overview of the principles of a good business/personal life balance.  I am not quite sure how they managed to keep the book's price down (I can only assume it was due to Amazon's royalty policies).   The author should consider writing an entire book of good-for-you/good-for them tips that also include good eating habits and good sleep habits. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The concept was not novel, but it captured my attention and kept me turning the pages."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent work of scholarship, history and biography that has influenced the understanding of our past as well as our future. I am glad to find it in print and read it again. I think we can all learn a great deal from it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of those that can be used in any situation.   I can use this book to learn a lot of new things.  One of the most interesting things is how to use the various types of numbers when solving certain problems. This book was a great addition to my math and statistics classes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very readable book that discusses topics in a scientific manner. I'm glad the author is not just another advocate for anti-vaccine beliefs.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I've been looking for a book that I can read every day for the next week.   This book is great!   The pictures, the writing and the audio are all good, and it's easy to understand.  I'd highly recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been searching for a novel that will help me get more information about the history and development of the United States (and other places). In my search, I came across several books by Thomas Jefferson, but I really liked this one the most. Jefferson gives a balanced and comprehensive look at our Founding Fathers in a fascinating and fascinating way. I'm grateful that I have the time to read this book, especially since it was so hard to find in bookstores. I am going to make this a regular feature in my collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, because it was very interesting, and because the author clearly understood his subject well.   The plot was interesting, but I am not sure if I understand why some people believe in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent introduction to the subject of Buddhism.  I was very much looking forward to reading a book on Buddhism that would address the many topics and criticisms that are often directed towards the topic.   The book provides an excellent grounding for anyone interested in Buddhism. While the book is written for a lay audience,   it is quite interesting and engaging for those of us who live in a more spiritual society and live a more spiritually oriented life.  It is an impressive achievement to write a book about such an ancient subject and it is a joy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful book that brings together a fascinating mixture of history, philosophy, psychology, and religious belief, but with a lot of humor and light hearted humor, and a lot more history.   If you have never read a book by one of the founders of the new atheist movement, you owe it to yourself to read this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very glad I read the book.   This is a very well researched and written book. As a professional artist, I think you need to be a true believer in yourself and in your work to make art. I found the book to be an insightful and well researched look at the creative process.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can remember when this book was a mystery, and the only problem was the characters were so uninteresting that it wasn't until the end of the story that I realized what they were trying to accomplish. Now that I've read it, I'm very glad I got it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've found this book very interesting and interesting and insightful.   The authors have shown great knowledge in regards to how the Internet works and how it has impacted our lives.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that needs to understand how and why we use the Internet.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book from Amazon as an eBook.  The book is very good and a lot of fun.  It's also a good introduction to the field.    This book will help anyone interested in the field  of music theory and enjoy the fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read The Magic of Reality: The Physics of Everyday Life.  I like the fact that it explains, and in a clear and simple way, the concept of reality.  It does not go into an esoteric (I hate that term), philosophical (you know how people complain about philosophy and try to make it go away?) or mystical (how will the meaning of life be known when it isn't?) way, but explains it simply and clearly.     I like it because it gives an easy-to-understand, non-technical explanation of the science of reality and how it influences us.  The author has a Ph.D. in physics and is an excellent speaker and writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the English language and the evolution of literary styles.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a great book on self-defense. The author describes the techniques used in various styles of self-defence. He describes the different kinds of situations in which self-protection is needed. He offers tips and tricks for various situations. If you have any interest in fighting crime, then I recommend you to read this book. He even describes the weapons one would use in self- defense."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am an old fashioned person that likes to sit down and read a book and enjoy myself while I do it, this is definitely a good read and if you are the type of person who likes to read a lot or have many books on your nightstand, this may be a good one. The narration and the writing is a bit repetitive, but I like to go through books a bit slow just for the novelty of reading a different voice, but it's still fun to read and I think that would make this a good pick for a book club or a library. In the end this is another book that would have been better if the author went for a lighter touch with the narration.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book, for people who have to teach high school English as a foreign language.   In addition to providing students with many examples of a well written and well written text, it also contains examples of how to format, organize, edit and format a paper, and even how to use the word "I" to show agreement with others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would recommend "The Good Brain: The Surprising New Science of Building and Running a Good Brain" by David Eagleman. It is not easy to get into this book; Eagleman, a neurosurgeon, does an amazing job of introducing the basics of the brain that are so often ignored by people who do not know what the brain is really for. He explains why the brain has evolved and developed as it has, and he discusses how the brain's structure has evolved in response to human evolution. He then describes various neurological conditions that are often seen in adults who are not developing normally, such as dyslexia, epilepsy, autism, ADHD and even depression. He also discusses various approaches for managing these disorders. The book is well written, easy to read and very approachable to those with a non-medical background. I especially appreciated his discussion of the importance of exercise to the brain. If you are a child or an adult who is looking for some information about the brain, this is a must have book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the story and found the characters to be well-developed and interesting.   My only issue was that the book had the same issue as "Gone Girl." The author seemed to get the idea for the "crime/mystery/thriller" genre (something similar to "The Prestige" or "Camelot") and followed it to a tee.  A few of the characters were a bit annoying (the father, the girlfriend, the mother-in-law) but overall I enjoyed the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading for a couple years now and so far have enjoyed the book immensely, which makes me sad that I will have to start all over again at some point. I love it when good books come out, and the author, in this case, does a great job of keeping it updated with the times and keeping it original. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      "I read this on a plane, in first class, while I was listening to my wife. I thought it was the best book I've ever read. There are few things in life more exhilarating than traveling and being in a foreign country. This book told me how to take that trip to the unknown."
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent guide to the game of rugby and very useful for coaches. The book is short but comprehensive and provides the key points needed to understand the game, what players need to be aware of in the game and how to use the tools in the book. A book like this really should be given to every coach as it can be a life saver for any coaches coming into the game. I would recommend this book to any rugby team with a rugby background, especially those wanting to progress to the next level.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be a light read. After all I know you don't want to read an overly long book so I thought, 'Hey, I might just find something interesting here.' And this is the book I found!  I found it very interesting and I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.  " 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great read.  The information in the book is useful and well-written, with a well-chosen set of sources.  It was interesting and informative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's got lots of good information for everyone from the beginning of the world's history to the end of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good one to read for those who want to learn more about programming. This is a well written book and there is a lot of information about different aspects of programming which the reader can easily find on the Internet. However, the book also includes some practical examples. I enjoyed the book and I think it will be useful for those looking to develop skills and expand their knowledge.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about the way to a good marriage. I have found that my husband and I have a "relationship crisis" and that "happens" to every couple in every relationship - but with me this problem has been more problematic.  I have never found any book that has actually helped me, and so I am still trying to figure it out.   It has been over 4 years and this book has helped me to make a few changes that I have now incorporated in my relationship.  Thanks for writing this, Susan.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been using the book "The Art of Living" as a companion to my other books, which are not only helpful but also fun. It teaches you how to create your own path and be happy for the choices you make in each life stage and the way they fit into your life and your current situation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read in a long time. It has some interesting facts about life in Germany during the war, but it is also a book about the war itself.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great and fun read!   It's about time that some of the "toys" got the attention they deserve.   This book should be required reading in all elementary school, elementary and middle school English classes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is very well written, as I expected. The first half is a good introduction to the topic of the book and has the advantage of being a great story, although it is not without its flaws. I loved the character development for those characters, and the action and intrigue added another dimension to the story.  I found it hard to put down when the book was done, because the story is very good and the writing is top notch. I highly recommend the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like books about real-life superheroes, especially if you liked "Superheroes: The Best of the Best" by George Perez, this is the book for you.   Perez has a knack for creating characters who aren't just powerful, but real and relatable.  " Superheroes" gives readers a chance to understand the different superheroes' unique backgrounds. "Superman: Secret Origin" also gave readers an explanation of why Superman has to wear a suit.  And as if that isn't enough, Perez also gave us a look at how the other superheroes came to be!

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book contains much information on the different methods of making money by making people do the work for them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking forward to reading this book for a long time. I can't wait to read it.   As a former professor who was also a teacher, I'm thrilled that this book offers a wide variety of resources and methods for teachers and learners.  I'm excited to see how the authors adapt their methods and teaching styles to the 21st Century. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a fan of old pulp books, then this book is perfect for you. This is a collection of stories told by different pulp writers who all tell their stories with a certain flair. I was thoroughly entertained by every story. A must have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in about 3 hours, and found myself really getting into it, and having a great time. It has many, many good characters, and some very interesting and well-developed scenes.   It is a good, short read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book. It gives a lot of interesting background info about the ancient Greek religion and its relationship to modern-day religions. I'm sure it would have been a hard book to find in any bookstores before now, but it's now available.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I've read recently.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got a lot out of this book.  The only real criticism I have is that the book is really long.  It would have been much shorter with just the beginning.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never seen a book this rich in detail and full of good examples and good examples of bad examples.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child I loved reading 'The Cat in the Hat' and would go to the movies just to watch 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'.   My parents also bought 'The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents' for me to read over my bed to sleep through the night.   I'm a little older now, but I still have a lot of affection for these books, which have inspired me to become a writer myself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a great book. I highly recommend it to any person who wants to learn about different methods of creating and distributing their own code.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the book that set me on the path to my current obsession with Nazi memorabilia and collecting. I was introduced to it through a book club in college, but I'm glad I got to see it as soon as possible. The story is fascinating and well-told, and there's just something about a book like this that captures the spirit of the time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great way to learn to draw.   If you are into cartooning, this is the book for you.  It has been used to learn the basics in a non-threatening way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I'm a huge fan of the series, and this is the final book in the series that has the story arc that the series has always had. I especially enjoyed the characters that were in the book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   " I did not know I could appreciate a good history book until I read this one.     For a good solid history book that covers most of the major events in the last 600 years,   The Siege of Jerusalem   is a bit dry, but it is a must read for anyone who wants to know more about this interesting city.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is a good one. It is a great read. I've got a big library of books I have to read and this is one I want to keep a good eye on. I am very excited to read more of the series! I wish I knew about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this in about 4 days but had a very good time. This is definitely a stand alone book.    It's got a lot of stuff in it that I wouldn't usually get into but the humor is just right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I saw this I thought it was a good example of a fantasy novel I want to read. I was interested in the premise of a man who is in love with his niece while having no idea what to do with his daughter.  Unfortunately it took me a while to realize it was fantasy and not a good fantasy novel.   I'm glad I checked out this book and hope to find more in this genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I enjoyed this book a lot. It has a good story, good characters and a pretty well written plot. It's good that you include some real life personal experiences so it's easy to relate to the characters and to the experience of being a teenager. I enjoyed the stories so much, I just found myself reading this book over and over again because it was so good."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got really hooked on this one. It's a really well done story with great characters. I am really hoping this book will end up being a part of my "best of" shelf. It was a bit of a struggle to get through this book, but if the rest of the series is as good as this one, I will be buying the next book as soon as it comes out.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read book for anyone who loves Star Wars.  I have read the whole trilogy now and still look forward to the next one. The story and the characters are the main highlights and the humor is pretty funny too.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The title is really a bit of a misnomer; I haven't read a single page of the book and yet I'm already a huge fan.   For the most part, the book presents an overview of various ideas about time travel and why they may not be so "true", but with a lot of insight and useful examples. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the fact that this book provides a unique look at different cultures, history, and people with a great mix of humour and depth.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleased to have finally read this book and find a very good analysis of the issue of gay marriage.   This book is not without its problems (see my previous review for one), but I like the author's willingness to think beyond his limited background to do his homework. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so excited to get this book. I read the first half in one sitting. It's so different from other works of horror I've read. I'm surprised that I loved it so much.   The characters were so well written, I loved the atmosphere they created.  The monsters in this story were scary, and the way they reacted and reacted to each other was cool.  This book really reminded me of my favorite books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In many ways, this is the book I needed to read in order to be prepared for the new version of the D&D game I'm going to be playing. I'm a huge fan of the original, so this book was a real revelation.   It's written in a simple, easy to follow style, and it will give new gamers a solid foundation upon which to build. I particularly enjoyed the section on playing D& D in the past. I'd recommend it highly to people who are interested in a new edition of the game, but would like to get a good idea of how things used to be done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An interesting read for an interesting topic. Good information for the general audience, as well. I had some doubts about the nature of the book (and the authors) at the beginning, but the information was well-documented and well-prepared.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The way they write about it. It was amazing.   I love to read novels so when I found this book I thought that I was going to read the book by the author. It wasn't until I finished the book that I realized that this book had more in common with Harry Potter than the Harry Potter novels. I am a huge fan of the Harry potter series and this book is just like reading the first two. The way that they write the book. They make it seem so easy and it is easy for the reader to read.  I got to read about a girl that goes out of her way to help people. She's kind of the hero of the story and you could easily imagine that she would go on to have a great life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most enjoyable book I have read in a long time.  The story is well written and the characters are well developed.  It is a very good book that will leave a lasting impression.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading the book The Mothman Prophecies. The book was well researched, well written, well packaged and the author even wrote an afterword about what he thinks about the strange phenomenon.  The book has a very detailed, well researched and well written overview of the Mothmen and their many sightings.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best science-based book on how to be a well-rounded individual is still out there. I've been trying to improve myself and this book has helped me do so. I am very impressed by the authors ability to communicate, and they present the material in a way that is simple and understandable without being too complicated. My favorite parts are the personal development and how it relates to being a "successful man".   If you have any interest in improving your own health, lifestyle and well-being I highly recommend that you give this book a look. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In all seriousness, I have no complaints about this book. The writing is good and the information contained in the book is great. I'm glad I've found this book and can use it to prepare for my exams.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A must-have book about the world's most influential company.... This is not about the company, per se; the book is about the man. He makes you feel good about yourself by telling you that there is nothing you can't do if you just try hard enough. (This reviewer used to work for Xerox.)    If you like great books on the human condition, especially ones that focus on the people involved, buy this book.   Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because it was on my list of "favourite" books on the subject of psychopathy but I was really looking forward to reading it. I wasn't expecting much from this book, which is why I was disappointed when I was about to start. However, the book did contain a few interesting ideas that I didn't get to enjoy until the very end. I don't know whether to blame the author for the lack of good ideas or the author herself for the poor writing, but it's a shame. If only she could improve her skills at writing... (hide spoiler)  [ She's kind of dumb in this one, and the book could've been so much better with an easier theme. However it does have some good advice from one of her patients and some good insights into psychopathy. (hide spoilers) . I thought I was going to hate this book when I first read it, but I'm actually really liking it. The book is very readable and the author does a very good job explaining the different aspects of psychopaths. I am not going to give you a summary or a lot of details, as this book is so informative, but this is a very interesting book for people who know nothing about psychopathy and for those who know a little. The author is very open about the many variations of psychopathic behavior and explains how different psychopathy is influenced by many factors (her own and the patients'). The only issue I have with the book is that the main character seems to be a little boring. She is a little bitchy, a little self-centered, and she has a lot to say that I don´t really agree with. But still, I can understand why she is a bit of a bitch. The only good thing I got from this novel is the idea that there is a subtype of psychos, which has a certain amount of empathy. I read a paper a while back about the "psychopathy spectrum" which suggested that there are actually three psychopathy subtypes. The "empathy" subtype is probably the least common. The main character's psychopathy fits in the "sociopath" sub type.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not had a chance to read this in a while but the memories and feelings I have from the writing still remain.  The book is about the time I was a child growing up in a poor family in the south.  I still remember the day my father died and being so devastated I never even thought about him.  And the book touches on my grief for him in a great way, as well as my anger and confusion.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was given this book in exchange for a fair number of other excellent books and am very glad I chose this book. My only complaint is that the author often falls into the trap of making a book that is basically a series of essays about different experiences and emotions.     So, each chapter is essentially an essay about a particular experience (with some of the experiences being quite good and worthwhile).   The first two chapters are actually quite good, the third chapter is somewhat disappointing (although perhaps more because the author is too much of a stickler for grammar) but I did find the last two chapters (which involve writing letters to people I disagree with) quite interesting and worthwhile. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so surprised by this book! I didn't even know it had a subtitle like "How to get a guy to fall in love with you" until I finished it. I thought, "Man, this must be hard to get the right guy!" But it wasn't that hard at all! I was a little disappointed when the two men who didn't get with my boyfriends got together and fell in love, but that's just a small flaw in the book. This book is a must-read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a fun book to read, with an interesting storyline.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing was good, but the research was a bit weak.   However, there were some things that I learned from this book. I didn't want to buy this book until I knew the answer to the "why" of the situation. I think I am done with this kind of book, as I think that I have had enough in my life for one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was well written, and gave me a lot of insight about how different people can view the world from different angles. There were many interesting things I learned from it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book taught me some interesting tidbits about human nature. I have found the science and sociology (and some moral implications) very intriguing. The first half of the book is about the effects of modern media and entertainment on the human mind, and the second half is about how we should live our lives. I found it interesting how one's personality can be altered by media, particularly as it pertains to how people use social media. For the sake of simplicity I chose not to make specific use of the scientific findings in the book because I don't want this to become an overly-long review.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of this book, and highly recommend it to anyone that has children. I have five who are all under the age of two and love reading stories to them. They have found many fun things to do as a result.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've got my copy of this book and I'm really pleased that I have it. It is a terrific read and my daughter will really enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason I read this is because I know how hard it is to read a book and I wanted to know how the author did it. I'm not a huge fantasy fan and I'm interested in fantasy for the plot but it was nice to have a good fantasy novel. The character development was well done.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to the history of the Middle East from the beginning of the Roman Empire to the Middle Ages, including both the Christian and Islamic eras. The style of writing is very easy to follow and provides a good view of the changes the area has experienced over the years, and a description of the major characters as well as of the countries and the people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed this book a great deal. It is very different than anything I've ever read and I have a tendency to read only the best books, so I was really pleased to discover this one. My husband and I both liked it and we look forward to the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad I listened to the audiobook over the paper version. It is a lot more interesting to hear a story from the author's point of view.   This book is one of the best I have read. I am a big fan of the classic genre in which books have the ability to entertain the reader and have a good time as well. I enjoyed reading this book very much, and I look forward to hearing more stories from the creator himself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing that I can say about this book is that it made me think. It was a very thought provoking book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept is great, and I think I found something that's very similar to the one in the Harry Potter books. I really appreciate that you go out of your way to say how you found the plot confusing, and how the character development didn't seem to fit into the story.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I read this book!   It was entertaining and was very well-written.   If I could have done one thing different, I would have tried to cover some of the concepts more thoroughly.  I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for a little more detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book to do my Master's in Philosophy with. I was really nervous about going into it as a beginner but I was so relieved and excited at the same time when I actually did.   It was a good challenge for me and I got my MPhil done on time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read the first part of this book and had my doubts about it. After I had finished it, however, I'm very pleased.   This book is a great example of the genre.  This is a story of two brothers who grew up in a religious family but when they both get a job in a Christian publishing house, they realize that the God that they knew has been turned upside down.  I think it's a good example of "the faithless brother" that is a classic in the genre, although I haven't read many of those.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A quick read, but an important one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think that this book was a breath of fresh air for those who are tired of the same old stories told over and over, so I hope it's enjoyed by those who read it as well as me.   The main characters are very different and the story moves quickly, so it's easy to get into. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book immensely. I am a Christian who reads more Christian books than non-Christian ones, and this is easily one of my top- 5.   The main themes that I really liked in this book were: 1. Jesus and his teachings:  I think Jesus was a pretty good preacher, I think he was one of the best I've ever heard.  I can think of many places in the Bible that are just as good as the ones he was talking about. He is pretty much flawless, but there are things he could have done better. For instance, he had this thing he said about the Sabbath, about it being the only day on which God is glorified. I think that's pretty dumb, because the Sabbath is a day to rest from work, not to be glorified, and he shouldn't have said that. I would have rather seen him say something like, "If God is in this world, and I can make my life a lot better by obeying the rules I have laid down, then I will do so"  But I'm sure that would have been too much work for him to write for a Sunday school class. 2. Jesus' teachings in general:  This is the best section in the book, for a few reasons. One, it's all about Jesus' message, which is much more important than his personal life.  In addition, this is the section that deals with the Bible and theology, which I've been looking for on this site. The other thing I liked about this book is that it's based on some pretty good scholarship. It's not a book about Jesus specifically, but it gives a lot of insight into why we think he said certain things, and why his followers are so obsessed with the resurrection.  Also, I love that they mention John the Baptist, and his testimony about Jesus.  3. Jesus as a political figure:  Now, this section is a little odd.  It's basically a political history of Jesus, but the authors only touch on a few specific points.  They try to make Jesus into someone who is both political and a good person.  Jesus is "a God-loving radical" and is really not very interested in politics, at all.  But the authors say that Jesus "was deeply religious and committed to moral behavior" and that the "messianic age" is the one when Christianity will be the most important force in the world.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished "The Art of the Deal" by Donald J. Trump.   The book is a great read.  This is the book that "Trump" wanted to write for himself, and it was an incredibly enlightening read.   The way Trump describes his business success is just brilliant.  In this book he describes how he creates deals that benefit all parties and how it's not about winning or losing but about creating a system that has everyone happy.   You will never believe it but if Trump was alive today he would be in the same room with you and listening.  "Trump's" writing style is so very honest and very plain, the very opposite of what the media has portrayed of him.  Trump's book is an eye opener, for example he reveals that when he was first starting out he was very much like many of the people we consider to be the "poor people" in the country today.  He writes, " In the early stages of my business career I was very poor, which made life very difficult.  I hated to spend money and I hated paying for things.  It was very hard for me to make ends meet.  But by focusing on what I wanted and working harder than most, I soon had a lifestyle that I very much enjoyed.  At my age, and with the tremendous amount of work I've been doing, it's a dream come true to have the kind of life that I want. "   I love how he describes the lifestyle that he wants, it isn't all about money, it is about having the freedom to do what you want, and having the right people around you to do the same.  Donald J Trump is a person of the highest integrity, and I am happy that I was able to learn something from his words and hopefully understand a little more about how the business world works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great, it's the only book I've ever read about sex, about homosexuality, about feminism, and how to make a good relationship.    I've never been into the whole polyamory thing, so I really can't say much about that, but this is probably the best book about poly I've read. I'm not exactly sure I agree with everything the author said or written, but his philosophy really appeals to me in a way that no other book has ever come close to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My second book is a must for all children and parents with children who are in danger of being abducted.   This book helps children to be safe when they need it most. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is well written, and the author has made a decent effort to give some background information. It is also pretty clear why some of the people involved in the book have a hard time being open to new ideas. However, if you do like this book, you should read the sequels (both published). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the illustrations.   It is funny and creative and easy to read!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Good idea and a nice write-up. I am very interested in the subject of self-control and it's a shame we don't teach kids about it in school."
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great story, very well put together with lots of pictures.    Highly recommend.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a student of English Literature, and this book is great at explaining the different literary styles and techniques.  I don't think anyone has ever explained this in such a way to begin with, and in fact the book does this in a rather simplistic way.  However, the book takes you through the basics, how to write for literary devices, and the various types of characters and characters in novels.   The book is good at explaining different literary methods and is very easy to read.  This is great for those that have never really learned how to use various genres of literature in their writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is really a great book with a lot of interesting and important content. There are many other books out there, but you don't find as much depth in all of them, as well as the variety. In fact, you feel you're getting more information by taking a book with little to no originality that is not particularly well researched. However, it's an amazing journey! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent and well-written history, one that tells the truth about how a modern state was built.   I found the first few chapters confusing. I didn't understand the first half of the book. But once the second half hits, everything comes together.  The author does not shy away from the darker side of history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like a good old fashioned read, like this one.   It's got the same feeling as my early Harry Potter books, but it's a lot better.  It makes me remember a great part of my childhood.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had heard nothing about this book but heard that it was really good, so I decided to read it. I am so glad that I did. It's not a book on what the author would like you to do, but instead on what it takes to accomplish the things that one wants to do (in my case it's making money through freelance writing). The book starts with a quote that makes me want to start writing. "If you are passionate about something, you have to give yourself permission to be passionate about it. If you are not passionate about your work, then you cannot give yourself the permission to really give it your all, and you will never get very far. If you give yourself all of your maximum energy, and it doesn't work, you don't have it. That's how I get through any work."   This book is a huge improvement over my last book, which is a very typical book on how to become a freelance writer with a lot of practical advice.   For example, in my last work I didn't understand that the people who are hired for jobs as freelancers (not as writers) should have an expectation that they will be paid. I had a feeling that when I hired someone I would be expected to get paid, but I didn' t realize that I had this expectation as a freelancer. This is something that I didn't understand when I was first starting to freelance, but now that I do, I am glad I did, because my freelance clients were always very supportive of this expectation and of me giving it my all. I also like the fact that it provides information and examples of successful freelancers.  In fact, when I decided that I wanted to write this book I knew that I wouldn't be able to learn anything from any other book, so when I found this one I thought it was going to be very helpful.  This is an excellent book to read for people who would like to try to get into freelancing, but who are unsure whether they should, or even if they can.  The book is short and easy to read, and I think anyone can read it and benefit.   Overall I gave this book 5 stars because I liked reading it, but because of the price and because I think the examples from successful freelancer that he uses really do show what a good freelancer should do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, entertaining and informative book.   In the same way as the first book, this one takes the concept of the 'human animal' and presents it in a more humanistic manner.  This approach, which focuses on human-centric aspects of animals, can be found in some of the other books that were recommended to me by a few friends.  One could probably even add the book to their library of 'animal related books'.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author was able to create a unique perspective, an insight, that will help any student of psychology, and has clearly put a lot of thought into what she has to say. She manages to create the impression that she is truly passionate about the subject and her message will really stick.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am always interested to learn about the subject matter of the books I read and this one, which I have read three times now, is a fantastic book. The subject matter is not only intriguing, but the depth and breadth of the information in the book is very impressive.   This is a book that you will never be bored, because every chapter is packed with new information and never becomes boring because of the amount of information and the amount to keep up with. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was just so relieved when my sister gave this book to me.   It's wonderful   to have the opportunity to read something written in this style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child who lived in the city during the war, this book made me realize that our history is intertwined with other people's histories, and that the present generation must not forget our war history as it continues the struggle for peace.   I agree that the books that focus on the Jews are very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely LOVE this book!  The book is not only a wonderful read, but it is a great resource.  The writing is great and it really gets to the heart of what is important to you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book should be required reading for every historian and every student in American history. While the story is based on a couple of fairly recent newspapers, the book provides a wealth of primary sources. I have studied various sources of the period (i.e., the "Great Writings" of William Faulkner, T.S. Eliot, D.H. Lawrence, etc.), and while I appreciate these, I find the sources here a lot more detailed and comprehensive. The historical accuracy of the information is remarkable. The authors go beyond historical sources, giving examples of the kind of contemporary information that the newspapers would have reported. In addition to a very readable narrative, there are plenty of interesting historical insights. (hide spoiler)
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so happy with my Kindle! I purchased this to add an e-reader to my Kindle and it is the best. No more paper copies, the interface is awesome. Love the fact I can scan through the pages and print them if needed.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is well written and easy to follow. The author does a good job of giving a brief history of the development of the atomic bomb and how it was developed. There is also an overview of the process of atomic energy development from the Manhattan Project and its impact on the American economy. The book does have one drawback that might make it less than perfect for some, but I did not encounter that problem.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very disappointed that the book did not explain enough about the theory of evolution to be able to appreciate how difficult it is to understand, so I ended up spending a lot of time trying to understand the details.   However, my kids really enjoyed this book, and I'm glad that I took the time to teach them the concepts in the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a classic on the topic of the "Catch 22" dilemma.  The story is well written and the subject is relevant and interesting.  It makes for a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent book that can give you a new perspective on human nature and the meaning of life. The only thing I wished was more than this was a chapter on how to be a successful, happy, fulfilled, fulfilled human being. If you want to know more about how to deal with depression, you may want to read this book as it would help you figure out how to better deal with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite part of this book was the idea that a very powerful person who had a great influence on me and on my parents has the same flaws that everyone else has. I am so happy to know that I'm not alone, and to know this person has a secret - that if you are a person of great power and influence, you can be just as bad as everyone else.   I'm a very emotional person, so I can relate to the feelings that this book created in me. The book is written from the point of view of a man who has been a very prominent leader of his church, and how this has affected his children.  I think it's great that the author takes his own experience and looks at it through other people's eyes, so the story can be seen from different perspectives, which is nice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book a long time ago, when I was in the middle of an extremely bad breakup and looking for some distraction. After a few days of trying to distract myself from being angry and sad, I found this book. I was so happy I was able to finish it on time. In addition to the helpful advice on how to make it through any situation, this book was a good, funny read. It's a good reminder to be kind, even when you are mad.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I'm an academic, but it's good to have another opinion.  I also thought the book was well written. The book has some bad aspects, but a good deal of good, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 5 years ago and was blown away. It took me on a journey that I am only just beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite book on the whole wide earth! I find it fascinating and enlightening.    I am an American soldier in a foreign country who is a convert to Islam.  This book was a huge help to me in my new faith.  I enjoyed it very much.  I don't usually read military history but this book really interested me. It gives an interesting overview of the Islamic religion as it evolved over the centuries. I can't say enough good things about this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book and I am so glad that I did.   The story and characters are great!   There is a lot of violence and death.  But, I don't mind it and it is very realistic.  Also, I really enjoyed the way the author describes people's problems (they have issues they need to overcome) with great description.  If you like science fiction, the book is for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my younger years my mother always told me "there are two types of people in the world:  those who don't like to read and those who do.   One of the best things about reading is that you learn things from people who don 't like to Read.  " Well, I have come to realize that this is just common sense and I can now say that my mother was absolutely correct.  I recommend this book to everyone who likes to read, young or old, and has time to do so. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading this book, I'm more comfortable speaking to men about their feelings. I have noticed that the men I talk to a lot don't have any idea how to talk to women about their emotions.  I am a male and sometimes my feelings and emotions are pretty hard to talk about. I feel like when I'm on a date, it's very awkward to talk because men are afraid of offending someone they have just met.   So, I am glad I found this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very excited to read this book.   The plot is really well written, the characters are well written and the world building is fantastic.  This story is set in a fantasy world called Vildr, and the main protagonist is a young girl called Aliana.  It's set in the same world as the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson, but you don't have to have read either of those books to enjoy this.  Also, this book is a fantasy that's not bogged down with the mundanity of the mundane world, like so many other fantasy books.  If you liked the Mistbends, then I'd say this is a must read, if not, I'd recommend reading the Mistbirths first.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really impressed with this book. It covers a topic that I wanted to know more about, but never got around to. I found it interesting and interesting, and it may even be useful for some people who are contemplating starting an open source project. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was an excellent read for me.   This book really helped me develop my own perspective on my work in a way that was new to me. I will read more books of this nature and they really help one gain an even deeper appreciation for what they are reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this one and it definitely will be in my reading list for a long time to come. I loved this book because it is well written and well researched. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! It does not leave me completely satisfied. It would be better if the author were a little more explicit about the problems that her characters have in this book. But, at the same time, the story is compelling and well told.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The one time I read this book, I was reading the second half as the first half was over. The first half (The Secret Life of Bees) was a bit too hard to follow. The author did a good job of breaking it up into a series of smaller articles, which seemed to work quite well. This book is worth your time. It is well written, clear, and quite funny. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It helped me to understand the problem of rape in ancient Greece and Rome.   It is a short and clear text.  I learned a lot from this book and  have a different view on the subject of rape.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book so far.   I really enjoyed this book and I would like to have more of it in my life.  This book is funny and a bit serious at the same time.  It takes you to places you wouldn't normally go to and makes you think.  I have taken a class on a subject related to this book but never picked it up because of the length and this book is so good I wanted to pick it up so much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased the book to use on my son as he is in his 3rd grade class now and I was able to read it to him without any problems. I love to read to my sons, they really enjoy it and I feel like they have the same enjoyment I had reading it.   It is a good easy read and will definitely be reading this in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I got to spend the afternoon reading this book about the life of the world's most famous author.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read in all respects   By far the best book I have read on the subject of modern politics.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was written to teach someone about a very difficult skill, but it works and is easy to understand.   It also gives a good insight about other areas that I need to focus on.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been following the blog of Mr. Sutter for a couple of months now and he always writes about books which are good. This book is no exception, but the best thing about this book is that it tells you about the science behind what you have read.   Mr.Sutter wrote a really good book about how different foods affect blood sugar control, and the nutrition information is written in such a way that people will understand what they are reading and how to get the most out of what they eat.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I did not know that these two were related until my friend suggested it to me. It has many interesting ideas but some of the parts that struck me as the most interesting were the cultural differences, the relationship of male and female, the ways in which the modern world is changing the concept of love, and the different ways of knowing the Divine.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A well written book that was well organized and informative and was well paced for both kids and adults. I have now read a lot of children's books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a couple of books on this topic. The last one that came close to getting the grade I felt was " The Great War: A History of World War I ", although it was a bit less comprehensive. While I did not like " The Last Days of the Roman Empire ", I did like " History of Ancient Rome ", it had a more complete set of sources and a clearer presentation.   Overall, if you are looking for something new, and this one looks interesting, I would recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's very easy to read and it gets you up to speed on what's going on in the world of food science and nutrition.   The book is written in a way that is very simple and understandable, so that's the first plus point.  However, there are some problems with the book.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more analysis from the author, not just a summary.  A lot of the research in the book is very hard to understand, because most of the results are reported with a lot of numbers.  This might be more understandable if they were presented in a more readable format.  Also, I found the book a bit frustrating because it feels like a lot is missing.  The author seems to have focused mainly on what I'd call the "good stuff" (the "bad stuff" is buried deeper down in the text), whereas most of what I would consider good stuff is missing altogether.  If someone is serious about studying food science, they'll have to read this book in one sitting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never seen a book like this before. It is fascinating to learn about these fascinating ancient peoples.   The writing style is excellent.  I think I will get the Kindle version for my library.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The author, Dr. J. Andrew McCullough, has an excellent book that provides useful information for families with children with autism. Dr. McCullough's work has provided me with valuable information on the benefits of treating Autism.   Although it is possible that I am wrong about many aspects of autism, I am pretty confident that this book is correct on one thing and one thing only: Autism is not a disease and it does not need to be treated as such.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not perfect. But I feel it is the best book on my shelf.   I think there are a few things that could be improved, such as an index. But for the most part this book is superb.  I found it very interesting and helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little surprised with how well this book turned out.   It's not your standard romance, it is more like a love story, as far as I can tell.  I liked that it was written from the female point of view, which was nice.  Overall, I liked this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book interesting because it deals with the very difficult subjects of the human psyche. Although I am not an expert, I have read a good bit about this area of psychology. I enjoyed the book a great deal, and I intend to make it a standard reading for my Psychology Textbooks class. Highly recommended!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   In addition to having great characters, great writing, and an interesting premise, the plot moves along at a good pace with no hiccups.  This book is an interesting mix of classic and contemporary.   As always, I loved the characters.  From the main character, who can't stand the idea of her ex and his friends having the same name as the ex, to her younger brother, who tries to live a normal life while his mother and sister are going through a divorce.  In fact, this book was so good, I had to pick up the sequel, and I was thrilled. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun and enjoyable read.   It took a few re-reads to get the ending just right, but I found that it was a very satisfying story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book on how to create a professional and a positive working environment. I always tell my clients to "get into the head" of someone you want to work with, and this book does that really well. It's also a great way to avoid being caught by surprise when you meet someone.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book very interesting and well researched. It has some errors, but that is to be expected when you have only an abridged transcript and only a few people have seen the original documents. It is well written and easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been useful for my own understanding of what makes a good leader. It is clear, concise, and is extremely useful.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic book.   This is the first in a series of books.  I am looking forward to each of them and will be reading them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book for my birthday. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, but when it came to this book, it was one of the few times I found myself getting annoyed at Harry (the man is an idiot sometimes), but then, the good writing and plot kept me engaged.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The plot, the writing, the character development, the ideas of the book, are excellent. In fact, the main character is the most interesting one I have ever read in a sci-fi series. I have read the other books in the series, and they are also excellent, but the character of the main one, the android, makes me want to read the rest of the books even more than in the first book.

But it's also quite funny (and well-written)   So if you're into math puzzles, puzzles, and logic puzzles,   it's a lot of fun   It's also not that easy, and if you like logic puzzles and puzzles   then you'll definitely like this one"
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so sorry but I will not be buying another book from Dr. Farr this year. This book is nothing but BS. I took the time to read a little more before I purchased this book and it makes me realize that Dr. Farrah Farr is no longer a credible doctor. The way she talks about how to take her medications and how to be more of a good patient is the opposite of what I believe a physician should do. This is not an excuse, I want to get to the good part of her book, but I have already had to pull out my books on cancer from my shelf. I hope she has better things to write about.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book on the subject I've read and was thoroughly entertained.  I like the style of the author, and it's not just about a few simple exercises that will get you results. The author does a great job showing what you can achieve if you are disciplined.    I highly recommend this book and plan on purchasing the paperback when it's available. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book while on break from a summer job and it was great! This book was written by someone who is actually a psychologist, so it's actually more of a psychological book. It discusses many aspects of how you develop a mind. It's interesting because in real life it seems like people have to constantly think in terms of their minds. When you think about it, people are so busy with their heads that we rarely really think in the moment. What's more, this book really showed me that there's much more to being a mind than thinking in abstract terms. It also showed me just how much we can change if we can only really focus on something for a couple of hours.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book over a weekend, because it was on the back of the free Kindle for the Kindle Fire. I have to say I was surprised at how well the book went over the weekend. I really liked the book and the overall plot was engaging.   The main characters (who I won't name because the plot's a little too personal for me) are very likable, and that's an important part of this genre (my friend who loved the Hunger Games said it had an "awkward, slightly mopey, slightly creepy charm").   Although there are some plot twists, the overall story of the book was a very well written one, and I would definitely recommend this book to people who like dark fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a substitute for the usual history textbook and I liked it.   It is a clear presentation and a good overview of the history of the Jewish population in Europe.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book I read because I needed a few hours to go over what was in the bookshelf with my husband. The book is not as easy to read as some others, but it's worth reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would rate this one of the best fantasy books I've ever read.   It was written to make the reader think and I was very impressed with the use of both metaphor and language, both with regards to language and themes of religion, and I would highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    " This book is a treasure.   It is a quick read and very good to the point.  I can see why it is on the top of my list of best mystery books   and I know it will be the one to end all other mysteries.  Thanks,   The Great Gatsby. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first experience with this book was very interesting to me. I have always found writing to be an enjoyable and stimulating activity. I am a fan of historical fantasy, and I had a desire to try to find some of the literary influences that had influenced Tolkien. While I certainly couldn't point to Tolkien's books as being a major inspiration, I was able to enjoy some of his ideas. Although the book isn't as good as some of Tolkien's works (and I had only read one of his books, The Hobbit ), I found this to be well written and thought-provoking.   I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want to read a well written, interesting story, look no further. The author uses a lot of common sense and some great metaphors and is very descriptive in the details, but doesn't go too crazy with his imagery. He has a great plot and a great beginning.   The author has a lot to say and the end product is a nice little book that is easy to read, but I recommend the first book because the second one goes into the same details as the first but is more on the realistic side and will appeal to more readers.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a way to learn a bit about "why" a lot of things occur in our lives. It's a very well written, if somewhat academic work about "how" things have always occurred, and how they will continue to occur, as well as "how we can control them."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is brilliant and the theory is sound. It covers the basics but is well written and easy to follow.   It is great for a newbie like me and the author has really helped me understand the concepts.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book.   I'm not a scientist, but I have some understanding of how the world works.  It is interesting how all science comes from some sort of experiment.  This book was a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book to read for my daughter. She is 12 and has been a reader her whole life, but we never found a book that was suitable for her. This book is very funny, and it's well written.   This is a good family book, and the chapters are short enough so that they don't become boring. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently purchased the paperback edition of The Good Fight, which is the second book in the trilogy (after  Rise of the Republic  ).   This series is about what happened when the Republic was at its weakest, so there's a lot of backstory here, but there are also plenty of new characters and new planets.   The characters are well developed, and are good for a quick read.  The plot is solid, and the new planets are interesting.  I have not yet finished the previous two books, but I plan to.  This has been a good series, and it's a nice reminder that in the Star Wars universe, things aren't always what they seem.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a bit put off by this book at first, but I think I found something for me in it. I have always enjoyed the world building in books, but this is the first book to really hit on the feel of my world. I liked how it did this in such a subtle way, the way the author had her characters talk and interact with each other. I find this to be a huge strength of the worldbuilding, so I was hoping for some good magic in it, but that was not the case.   Overall, it was a fun read, and I found it really enjoyable, even if the plot didn't work for me. I'm definitely going to give it another shot if I ever run into another world building book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after the "Mortal Combat" film came out.   If you have a good imagination, then this book can be very enjoyable, even if the story is not as interesting as that movie.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book on a whim. I was just getting back into fantasy, and I really enjoyed this story. The world building was a good thing, as was the writing, and the characters were very likable. I would recommend it. I think it was well-written enough to get past the fact that the plot is a bit of a mystery.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The books I have bought in the last year or so have been of the good quality. The best part of the book is the bibliography that it contains.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. It's an interesting read on the philosophy of time. The author uses philosophical arguments to argue for his own personal opinions on the topic of the nature of time and time travel. It was fun to read and was definitely engaging.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child of the '60s, and the '70s and the early '80s, I could not have asked for a better introduction to the Beatles' music and the Beatles themselves. It really is an essential book. My only regret is that it didn't come out earlier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read through this book and it's a great resource for beginners in any kind of music.   The book has a lot of great information to get you started and keep you there as you learn the intricacies of all styles.

There's a lot of humor in this book and the author knows how to work in a childrens book for the readers.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most thorough, well-written, and easily accessible source on the history of the "Dixiecrats" for the average person.  This book has everything you want to know about the history and politics of Dixiecratism: the major battles, the leaders, the players, the history, and even the party lines.  All of this is presented in an easy-to-read, clear-to the point style that will enable you to easily understand everything.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to become familiar with the history behind the modern political party that is still "a thing".  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this book was wonderful, and I liked the fact that it was written by a woman, though it was also a very positive book.   "Why is it that we are so prone to believing what we want to hear, rather than examining things for ourselves?"   This is one of those books that makes you wonder, "Why am I even reading this, or even thinking about it, if I'm not interested?   It's a bit like reading the first two Harry Potter books, but less magical.  In fact, some of the details of the book felt a little off.  My favourite character, as a Harry Potter fan, was Hermione Granger.  However, it seemed that she had some sort of character flaw, like Hermione's "love interest" Ron Weasley.  The relationship between the two boys was the most interesting part of the books for me.  It seems like Harry is going to have some growing up to do with his mother and his father.  That said, this series was one of my favourite Harry Potter reads until the end.  If you love fantasy, or a series that has a female protagonist, then I think you might enjoy this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of this book. I've read a few other books about this subject and this is the most complete and well-researched book I have read about it. It provides a good understanding of what is going on in the medical establishment, the politics surrounding it and the people who are actually doing the work. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a physician, is interested in medicine or has any connection with the medical system.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A funny book, great story. The characters were different enough to be believable but had their own quirks, and the world the author put together was believable and fun.   I loved all the little details and surprises in the plot.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book so much, it's the best one I've read in a while and i haven't stopped reading since. It was a fast read, filled with good ideas, good examples and great advice.    My parents recently had a small child and since I'd only seen one book about birth before, i was really anxious about what I should read, but when this book was recommended to me I couldn't resist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very disappointed in the "Book of Numbers" by Gary Stuemke and John F. Fusco. The writing was bad, the prose clumsy, and the conclusions questionable. In spite of that, I found the subject matter of the book fascinating and the arguments in favour of a strong American government worth considering. It would be interesting to see what Stuenke, Fuscom, and others could do to improve their writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had really high hopes for this book. A lot of people who love the show liked it, but they just did not get it. I liked it. It was easy to follow, easy to remember the characters and their motivations, and I loved all the little scenes. If you love the TV show then you should buy this book and see if it works for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was excellent.   From start to finish it was fascinating and quite interesting. I enjoyed the story and the book.  My only nitpick was the author does not use the "t" or "th" in "tourist" or the "s" in tourist, but I have heard the "thriller" version uses it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is no better read about the impact of time on human society than this excellent book. It covers a lot of very important issues. If you read it, you will realize that our society has changed very little from the way it was in the 1950s and 1960s.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a really good example of why one should never judge a book by its cover.    My favorite part of the book was when I finally read the "real" title, which was The Last Generation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good! I like the variety of the stories and the author's sense of humor.   There is a story at the end about a dog in the house that is so funny!   It's a good, clean book, and it makes me feel better about my own dog and the fact that I can take care of him without him having to watch over me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.   It is one of the best non-fiction books I've read in a while.  The people in the book were amazingly kind and the story is well told.  I love the way the author uses humor to lighten up the hard truths that they discuss. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The reason for this is that I love the story of this book - a young boy, a woman, and an older man (no, really - he is a wise old man and she is a beautiful young girl) - and I think this is a story well worth hearing (at least as I heard it).   I also liked the humor that this book shows, but that is what a book can be called. I found that this was a book that I wanted to read, but had a hard time finding time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was reading this book when it first came out and I loved it. However, I found myself forgetting all of the information that the author wrote. This was no mistake; this was intentional. When I got to the book's conclusions, I was completely shocked.   The book concludes that the average IQ of a country is about 100.  I found this to be a bit shocking.  For one, I have seen people as bright as this at work in the fields of mathematics and physics. It may be that the authors didn't want to offend the "gullible" with such a statement. Second, why does everyone assume that a country's IQ is 100? Are they talking about just men? How is a man supposed to know that his country's intelligence is 100 when men have much more variation in their IQs? Does anyone think that the IQ is about the same in every country on the planet? This doesn't sound very scientific and it may be a little insulting to those people that are in that 80-100 range. Third, I feel like this author didn't go far enough. The book states that the "IQ gap" is closing. I personally feel like a lot of this "gaps" could be due to social reasons, and that it doesn't make sense to blame society for anything. Fourth, it doesn;t seem that this gap is closing much either. The correlation between national IQ and life expectancy is still poor.  Fifth, is it possible that some of these countries just weren't that well educated?  I understand that the book goes into more depth on these topics, and I'm all for more information on a subject, but some of the topics could have been avoided altogether if the author just stated what he believes the real IQ gap is and the importance of education for it, instead of simply stating that IQ is low for some countries and not for others.  7 of 8 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   The world is full of dark, bleak things.   But when I read this, it was like the sun had been brought back to my life.  The story was gripping, though I found it difficult to follow and some of the characters seemed unbelievable.  But if you are looking for a good tale of darkness and intrigue, you can't go wrong.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to say this is my favourite book ever   The writing is excellent, the characters have real depth and are believable, the plot is well thought out, and the setting is extremely evocative.   (You get the impression that it was inspired by a very good book.  I would give it a 9/10 but the author was kind enough to take the blame for a few errors.  Sorry )
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I liked how there was no single, universal way to think about God, or to be a Christian.   The first half of the book is a compilation of various thinkers and historians talking about the nature of God, and the second half deals with some of the different views of God from the early Church.  I'm not sure I understood all the things the various people said, but the end of the first half is a helpful guide, if you want to get an understanding of what the views of other people in the early church were.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, it's a very nice book to read.   The author's ideas about the spiritual journey are very much in line with the principles of spiritual realization, which is an essential part of any spiritual path.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. I really liked the idea of using a child in a way that allows for them to express themselves.   For me, the way I found it was pretty easy to find the different ways I could connect with a little boy.  I love that there are two different perspectives. I was able to really find out what a boy was feeling as he was trying to figure out why people didn't want to play with him.  In this book, there's a lot of learning and growth, and it really brought my daughter and I together and really brought us closer.  I'm not sure what's more important, the fact that this book is written for little boys (or girls) or the fact of the author's ability to write such an amazing book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child I loved this book. It was funny and clever, and I loved reading it. This is one of the first books I have read by Robert Louis Stevenson. I was not disappointed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book as a companion to the more serious and academic treatment of " The Mismeasure of Man " by Steven Pinker.   The chapters are similar in content, but the author deviates from the book by using a different methodology for his analysis and, more importantly, he presents the facts as they are.  The chapter on "The Myth of Race" is very strong, though the book as whole suffers from what I feel is a failure to make its arguments comprehensible and well-supported.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book and it really got into the spirit of the holidays. It is really simple and has no complex explanations of complicated concepts.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and recommend it to everyone, especially those who are curious about how to get a tattoo.   This book talks about the different parts and different techniques involved in tattooing and how to have the best success in the area.  I am also a little scared to get the tattoo but luckily, I found this book to be a very helpful guide.  The only issue I have with this book is that the author goes over all the parts before actually getting started with a tattoo and she makes things pretty complicated so I feel like I got a better value from getting it on the book then getting it done.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a copy of this book in my collection.   There are a few parts that are a little confusing.  The first part is about the importance of having a strong sense of personal responsibility and integrity.  This may sound obvious but it is not for most people.  And the author takes advantage of this.  It is also confusing for people who want to take a different path. The second part is a lot more simple.  If you don't have your own car, the car you are using is garbage.  I get a lot of crap about this from people who think they can fix my car.  However, if I really want a vehicle I can afford to fix, I will pay for it.  That's the attitude I have been trying to have for many years.  But the good part is I don't need a lot for a vehicle.  You should really read this book because it helps you get that car.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book about the history of witchcraft ever written!  The history of magical belief in the 19th and early 20th centuries is a complex, fascinating and at times maddening topic that is filled with incredible complexity, contradictions and bizarre twists.   Berthe's book is a tour de force.  She presents an extremely well-researched and well-written study that not only gives you a clear picture of the history but also of the rise of the British witch trials which is a subject I have long been interested in.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've loved this book and I've enjoyed it for many reasons, one of which is the story. It's an enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys classic children's books. It tells the story of the life of a very strange little girl who lives in a strange castle and has a dog, a cat and two ducks. If you are a fan of fairy tales and the storybook like characters and the characters from this story book you will love this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't really know why I gave this book 3 stars, but I couldn't really give it 5.   If I had a problem with it, it was that the book was a bit too long.  In the end, I got pretty much the whole story, but it would have been much more enjoyable if I had seen it in one go. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this a long time ago and have found it to be a very thorough book on a controversial subject. It is an important book and an important read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very useful book about the history of the German war machine. It is a very well written book with a few chapters that need to be added to the standard text on the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has made a profound impression on me. I have long believed that all of the important scientific findings are found in religion and spirituality, and these discoveries are often obscured by humanism. A number of the best scientists in the field of science have written about their spiritual beliefs. However, until now, no book had been written about religion and science.   What has been revealed to me is that the science of religion is a living, evolving science, constantly trying to find its place in the larger world of science. The science of spirituality is much older, and much more powerful. As a scientist I have a very strong sense of personal continuity with all the generations of scientists who have preceded me, and I can see the potential of their legacy in the evolution of science itself. In addition, I have discovered that science is not limited to the understanding of the physical universe; that our understanding of consciousness, meaning and the nature of reality is an integral part of the scientific revolution. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in religion, science, and spirituality.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   As a sci fi fan, I love the idea of a universe where our technology is more advanced than ours, but the technology is hidden.  This is such an appealing idea.  The story is told in a very slow manner, and the characters are not complex.  For me, I like to see an action scene, so the characters aren't as interesting.  I think that it was very well written and I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book really helped me gain a new understanding about my sexual past.   It was a real eye opener for me as I have been in a very unhealthy sexual relationship. I found this book to be a really good read, I would highly recommend it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The concept of the "toy" and the "adventure" was brilliantly brought to life, using the magic of color and illustration to tell a story that has some depth.   It's got lots of humor, but it doesn't take itself seriously and is worth every minute. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really surprised by how well this book covered what the author was saying.  I am a first year in nursing school and this book gave me a good idea of what to expect on the nursing job and how to handle things if things go wrong.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very pleased with this book.   It was a lot of fun to read.    I also found myself re-reading a few lines a few times throughout. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's not as easy as you would think to put a good review on a bad book.   The story isn't really new, but it's entertaining and I am surprised at how much I liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book about a real life murder case. The author has a wonderful way of giving the reader insight into the minds of the murderers, a way that the real life cases do not do. It is hard to write a realistic and believable review of a book about murder, but that is exactly what the author does here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's really good, and has really great information.   This has really made me think about how to be more mindful.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this book was a little dry. I'm a firm believer that reading a book is a lot like having a cup of coffee, the more you have of it, the less you care about the ingredients. If a book has too little, you just get a lot of words and not the story you want.   This one is dry as well as just plain not good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    For some reason, I don't quite understand, but I have to agree with the author. This book is a real gem. The book, and the author, are a complete package. You can see how these two people have had some experience with a variety of projects, and both have found that their passion for something drives them, and can be a very rewarding and satisfying hobby.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had a few good books in my time, but I can never really get behind the ones that I feel didn't achieve what they were supposed to (such as the excellent Dark Angel series). This was the book that I finally read and loved.   It is an excellent introduction to some interesting characters and interesting concepts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this for my 7th grade science class and it was a real time saver!   It's a real eye opener for all the kids that have been told in school that the world is flat.   They don't even know it, but they will soon find out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  The author takes the subject of the Holocaust very seriously, but does it in a way that makes it readable and understandable.  He is able to portray the human side of the Nazi's while also showing that even the Nazis were not completely bad people.  This book is a bit more dry and factual than others I have read about the Holocaust.  But there are many good things about this book and it certainly did not disappoint. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's very helpful in that it has a lot of good advice for the newbies. The book is in the spirit of 'How to be a Man (and a Geek)' (by the same author), which is a very good series (as in, "it was written by a smart dude, and he knows his stuff"), and that book is good too. So it's like a combination of both! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great.   It's one of the best examples of the modern day zombie apocalypse.  It has it all- you've got a lot of the science that works, a lot that doesn't, and a lot with a lot to think about, which makes for a fast read.  If you're looking for a good science book that's written in the   way you want it to be written, this is the book.  (I also like the fact that it doesn't cover much of the actual science.)
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is full of valuable information on the subject of suicide. I had always assumed that the cause of suicide was due to a bad relationship or loss of a job. My wife and I had been married for 9 years and had been very happy together until she had a heart attack 2 years ago.  The books "The Death of Innocence" and "The Gift of Fear" (both of which are on the list) gave me a lot of information about suicide and how to deal with it.   I have found the books on my own and have been able to learn the hard way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad that after all this time and effort I was finally able to read this book.   In all honesty I was afraid it was going to be too heavy handed.  But it actually was!  But, that's ok!   This is a great book to read while waiting for your kids to get home from school.  In a nutshell, the main story is simple enough, with a very engaging villain, a happy ending that is still very bittersweet, and a fun and easy to read narrative.  My only issue is how the kids, who are old enough now to read, couldn't help but fall asleep a couple of times.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very good. The author is very interesting and I found his methods very simple and practical.  One of the best books on the subject of mental training that I've found.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book with my 8-year-old son. It's very detailed, informative and thought provoking. We've used it as a learning tool, so that's great!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am looking for a book to read in the fall that takes on the question of a religious worldview and the implications of those worldviews for our secular culture. This book is exactly that, and it is a very good read.   For those who don't know, David Fitzgerald is a professor of psychology at Harvard, one of the world's leading experts on religious, religious education, and even religious attitudes and practices.  He is known to be one of a very small number of psychologists who are free of religious beliefs and practices, and he makes clear that he does not do so because of his religious beliefs, but rather because he is an academic who believes in science, reason, and critical thinking.  This book provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of religious ideologies on education, economics, science, politics, culture, and government.  One of the most interesting elements to the book is the fact that the authors discuss the importance of a school system which is explicitly neutral to all religions and provides an inclusive environment for students.  If you are looking for an interesting and insightful look into religious education in America, you will enjoy this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite historical books is the one about the War of 1812. I found it fascinating and enjoyable. I learned a lot from it, and I believe I am going to find this book in my history bookshelf.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The stories in this book were so fresh and new, I knew I had to try them out.      They are definitely the new kid on the block. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The new book by Dr. Michael Gerson on the future of the American republic   is a must-read   for all serious American conservatives.   Dr. Gerson has been a respected historian and political commentator for many years and is well-informed on issues including the Constitution, federalism, the military, and civil liberties.  The book covers the Constitution as a whole and focuses on its historical impact on the American polity.  In discussing the issues that would have shaped America's republic, Dr. Glaude comes to the conclusion that one of the two major candidates in this year's election, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, is "almost certain" to be a good president   if he or she can maintain and strengthen the commitments made during the first 100 days of the Trump administration.  This is a thoughtful, informative book that is well worth the read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It's good for getting your hair up and the feeling of being a man! "
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It is very clear and concise. My daughter and I both had fun reading it. It does a good job of getting people to think and discuss and analyze the evidence. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book, but the actual experience was very disjointed.  My friend who has an MM also has a MM and she told me that she had the same issues.  It was nice that she told it to me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent introduction to what is known as a "complex system" in mathematics. It is a wonderful introduction to the subject, covering a very wide range of mathematical topics and techniques, including both polynomials and rational functions, as well as linear, conic, exponential, and logarithmic functions. It covers all the main aspects of complex analysis: functions, limits, integrals, graphs, and systems of equations. The book is short and well-organized, giving the reader a lot of examples and exercises. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in complex analysis.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just read "Elegant Loom", and I'm in love with it!  The writing is brilliant and the plot is so exciting!   The only thing I wish was more is an ending!  I was left with a lot of unanswered questions, and some more questions to be answered (and yes, I'm really hoping this book has more endings).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good and good-sized book. I found that it took a good deal of effort to get through it and that, in fact, there is very little new information. It may be difficult to get a handle on most of the topics presented here, so that would be good to know before going to the effort to read this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to read "The Devil in the White City" since I heard of it.  This is one of the better reads I've had recently.  It starts out with an interesting premise and a story that is a bit hard to get into but once you do you're hooked.  The characters are interesting, the prose is good and the story isn't as clichéd as other works of this genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is extremely well written and I'm so grateful to be able to learn about the human rights issues raised in it.   The authors do an excellent job showing the difficulties that the state in Saudi Arabia has in enforcing the fatwas.  The story is told in a very well-written style, giving a very good overall impression of the situation in Saudi society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so happy with the book! It was so easy to follow and I was able to learn so many tips from it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My mother gave me this book when I was 14, after I told her I was going to read "To Kill a Mockingbird"  .   I read this book a lot before I got this one.   It's not the best MockingBird book   but it's the best book  I've ever read about Mockingbirds  
Write a positive review about a good book:    While this book is great for people who want to know what it's like to be a woman who is a doctor, if you don't know anything about women in medicine or biology or whatever it is you want to learn about, it's a lot of work to figure it out!   And by the time I figured it out, the book had worn off, and I've come back to it a couple times to review it, but it's still great as a primer for people interested in science or medicine!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book and a great introduction to the topic of cognitive behavioral therapy.   I am currently in treatment for panic disorder, depression, and social anxiety.  As an APT specialist, I am used to dealing with patients who are unable to change their thoughts or emotions, and I have found that I can apply the techniques in this book to these conditions too.  The book is short and easy to read, which is important in the treatment of anxiety disorders.  I highly recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. My son and I read it as a family.   There were some things about the story that were a little vague, but for the most part this book was really good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading "The Power of Intentional Deception" by Michael Shermer and the author's excellent book is a must read for anybody interested in psychology and behavior. This is a very interesting topic that deserves the attention it is getting. It is a good and well written book that is more of a philosophy that a scientific approach.  I am very interested in how our brain works and how we can use that information in our everyday lives. The Power of Intentions is a great place to start.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an interesting book that explores the different ways in which various animals have adapted to live in the different ecosystems on earth.   The author is a researcher who studies how animals have evolved over time to adapt to different environments, such as how whales have adapted and adapted to the ocean.  This book is a great read and I recommend it to all animal lovers.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife had been looking for some kind of reading activity for our kiddos, and this is the closest thing to one that they have found.   There are a number of different activities and they are designed to get kids excited about reading.  We started with the first book, and after each activity they loved reading and we got the next book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  The descriptions of the two girls were very well done and the story was very well thought out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book, as an adult, I found to be an excellent example of an excellent literary genre. I read it back in the early 70's on a whim (since I didn't care for any of the other books in the genre then). This was an excellent book that was well written, well presented, and well presented by the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is awesome. It covers the topic of "Marrying a Muslim" in a way that's easy to understand, and has lots of examples and anecdotes to help it along. It makes you want to know more, so you can try it out, but it also makes you think, so it leaves you with more questions than answers.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book on one of the biggest questions I have had since I have become a Buddhist. There are so many things to consider when we start or continue a meditative practice, but none of the considerations will ever be quite as compelling, satisfying, or inspiring as the insights from this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading The Death of Innocence by Sarah Waters. I loved this story and I had so much fun reading it. A great addition to the books on The Vampire Diaries.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book a long time ago on a whim.   When I finally got to the end, I found I was not disappointed.  The authors have provided some really good information about some very challenging subjects.  If you are interested in a great history, with a good mix of facts and opinion, this is the book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am now a very confident user of this and other ebooks as a first introduction to the subject.  This is a great guide to the basics and it has given me the confidence to take on other subjects that are interesting and require an understanding of how the brain works.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book after it first came out.   When it first arrived, I was confused because it doesn't seem very new. It was the exact book my brother gave me when I was younger and had never read or heard about it. I was just curious and wanted to read it.  It wasn't bad at all and there was an added bonus in the fact that the book has a lot of pictures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A beautiful work of history and a moving meditation on the importance of a love of country.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm in love with this book.   There is a lot of discussion in the first 3 chapters about what it means to be a Christian, what the Bible is about, and how God has changed the world for the better. I particularly liked the discussion about how the story of Jesus has changed through the ages, but not only for the Christians, but for everyone.  I've been looking forward to this book from the moment I heard about it and couldn't wait to start it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   When I saw this book, I had some doubts. I didn't think the book would be as good as it is. The cover was horrible. The back cover was a great idea but that one wasn't the case. The book was really good, so if it weren't for my reservations, I probably would have bought it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very engaging story and a must read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is well written and very informative.  The author is very knowledgeable about the subject matter of the book and she is quick to explain the concepts.  As for the writing style the author used very good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've already read this and will be giving it to my husband. I was nervous at first because I'm always on the hunt for an "I wish I had read this before" book but I'm so glad I found this. It's an interesting read and I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book that I really enjoyed. I had been wanting to read this for a long time but I kept putting it off because I couldn't find it anywhere. Now that I have read it, I will certainly be picking it up again.   A lot of people seem to want to be authors, but most of them never make it.  This book made it into the top 50. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this on my second day back to school and I enjoyed it. It's a very good introduction to how to play Magic in a casual/cooperative environment. I can't wait to see how the game will evolve over the years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a great read! I really enjoyed this book. The writing is fast and to the point. The characters are easy to like. I think I would like this book more if it was written in an American language. The story is good enough that I will finish this book in one reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was in the middle of an internship with a law firm. I was a little put off by the first half of the book, but that all changed when I finally read the second half. There were plenty of interesting information contained in the first parts of the work, but I was especially surprised to learn about the ways in which this book is so accurate.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  It's good if you like fantasy, but don't expect a lot of depth or a lot going on, because there isn't much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fascinating book that takes us behind the curtain and shows us the dark side of the intelligence community. I really enjoyed reading this book, particularly because it's in layman's terms, which is great for anyone who has a job that has to do with intelligence, or who is involved in politics. I think that a lot of people aren't aware of all of the behind-the-scenes machinations that go on. In many ways, this book provides an eye-opening experience for anyone interested in the "black budget" and its implications on America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not sure of how to start this book, but I found it a worthwhile read. I feel very good about myself for reading this book. I had read some reviews that claimed the author was a fraud and that he did not have a degree. I find it quite difficult to accept that.   He is an educated man and it was good to see he had done his research, including his own family background.  I can say that although it was a challenge to follow, I found the information interesting and interesting people make interesting books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book of Mormon is a great read and is well written.   I enjoyed it a lot!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the early stages of the book, it was a little bit dry. Not all of the points he was making seemed to be clear or the argument compelling. But as the book progressed, his points became more compelling. The ending is what you would expect.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's amazing how many people read this book and just find themselves in a different book! I'd say the author did an excellent job of making her stories believable. My only nitpick is that I think she made the writing a little bit too easy. It was so easy to like the characters, and it seemed like there was never any struggle to make their choices.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, especially because of all of the helpful tips, ideas, and insight in it. The writing is very clear, and the author doesn't gloss over the important stuff to help us make the best decisions. She also doesn't go off on tangents, which are just fine.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I can't recommend   Mimi Lee 's   A Girl's Guide to Feminism   very highly enough.   This is a must read for all those who want to be educated and educated about feminism and feminism issues in general.  In this collection of essays by female writers, the female perspective is present and the writing is strong and insightful.  I feel like it would be better if the book had been an anthology (but that's me).  This collection of short essays is a great introduction to feminism for all levels.  I'm not sure what Lee has to say about why it's important that women and girls have equal access to education or how her activism plays into it, but her essays are all really well written and thought provoking.  The main point I'm trying to make in my review is to remind readers that there are more and better feminists than just "a few white, middle-class, upper-class women". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is so much that I want to get to in this book--the wonderful, beautiful worldbuilding, the character studies, the wonderful science and magic system, the rich history and the fascinating magic system of ancient Egypt and ancient Greece.   And it is written so well.  I think this is one of the best fantasy novels I've read in recent years, and I've been reading for more than 50 years.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is like an old family album that I love. I know I am always getting excited about something that will be a part of my kids' lives, but this book definitely surpassed all my expectations. It's funny, it's educational, and I will be saving this for my son and daughter to read for a long, long time. The drawings are charming, and the stories were full of great words and good morals. I definitely recommend this book to everyone, and even if you're not a fan of children's books, you may find something that you think is hilarious in there.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so glad I finally got around to picking up this book.   It is a great read that provides a detailed look into the origins of Mormonism. I've always wondered why there is so much confusion about Mormonism and this book helps put the pieces together.  I really enjoyed reading about Joseph Smith and the Church as it is today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this on a whim a little while back, and I was absolutely amazed at how much it improved my reading experience. I'm not sure that I will ever go back to any of the other novels that I've read (I can't really read much or any fiction without a companion book, and this one just wasn't that), but I can't imagine reading any other book in a world this amazing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is good. It is full of interesting historical details and some excellent and intriguing information about the development of the US Postal Service. I got interested in postal history when I read about the Great Postal Strike of 1919.  This is the first book I have ever read about it.  There is also an interesting and interesting history of the postal service and how the strike occurred.  The only complaint is that it is a bit long.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful, detailed guide to the history and practice of yoga, with a variety of topics ranging from meditation to meditation and back.   I am a new student of yoga and I really wanted to become more knowledgeable and get started but this book definitely changed my life.  My boyfriend and I had been practicing yoga together for a while and I always felt like I had an incomplete understanding of how yoga is practiced.  The practice of all of the yoga teachers, especially the famous ones, is very detailed and all of them are very generous.  This guide makes it clear how this is done and shows what all of our different poses and poses, postures and postures, breathing exercises, etc, etc are for.  We both have been practicing for a long time so it was good to be able to see how these things fit together and how to do the specific practices we have been doing for years.  I really enjoyed this book  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a bit surprised to see how well the book turned out.  A few people on Facebook mentioned they thought the prose had a very "academic" tone.  I don't mind.  It was a nice mix of descriptive prose, but then he gets in to a few more "real world" examples of real science.   Overall, it was a good and very enjoyable read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book that I am going to recommend to all my friends who are into fantasy. My wife has recently joined this group and we have been going for a month now. We get to listen to people that are as enthusiastic about this genre as we are, and it's great. We both really enjoy the group, and its definitely a great way to introduce others to this wonderful genre. It's a must for people like us and other fantasy fans.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book several years ago and I liked it quite a bit, and I've just re-read it. I've had a few friends who don't like this book, but I like this one more.    If you like Harry Potter and love the humor, the action, the books about dragons and wizards, and the "magic" in the stories-- then go for it!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I got to experience this story as it was written by the author's actual child.  It was extremely good, and i didn't feel the need to wait for a sequel to read the next story because it was that good already. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a good idea who is behind this book. It's the author of an extremely popular fantasy series that has been translated into many different languages.   He seems to be doing his best to cash in on the success of these books and I applaud him for it.  In spite of the fact that the main character is an idiot, I was entertained at least.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book on building a good marriage by a writer of a good kind, i have bought the original edition of this book back in 2000, i read it twice back then and it made so much sense in terms of what you were doing at the time (i was married at that time) but you changed the whole style of the book so much i had to read it again,   the book is very informative and very clear in everything that it explains,  this is great for people who are trying to understand marriage as much as possible and  i really appreciate that you've made this book freely available to help others,  a must buy for anyone interested in finding the answers to their marriage problems.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea of a "normal" life with friends and family is something I wish I could have back. I've been away from them for a while now, and the more I travel, the more it's clear that life isn't normal.   I'm a bit of a loner, and my life was a lot more exciting and fun when I was away from home. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book to give it to my son who just turned 10 and I was not happy with the last book he got (which was really disappointing) but this book was a bit better.   The illustrations were really cool and my son really enjoyed this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My son gave this book to me as a Christmas gift. It is a very good read. I think this is one of the best book for those who are not so big into computers. It does not teach how to program but gives good example about programming. It's definitely not the best or only book but it will be useful to those who don't know much about computers.  - Michael
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are looking for a book to enhance your life, read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am new to all this ejuice stuff. I have been on e-cigs since I got the first kit from Vape Wild and I have finally tried some of the new flavorings out of RY4.   This is by far the best and cheapest E Juice on the market.  I use the RY6 as a daily vape but I like to mix it with other flavors to see if I like it better.  As I said, I am completely new to the whole vape scene.  It's not about the money, it's about the quality and what I can taste.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book provides good information. The writing style is professional and the examples and examples used in the text help to provide insight on the application.

He is one of the most intelligent, articulate, and witty people I know.       I can't wait to read more of his writing in the future.    I had the pleasure of reading his most recent book, the first one in a series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book contains interesting stories of people going about their daily life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The only reason this book wasn't 5 stars is because my review is short, so it could be better. But this book is a very, very good introduction to a lot of the things you need to know about running. This is my first book, and I've only been running for about 3 months (about a month before the last book), so I definitely have to review it more in depth. But I definitely think I'll go back and review this more once I've read the other books, because it's a good one that goes into a lot more detail.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book on the history of the French revolutionary struggle.   My favorite book on this subject, for sure.  I also very much enjoy The Revolutionary Road: The Life of Louis Blanc, a great work by E.H. Carr, which I also highly recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm thrilled to have discovered this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book about 10 years ago while in my junior year in college. The book has remained in my mind ever since.   The author, Dr. Richard A. Jaffe, had been trying to make a new generation aware of the value of the brain for creative thinking and problem solving.  He had started out by writing "Creativity: The New Science of Making, Not just Doing" and then went on to publish "Thinking, Fast and Slow".   When I first read this little book I knew this was a great idea.  It gave me a new appreciation for creative problem solving and a better understanding of the concept of creativity.  The book is very short, but packed with information and great advice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The best book I've read so far, as a historical and literary figure, but I want to reread this one and I'll definitely have a few other books to compare this to when I do." --Karen (June 10, 2006)
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is not your typical romantic comedy. You see that it's supposed to be funny, but then you realize it's not, and you see why it isn't. There are some genuinely funny moments, particularly around the middle, but the story is very, very flat.   It's a good read, but if you're looking for a romcom, there are much better ones out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so looking forward to reading this. I was really bummed that I didn't read it sooner, but I can't wait to finally read it. I'm sure the author has done some research before writing his books, but the book is still very entertaining and full of interesting information.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have now listened to The Art of The Lie (first novel) three times. I'm on the fourth, and the narration by Paul F. Tompkins is phenomenal. It's a very good read that doesn't require much explanation as to why it's one of the best novels I've ever read. T The Art of the Lie: An Investigation, 2nd Edition 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is the only book I have read that deals with the subject of sex. While it is true that there are more books written about this subject,   Sex is complex, it is not as simple as a simple answer like, "This book can help you get laid," but it does give insight into why this is the case and what to do about it.   This is one of the first books that I've ever had in my possession that not only touched on my own sexual difficulties, but also helped me understand the issues a girl would encounter on her journey from being a virgin to a successful, sexual woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. I had never heard of the work of Robert Heinlein before I read it, but the writing and story were very solid. I really liked that there was no clear line between the characters and the story. That is probably one of the more impressive aspects of this book - Heinlein creates characters that are completely believable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book about a great subject. I am now interested in how it relates to other areas of my life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A really well done and compelling story. My kids really enjoyed it. My husband and I laughed a lot and laughed quite a bit as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was recently able to see and learn a lot from this book.   It is well written, with a lot of information to learn.  I also liked the fact that it was all written from the perspective of a male's point of view.  It took a long time to get to where I wanted to be, but I think I made it. I will definitely recommend this book to my male friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best thing I have read all year!   If you're looking for a new kind of thriller, give this one a try! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was interested in this book from the beginning, but never quite managed to put it down.   The first three chapters give a nice overview of the subject of meditation, the various forms of meditation practiced, and the different styles of meditation. The second chapter is on different types of meditation practice.  The final chapter has a short discussion on how to apply the principles and exercises to your own life.  Highly recommended, especially if you're interested in exploring the practice of meditation or are considering the possibility of meditating for your wedding. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only negative thing about this book is that the narrator, Mark, is too nice. That's not too unusual in the audiobook world; some narrators have an inherent "nice guy" personality, but I was a little disappointed in the narrator. In a way, that bothered me, because I really like him as a narrator, but it kind of made me resent him for it, which is something I don't enjoy doing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a nice, simple and easy read.  I think I am now going to get to read the rest of the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book, the first in a series, over a month ago. It was excellent. I got the first two volumes when I was in high school. I bought a few others after that as well as all the other series he has written.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! It is so useful and so helpful! I recommend it highly. The illustrations are well done, but what the book does best is to show you the techniques. As a graphic designer/illustrator, I love learning the techniques to make my illustrations look good. And the methods in this book are easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good introduction to Buddhism.  This may be the first book that I have read that deals with Buddhism in the context of modern western thought and modern western culture.  It provides a good overview of what Buddhism is, what it is not, and why it's important.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at one of my favorite local bookstores. I love books that deal with the paranormal, so this book was a welcome addition to my collection.   This book was easy to read and enjoyable.  I am definitely looking forward to reading more from this author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm pretty sure I've read more '80s-era science fiction than I've seen on the shelves in the last decade or two. I can only assume this is because there's a shortage of great stories. So when I heard thatis a great read about a guy who has a robot body and gets mixed up with a bunch of space-faring robots, I knew I had to get this book. I enjoyed the adventure/puzzle aspect of it, especially the bits where the author explains the basic rules of robot creation. It's a quick, fun read that I could get lost in, which is something I appreciate.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It was a good way to start a reading experience that was very enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in high school when I read this book.  I don't recall a whole lot in it except for a couple of short sections that described my early experience with the Church. I went to a couple Mormon missions and was on a few, and it's interesting to read about some of the things I was taught, how I changed and how they helped me understand.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was just what I needed. It explained a lot of the complex details, and it was written so clearly. The book did not go into too much detail in terms of the research, but it does have many references.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is a great book to start with. It has a good variety of ideas in it that I would like to explore further but I am not sure what my next step would be. It is good to be introduced to a diverse range of subjects. I would recommend this book."
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's been a long time since I read anything by Gaiman.  It was a fun read and very well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character, M.A.D., gets a lot of things right, from being a self-reliant, capable individual who's got to make decisions, to the importance of a good education. However, there is still one thing I do not like about this book, and that is that when M. A.D. starts to get involved with her new boyfriend, he begins to act as though the relationship between them is one he wants, rather than one she has chosen. I could understand how he would think that, but he was going about it completely differently than she wanted him to. (hide spoiler) Just in case anyone thought I'd forgotten about my review of the first book, here it is. This one is longer than that, and it is definitely better than the first one.The story starts off in the middle of a field with a few hundred people, all trying to get back to the village that was destroyed in a huge storm when they were children. At first, I was a little concerned that this would become too long and drawn out, but then I thought about how the second book ended. M.R.R ends up going to the town where the storm occurred and finding his old childhood home, which seems to have survived. But it is empty, and only has one room that is mostly full of rubble and rubble. It's like he hasn't been back there in a long time.So, in the first part of the book, M. R. ends up taking the two guys who are traveling with him back to his old home and they make a fire and sit around for a while. It all seems to be okay, but I kept thinking "I wonder what happened when M. A. D. and her boyfriend came back here?" We do get a brief description of the tornado itself, and we get a bit of description of what the tornado's effect on the area is like. Then M. R.R goes and takes one of the other people back to her village, to check in with her mom and dad and make sure she's okay. Then we get this long description of how the survivors of the town were trying to rebuild and then the second thing that happened: M. F. was being told by her sister that she had a chance with a rich boy, but her sister would not let her go because her sister had a brother and M. S. has the same name as the rich boy. It seemed
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love it. There are a number of things that make this book more fun and interesting than most: the wonderful characters, the way it's written in a style that's a bit old-fashioned, the interesting historical details, and the surprising and witty humor.   This book has an interesting concept, and I recommend that anyone interested in ancient Egypt read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book! The author has a really good point of view and is pretty down to earth.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My parents have always been good at making me feel special. Even though I've only been with my parents for a year or so, I can't say enough good things about them.  I have always felt a closeness to them, even though we have only been together for a few months.   The best part is that we already had some of the books for my childhood, so I'm able to make use of the ones that I already had. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great little book with an interesting subject. Good advice for anyone who is new to reading books or trying to read more books at one time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was thoroughly engrossed in this book. The characters are wonderful and the plot has many twists and turns. This book was really well written. The story was interesting and well written all the way through. It would be interesting to see if I can write a story of this caliber in a month.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of this book and found it very informative. The style is the most interesting thing about this book, so I was excited to read it.   The book does a great job of breaking down a complex issue, but I found the examples used in the chapters were a little confusing. I'd recommend reading the book before reading the examples.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so glad to finally find something like this for me that I can read in a comfortable, quiet spot. I've wanted a book with this theme for a while. This book is well-written and thoughtfully structured, and has very well-thought-out plot twists and characters with plenty of depth to work with. I also liked that the author's main point is not that I must believe in God in order to be a good person but that, in many, many other aspects of my life, I'm already doing so. It seems that the atheist world view is more important to me than the "faith" part. I'm also intrigued by the idea that there might be a way to reconcile our religious beliefs with the scientific world view in ways that don't actually negate them. Overall, I think I'll probably be reading more books by other authors in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't remember what happened to me in that week and a half of classes but it didn't really matter. I don't have the time or motivation to study and all of the other stuff is just way over my head but I learned something about myself while I was there and if I have more time I'll probably spend it on it. I will definitely take more classes, and will do whatever it takes to be successful. -AJ - Texas, USA

I can't wait to get into it in the near future.   Fantastic book!   By far my favorite sci-fi book.  The writing is amazing and the plot is fascinating. It's one of those books that's both exciting and easy to read.  Highly recommended  .

It's easy to relate to her,  and she has a very positive attitude,  which is important in this era.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The prose is very interesting, the history of the early Mormons is interesting, and the illustrations are very good.   It is a bit of a departure from what is written in the Book of Mormon, but the LDS faith as it has been explained in the book is probably the closest to the Mormon faith as we have today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is good for all ages and people, and I like to take my children with me when we read, which is why I bought the book.   I bought this book because it has a great picture of a dog and was very entertaining and enjoyable.  I don't like to read in public, and since I have a young child I read this book on my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good story, though I felt the author missed the mark with the way he ended the book. It is better than it should have been. The ending is much better than the beginning. If I had gotten to the ending in time, I would have enjoyed it much more. If you like books, you will enjoy this one.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading this book for a couple of months now and it has gotten better and better. In the beginning, the only book that I would recommend to my friends is 'Wool'  I was really excited to read this book because it was by the author of 'Watership Down'.  I love the book but  the cover of 'Caveman' is better (it's by the artist of 'Dhalgren').  I don't understand why they changed but I'm not complaining and can't wait for the sequel!  I liked 'Wolverine', 'Guts', and 'Might and Magic'.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci fi or fantasy.

There's a great mix of science and fantasy in this book, and the story is interesting and has a strong feel to it. The art is excellent as well and has all the right feel of an old school comic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had read this book several times, and I thought the writing was excellent and the explanations of a lot of things were so clear that I never had a problem understanding them. I didn't understand it at all the first time, but once I got the hang of it, I realized what it was all about. It made me think about how often people give up trying to find out how something works and just follow the flow of events. They know it's going to work, but they just don't know how. And I guess that's what the book is all about, a lot. It's just one person's thoughts on how his relationship with his son came about. And in that way it's a lot like my book "A Woman's Guide to Love and Sex".
Write a positive review about a good book:   A well-thought-out story that is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. The stories of the people, especially the children, who were affected by their parents' addiction is extremely moving.   The book touches on the power of hope and hope in the face of adversity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like science fiction or fantasy this book is perfect for you.  I read this book in a short period of time.  The plot is good, but there is also a lot of character development.  Some people like to know what they are reading about so the author could have gone with another plot.  There are a lot good characters but the author has no problem showing their faults and the readers should like some of them more than others.  This is a good read even though it's just a book.  It's a good story and can be enjoyable even if you like the science fiction genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished reading " The Art of Learning " and it's excellent. The author was very good at exploring and synthesizing concepts.   Very helpful and clear explanation about the science and how to learn how to do it the right way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband gave me this book for Christmas, and I was very impressed. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading and loved this book. It is a wonderful story with lots of humor and a twist ending that is very cool and unexpected.   The author really knows how to write a story.  The characters are really well drawn, they are interesting and their reactions to situations are funny.  The dialogue is clever and sometimes a little too clever and funny at times, but other times it is very clever.  I also enjoyed how the author made her way through a lot of the books while writing this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good read and a fascinating look at the development of the modern nation state. In a recent article, the author gives the historical context of the book (1789 - 1815). As I am an older American, I can say that many of the points he makes have a lot of validity today. His book was one I was excited to read because I am fascinated by the development and evolution of government and how it has developed over the centuries.  I do not think the author is trying to do something overly political in the book.  As a matter of fact, I found it to be a very balanced book. I could have been more analytical in the writing of this review but as an older man, the information in the text was very relatable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I've been studying philosophy with a new book "On Being a Human" by John McDowell, but I needed a book that wasn't about philosophy.   This book is about having some kind of existentialist-esque idea about life in general.  I found it useful and the author does a good job of making it coherent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a professional programmer. This book is a must have. It will help you to know the differences between C and C++.   It is a book for any programmer who is learning the C programming language, but especially for those learning the language to become a full-fledged software developer. I have had this book for over 10 years and have always used it.  The book covers all aspects of the language with many practical examples to illustrate how the language works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book and I like the idea of doing more than just the one or two times a year I go through a garden, or go to the library.   The book contains a good number of examples and the author shows that he/she has a strong knowledge about gardening.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a great book, I feel the same way about the previous book and the two previous books by this author.   I am looking forward to the next one!
Write a positive review about a good book:   The concept behind this book is brilliant. It explains that all of us have an internal sense of how we feel. We all have an inner voice that says things like, "I feel good," or "I'm OK." When the voice sounds off it is really annoying and makes us want to just shut it up. But we can use the voice to improve our life and get rid of the annoying inner voice.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know how anyone could dislike this book! I think it's a fantastic book, I really do. It's just that I hate to see the writing of it. The author does a fine job of describing what she is talking about, and in the end there are just so many unanswered questions that there's not much point in giving it more stars than I am giving it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason I gave this book 5 stars was because it is definitely the most accurate depiction of modern life in the world. It is very interesting and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book, and it is one of the very best books I have read in a long time. It is really thought-provoking and a very good read.   As for my experience with the book, I will say it is not the type of book that I would normally read. I am a very picky reader. I like books that I don't understand but can put my finger on. I found this book to be one of those.  I am not sure if it was because I am from the middle east, or that this book is too much for me. The story itself wasn't the issue. The problem was the fact that this kind of book should not be published and that it was marketed to white people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got a copy of this book from my librarian (who is not my primary librarian) for my birthday.  I was super impressed with the cover and the book itself, especially the "back cover".  My only real complaint about the book is that it does not really seem to focus on women in the industry, and instead focuses on people who have made it, like a "Who's Who" of men who were in the game.    Overall, I highly recommend this book, especially if you are looking for an easy way to learn how the industry worked back then. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read this book at least three times over the past few years. It's a good reference book that has many examples of common and uncommon uses of programming languages. As for what you learn, it depends on what your particular interest is, but I can't really give any solid advice other than the fact that learn the basic principles that you will need to program your own computer games in C++.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book! I found it a very helpful resource for the people who want to be able to build up the skills to work in a non-English speaking country (myself included).   There are so many great information in this book that I recommend reading it over and over again.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    By the end of this book, you will see that the authors have accomplished much in the realm of historical research, especially of the medieval world. In addition to the vast amount of research that was involved, the authors' use of the sources is excellent.   They have also made it clear that they are serious students of history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really hoping for a book that would make me feel like a man, but this book definitely did the trick! The author really did a great job of writing a story that was realistic to the life of a man that has a crush on his female co-worker and then finds out that he has an erection while she's looking at him.   A story that is funny, but not at all mean spirited.  This book really made me want to be a male chauvinist because the author made the man seem to be the one in control when it comes to the relationship, not the woman.  My husband loved this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it is an excellent book. As a student of the early church, I learned a lot from this book. There are many useful things in it, including the historical basis for the belief that the resurrection is the first resurrection. I would recommend it to other students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    While this book is certainly not as good as, say,   The Book of the New Sun, it does what the original does (with minor variations) and better.   I don't usually like D&D books, and I tend to have problems finding good D&E books.  The new series is something different that I'll probably enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been enjoying this series for years. This is the second book in the series. I had originally bought the first book. This one has a better ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is funny how many reviewers complain about the language, but they seem to miss the point.  It has the same point it makes in so many other ways.  I love this book because it is funny and fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the stories in this book, and the characters are likeable. They have interesting backstories and some interesting personal problems.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not a huge fan of the series, but I'm glad I bought this because there are many ways to enjoy it. The prose is great, and the characters are well-developed. There's also a certain mystery that I can't get enough of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book on a whim a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since. I love the historical setting and the characters are all compelling.    The book does have a slight tendency to drag a little bit, and the romance is a little underdeveloped, but in the end I think it's pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read all of the Harry Potter books.   It's a great series with wonderful characters and great adventures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so excited to hear about all the cool stuff going on in the world with the release of this new book! I love the fact that it's full of humor and is easy to read, too! It's a really great book for someone to get an idea of what a "good" book is like in today's world.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was great! It was filled with humor and interesting information on several subjects. It was very accessible and easy to follow.   My wife and I enjoyed it. It's a lot of fun and the pictures and illustrations were fun to look at. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main reason to read this book is that the author does a good job of showing the consequences of the lack of any kind of societal cohesion. It's very depressing to think that there's no need to trust in others, and that you would be much more successful if you tried to make others happy.   Also, the author makes a good argument for why we should stop the wars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has helped me to realize that I am not alone in this struggle.   And this book is not the end all be all to being transgender but if you're going through a similar struggle this is the one book that I always have with me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent read about the war in Afghanistan. The author manages to make the human factors at the heart of the war interesting, while at the same time, offering a factual account of what is happening on the ground. The book is written in a very engaging style and contains some fascinating historical information about the Taliban and the war that has followed. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been recommended to me by many other people. I have not read much fantasy before but this one seemed like a good idea for a first book. I will certainly be looking forward to the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is well done, and all the parts are quite good. It also has a good point system, with both positive and negative points.   My only complaint would be that some of the events seem a bit rushed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I picked this book up from the library after finding it in a used bookstore.  I enjoyed this novel very much.   The story was very good.  It was a story that was hard to put down.  The characters were all likable.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book during the summer when I was working at a computer repair shop. I didn't realize I was going to like this book until I began writing this review and it kept me hooked until the end. I'm glad I found this book and I hope it gets a wider audience.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was good.   The author was very knowledgeable and very good at writing about the history of art and artists.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in art history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It's a very good book for the right person. I also think that it does well in describing the world of the people who make up the Mormon religion. It also gives information that has been omitted from more general biographies.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book. The author has really thought the matter out and put it to good use. I was not sure I liked this book at first, but now I am sure. The research is very clear. It is a wonderful tool that makes it easy to understand complex concepts.   Recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book an interesting and interesting read, even though the subject matter was a bit confusing.   It was very informative, and provided me with the motivation I needed to pursue this subject in more depth.  A couple of points that are worth making:  1) Most of the people in this story do not appear in the book.  However, the one guy who does is very interesting, and I was fascinated by his background and experience.  2) I feel like the characters are more like real people than fictional ones.  This made it so much more interesting to read about the different characters.  In any case, I highly recommend this book to those interested in history, military and foreign relations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great read!   The writing style is very easy to read and easy to follow.   I enjoyed the story line.  I also liked the illustrations.  The story is also very good.  This is a fun book to read, and a nice story to tell with a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best novel about the Irish famine I've read. A gripping, accurate story with a good ending.   I didn't like the ending too much but it made me realize how bad my own story is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so glad that I read this.  The author's use of the word "grizzly" is very good and the title is a fitting name for a book.  It's like a cross between an old western and a YA thriller.   It starts with an "A-ha!" moment, as you read the first sentence. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am currently trying to wrap my head around the difference between a science fiction and fantasy book, and this book was perfect, from the first sentence, which explained my problem, to the ending, which ended the trilogy perfectly (a brilliant, poetic ending, I must say). I highly recommend this to any fan of fantasy and science fiction, no matter what their tastes in these genres are.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really well written and informative. It will open your eyes to what is going on and why it is going.  It really was a nice surprise and an interesting read. I really enjoyed learning more about the world and I am glad I picked it up to learn more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received this book as a part of a free Kindle gift. The book is excellent, and well worth the money.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book the author has put together a solid overview of the literature and of the scientific method.  It is definitely a book for someone looking for a good introduction to scientific methodology, and an interesting read from beginning to end.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I have been looking for a new book that's going to help us become more communicative in our relationship and as a result we stumbled upon Love In Action: The Four Essential Elements of Love.  It was easy to find because it's listed in Amazon's Recommended Kindle Books and you can click the cover to go directly to the book.   I like that the title is "Four Essential Elements"  It's a great title because it makes you think about the four elements of communication:  Love,   respect,   humor, and, most importantly, empathy.  The book talks about what each one of the four is and why it's important, and how we can use them to our advantage.  I'm very interested to see how the communication skills he's taught me become a part of my everyday conversations.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very well written. I love how it explains various aspects of the "real" world (such as time and relativity) but keeps it as a fun adventure story (with a dark twist).   It is a fun book, well written and fun to read, and if you like the "L.A. Expeditions" books by Paul Dini and Gary Gygax (which I did), then this is the book for you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "  I was a bit worried about reading this book but I've read it, it is actually a very well done book and the concept of the life cycle of a butterfly is very interesting, well done"  "   Very interesting and interesting.   I'm very interested in how insects live and what they do during the winter."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was extremely satisfied with this book. I am an English teacher, and I teach English as a foreign language (or second language). It was very helpful to me when I had a difficult student.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a good read.   While the book is heavy, it is well worth it for the information it provides.  I had a good time with this book.  In fact, I have already recommended it to others and have recommended it several times to my friends.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the first in the series in the form of a book on my Kindle. After finishing it, I felt that the author, Brian Evenson, has an incredible gift for writing a story with character development that doesn't require a lot of page turns to make it all make sense. I really enjoyed the worldbuilding in the book, the descriptions, the prose, and especially the characters. If you love fantasy, and love to read fantasy and know that it will never be as good as Game of Thrones, give this book a read! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this on a short weekend when I needed to use up a few hours but didn't want to leave the beach. It was an interesting look at the history of the United States with an excellent cast.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    By the end of this book, you'll have gained an incredible perspective on everything from the beginning of the universe to the evolution of the human race. I learned a lot, but most importantly, I feel the world we live in today has a much better chance of being better than what it was in my childhood.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author is very intelligent and well informed about the political situation in Syria.  The book is well written.   I think a great deal of time was devoted to outlining the different aspects of the situation and the various groups involved in the conflict.  I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in a detailed look at this conflict and how it may develop over time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read. The concept is interesting and intriguing and there are a number of points in the book I agree with. This book is worth reading just to get a better understanding of the issues involved.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have only read one of these, but I am very happy with this. In fact, I'd be willing to bet I know more about the human anatomy of an ape than I do about the female anatomy of a human. This is a fascinating book that will surely be helpful to everyone with an interest in this subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The last two sections were really interesting, and the final section was really well-written. I have some questions and I think the author will address those. I'll be going back to read it again. "

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read, and it is a very good story that deals with a very complex subject. I enjoyed all the characters and their interaction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a terrific book.   A great introduction to modern, philosophical, and existentialist philosophy.  It's a very readable and easy read.  The book is really about two thinkers and their respective philosophies.  One is the great French philosopher and mystic, René Descartes.  They are both essentially anti-theists and anti-rationalism in that they both believe that everything begins with the idea or thought,  rather than any "thing" or material object,  which we can see or touch or hear or taste.  Descarte says, "I see with my eyes."  This quote from Descartesian philosophy is pretty great.  If you are a non-theist or rationalist, this is the book to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the depth of the author's knowledge on all the different topics he covers in this book. He covers a lot of ground (and a lot about history). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, even though it is a bit heavy on the historical. It gives us a look at how a lot of the world views our present society to be. The author does a fantastic job giving the reader a history of the human race and how it has changed from the beginning of time to the modern day.   This is the type of book I am looking for!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most important lesson I learned during my first year at Harvard Business School is that good business is easy.   If you're going to get good at business, you have to start as a student, not an employee.  It's not going to be easy.  You need a lot of grit, and an unshakable belief that you can achieve what you want, when you want it.  At Harvard, I discovered that I could not do business.  I was always in debt.  I always struggled with deadlines.  I always felt like I was missing something.    I knew I had a lot to learn, but I did not feel ready to commit to a four-year college degree.  As someone who had spent nearly 20 years at Goldman Sachs in various roles, I had decided that I did know something about finance and had enough of a financial background to do it.      I did start out at a very small firm, but it did not take long to realize that being small was not as limiting as it once seemed.  The downside of that decision was that I had to learn to get along with people who were very different from me.  In some ways, I got along very well with the people I worked with, but that did not last.  We all have different ways of being at work, and we all have to learn how to cope with it. I was lucky that there was an opportunity to learn this at the beginning of my career.  In general, I believe that the best way to learn is from the people who matter most.  By that I mean my former and current friends and colleagues.   What worked for me was that the people at Goldman who were good at working with people did not require a lot for them to do their job.  They were not interested in my success or failure.  They just cared about how we could be successful together.  If I was struggling to work with them, it was usually because I was not listening.  That doesn't mean that the Goldman people didn't care, but they just wanted me to find out what I was doing right.   When I worked for a smaller firm, I was forced to become a member of the group and learn the ins and outs of a large firm's culture.  It wasn't easy, but the results were worth it. If you are a new MBA, don't feel that your way of learning is better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a few months back. It's one of the few books I've read that I'm glad I read. I have a long way to go, but it's a good start.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must for all students who have the interest in learning how to play piano. The teacher who wrote this book is great.   She is very well informed.  I really enjoyed this book, and it is also a good resource for parents to use as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought the book was very informative, with the history and the theories behind the technology. I have used it for several years now, and have found it helpful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been studying the Tibetan Book of the Dead for over a year now and I must say it is a very good guide for all those who are interested in the Buddhist doctrine, even though it is only about 4500 years old.   "  The book is very detailed and in no way only focusing on the sutras.  "
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading the book for a couple weeks now. I loved the story, but I had a few problems with it. First, the writing was very rushed. I was impatient to find out what happened next, and it really slowed down the pacing of the story. This is a little frustrating, since I really liked the characters and what they were going through, but it's an issue that could have been avoided by a bit more time. Second, the final scene is a bit disappointing, if you're going in expecting to read a happy ending. If this book had ended with one of the characters going back to her house, it would have been okay, but because the book was trying to do two things at once, it ended on a more bittersweet note than I was expecting. I know I didn't like it, but if I had the chance, I would definitely read the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was never a "Harry Potter" fan. But my son is. After reading the books, we went to see "Harry and the Goblet of Fire." We were very happy with it. The movie was also good, but not nearly as good as the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got hooked in my teens, but by the time I was 21 and had started working a steady job, I realized I didn't really like this book.  This book is written in an   way   that feels like it will appeal to anyone, young or old, so I  decided to give it a shot.  I have to say that this book will have a different effect on you than other books you've read.    This is a quick read, but it will last a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure I'd recommend this to a complete beginner (but it's good enough that I'm sure they'll be able to read the last few chapters by themselves), but I certainly recommend it to people who want a good primer. A great book for beginners with very clear explanations and illustrations.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this book is a very good read, but there were a few parts that were kind of off-putting to me.  The first was that the author felt that he was entitled to write about a "woman" (his word) that had an affair.  I'm not one for "slut shaming" books, but I thought that it was strange that he felt the need to refer to a woman in this way.   My second problem with this book was that I didn't feel that the story was very well written.  This is probably due to my general dislike of books that take a very personal angle.  My favorite character in this book, though, was the character of my boyfriend, which I really appreciated because I wanted to read more about him. I think this book would be better as a stand-alone book or an e-book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. I bought it and read it on a plane to Boston. I didn't get to see the original, but read the new one right after.  I will buy this book when I travel.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got really into this book and loved every minute of it!   This is a really good, fun read and the story has a lot going for it.  I hope more people read this book to try it out and get an idea for what it might be like to become a hero! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I read the book in two sittings and enjoyed it, very good story about the family of two men that is not that romantic but the characters did become real people. The ending was great too."
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a good basic story to follow, it is a lot of fun to read. It is not exactly a good thriller, which I enjoyed it a lot because it was not really a thriller, but more a psychological thriller. This story will have you thinking about the world that is created by a good story and a good author, which is a true pleasure.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book!   The characters are very relatable, I liked how they each dealt with issues that were important to me, although it was obvious to me that this was meant to be for kids.   It's not exactly a rambling novel, but if you need something to read and it doesn't go too deep, I'd recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be an enjoyable story, and if anything the more I think about it the more it makes perfect sense.   It's a very good use of fantasy and is enjoyable in its own right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most fascinating and well-researched books I have read in a long time. I am now very familiar with the field of social psychology.    I particularly enjoy the integration of evolutionary psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and developmental economics into a cohesive theory of social behavior and how it evolved.  This new model of human behavior is well-developed and is a very promising direction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best short reads I have ever read.   I read this before starting The Way to Succeed, which I have not been disappointed by in the least.  It's a classic and I can't wait to see what other great short reads will be in the coming months. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved it! I read it with an English major friend who had never read any books about history before and really enjoyed this one. The subject matter is complex, interesting and a lot of fun. I really do recommend this one!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been looking for some time for a book that is both easy to read and informative.   This book does it well. I am also quite enjoying that it isn't just a book about one religion but the many ways we're still bound to religion today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author did a wonderful job in describing the different ways in which the world is "different". It is easy to get caught up in a culture that we know to be wrong, and the author does a wonderful, but short, job of showing how such wrongness is both natural and widespread. A couple of points to be aware of: 1) In order to make it a bit more realistic, the author makes the statement that the various cultures are "not just different, but different for a reason" (p. 10). He's aware that it would have been better if he had shown the many possible reasons (as in the second paragraph of the second chapter). Instead, though, it seems to me that it's perfectly acceptable to use the word "different" as an adjective, and "for a reason." (p 23) 2) The book is not a long chapter, and, in addition to describing the various cultural differences, the writer also tries to show how some people have managed to adapt their way of thinking to one of the cultures and how the result is still somewhat different, which I feel is a good way of showing the fact that such adaptation is quite hard. Also, the book is quite well written, so it wouldn't be such a waste if the author could have spent less time describing differences but instead wrote more about how these different cultures are related to each other.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book a lot.   The concept is well thought out and the authors do a great job of describing the physical and mental effects of these drugs.  They really get into the nitty-gritty of the effects of datura, how they work, and what you should do if you take them.  My only complaint is that the cover art is very nice but the text could use a little more explanation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "What could be better than a good story?   When I heard of this I knew it was going to be fantastic.   The writing was top-notch and the characters were all memorable and developed nicely.  I look forward to the second book in this series  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I enjoyed this book. Very informative and easy to read."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book on the topic of how to build a better life. If you want a guide that will help you succeed and be a happier person, read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is great.   It's the perfect blend of history and historical fiction.  It does not use the same "old stuff" but covers the key events from the time period it covers.  The best part is that it uses both the old stuff and the new stuff with a good mix.  I would highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really pleased with this book. I had a hard time trying to figure out what to say about this one. I liked all of the characters. The author gives us an explanation of a lot of what's going on, which I liked. I am a bit on the fence on some of the character stuff, but overall this was a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the novel, it was good. But it wasn't for me. I like fast-paced, non-stop, action, exciting, thrilling novels.  I really didn't find that one that I was looking for in a long time.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives a clear exposition on the subject of spiritual evolution, and what each stage entails. It explains the theory in a way that I am sure all people who have some knowledge about this subject will be able to follow.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It is a good story that is quite readable. I found it to be more fun than The Black Queen but I am glad I read this book because I do not have enough books to read in the series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this very much. I am a professional writer, and this book has many excellent lessons to teach.  I am also a huge fan of the Harry Potter books and movies, and was especially excited when I found out about this novel.   It would make a great read for any fan of either series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A nice, well-written and well-thought out book on the history of the Jewish People.   There is a good deal of information here and there is a clear focus on the issues of the day as well as issues of history and culture. I'm not sure that I'd recommend this book to a new reader, but if you've been on the fence about Judaism, this should do the trick. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I am so glad I got to read this book. It is very enlightening and I am glad that I got the chance to read it. I am also glad that the author does not just take people's experiences and assume they are unique. I found this to be a very well written book. "
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great. It does what it says it will and that is to expose the history of the Jews and the persecution that they suffered. It did what it set out to do and that was to give a balanced view. It had a lot of interesting material that I found interesting as a historical document but also interesting for the more modern audience to study, for the general public to know the facts and for the historians who want to investigate more about this subject.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only downside I have to this book is that it is very hard to get through.   I find it hard to keep up with the author's stories, the prose, and the plot line.  This book was very intriguing, but unfortunately I have decided to not read any more from the series because of the many problems I have with this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book.  It's a very interesting read and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in what goes on inside the mind of a woman.  I highly recommend it.    
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was 18, I bought this. I'm so happy that I did because I never liked the series. That is, until now. I bought the second book (yes, I do not like to read that old shit) and really enjoyed it. There are so many references to Star Wars in this book, I was amazed.  I have been told that I am an old fart but, if I read this book then I know that I'm not. Thanks, 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to say, this book is a wonderful example of how to work a complex and interesting subject from a different angle than one typically sees in books on this subject. The writing is clear and simple, making it easy to follow along as the author makes the case that religious belief in the Judeo-Christian tradition is a good thing. There are many examples of how the Bible and other religious texts have influenced, and sometimes have even led to, the development of scientific theories of how our planet is and where it came from.   This book is very accessible to anyone. I especially like that it has a different take on how to deal with the "narrative of evil" and how to present it in a non-denigrating and helpful manner.  I was not convinced at first when the author wrote that the "skeptic" interpretation of the Judeos is no more or less valid than the "fundamentalist" interpretation. But once I accepted that it makes more sense in terms of how a rational and scientific person would read the text, I liked it better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm thrilled that I found this book!   "What I Loved" really took me by surprise, and I think you'll like it too! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm glad I bought this book.  The title gives away that this is a "romance" with a "strong female character".  The plot is somewhat vague, but the story is fun and exciting.   A good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed the books that I have read from this author. I don't believe this is a children's book; it is more like a work of fiction.   This is a great story and the characters are very well drawn. I had a good laugh reading this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An absolutely brilliant and engaging book, an excellent addition to the canon of fantasy, especially the later ones.   A brilliant book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the first chapter and loved it! The writing is crisp and I love the illustrations! This is the type of book that I always wanted to read but just never got around to.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book from cover to cover. If I had this kind of money to invest in books, I would take it over The Da Vinci Code or the Bible in a heartbeat. I didn't expect it to be an easy read, but I never expected it to challenge my thinking like this. I read through the first couple of pages and my thoughts started going off in different directions. I wanted to know more about the characters. About the culture that the book takes place in. About why these people are doing what they're doing. It all made perfect sense to me, and the details were fascinating.   I was really looking forward to the conclusion, which is what surprised me most about this book. It was well-paced and very intriguing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It is an interesting look at the history of the Irish and the Irish experience in America. The writing is not easy, but the subject matter is very interesting and informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a child, and have always remembered it as a wonderful book.   The writing is very good;   the illustrations are very artistic and clever.  It seems to be about the same time as the books I grew up on (Dorothy, Oliver Twist, Lewis Carroll), and is a much better book in every way.  Thank you for including it in your book series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book on the subject of quantum mechanics I've ever encountered. This one really gets it, and covers the basics of the theory, including what quantum mechanics is, and what it can and can't tell us about the world.   It is the only book I've encountered that has a good introduction and thorough discussion, both for the more mathematically inclined and for the nonscientific. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really pleased with this book. I've read the other reviews, and I agree. The main premise was very strong, and the story was easy to follow. But I think this was not the story of one woman's life. It was a very unique and memorable experience. I loved how the author explored all the possible ways in which her experiences might have led her to choose a certain lifestyle. I also liked that she used some of the "common sense" arguments to convince her that it wasn't so bad to be bisexual.   Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, just like the previous three, is about how people develop their own styles of living. It is a bit of a throwback to the more classical and "authoritative" works of psychology. However, the authors, rather than trying to be academic, were interested in making a positive contribution to society by discussing the various facets of people's lives and how they affect our lives in general.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've heard of the book but never read it until recently, when it was reviewed here. The first section is very good, but the rest is a big letdown. The first chapter describes how people who are depressed usually make poor decisions. They tend to use excuses to justify not taking action, and end up being punished by negative feelings. The second part of the chapter describes the positive qualities of exercise, and how the book makes the case that exercise can help people. This section of the text is excellent. The last two sections are a little disappointing. The author says that exercise will help you with your decision making skills. Unfortunately, the text never really discusses how to improve those skills, and it's unclear why he believes that exercising is useful for people who make poor decision. The whole concept of "decision making" in this book is very interesting. However, the author has no idea of what he is talking about, and the book has lots of typos. I think this book would be a great addition to the personal growth library. I have yet to try the exercises included, but I imagine they are well written. The idea of "sticking to my guns" is intriguing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the science and social implications of the concept of "truism" in the sense of "believing that things are as they are." The book is very concise and is written by an author who has been doing some excellent work in this area. The book's style is very clear and there is very little in the way of jargon, and the author is willing to discuss the issue of whether or not we believe things because of some force, whether it be science, or something more. I particularly like that this book deals with the social implications as well. A nice book on an interesting topic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am really glad I read this book and I learned a lot from it, I like the fact that he uses the term "troublesome" a lot.  This is not exactly a book about computer problems or hacking, but I think he's giving us some insight into how we can make the lives of those around us better (and not just the hackers).
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great read for anyone that loves to learn or knows some very basic programming languages.  It has helped me learn to code so that i can make the websites on the internet go more smoothly.  I found this book very interesting, even if i did not like the book as it is written.   If you are planning on taking any course in any field, then this book is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not so sure this book was going to be able to teach me about gender issues.   However,  I had so much fun  with it.  I am glad I read it and that it was in print for so many years to read again  it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite book of all time.   I've always loved and admired "Alice" and "Violet" in particular.  I had to buy both of them to have a copy I could keep for myself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been thinking about this book for quite some time, I know that most of us are a bit of a hoarder but I hadn't read a book on the subject.  It was actually my husband who got me to finally read this book.  He is also a collector of comics and had already picked out the first few issues of this book when I mentioned this to him.  After reading it, I have to admit that it is very well done.  This book was very well researched, and was a great read for the collector.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   In addition to being a very entertaining story, this book was really educational in that it taught me how to properly store and use my own money and how to evaluate my own investments and decisions.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my favorite book of the year. The world building is outstanding.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is good. I was reading the book when the first part hit me. Then I read the book a second time.   I was surprised at the character development. It was well done and the story stayed with me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great! I was looking for a very short book on the subject of tectonic plate tectonics. I got this and was pleased with the content and how easy it was to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's nice to be able to read a book that is a little different from the other books you have read.   I didn't realize this was possible, so it is very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I have enjoyed this book as much as the author is a skilled and gifted linguist who knows the ins and outs of both the Romance languages and the Germanic languages.   In addition to his masterful grammar and lexicon, the author writes with a natural flow and has a great appreciation for language.  I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for a great story with a solid understanding of both languages. "
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first two books in the series, The War Games and The Hunger Games, are brilliant, well-written, engaging, suspenseful and heart-wrenching.   They both tie into each other as well as a well-engineered jigsaw puzzle; the plot lines keep you engaged, but the books are not too long, so you can finish them in a week.  I highly recommend The Hunger games books . 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in the last couple of months and really enjoyed it! It's quite different from anything I've read in the past. It's a nice mix of the traditional fantasy setting and the realistic (but not unrealistic) treatment of the protagonist's race, but it's also quite different in the ways the author tries to handle various different character's race and class.   It's got a bit of everything!   A fun, interesting read that I'm happy I picked up! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book that took me months to finish and really made me think hard about how much we do care about each other in this world.   I think that it's an important book for anyone who wants to know more about what makes us different and what makes a family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    While I have not read the whole book, this is one of the best examples I have seen of the process of how a "normal" human being can be made to believe they are crazy and then see the world in a completely different way. "The Way of the Master" is not a particularly good book. This book is not about how to "behave" better, but rather how to be a "man" who is still able to see, in the end, that there is nothing abnormal about anything that happens to him or her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a couple of weeks ago and it really impressed me. It's a great little book that provides some really useful information.   This is an informative book about a fascinating subject, and I'm glad to be able to use it as a reference for when I want to do something on the fly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I loved this book, and I couldn't be happier with the experience.   The book really has everything that the title says it does.  It's a quick, easy read, with very few problems in the book itself (although we have to admit there are a few grammatical errors).  The content is very factual, and the story is entertaining.  I'm a huge fan of these types of books, and this was a great addition to my collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've listened to all five of this author's audiobooks.   The first three are very good, and the last one was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the historical events in the Middle East in the nineteenth century, and the early years of the twentieth century. I think I understand the Middle Eastern context better now and appreciate the fact that, as the book is written by a professor at the London School of Economics (where I studied a number of years ago), he does not focus much on the politics of the time, and does not take sides on these events. However, I am aware that my own opinion is more critical and I wish the author had discussed more extensively what he meant by the Arab-Jewish conflict.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got hooked on the book within a week of reading it. My daughter has a similar taste in books and I've purchased her many of them. I have her pick out what she likes and what she doesn't and I'm a sucker for any book with a cute dog. I think it's the dog. My favorite character is the "bad boy", a husky/German shepherd mix that is always ready for a good fight (even if it's just a little one-on-one battle). Her other friends seem to be on the sidelines. I read it on my Kindle (which I love - I love how it saves so much space) but it's great in paperback, too. My only complaint is that it's a bit short at only 144 pages.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want a good reading experience and this is the only book you can buy, then buy it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was reading it at a conference, and when I finished, I was a little shocked, because I had forgotten that this was a book I had not read.   As my daughter and I drove home, I looked through my other books and found a review of it.  I also found the book very stimulating, very easy to read, and I think it has a lot to teach all children. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I did find some problems with this book, such as the first half of the book being a description of a very old, very boring, and very boring book and the second half being a more enjoyable story. The first half is quite dry and boring, but the second seems like it was meant to be more enjoyable.   The story is good and has a lot of potential, so I'm sure the next book will improve upon this one, and will probably be my new favorite. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was fantastic.  It was written in such a way that it was understandable and very engaging.   It is such a nice change from other book that make people want to read more.  If I have one complaint it is that the title was not "Dogs of War". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading " A Very Good Book " by David P. Coombes a lot. I like to read from a variety of sources and this book does the job. I found the story, although somewhat dry, interesting and engaging. The illustrations were very good and the stories were easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book to learn about the history of the world. It is easy to learn and to enjoy. A lot of the history in the book was not available in a easy to understand form. But it is all there in this book. I think this is a book for all students from elementary to high school age. I will certainly refer this book to my high school history teacher. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am looking forward to reading this book.   The writing is clear, well-written, and the subject matter is not complex.  I enjoyed the way the author put it together. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book because I had been asked to review a book I really enjoyed. This book was actually the only one I read on the subject, and I did so in spite of the fact that I don't agree with everything she says. There were two important things I found useful.   One is that she points out (and I agree with her), that we should be more concerned with the quality of the research rather than the number of studies on the topic.  Another is that there are several studies that have suggested that being vegan is associated with increased heart disease risk.  I'm not certain that I would agree with that, however. The main reason for my feeling that the research on this topic is not as robust as I would like is that we do not know how people who are vegans perform compared to those who consume animal foods.  The only studies that address this are relatively recent and involve a smaller number of subjects.  This is unfortunate, because I don 't feel that the studies that are published are necessarily representative of how vegan people perform.  For instance, we need to look at studies in which all the subjects are fully aware that they are eating a vegan diet, but those in which participants are unaware of their diets.  Also, we should not ignore the fact, that a lot of the studies do not have a control group.  Again, this is a concern for me, but the more important point is that a vegan person can eat meat, and if they do so with the intent of not harming other animals, then they should be healthy.  We should not assume that a person who is veg is incapable of harming other non-vegans, and we should have the same consideration for ourselves.  If you think that you could go vegan without harming your health, then by all means go for it, but remember to be aware that not everyone is prepared to go through the pain and suffering.  Lastly, she suggests that there is a role for government agencies in promoting a vegan lifestyle, although I personally disagree with her assessment of their value in terms of the health of our planet.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book. It wasn't too long but it covered what the book was like. It is a good place to start and is written by a person who knows a little about this genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed the fact that this book covered more than just basic computer language, although it did that as well, which is great. I like that the book covers more than simple programming, as it teaches about design and how to write for all the different platforms, including mobile devices.   This book covers the theory, but it was fun to read, even though I don't really know what I was learning. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very very excellent book for those who study the scriptures and have taken the time to go through it.   The book is very informative and well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for anyone who studies the "Gods" of the Ancient Near East.  If you are going to write a book about Gods, you have to put your own stamp on it.  In this case, the book is an extremely well done book, with the author's style and writing.   The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the author goes overboard when he tries to discuss a few Gods in detail.  I mean, if I'm reading the introduction to a book and I have to read pages and pages on the Gods of various times and places, the entire book becomes an academic exercise.  However, that's only because I can't understand the authors' words. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book when I came to it because I am a huge fan of fantasy and I was very interested in the concept of a series set in a medieval setting. I was also very interested that the series is told from the point of view of a young girl and her father in their adventures. The author, Robert E. Howard, has done a great job in putting together a story with characters that I found very interesting and very memorable. This series is a great read because of how much it is filled with humor, action and a lot of humor. A great place to start for any fantasy reader. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. As a teenager I used to think I had a lot in common with the main character, but my experience with that person has been very, very different. In my view, the book gives a very thorough overview of what makes him tick and why the other people in his life have been so different from what he expects or likes.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book!   I don't think I've ever been so sucked into a book, even though I usually hate reading.   This book was definitely fun! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the stories and the characters are all great.   It's definitely going to be a favorite for me 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the book more than I thought I would! It was interesting, and I feel like this is going to be a more general interest book that focuses on all the different types of mental health issues. It's a really interesting topic, and there are definitely some "bad apples" as I call them in my book, but I also felt like the vast majority of them were in fact mental health disorders, with a few psychological illnesses thrown in. The authors also mention some different types and subtypes of mental illness, which is a nice touch. The cover is nice, as it does not have an illustration or graphic, and it's all in black and white instead of being bright colors. It does not detract from the book at all, and the cover really conveys that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want to see a good story told in a fun and entertaining way, then this is the book for you.   I loved the main characters and the story.  It has a lot of adventure in it.  A great book for all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character does not have a character flaw or a flaw that is made obvious.   He is an ordinary guy, like most of the men I know.  For me, the fact that he was a Vietnam war vet who became a successful scientist gave it a real sense of credibility.  I will be buying the sequels.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second part of this book is very good, if not better than the first. The first half was great but I'm not going to say it's better than or the best of the two parts.   There are some good examples of how to use the book, some great examples of the techniques of writing, and some new techniques of thinking about writing, which I had not seen before.  The techniques I'm talking about were the things I thought were most valuable, and also a little hard to get, but I liked it anyway. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was my introduction to the game. It is one of the more thorough but simple books out there.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of this book. I like that you don't focus on the story per se, but you show the story through the characters, which makes for a really good book.   The characters are also just great and you get to see so much of them!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    While reading this book I was excited to read about one of my favorite tv shows from years ago.   This book gives an interesting glimpse of what it was like to be a teenager during the 70's.  The book describes the excitement of being part of a new generation and how it might have gone the same way as the previous one.  I feel the author has succeeded in capturing the essence of the 70s and is not afraid to show what life was like during the era.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thrilled to discover a gem like this when I was in college.   It's the best explanation of how a rationalist should look at the world I've ever found.  In short, it's a simple, practical, but highly effective guide that will allow you to get to the bottom of the matter of God, the paranormal, ghosts, angels, etc.  I've used it to better understand science, history, philosophy, science fiction, psychology, religion, etc., and it was the most effective piece of self-help that I have ever used.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this well written book, Mr. Oreskes shows that the public is a large part of the decision-making body, and therefore needs to be properly represented at all levels of decision making.   I'm not really sure how the authors of the various state governments are going to use this information, but it is a good guide. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I got the book about 4 months ago. We started with a chapter on the "The Book of the War of the Roses" by Jane Austen that we love. We really liked this book, but found ourselves a bit put off by the lack of romance in the story. Still, the book is fun and interesting. I'm not sure how we're going to keep all our medieval characters in the mood for battle, but we'll keep trying.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was fun, I was entertained, and it got me thinking about the history of the "Great Depression".  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is compelling enough to keep me hooked. This book is a must have! This is the type of book you'd find in the book store. I've already recommended this book to my friends.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've read about the modern-day world since "The God of Small Things" (a.k.a. "The Great Depression") by Richard Lourie (or "The Little Book of Life" and its companion book, "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up."   It was the kind of book that made me re-read an old favourite - I re-reads old favourites often - and that's a real gift.   I have read "The Age of Anxiety" and "The Magic of Thinking Big" (the second of which is now available for pre-order) and "It's All About Timing" and I have enjoyed them, but never the same ones.  "The Big Book of Everything" is the best of those books and that is why I was so happy to be able to get it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. I have always been into the occult, but have never really been able to wrap my head around certain areas of the occult. This book helped me connect all these various occult practices together.   It was quite interesting how the various parts of the book all seemed to fit together into the whole. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book very well researched.  It is not the usual, easy to read, one-dimensional, well-written, quick read.   This book took me hours of reading and hours of looking over the material in search of my new research question.  I find the book informative and helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say this book is a must-have book, since it was published in 2002, but it is a good example of how to combine two different types of work into a coherent whole. The prose is not quite as strong as it was when it was first published, but the quality of the story and the insight into the development of the characters and their relationships make up for that, and it makes for a good read. I will definitely be reading more of the author's work.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the book, especially the ending. It was interesting and well-written. I would love to read more of the author's work, and maybe read one of her other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was hesitant to pick up this one, but I think I've found my favorite mystery series so far. It's got my kind of vibe, and I'm definitely digging the characters. The mystery elements are really well done (and I know this will come as a surprise to some, but it's not like a lot of mystery series that I've read--they have a bit of a formula). I'm also loving the characters, and the sense of danger that's present in each chapter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books that I could never quite get into.   But after getting through the first few chapters and getting to the point where I could get a grasp on some of the concepts, I was hooked.  As I said before I never could get into the first two books by Dune. But, the third one was just as good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've recently read two of these, which is a nice change of pace for me. I don't usually read sci-fi but these are actually pretty enjoyable. They are not very complex, but they are a fun ride. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book.   I can easily see how it could get confusing.  The book is not easy, and I could see how some readers might be put off by it.  However, I feel that a book like this should be read and understood, rather than being thrown in the trash.  This book does a good job of illustrating what the Bible is talking about, especially with the way it has us read the Bible.  If you have any interest in the Bible, it is worth the effort. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a few short weeks I became a new fan of the "Bible" series.   The characters and story line are fun.  They are written in such a way that the reader has no idea what's going to happen and they are not predictable.  If I were to pick a favorite character, I would have to say, "The Lord of Darkness". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book. The pictures are very good. This is just great to keep in my library.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I really enjoyed this book and enjoyed it a lot more when I got to reading about the people who lived through and experienced it. The book also provided me with a new way of looking at the history of the Civil War. I was a little surprised at how detailed and extensive this book was when it covered such a small area of the war, but it was really worth the read. It was informative, exciting, and just plain interesting." -Tricia K.   Read an unedited, uncorrected review:  "I didn't want to give this a 3 star rating, but when I was reading the first few pages, it seemed like the author had no idea what to do with the book. There were so many things that I couldn't understand, and all I got from the book were a few lines, which really made the reader go, "Wow". I don't know how the author felt about the book, but there is not one thing about it that I enjoyed, not even the historical part, and that made it very hard to recommend the book." -Linda B.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was completely hooked by the story and completely captivated by the characters. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, and my only real complaint was the length. However, I do have to say, I was very pleased with the way that this book progressed. I would love to see where this series goes in future books!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book on a plane. It's got the best description of how we think, and it's clear how difficult it can be to change a bad habit. This is so much better than "How To Win Friends and Influence People"  I used to read it and think how I don't know, but it seems like if I can't stop this book's negative thoughts, it might be a good idea to just go read a more useful book that has a positive ending.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good read, but I did have a few issues with the story. First, it took a good portion of the book to get a grasp on the main character. I found it frustrating because it was a character who was, to me, the most interesting character. It was very hard for me to connect with him, especially since his "recovery" was basically just a rehash of his past. I felt like I was watching a guy who was doing OK, but not doing as well as he was supposed to. I guess I just needed more information, which was the main issue I had with the first half of the story, not so much the second half.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was good and I liked the premise well enough but I thought it was overlong and poorly executed. It seemed like the author had never written a short story before and she was always writing long books.   This book is an interesting one and I think it could be used to teach basic writing skills in a class setting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The plot was a bit weak, but the characters were very good, and the story was well paced.   My favorite book   This book was so well written. I loved it.  I have tried to learn more about plants and how they can benefit people and our planet.  This is the first book that I can see myself giving out as a gift, and I would recommend this book to everyone who loves plants and plants in general. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great because it offers a very clear, yet detailed description of all the major methods that one can use to help the patients. This book offers all the information you need to know, but does it in a very easy to understand way.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would recommend this book to all ages to read. The illustrations are great and the story is full of twists and turns that will keep the reader intrigued.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very helpful for my daughter who recently moved to a new town and would rather not have a library book in her backpack. It's a little more of a detective story than a romantic thriller, but the story is great.   It is not a perfect book because of a few things, including the fact that it is narrated by someone who is too nervous to say much, which made it hard for me to connect with her and was a little awkward. But I loved it anyway. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this for my son's fifth birthday. He had been begging me to get him this book because he thought it was the funniest book he had ever read. I didn't get the whole humor thing, but I didn t hate it and it is very funny.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the series and I loved this book.   The first few books were really good, but this is very up to date, well written, and really interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It took me a while to get into this novel, but once I got into it it became a real treat, because it is not about how amazing the author is at writing, it is about the amazing world that this world in its own right has and the people that live in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the only book I've read that addresses the whole issue of the relationship between men and women in a thorough and objective manner.  It's also very well written, clear and concise.   In fact it's probably the best book on the subject I've ever read.  (You'll be interested in this:  I had previously taken part in an interview for a college course that was taught by a professor who had written a book on women and relationships.  He had asked me if I'd be interested but I had thought it too hard, as it related to my current project.  A friend of mine was very interested in taking a look at the book so I gave it a go,  and I'm glad I did.  ) Review:  This is a very well researched and written book.  The main thesis is that men and men's issues are very closely related, as men are the most likely gender to be victims of violence and sexual abuse.   In addition, men are more likely to engage in violent and/or violent behaviours and engage in the types of relationships that are most harmful.  This also applies to domestic violence in the relationship, particularly as it is largely perpetrated by women.  When we consider that this has been a problem for men in modern society for many years, it is of course very disappointing that nothing is being done about it.  If this book can do anything, it would be to raise awareness.  There are some other books on the topic (but not that many).  I recommend this one for anyone who has a serious interest in male/female relationships. Posted by Amy in the UK at 9:42 am
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author makes the connection between "a culture of self-disclosure" and the "culture of narcissism" in a compelling way.  I have been studying narcissism for over 15 years.   Although this book will not provide all the answers, it does give the information needed to understand the culture of narcissists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the very few books that I have not only read, but have also read, re-read, and re-looked at twice in order to understand what is being taught.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "For an adult book, it is a good one that covers some important points and it's well written.   I got a lot of things from this book.  I was able to relate to many of the events I was going through.  This is the kind of book I would want to have when I was growing up.  If you like sports, history, science, or if you are a big fan of the TV show "The West Wing" you should check it out.  "
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this is a great book. I love science, but I really didn't understand the basics of this particular book, and thought it could use a little more detail, so I was surprised at the amount of information I picked up about the science of the Moon and how it changed humans. I will definitely buy the second book, though I still need to look up a lot of the terminology.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read in a long time. A beautiful book of a book and very detailed and insightful. Great book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite "modern" book I've ever read, and it has made an impact. It is witty, insightful, funny, and sometimes quite thought provoking. It's not a light read, but it's certainly a great one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book at a very good pace and enjoyed the story a lot.   The character's in the book are believable.  The story is fast-paced and exciting.  This is a great book to read and keep you engaged until the very end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story follows the characters through an important and difficult decision, without being overwhelming.   It is an important book that should be on everyone's list. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend of mine who loves it. She said it was good to get a little historical fiction to read and was not too hard.   The author is a good teacher on history and she shows that there is a reason why certain things happened but not others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I really enjoyed this book. It is a very informative and entertaining book.  It is well written and the humor is funny and the characters are interesting.   Overall, a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read "Curious George and the Magic of the Ocean" by Nancy L. Cott. I am a lifelong Disney fan, and had never heard of the book before but enjoyed the book. Cotta has made this a wonderful, entertaining, and enlightening book. It gives a wonderful account of George's life and career, as well as his encounters with magic, animals, and of course, the ocean. I especially loved the part about the trip to the South Pole, and especially the "funniest" scenes! I am always looking for books that offer a more complete story and I can't wait to read more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character is a woman, and she is a very interesting and likable one. She is not a victim, and has some strength to her to resist the urge to sell her family's house for the cash. The last chapters of the book were very moving, and gave a good picture of the hardships that are common in life.   I read the first part and enjoyed it.  A very well written book. The author describes many aspects of the life of a soldier, the battles, the weather, the training, the meals, and so on. The stories are well written and believable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. There was a lot of information, but I think it is good if you want to have a general understanding of the principles of meditation and its practice.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must read book for anyone interested in learning about a specific religion. The author makes many well reasoned arguments in favour of the religion in question, and I found many of the arguments persuasive.   It was easy to understand what all the pieces of information he was citing in the book were and how they fit together, and this made it very readable.  It's a good, basic introductory book to understand how religion works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent, well written book. The information is excellent. It was a real eye opener for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read, and a great story. I love the plot. The writing is well-written, and the descriptions of the different planets were accurate. I wish I had had more information about each planet (e.g. what kind of flora they had, the species of humans that settled them, etc.). It would have made for a better story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting and funny and made me think about religion and how that can affect our thoughts, but it was also very thought-provoking and easy to read. I don't think I'll read another religion book, but this one is definitely up my alley.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good read! It gives an explanation of the differences between American and European laws on marriage and divorces, and how these differ from the laws of other countries. The author is very thorough in covering the history and legal issues, which is what I've been looking for.   I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn about marriage and divorce law and to be prepared to make a legal case when someone wants to get divorced.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book explains many aspects of a very complex topic that have very little literature. This was very useful for me. It helps me understand complex subjects by showing that people have done the work. Thanks so much for this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a young man I thought all I had to do was have a decent home and family to care for, and life would be good, but I learned otherwise. I learned of people who took a lot of time, effort, and effort to provide for their families and who were so grateful to get the chance to provide. The best way to describe my feeling about the family of this book was 'I am grateful that this book exists', because these stories give insight into the mindset of those that worked hard to provide a better life for their family and loved ones. The book is written in a way that was a challenge for me to understand and the characters were all so unique and interesting.   "I am sure I'll be talking about this book for years to come" I read this book at my local library and was blown away by the depth of this topic. I was intrigued by the concept of what being able to provide was, how difficult it is to get there and to what degree people can succeed at this. I am still in search of this and want to find someone that I can talk to about it so I can get their perspective and help to share the information with others. I recommend this book, even though I am not sure I fully understand what it's all about yet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is well told.  I enjoyed it very much, it's the first time i'm reading a book on the history of Christianity in this format, and i'm very glad i decided to take this path.  The historical background i found very interesting and i felt the way the authors explained it really brought the story alive.   Overall, i thought the book was a very good read, and if you enjoyed historical fiction, you will probably like it too.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book on the importance of making decisions that impact your own health.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is probably the best book I've read on the topic of psychology for both students and non-students.   I'm not particularly good at science, but this book makes it so much more fun.    It's not a perfect book - but it's a great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just got this on the heels of a very sad day and it hit all the right notes! It is such a poignant book about a little boy and the very real sadness that his mother is gone and yet still the love that they have is just overwhelming. This is such an honest, beautiful, and genuine book that I would absolutely recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a great book called  The Book of the New Sun. This is my third book I've read by Alan Moore. The first was V for Vendetta, the second was From Hell. I had no idea if they were any good, but I knew this one was going to be good. In a way, I'm glad I didn't wait for the second book, because this one is even better. Not only is it amazing, but it's a masterpiece. My only problem is that I want to read more of Alan Moore. This book is one of the most important and influential novels of our time.  The  Book of Souls  is a great example of a work by a major author. As a writer, Moore's work is unmatched by any of his contemporaries, and the art he does with his words is truly spectacular. The book is an ode to the ancient myth of the  Fall of Man   (which, of course, is also the most famous literary event in the world, and one of a kind ). Moore takes this idea to its logical extreme and presents it as an allegory for the human condition. The author explores how people react to the fall of the mythological gods and gods themselves and how people deal with their newly found power. The final battle that takes place is one that I had seen in my mind for years, but never fully understood. The characters in the book are almost uniformly flawed, but Moore makes it so that they are believable. The story itself is incredibly intense, but the emotional core is more than worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is amazing.   I wish there was a book with this amount of info about each and every aspect of a cotillion - and all the nuances of how it really works in terms of planning, logistics, finances, and the cotillon and the person/cotillon's psyche and how they interact.  I could go on and on, but I think the gist is that it's pretty awesome - you should be reading it if you want to get more details on what the coteillon is like, and how it works.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was a good read!   After all of my other reading  I wanted to finish the book and I felt the ending was good.   I liked how this author writes a good summary and  gives the reader a brief introduction to the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read this for a class and it was interesting and helpful. I think it is an excellent book on a lot of topics. It will probably be more difficult to get the material out of this book if you haven't studied it before. I would definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is not the "perfect" book but it is a good one. I was quite surprised that I had not heard about it before now. I have a friend who reads a lot and she's a huge fan of historical novels. Her interest led her to try the "old wives tale". She had a hard time with the first book and was really disappointed. I found it really interesting but not enough to buy the other books in the series. If you like historical books, this is a great starting point. I was also quite surprised how the series progressed. It went from first person narration of the main character, in which she was portrayed as a really brave and good person, to third person narration, in the form of a character in the story, a woman, who is also described as a brave and honorable person but has a more cynical view about the world, and who's voice is narrated from the second person, where she is shown as a woman who hates things in life. The book ended with the same narrator, who started the story. In the end, this woman is shown to be a bit of an "angel" but still the main protagonist in the book. That's quite a twist, as many books and movies have shown people like that and the "angels" are usually evil or misguided in their own way, as opposed to the people who are portrayed as good, in spite of their own faults.  A nice introduction to historical fiction: I think it's very important to mention that this book is part of the "Historical Fiction Series" which also includes "The Old Gods and the New" and "The Gods Are Not Great". In fact, this one is even more "historical" than the other two. That means that it's set in ancient Greece and Rome. And the main characters are Greek and Roman.  The book is about the conflict between the two, who were at war for centuries at that time, in contrast to the more modern conflicts we're used to seeing today, such as in the Middle East or North America. This book can also be viewed as a political novel, but not exclusively. The characters are political activists, intellectuals and members of political parties and the book is also an allegory for the struggle for freedom that people in ancient times were experiencing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing in this book is excellent. The narrative is rich and deep, with the usual insights and information that are necessary for the reader to grasp the author's message.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read a few of the Star Trek   books and I'm really enjoying them.   This   book   has some cool stories   in it   and I like that   the writers are very involved in the   story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in the middle of a massive busy period, which meant I couldn't pick it up immediately, but I found myself happily reading the story a week later and then catching up on the last third.   The characters are well-drawn, the story well-written and the ending very satisfying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about how to use the Internet and social media effectively to interact with the world.

Thank you for such a well written and very helpful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a new and unique game, and this game does not disappoint. I do not know what I was expecting but I was pleasantly surprised.  I just finished it today, and I have to say I found it enjoyable.   This is the most difficult game out so far this year, which is an accomplishment for a 3D rpg. I found the game is challenging but not difficult. I really enjoy the storyline and the writing was great.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about the first four centuries of the Church. It tells a good story about the Church, not that the Church was a great thing (there's plenty of that in there also) but how it got started and why it has been so successful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a number of books last summer and this one has been on my shelf for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a very enjoyable book to read. I'm glad I bought this book and I plan on buying it again soon.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book.   My sister and I read it together and it was the most fun we ever had reading.  We got so engrossed in reading it that we forgot what time it was!   This book tells the story of the life of a very important person in the history of the world, and of how he used the power of the printing press to bring information to the world.  His name was George Washington.  He was a slave owner, but he used his wealth to make a better life for people and to create a republic.  I enjoyed his stories about his family, how he was treated and what he did to try to make them better.  The story about the slave-trade he describes is really sad and shocking.  George Washington didn't care how others treated slaves.  All he wanted to do was to end slavery.  If he had had the power to do it, he would have. I think people should read this book because it gives an understanding of what America was like in the 19th Century. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As with most of this series, I was excited to read the first two books in the series and to hear that it was going to be an ongoing series but I was a little disappointed when I finished reading the last book. I'm not usually a fan of books where the characters' actions lead to unintended consequences so I was hoping that the ending would be more satisfying but sadly, there's no hope in this book.   If you love romance and action, you'll love this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this to read and read and got lost in the story.    What a great story!   The author has a knack for crafting a story with suspense and suspenseful parts, but a good story can also be very fun to read.  I really enjoyed this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was not really sure what I wanted to read before I tried this book.   A couple years ago, I had a lot of trouble reading because my wife was pregnant with twins.  I had to make a big effort to read for a couple months and it took awhile to get through.  With the help of this book I finally had some time to read it all.  The first part of the book is interesting.  While the characters are interesting and the story is entertaining, the characters aren't exactly the best.  First, it's hard to buy into what the author is writing about.  This is mostly because the author seems so interested in showing his characters and their faults.  As a result, I found myself rooting against some of the characters.  However, this is not a negative for me.  Most of the authors characters are likable and likeable.  It's the characters in this book that are not.  You should really just try reading the book and if you are really interested in the characters, then by all means give it a try.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. It explains the historical and theoretical framework behind the theory and practice of the "cognitive-behavioral therapy" (CBT). It explains how the principles behind the therapy work, and how to apply them.   If you are looking for a good read with the benefit of the theory behind CBT, I would recommend this book to you!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very well done book on how to make a computer and a whole lot more!
Write a positive review about a good book:   In case there's any question about whether I'm a writer, let me put it this way: I've written five books in four years. I haven't actually written any fiction; I just write to fill time between full-time gigs. I got the idea for this book a few years ago while researching how my friend, a teacher, came up with ideas to give to her students. One of her ideas was to write down all the things she saw in class. This book is an attempt to do the same thing with my own life. I feel pretty good about the result. It has been long in the making and I'm really glad that I finally managed to do it. It's a really well-written book, and I recommend it highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The premise is the kind that I'm always in favor of, but it's the execution that really made me fall in love with the book.    The premise is about a mother, daughter, and her brother, who are running away from their life to start their own in Europe. They're taking the train to London for the night, where they plan on visiting a friend of theirs. But they're stranded on a train for 10 days, and they're forced to spend the time doing everything from eating to sleeping to going to the bathroom.  The book goes on to tell their story, how they got on the train, and how they were found.  I was very interested in the detail in describing the train.  The author did a good job describing the size and layout of the train and the various passengers, who were each given their own background story. I'm not a fan of railroading (or any train, for that matter), but this description was very well done.  It's a bit long, but I really wanted to know more about the story, and it was all done very well.  As a child, I never really experienced what the author called the "slow railroader" experience.  This book was a breath of fresh air, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a fascinating read, with some interesting aspects that I'd like to explore further.   This is an excellent read that I recommend to my fellow readers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a very good one and I think I learned something from it.    This is the third book I have bought from author and I recommend it to all people interested in writing.  This book gives good tips on how to find a good writing partner and have some fun while you are at it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very readable one! I like it, as it is written in an "advanced college text" format, I understand what the author is talking about and the author tries to make sense of the material.   Overall a good read, but it is really just a continuation of the text. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason I didn't like this book more is that the ending was so anticlimactic. The main character doesn't want to leave his family. His father tells him "the job is done, my son." He says he can't take that responsibility. He says that his father and his mother should have been there to support him when he was young. That's when he has the epiphany. He's free. The only problem was that his parents didn't want him to leave them and they didn't approve of him getting involved in the revolution. That left a big hole in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story was enjoyable and kept me reading, with some interesting characters.  The narration by John C. Flynn was good.   I enjoyed the illustrations, though the story could have used more development.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently started reading "Catching Fire," and loved it! This is the best book I've read on the subject.  I also loved the idea of having a child in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent example of what I love about The Narnia books. The story is so well written that it reads like a novel rather than a children's book. I was a little nervous at first when a Narnian showed up with a dog. But she was such a sweet soul. She was easy to get along with and always knew what I needed, which is the best kind of dog. It is a shame that the only reason you don't have the book in English is because the publisher is a little busy with her other project, which I believe is the new book "The Secret World of Mrs. T."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got hooked on this book when it was published, and read it through in three weeks (as did my mom, who I am in regular communication with, and also gave it three stars). The story is well-written and the action is interesting. The characters are all very well developed.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "   This is the book that started me on a new career.   I read the first 4 chapters and liked what I read.  It is a great read. If you are interested in writing,  this is the one book to start from."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not really the right person to review this book, but I've been meaning to read it for some time.   It's about the same size and style as some of the non-fiction I've read, but the story is a lot more serious and engaging.      
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great. If you like the "I want to eat a chicken nugget" and "I was in a rock and roll band and it sucked and it felt great" subcultures (and for sure if you have some serious teenage angst issues), this will give you a lot of stuff to chew on that won't help you grow any wiser, but will give a much needed kick to your bootstraps.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think that the book is a great read. My wife and I had an enjoyable time reading the book, and as someone who was taught the theory of relativity by Einstein in high school, this book was well researched.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got into this at the right time, i loved it from the start, and it never once let me down. The writing is good and the characters are well developed and interesting. There are many different story lines that are all equally good, and i have yet to run out of things to do with the various characters. I also really liked the way the characters were created by the author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book! Great information. It will help anyone interested in the subject of "how a child develops."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have not read the other two books in the series by the same author.   They both have been great reads, especially since it has a beginning, middle, and end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when it first came out, and I am glad I read it. I loved the story and the characters.   The language is clear.  What an excellent book: I have had this book in my hands for over three months now. It is absolutely perfect.  From the description, I thought the book would be a little longer, but the chapters are all quite short and the story never felt like it was getting bogged down in too much detail.  The book is a combination of suspense, adventure, romance and politics. It definitely does not have a happy ending, but I think most readers will be surprised at the ending because it doesn't feel forced or unrealistic. I also love the characters and I look forward to seeing the next book in the series! What a great book: This book made my day. I had been wanting to read this for a while. I am so glad I finally took the time to read it because this is just the perfect book to read when you are looking for a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read The Last Jedi last night at bedtime. I'm loving this movie! I especially like the Han Solo and Chewbacca characterizations. I think that's the key to the success of this movie. I mean, he's a Wookiee, and yet I like him because he seems to be a decent person with flaws. Also, the new characters were cool.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely adore this book. It is a beautifully written and comprehensive guide for people interested in learning Japanese. The quality of the writing is great, and the photos are superb. The book is a great resource for anyone interested in acquiring Japanese language skills. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be very helpful in learning about and understanding the difference between the types of mental illness. As someone with Borderline Personality Disorder, I was able to appreciate how the author describes the various types of symptoms of BPD and how the person can become over-preoccupied or "susceptible" to stress, or feel like they can't cope, or are "dysfunctional". This is great because for the most part, I feel that most mental illnesses are misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. As for the description of Bipolar Disorder, it made me realize what I needed to be doing to get better, and it helped me understand how to get my life back to being normal and I don't have to take medications anymore. The book was very helpful and the tips and tricks were very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A novel by the wonderful David Gerrold, a science fiction and fantasy writer, which is a classic and much-loved classic. The author's style is a bit on the dry side for me, but that's the style I like. I enjoy reading about people who live in a world of magic. The main character is a wizard who learns how to cast the magic from the great book of the gods.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, and it made me think in a new way. The story is very clever, but it does have a "tell us the ending so we have to read it" feel to it. It's very well written, but I think that if I were to make a list of my favorite science fiction books, it would probably be the books that I have been putting off, because I have some unfinished stories, and I've been looking for something that was a bit more "for me", something that would have a bit of depth that I could relate to, something that could have a strong ending. This book did that for me, so I will be reading the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was really good.  It gave a great description of the "pumpkin spice latte" concept. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and the story was well told.   My favorite part was reading about the dog's journey to the shelter. It's just what I want in a story about a dog's quest to find a home. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thoroughly impressed by a book I read a few years ago on the dangers of over-vaccination.    The authors are clearly informed, and have a scientific background, as well as experience as both medical physicians and scientists.  The book is well written, well argued, and contains many citations to studies that support the validity of vaccination.  I would encourage everyone to read the book and give it serious consideration. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've enjoyed this book. It makes for an interesting read. I really liked the discussion on how to handle people when they have a bad attitude. The stories of some of the characters in this book really brought the emotion of what I felt about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am really looking forward to reading the new books on "Moby Dick". "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" (or "The Long Goodbye") is the one I'm currently reading.   It has been a while since I've read a novel that had me so intrigued, so riveted, that I could not put it down.  If "MOBY DICK" had been around at the time of the Great Depression, it would have been a hit. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My second trip to NYC and this book was a real treasure.   While the New York trip was fun, this one is all about the city, as the author states in the preface. The food was great, and I even got to try some of their famous food.  I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to do NYC next time!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is a really awesome girl who is very intelligent and gets what she wants. She's not perfect but she's definitely smart and I liked the fact that the story didn't come across as super shallow. The ending was pretty interesting. I was also really surprised by the fact she was so popular in high school.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had this book for years, but then I got the second edition. It's the most recent book I've read on my journey with chronic illness. My husband has chronic heart failure and I had read many books about his condition. This book gave me a lot of information about how to deal with it. It was easy to follow and didn't take a lot.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read! It makes you think about how we may be taking our lives for granted! I think my son would really enjoy this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed many books on philosophy and the philosophy of mind and I am always glad to find some new books by other philosophers.   The first book I read on ethics, by Peter Singer and my favorite on ethics I have ever read, by Robin Hanson.  I do not understand why the book was not made into a film, since Singer and Hanson have a unique style.  In my opinion, the book does not say anything that cannot be found in a thousand other books on ethics.  A book should be as readable as possible without being boring. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like that this is a book that I read multiple times.   There is no obvious one thing that the author says "do this, do that".   It's a journey of discovery through a different perspective and a very well written book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It was the first book I picked up to write about the new world order as I understand it now.  I hope you are doing better than me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after doing a study of the Bible, and I felt that it really helped me to understand what's going on. The main message of the book is, "You should never believe what your religion tells you."  I know, it is hard to listen to, but if you can learn to listen, the Bible will teach you what to believe and when to believe.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The way this book relates how to find and fix a broken heart is very relevant to a lot of me and my friends. It's about an older woman who has an older lady friend who suffers from depression and this is the way the older woman deals with her illness. I can see how I would have benefited from reading more from this author. The writing is good, but is not great. I think that this book was a good idea and a great idea, but that she may have needed to cut some of the descriptions and maybe some of her "inspirational" quotes from the book to make the book less intimidating to people who don't understand what depression is and how a depression diagnosis is different than being diagnosed as a "big fat loser" who doesn't know how to live.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best works of fiction I've ever read. The style is fast-paced and has a lot of action in it, but it's also well-paced so that you can relax while you're reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so happy that I finally read this book. This is a very interesting story about the history of the world and how it has changed since the days of the Mayans. I really appreciate the details that were never included in the original book; it makes the history all the more interesting. This story was also written very well, and I didn't think the author did anything wrong.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read so many good books on the subject of cooking, but none quite like this one, which covers everything and I still learn a lot about making the best out of the simplest ingredients.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book! I haven't read a book since the late 70's with a more thorough, detailed and well researched argument than this one. There is not only a scientific background behind the theory and practice of yoga, but also a very thorough analysis of the many historical and cultural references.   The book also shows how these practices have been a part of our culture for many thousands of years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the series as a whole. I am excited to see what happens in the next book, and will be looking forward to finding out what happens next. I also enjoyed the addition of the other side. It is a real shame that the author didn't get the opportunity to develop the relationship between the two sides.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking to get into the world of the Harry Potter books. My santa had a great suggestion: I'm a fan of the Lord of the Rings series and I have a feeling that Harry Potter could be a fantastic read for me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title made me think that this book was about people who did drugs, but it's much more about a couple who lived in a drug den. I don't really like that the author uses the word 'den' here and is a bit mean, but the couple is in an uncomfortable situation.   It's a bit depressing, but I guess there are people who do drugs and want to keep their lifestyle a secret. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good summary of the basics of quantum mechanics and the theories of quantum field theory.   I am a physicist and this book is very good in terms of presenting what the theories are, and explaining how they work.  There are lots of pictures and diagrams and this is helpful for someone who may not be familiar with the theories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the best book about poly I have read.   I have never been interested in polyamory in the first place, but I was so drawn to this book that I decided I needed to find out more. I love how it is both descriptive and factual. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the greatest book I have ever read!  I am a total newbie at magic, but this book has been so valuable to me.  The book has a fantastic combination of practical tips on everything from how to do the simplest of tricks to the more complex of hand and arm tricks, to the theory and application of magic and spellwork in general.  All this in an engaging, easy-to-read format.  I have always felt that it is a waste of time trying to learn complicated magic tricks, when the trick is more enjoyable and less likely to be boring.  With this book, I know I have everything I need to do basic tricks (even the hardest ones!) and do a lot of the basics with ease.  There are also a lot more advanced techniques at the end that I had to read the book in order to take advantage of them.   I love the fact that the tricks are a little self-explanatory, which is a bonus.  Overall, the book is very easy to read and easy to use. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book a lot! It is the best of the bunch I think. I have some ideas for others to read. I just don't have the time to read them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book! I have never found one that is so clearly written that you could read it quickly, then get into the meat of the book.   I'm enjoying the plot and characters, as well as the many examples of how one could use the information provided.  I'll be back for more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing is very good. The story is original, interesting and captivating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been an avid reader of this series for many years and have read it in the old hard copy. I'm pleased with how thoroughly I have absorbed the book and have been entertained.    The story is fun and light and doesn't waste time on tedious details like the history of war or details of foreign culture. It's more of a story about how people can be friends or enemies depending on their attitudes.  A great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't mind bad book. I read every book I can get my hands on. I'm a very avid reader. I got hooked on this book and read it in a week. It really kept me engaged in the story and I enjoyed it as much as I did the others I have read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved it.   It made me feel good about being a girl.  This book makes it clear to everyone, it's okay to like girls and to like things about girls.  And yes, there's also some pretty rough sex.  But it's not for everyone, but if you like reading about girls, you will like this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy science, history and philosophy, this is a great book.   A brilliant and thorough introduction to philosophy and to ancient Greek thought.  This book is very helpful, especially in the beginning stages of becoming an expert in a subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book's title gives away what the book is about. The author's premise is that the American people are now living in a bubble of ignorance and self-delusion. This book is a quick and easy read. The book is very thought provoking and provides valuable information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I was hooked from the first page.   The writing is excellent!   I was fascinated by all the different facets and aspects of human behaviour.  I found the way that the author made use of words to explain the meaning of the actions that she describes fascinating.  I learned a great deal from this book.  The only complaint I have is with the cover."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book back in 1998 and thought it was just a little above average. However, since then, it has made a dramatic jump up my "read if you like this" list. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really an eye opener for me, because I never thought I'd ever see a white woman in a relationship with black men.  This book took me from being angry to being in awe, and I think the experience is very helpful to my personal life.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, but it is missing a few essential pages of exposition.   It is easy to get distracted by the wonderful, and sometimes bizarre, details, but I did not enjoy the entire book for the story alone.  I enjoyed the characters and their lives, and I liked the twists and turns in the plot.  However, in this book I felt that the story was a bit rushed, and that it was a little confusing to understand.  The book does not have a whole lot of humor, but for a fantasy novel it did have some funny moments. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book on the history of chess and its importance to people's lives and careers.   I read the first book in a series, then bought this one in paperback and have been playing and teaching this game for years now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleased to find that my teacher read to me, instead of having me memorize things. I loved this book so much and I am very excited to read the rest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you don't understand the concept of "I am the hero of the story" by the end of this story, then I can't see what's good about it at all. I can see what I didn't understand.   The author had to have some real issues with himself. I think he should have just kept writing about how weird he is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been interested in ancient Greek philosophy, but had never taken a course in ancient Greece or studied ancient Greek. This book has made that happen for me.  I do not understand the Greek language, but I am reading this book as a means to getting myself to understand it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been on the lookout for a long time for a good, entertaining history of the war in Afghanistan. The subject is fascinating, and the writing is clear and crisp, with a strong thesis to back it up.   A few errors, but very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm always on the look out for a good novel. In fact I'm so excited about this novel that I'm not reading it as well as I can, which is bad. The author wrote this great book so fast, it's easy to see the first draft of the book, and it's a great read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The cover is beautiful.  I have the paperback edition.  It's got a nice cover with the red and blue of the ocean.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book. I can't remember why I have not read it before (it's just not that good).   One of the best books I've read.   As mentioned in the previous comment, I think the author's writing style is fairly good. However, I really struggled to understand the main character's thoughts (as well as his actions) throughout the book. He appears to be just trying to keep everyone safe, but he doesn't seem to truly understand what that actually means. As I started to think more about his situation, I was thinking that the situation is just too complicated for someone of his age. I understand it's just a book, but it just seems like the author was just making things up for the sake of making the story interesting. It would have been better if the author had taken a more simplified approach to the situation, or made a simple choice that was obviously correct.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in what will hopefully be a great series. I have been in the mood to read more SF/F/F and this was a great start. It will likely be followed by another book in the same universe. I hope this book doesn't stop being a series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book years ago and thought it was very good and would like to read more by her.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had never read anything like this before. There are so many layers to the story, and I loved the way the author put together the stories of everyone's past. It is so heart-wrenching.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a student I really enjoyed this book, which helped to improve my research and writing.     I can recommend this book to anyone who needs to be able to write a book on his or her own.  I can't recommend it highly enough!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read. In short: it is well written. It has a good tone to it and is a great example of the kind of work that is being done in the "alternative" scene. I liked it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many books but this is the first one that I enjoyed very much. My mother is dying of cancer and I was very touched by the beautiful, very realistic story of a person who was given a diagnosis of cancer in her 40s and had to face her fate. It made me think about how much the illness affects my life and I will definitely re read this one.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    For a book that has been out for so long, I found this book to be a fun read. The characters are realistic, the plot is interesting and the plot development was a pleasant surprise. I was pleased with the book.   I had no idea this story was going to be so emotional and I was quite surprised at the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a good overview of some of the fundamentals that you need to know in order to use the C language. It is a very good book, in fact, it is the first in the series I ordered. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The one in which I first found a love for the genre.   I've read some of my own favorite sf books, but this one was the first one that I read that really made me want to know more.  I haven't read much YA SF/F (though it's always good to see young adults reading sf) but the more I think about it, the more it looks like it will have staying power. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent and highly recommended, especially for those of us who are interested in the ancient Near East and are interested to understand the rise of Christianity.   I am interested in ancient Near Eastern civilization because I study the history of Christianity, and this book helped me to understand why and how Christianity took root in the Near East.  I also read this book because I'm interested in how the Roman Empire influenced ancient Near Asian civilizations.  This volume is highly recommended for everyone who is interested in exploring the cultural influences of the Roman empire. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great and interesting read.   I think the author does a fantastic job at explaining the reasons why people are left in abusive situations, but she leaves out some of the really tough ones.  I found myself looking up some of her experiences for specific reasons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My grandfather on my mother's side is a retired general officer and one of the greatest of all officers in the army. He was an amazing soldier and the best husband I have ever known. I remember reading a book on him in high school which he gave me. I am so glad that it's been out of print, I read it once or twice back in the day and it was a great read. I will always be grateful to have such a great grandfather who taught me so much. I don't have many great grandfathers in my life, but this was one of them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book about the history of the Jewish people. It is a great way to get familiar with the early history of Israel and the Jewishness of Jews in the ancient world. It explains Jewish history with a thoroughness I have never seen in other books on this subject. The language is clear, and I have not come across another book of this nature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful read and I'm not one to waste my time on books with low content. This book has plenty of good info. It's more of a summary than a comprehensive overview so don't go off the deep end with this one.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got my hands on the    " A Guide to Caring for Your Cat"  which was written by a woman who is in the medical profession.   It is filled with tips on how to better care for our feline family members, including the fact that one of my cats died because of neglect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just finished this book and found it an excellent book. It was a lot of fun to read and I really enjoyed the way the author explained the theory behind the subject. Although I had never heard of it, I was very intrigued and felt that the concepts presented in the book would be useful in any serious student of mathematics.   I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in advanced mathematical concepts and to students of mathematics in any subject!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say enough good things about this book. It was excellent, and the author made it easy to follow with an informative, informative, highly enjoyable read.   Overall, the book is an excellent, interesting and thought-provoking read. I am now looking forward to my next book in this series, and I've been meaning to pick this one up for a while now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the concept. I just don't really like the final product. I'm not sure the writer is trying to get me to change my way of thinking about things, but she did it anyway. I don't like the way it ends, the way the characters behave, the dialogue. The author did a good job of bringing her themes into the story, but it doesn't make up for the bad writing and bad execution of the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a very brief review, this book will appeal to a lot of people. In fact, I've already read the second edition which I highly recommend to anyone who likes adventure stories. The character development is good and the story is pretty well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my second time reading The Catcher in the Rye   I don't like it very much at first because the main character is a moron but in the end I like how he makes it through 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just read 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' by Jared Diamond and it changed my life!   This book is a must-have.   It's an excellent compilation of research and historical facts on global history and how we came to be where we are today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really great and thought-provoking book by a professional, well-read and thoughtful scholar.  The story is very well written, and it provides a very good basis for understanding the historical background of the various social movements during the twentieth century.   The book is available from an excellent online library,  http://www.kentucky.edu/. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, this book is a must read for anyone interested in the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The book presents a detailed and comprehensive account of King's life, and of the challenges he faced throughout his lifetime. As a historian, I also found the book very detailed and well organized.   The book makes a strong case for the importance of King as a human being and a leader, and I highly recommend it.  I just started reading the Life of Martin Luther. I am very glad I did, and am eagerly looking forward to the rest of the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been searching for a book to read but this one just took over my life and filled in all the gaps.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading this book it brought a smile to my face.   My husband and I loved this book as much as the author.  She did a good job at explaining what the difference is and the benefits of taking a vitamin.  This is an excellent book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Bible of the Left" is the bible of what the Bible is about. The book was written by the author and editor of a journal called The New Left.   What really makes this book valuable is the ability to read it in a scholarly, objective way, not in the way the author, Michael Harrington, does it.  The book can be a useful tool for anyone interested in religion, politics, or history.  I especially recommend it to the religious on this site, and to anyone who wants a good, serious book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very pleased with this book and highly recommend it to others, both for its historical context and as a good introduction to the subject. The authors give excellent historical background and a well-written account of the first three years of the British campaign in Ireland. I was struck by how many people (mostly former members of the army) were involved in the planning and preparation of the campaign.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a great book. The author writes at the beginning about how she writes on her lunch break (that's an hour-long break she takes, every week or so). She tells of her own first-time writing experience, how she had trouble getting started but the book she wrote after the first week was really good. So much so that she decided to make the writing a full time career, which is a great story. The book is not an easy read, but you'll have the good bits and you won't need an hour's worth of time to read the rest. This book was very well-written. It has the best cover I've seen, and it made my day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A solid little book by an intelligent and well-known thinker.   I've enjoyed listening to his thoughts on the nature of thought and its relationship to reality.  I think he could have improved on some points in this work, but this book is a must-have for all of those with an interest in epistemology.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was thrilled with the depth of research and the ability of the author to make me truly understand the problems with the country that we live in.   And to this day I still feel a deep sense of sadness that we've lost nearly a third of our population since 1970.  I also enjoyed the idea of living in a world without money and a lack of privacy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about a difficult subject.   It was an eye opening read and I've found myself wondering what I have been doing wrong and what I can do to improve my writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book on the basics of programming.   The content and explanation are both good and there are plenty of exercises and activities throughout the book.  This book is definitely the best introduction I have read to programming in its entirety. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the concept of a "family-like" society where men live with their parents, and women take care of the children and work. I think this idea has a lot of merit.   The story is interesting, and is a great introduction to the world of "the world" characters.  It is also interesting that the book's world is set in a place other than the present day, so it's nice to be able to imagine a future where this is still going on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It's a fun, fun, good read.  The author is just likeable and a good storyteller.  I also enjoyed the references and images (like the scene in the first part about the boy with the dog.)  I'm going to re-read this one because I want to understand more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book! I had a problem with this book for a while because I found the author's opinion on the matter to be rather condescending. However, after reading the book, it became clear that, yes, I was wrong.   What I really thought was that the author thought that the Bible didn't support a literal interpretation of marriage.  But then he goes on to support a variety of interpretations including polygyny, polygamy, and same-sex marriage. (In the end, he finds his way to an understanding of marriage as monogamy, with same-gender and opposite-gender couples. He doesn't think that there is such a thing as a heterosexual marriage.)
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is definitely one of those "good, but not great" books that is so good it leaves the reader wanting more. There are some very important points made throughout this book that I would have liked to have seen more of in the first and second editions. The book starts out fairly dry and then quickly takes off. After a few chapters it starts to pick up and the story begins to take off. I really liked the characters and it was good to see them having some sort of a connection to each other. The plot was a bit odd and strange at times, but I liked that the book was a little odd and oddy. I'd definitely recommend this book to a book lover like myself!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is pretty simple and the prose is clean. The story can be made deeper by putting in more background (such as the death of a parent or an aunt) and making sure that the characters are portrayed well.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful read. I have been interested in Buddhism for some time now, but this is the first book that I have read about it that actually explains its doctrines. I found the explanations very interesting and enlightening. If you are interested in Zen, Buddhism, and the philosophy behind them, I would highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The books of Robert B. Parker are often dark, serious, and a little depressing. But not with this one. It is an amazing tale about an unlikely hero, who has overcome many struggles to become a hero of justice. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the true story of Jesse James, and all the complications that have come from his heroic exploits. Parker is a real life "hero" and I look forward to reading his book. "

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book. It is very well written and provides a nice review of current research in neuroscience that can be helpful for the neurosciences and other fields.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.   It is a very well written book that explains all aspects of writing that I was unaware of and has helped me to grow in my craft.  This book is definitely worth the read  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing style is good, the writing is good. It's just that the story is over-long. The ending, though, was unexpected. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always wanted to read the 'lost volumes' of the Bible, but had always found the subject difficult. As I read this book, however, I was very impressed with the effort and scholarship made to assemble the missing volumes.   In particular, the use of modern translators and a thorough research technique made this a delight to read.  It would be easy to skim through these pages and get lost, but if you are interested in the topic, it will certainly be worth the effort to peruse the entire work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book with a lot of information, and it helps me. I am not a psychologist, but my best friend is one, and she told me to do this, and so I am doing this. I just want to say that it will take some time and patience to learn to live with all of this.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the analysis, the fact that it was well written, and that it had some interesting perspectives on the modern world.   The discussion of the evolution of religion, politics, and education were both interesting and thought provoking, and I enjoyed the discussion of modern culture and the influence of religion on it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book. I had been having problems with depression and anxiety, but this book gave me hope that I could get through it and get better. It helps you see that it's possible to get through any depression or anxiety. The best part is you don't have to suffer in silence. It shows you what you can do to get better, without going into the dark. It made me want to get my life back together.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book that finally gave me the courage to begin to believe in my own ability and to do what I want to do with my life.   The book is very well-researched, clear, and I have learned a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book's title is "The Great American Novel: An Appreciation," but the book is a serious read, well worth reading. It's a thorough analysis of what made the American novel unique and worth pursuing. There's some bad writing (notably in the chapters on the '50s and the '60s, though those are easily forgiven, particularly by the readers of a nonfiction work), but the authors are generally correct. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason for this book's popularity is the story told in the beginning. The idea of a young man who has been raised by wolves and knows nothing of their true nature really makes for an interesting and suspenseful read. It is easy to read this book, especially since the author did an excellent job at portraying a wolf.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book by a self-help author I can honestly say I liked and recommended to others. It's not perfect, but it's very easy to read.   It's got a lot of great stuff, and I recommend it to anyone who is struggling to be happier, and to be more self-aware.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book, I am very glad I read it.   The characters were well portrayed and their problems were well written.  It was just a little slow for my taste, but overall I enjoyed it.  Review by: kyle - Verified Buyer Great book, loved it!   If you've got any issues with the game, you need to find a way to deal with them, not keep on trying to fix what you can't.  I liked that it was not going to be a full length game, but I can see where the publisher thought it could be.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books and this one is just that: awesome! I've read several books about magic, witchcraft and the occult that have been pretty boring but this one was way more entertaining and I never felt bored.   The magic is well explained and it's great to have all the pieces explained at the same time, even if there is more to them than what I initially guessed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the last 3-4 chapters before I got a chance to finish the first book in the series. I love the first half of this book and enjoyed it well enough to get through the final chapters. I'll have to read the other books in the trilogy to fully enjoy this book, though.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed the book, and am now getting ready for the next one.

I think that this is one of the best books I have read in years.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best novel I have read in a while! I enjoyed the book and the story line. I liked how it was told and how the character of Mrs. Brown was used as the backbone of the story.   I like the style of writing and the dialogue. I especially liked the characters and how they were created and how much time they had to develop. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am glad I listened to this. The author makes the case for human rights as a result of the rights they have enjoyed and continue to enjoy. The world I live in is not perfect. We have our share of problems with people and institutions. However, we do not have our place in this world. This book is a good step to move us to take responsibility for our own lives. - L.H. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is great! A good read from beginning to end. My husband is not a big book person, so this was very nice to have as a gift. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book fascinating.   It provides an in depth and nuanced view of the various aspects of a system that has evolved over many centuries and is still evolving.  The book touches on a multitude of historical events such as the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the birth of Buddhism, and the evolution of Christianity.  I did not come away with a clear-cut conclusion on which system or belief system was superior.  However,  my interest in the subject did not wane as I gained a greater appreciation of the history of Christianity and an appreciation of how many aspects of Christianity have been incorporated into the other systems.  This book will be read by many people and will be used as a good reference for anyone interested in studying comparative religion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a fascinating study of early Christianity. One of the best features of this book is the way in which it is organized. I have no problem following the authors' approach to the subject, but I find that some of the chapters could have been organized more in a conventional way, particularly chapters 3-10.   In any case, this is a well written book on early Christian history and theology, and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book has a number of important points about the way the world works that, although often stated by various people, seem to have been forgotten. Some of these points are so obvious that they have become second nature to me. For example, the "power" to change oneself (to become a better person, in the way that he could become the best at his chosen job) is a well-known fact. But the book, although written by a well educated scientist, doesn't seem to believe this. In his opinion, people can only develop the power to change their inner being, not the inner being to change themselves. This leads to problems.   He also argues that a person can only learn to change one particular thing (such as an eye color) in the short-term. For many other things, he believes that it is too complicated for people to change. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think that it prevents a person from living the life that he or she truly wants. I find this book to be good for the people who have a tendency to get too involved in everything. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never read a book in a while and I didn't want to miss a chance to re-read one. So I got this book. I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King, but this is probably his best, so far. I found it to be an interesting mix of fantasy and horror. I enjoyed how the book was written.   It has some good points and some bad points, I'm just not that much of a fan of King. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character and the world-building are well done, and the writing is good.  The only part I dislike is the part about the protagonist's parents (which I think is a cop-out).

Write a positive review about a good book:   I purchased this book to read for class on a subject I am interested in. I like to read about scientific things (like chemistry) and the author has some interesting things to say.   A lot of the subjects he discusses are not really my field so it was interesting to learn about them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The description says it all: This is one of the best books I have ever read.   This is my favorite type of book- it is so interesting, but not too confusing, and it is written in an engaging style.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book.   The cover is pretty, the title is a good description of what it's all about, and the characters are very well developed.  An excellent book with a little flaw:  The main characters are not exactly who they seem to be.  They were very well written and very real to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. The narration was very good, and the story was intriguing. I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction, so I was glad to have read a book about the Civil War.   This was a great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am still a newbie to the craft of writing and had no idea there were so many rules for it, so this book is an absolute godsend.   This book has everything I needed to be a better writer: tips on how to structure your novel (perfectly), how to make a good first impression, a checklist of what to avoid and what to keep in mind when writing, and other tips for editing and promotion.  I will be using these to improve my writing and I can not wait for the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As far as I know, this is the only book on child development I have read.  I like this book because it focuses on the developmental aspects of the brain and nervous system.   There is a lot of information that a parent must absorb.  If you are like me and have to reread the last few chapters a couple of times, this book will make the process much smoother. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been searching for an alternative to conventional medicine for some time now and this book provided a lot of good information on how to take care of yourself. I was pleasantly surprised that the information was actually applicable to many illnesses, not just osteoarthritis. The author provides a lot more in-depth information on health-related topics in the book. The book is well written and the information is accessible.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I picked this up. It was well written, and while the story is obviously very long, it's not long enough to be boring.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The two main characters are the most likeable and interesting people in the book, but they're both rather dull.   It's fun and clever, but not much else.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In my early 30s I discovered a book about the great Italian explorer Francesco Redi. This book gave me a deeper appreciation of my Italian heritage.   After reading this book I felt I could learn so much about my own country and history from this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favourite is The Good Earth by Bill McKibben.   He's done a very good job of summarizing the scientific literature on climate change.   It's hard to understand the politics of climate change (which is the real tragedy here) without the context provided by climate scientists.  This book really made it clear to me why we need to do something about climate change, and the politics and inertia are just going to keep the problem from being solved. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must have for those seeking a good mystery.   This book has so many twists and turns that it's impossible to figure out what's going to happen next.  The characters are realistic.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    For some reason, I have never been a fan of history books, mostly because they seem to be full of boring historical minutia. I found the historical events detailed in this book fascinating, as well as the personalities involved.   I had no idea of what was going on in the Soviet Union at the time of the war, and this book fills in the gaps. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a while ago, and I like it very much. I like the story very much, I like how it's told, I think it's a good story, and although I'm no expert in the area of medieval literature, I do like this author's work.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I read the book. It's about a man, his girlfriend, and their first kiss. It starts off a little slow, but picks up. After that, it's a fun ride. " It was easy to get hooked on reading this book. I'll be picking this book up again.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book that has given me insight into my own mind.   I was always a big fan of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, but I never understood how it was possible to fit the human species into the evolutionary model.  This book gives a good description of that concept.  The author explains that the human brain evolved in such a way that it was hard-wired to believe the existence of a superior species, even though we could not see any.  And, as Darwin said, "the soul in man is a temple of immortality, which is a gift from God."  So, if the book makes you think, "Man is the smartest thing on earth!," then you are doing it right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A few months ago, I came across a book titled The Boy Who Would Be Queen, and I enjoyed it immensely. I thought I would read it again because I would like to know what she's up to.   I was not disappointed.  She's an exceptional writer, and the characters are real. I particularly liked the way the main character, a boy who's supposed to be a girl, was "transitioning."   She said it was her "true self" that was revealed, and she used a pronoun for her own "other self."  And, I agree.  I think it's a really awesome concept, and I would definitely read more from this author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking forward to reading this book for quite a while now. The first sentence made me want to read it all day.  I love the style of writing, the thoughtfulness of the characters and their reactions to each other.    The only thing that bothers me is that this was a collection of short stories.  If the characters had been in a book I would have given it more than five stars.

The book starts with a good overview of different meditation methods and then moves on to discuss various aspects of the practice, including the pros and cons of each one.  I think that the book could be improved by including additional information such as a list of recommended resources for further reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I got this book as part of my last month of medical school. I had read it before, and enjoyed it, but this time I read it more carefully. I think I'll be buying more of her books."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book    It is easy to understand and very useful   I had a very bad experience with one of these books. This is a book about the relationship between an old guy (the narrator) and his son, who is not in a good mood and does not want to eat dinner with the narrator. The narrator is not too concerned with his feelings about the boy (who, for the sake of argument, is now his granddaughter). The book tries to get the son to be better about his feelings toward the grandfather. He tries to show the son a good example of how to live a happy life with a grandfather. The old man, however, is not happy about being pushed around and is unhappy with the way the son is treating him.  In conclusion, I would avoid this book at all costs. This book is filled with so many negative examples and it would be a huge waste of time and energy for anyone to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "It is very easy to read; the narration is good. It is a fun read!   This book is one of those novels where you are enthralled by the prose and the story.   I will definetely re-read this book!"

However, the writing style felt a bit archaic (i.e. 'we all know that by now,' 'I was waiting for this to come out,' 'no need to go on about how it's the best book ever' etc.).  I'm sure I'll be reading more fantasy, but I'm worried that it will become boring.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. While I am not very creative in my writing, this book helped me do a lot better. I'm not a professional but this book definitely helped me in some things, I have never used Photoshop before but it was very easy and very enjoyable. I will have to learn the computer and I have a book for it at some point... 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must have for anyone interested in ancient Greek history, especially since it is now being published by Cambridge University Press.   The author, Ewan Thompson is a world class historian and has written many books in the field.  The quality of the writing is excellent, and it is well researched. The chapter which is the most interesting to me is about the Hellenistic world.  I had already read this book before, but the new edition has some good updates on some important subjects, and the style of the text has not changed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book for those who are new to Buddhism, those who want to learn more, and those who like to keep up with current literature. As a teacher, I enjoy this book most because of the "tacit" parts. For example, if you have never been to a Buddhist temple, you will learn that this is not your typical temple experience. This is one of the main reasons why I liked the book. It is good that the author includes many photos to demonstrate the process of the process.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I got into the Harry Potter series a couple years ago, but we were looking for a more recent series. We had heard that this was a wonderful book series, so we started at the beginning.  We enjoyed each book, and the stories had lots of charm and humor.   The book series was very detailed and easy to understand.  The series was easy to start and ended up lasting almost two years.  My son started on the second book and now is finished. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been using this book and it's been useful. I read this and my husband recommended it to me. It's not about getting the answers but it's a good read about how the process goes, about the reasons people believe different things and what they think the answer is. The last chapter of the book is "Solving the Mystery of the Unsolved Murder of Sarah Gajda" and it is full of interesting information.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the 1980's I read a book called "Crisis in American Culture" by sociologist Steven Miller. In his analysis, the economic collapse that occurred in the late 70's and early 80's was a 'flash crash' that wiped out the values that we were taught as a result of a very long period of growth in the U.S.   He points out that our system is built on a very narrow base and that it can be easily destroyed.  He uses this to make some interesting points that have proven to be very useful to me in life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book.    It is so clear and well researched.    It is also very practical.  And it teaches people how to make a living in the arts by not working.  I will definitely use this book. 9 of 9 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book about the lives of some of the world's greatest geniuses.  This book will leave you in awe and wanting more.   I got a copy on Amazon, and the shipping was great, and I got to enjoy a book I enjoyed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It took me a little time to get around to it (I'm not much of a reader), but it is definitely worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character has an interesting plot and interesting ideas, but in the end she is stuck in the boring, repetitive plot line.   I can't give this book 5 stars because of that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It's an interesting concept for a book and a very well researched and well written book. I love the premise of people growing up as robots, but it's very different from my other robot novels. The idea is neat, and the concept is not really something you can fully grasp without going into the depth. But it is very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a really good book, one of my favorites of 2015.  I loved the depth of the story (for both characters and a plot) and the way it was structured (as a story rather than a series).  The story is great and has a great ending, especially for this author.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy this one because it's not the typical romance with a strong ending, but rather one where the characters actually grow. I especially like how the book is very well written and doesn't overuse words. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read a few books on the subject of mental health and had never tried to address the issue from that perspective but this is a terrific book.   It gives a very clear and comprehensive overview of the field and provides a lot of information from which I'm now in a good position to understand the subject in greater detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It has been a year and a half since I first started reading this, and I am still discovering things that are particularly good.   For example, while I am sure I will probably keep re-reading the series as it continues, I have learned so much about the characters from the novel, so far.  I also think that it is very funny and has a lot of character development, especially for the main protagonist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was totally surprised by this book.   It is a short, easy to read book that I read in one sitting with a large cup of coffee.  The writing is quick, easy and enjoyable.  I loved all the details and did not feel bored.  This book could have been shorter if it contained less details but there was enough to interest me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    For a good adventure story, I think this book is above average. The main character is likable, and there is a bit of a twist and some plot twists which I found interesting. The writing is also good and the author does a good job of keeping you interested. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "What a great book! In a genre full of clichés, the author avoids them and succeeds in writing a unique story with well-drawn characters that don't rely on any of the clichés of the genre.  The best part of this book for me was the final chapter when the characters finally realize how the things they do have consequences for the others and that sometimes consequences need to be faced." - Kalee F.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book about one of the last remaining American heroes.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was hesitant at first to purchase this book since I am a bit squeamish about science fiction and fantasy, but I'm so glad I did.   The main characters are very likeable, and even though the story is a bit hard to follow (at least at first), there is lots of great adventure and fun to be had.  My only complaint is that I found myself wanting a little more detail on the time-travel plot.  But if you can read science fiction, you definitely should. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book. This book gives you a complete picture of how to start and run a successful gym. If you are the type that needs more than a general fitness and health book, then this is for you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I read this book together on our own.    I loved it.  The characters were fun, the story well told and the writing was great.  We loved the plot and the fact that this book was published in 2008 instead of 2002 is a plus. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the story but hated the ending. The ending was completely disappointing and I really wanted to like it, but I don't.   I've seen other people say they loved it, so I'm not sure if they are wrong or not.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad that I read this book, as it provided an eye-opening look at the impact of our culture on our children, and especially children whose mothers may not have known what to do when their boys were "different." I learned a lot from this book and hope to share this with my daughter, who will be 5 when this book comes out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very good. I like how it is a bit of everything, such as biographies, history of the people and places mentioned in the book, and more. It's fun to read, but not overly so, especially with how it wraps things up.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My book is a quick read. Very entertaining, and an excellent read for a first-time reader. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:    While this book is not really science fiction, it's quite good fun. I enjoyed the story and some of the minor characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful introduction to the basics of using the calculator. The author has done an excellent job of explaining the basic functions and explaining the terminology as well as the calculation results.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book about learning to fly.   I got to the point where I could fly in formation (about 30-35 feet off the ground) using only my eyes and a simple combination of a small stick and rudder pedal, and then I could really go.  It didn't take me very long, but I did have to go through a lot of practice.  I don't have the exact numbers, but it must have taken about 2 hours or so per week for a good month, but my technique improved a great deal.  And after the month, I managed to get my instructor to do an open-seat aerobatic competition with me (at a field where he flies).   And I got it down to a science: It turns out that you can fly pretty well without moving your body at all.  But it really is hard to do that in the beginning, and it's even harder to do in the last few days of an open seat.  All in all, an excellent book, one that is much more focused on the process than the results. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I have read since I picked up the original trilogy    I had hoped the book would be shorter, but it ends on a cliffhanger   A quick synopsis   An excellent character study, great dialogue, fun characters and lots of action.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    While I'm sure I would have enjoyed the book more if I hadn't finished all the way through first, I still enjoyed it, it was pretty good.   I will definitely be looking for this book when I've got more free time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am always interested in reading novels and this book was a very good read. The world building was interesting.   Also, the narrator was very good and the characters were well developed and interesting. The book was also very easy to read and very quick to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very happy to have this book available as part of my curriculum. I am a high school senior in an urban public school system and I have been reading the same textbooks my entire life. This book has really opened my eyes to different ways of looking at the world.   If the main purpose of a textbook is to give the student a textbook to refer back to throughout the semester, then this book is a complete failure in doing this.  I now look at the text as a reference point.  The book contains references to many other authors as well, but they all work with the same framework.  I have read numerous books on the topic of American history, but this one is the only one that really made me question some of the things that I've learned. I do understand that I am doing something very different from my classmates, but still, it's a bit disconcerting to learn that this kind of history is actually taught in public schools. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A well written book that contains a lot of useful information. The author explains the different types of hair loss, how they are treated and the different treatments that are available. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished The Great Gatsby.   It is a great read, with plenty of historical facts and interesting details.  The writing is wonderful.  I was pleasantly surprised.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am reading "The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, and the Rise of America's Secret Government" (St. Martin's Press, November 2, 2015) by John Prados. It is an exciting account of a very important but little-known chapter in U.S. foreign policy. A few years before Kennedy took office, he had been approached by a retired CIA official named Edward J. Lansdale, who wanted to use his contacts in the intelligence community to influence the White House. The Dulles brothers, as it happens, were in the middle of running the CIA, and Lansdale wanted to establish a working relationship with them. When they agreed to meet, Lansdale and the Dulleses discussed the possibility of using the CIA's assets in South America to destabilize and control those countries. Dulles thought this would give the United States a strategic advantage in an expanding world situation. Lansdal... "When the meeting ended, Dulles asked Lansdale if there was anything the agency should do. Lansale replied that the CIA should use its influence with the Vatican, especially in Latin America, to force the Catholic Church to support American policy. Dulless agreed, but added that the Dullers were interested in "another thing," "a new weapon." In the middle was a report on the Vatican's relations with the CIA. The report revealed the agency's close cooperation with the Jesuits, and said the CIA was more involved in the Vatican than in any other country. Dull was impressed. The CIA would no longer have to rely on the Jesuit network. "I felt that he was serious about trying to get a grip on the CIA," says Prados, who had been given permission to interview CIA agents for this book."
Write a positive review about a good book:    My friends and I are always asking each other,  "What were you thinking when you were making that choice?" and I think this book     is the answer to that.   The book makes   clear that the "lazy" is not the opposite of the "productive" person (though many people believe that).   There is a difference between the lazy person and the "good" one.  A person with "poor impulse control" is much more likely to have bad decisions because it is easier.  However, a "good and lazy" person may do more with the resources they have.  And a good and lazy person can be a leader. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was really good.   It was really well written and illustrated,   and made you really think about your own behavior.  It also did a great job of helping women realize how much men can mess with them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm writing a history of the war that involves all sorts of people, some of them famous, some who were not so well-known. The author manages to provide us with an interesting story and a well-crafted narrative.   If I were writing this book I'd have to make sure that some of the information is accurate, but I am having an easier time than I had expected with this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and I hope to use some of the information I learned in it to help me as a high school physics teacher. It took me a long time to find the right book but this was the one I found! I am so excited to be studying at an accredited school for the next several years.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A classic for the seasoned horror fan.   I am a fan of horror so I love this one.  The author writes very well, the stories are creepy, and the monsters are well done.  I'd recommend this to a horror aficionado or a horror fan like myself.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been interested in reading a biography of George Washington for years.   It has been out of print for some time, but thanks to the internet I found an excellent new edition in paperback.  Unfortunately, the biography has some typos and misprints.  If you want a good biography of Washington, you should read this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read several other books about meditation. This book was the best. There were a few problems with it, like not including any references to the previous books. But, other than that, this is a very good book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very interesting, but the real fun was seeing how it relates to the work I have been doing for the past four years and how much I learned along the way. I have had a lot of trouble staying on top of my meditation practice due to the fact that I have become over-stimulated. While I am still working on this aspect, this book definitely helped me to stay focused and organized.   I also highly recommend the book if you are interested in learning more about meditation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book to read because it looked intriguing and was just a good read.  The premise is good:  An autistic child goes on a quest with an older man to find his lost autistic brother. Unfortunately, he gets lost and gets killed.  In the end, the older man is not so different from the older son in this novel.  This is a great read for the younger children because it includes many different examples of various autistic characters and how different they can be.  Overall, I would recommend this to people who are looking for a good reading for the autism spectrum. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would say I enjoyed this book, although there were a couple of sections where it felt very dry.   This book focuses on the life of Martin Luther, but does not delve into the whole of his life.  The best parts of this book are the biographies of his followers and writings of his wife.  This was a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book.   While I am still learning the history of the American Revolution, I have gained a much deeper knowledge of the history and culture of colonial America from this book. I also appreciate the author's knowledge of this period.  For example, the French were not the only Europeans to come to the colonies in the 17th century, and while they may have left some bitter feelings in their wake, their arrival was a positive development for the colonists.  Overall, I am very happy with the work that was put into this book and I recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not perfect, but it's a great book with lots of useful ideas and I learned a lot from it.   This book is very accessible to beginners and veterans alike.  I plan to order it again.  It would be great to have a book like this that is easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers many bases.    I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a deeper understanding of modern economics, economics in general, and the role of money in the modern economy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm pretty sure it was the first book I've ever read by a woman that made me want to read more by her.   She is amazing and I highly recommend this to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very much looking forward to a sequel to this book! It really made me think of what we could be doing with these different types of people as a society. It also gave me a whole new outlook on the world. I enjoyed the philosophical side as well. I can't wait to see what happens next.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a very nice introduction to medieval art history. The style of presentation is a bit dated but the book is a wonderful resource.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I have a hard time doing research at the library, so having the entire book available at my fingertips is very important. The authors are excellent and the writing is very clear. It doesn't take that long to read, and I'm not afraid to put it down at any point. It makes me feel like I'm in the know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author makes some really good points about why a particular approach to teaching English to foreigners is superior to others, and it's all backed up with some great anecdotes from real students and teachers.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, and I'd highly recommend it. It's got a great story about the origins of Christianity and there are a number of useful historical, cultural, and archaeological insights. I especially liked the emphasis on the Christian church as a social institution. I thought it was well-written, and it left me with a feeling of accomplishment.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this novel with interest, as I love sci-fi.    The writing style is excellent, the premise is compelling and the characters are complex and believable.  It is a short novel and the only problem is that I found it a little slow at the start.  However after I got past the slow part it became a great read.  See more ▼ See less ▲ Cats And Dogs: The True Story Of The Dog That Saved My Life By Peter Bregman By Sarah Vowell My daughter was in the hospital for a few days and I had to come up with something to entertain her.  So I gave her the book "Cats and Dogs" by Peter Brugman, an acclaimed author who writes science fiction and fantasy.  Brugmans book is about a dog that helps a child survive during a zombie apocalypse, one of his friends dies in the apocalypse and now there's only him, the dog and one other child left to survive. I have seen the film by Robert Rodriguez and this book would be an excellent addition to my bookshelf.   The only thing is that Brugeman's dog doesn't actually save the child.  He saves one another.   I thought it was a funny book and had a good time reading it.  I also thought the end was kind of lame though I might just have grown up! See More ▼See Less ▲
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my second time reading the book, and I would highly recommend it. I'm a little bit of an introvert and this book has made me a lot more outgoing, especially around women.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not quite sure what I expected, exactly, but I was really impressed with this book. It's a collection of anecdotes, and a lot of them are very funny.   It's kind of funny how much she's written about the very same topics over the years, but now they are told more in a humorous way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A really fun read. Good characters. I'm always looking for a book that doesn't take itself too seriously, but The Princess Bride just has it right. It's one of the few book series I still read from cover to cover. And it is one of my favorite books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this because it is not just about learning the keyboard - it's about having the skill to be able to use the keyboard, a skill that will serve you well if you get into programming.   It does provide a bit of instruction at the beginning on how to use your keyboard, and how to type, but you have to be a bit lazy to take those steps (and that is a nice thing about it).   For me, I'm learning a lot by using it, but it still took me a while to figure out what to do with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised to find this book. I had seen it on the shelves of various library bookshelves, but did not think it would be much use for me. I found this book very useful. It was good, well written, and informative, and I highly recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book. I bought it in February to read it in a couple weeks when my book library is open again. I thought it would be just a normal book, but I was quite surprised to find out that it was the same author as the first book. It is a nice read, very well written and interesting. The author does not focus on only one point of view and it makes for a very interesting read. The ending was not the best, but the ending is not the main problem.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A brilliant and original way to think about the problem of being a good Christian  I will definitely read again to make sure I understand what I'm reading. This book will be on my "go to" bookshelf 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so well done, it's very difficult to put down.   I really like the author's style and what she was trying to accomplish.  It's not the kind of book you'll want to do all at once but it's a good, solid little book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An extremely interesting and engaging book that not only reveals the complexity of a well-studied process, but demonstrates that these systems are not always perfectly structured and predictable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to basic Japanese grammar. It is easy to understand, and I found the writing style to be pretty easy. The grammar is based on the grammar used in modern Japanese. I had trouble with the kanji because I'm not that good with them, but I found it was mostly easy to figure out.    
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of the  Wargaming Classic series, so I was thrilled to get this book when I saw it on the shelves at the local hobby shop.  I'm going to read through the book now before I decide to purchase the second book.  It is a wonderful book to have in your library for when you want to just relax and read about classic wargames.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the one that taught me that it is okay to write something you really care about.   You don't have to be perfect in every aspect of your life and this book gives you a great framework for being creative, caring, and accepting of others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is definitely the most entertaining book I have read in a long time. I have a few issues with the book, but they are minor. This is one of the few books where I really enjoyed the cover, and I will be looking at that for future reference.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was extremely happy with this book.   It was very well written and I really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the story of the main character and I thought the writing was quite good.  The world building was amazing and the book was well thought out.  There was also a good twist that made me very happy.  For a book that I've read many times, it's really interesting to hear how the author writes.  Thank you so much for publishing this book, as it is quite different from all the other fantasy novels I've come across.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that was so very well written. I liked it so much, I got so frustrated at first and I thought "well, I guess I'll write a book review instead." Then I finished it and it was a joy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this novel about three years ago and still find it to be a highly entertaining read. It follows a high school student named James who lives in a small town and works as a janitor. While working on his senior project for a history class, James learns that a former classmate has been working as a psychic for the CIA. While James thinks it is a very strange story, it gets even more strange when James's own father has been caught spying on him for the agency. James becomes an outcast as people around him try to keep James in the dark about the mysterious activity surrounding him. However, the more he learns about his own family and how much it means to them, the bigger it becomes. I think that this book is a fantastic thriller and a great way to introduce children to the fact that not everything is as it seems.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "best of the best" anthology is packed with excellent, well-written and well-researched books on topics such as: (1) The rise of radical Islam in the Arab world; (2) The Islamic world's reaction to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; (3) The political situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and elsewhere. While I do think that some of these authors are guilty of oversimplification, I have found their work to be both comprehensive and in many instances, well written and very thought-provoking.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In many ways, I was really impressed with this book.   The authors had a very thorough and well thought out explanation of how and why humans use language.  Their descriptions of the language processes and the role of the brain in linguistic processing are accurate and concise.  It's interesting that a linguist, who is concerned with the origins and development of language, has been so successful in getting this book so much attention.  I think it's because he is such a gifted teacher who makes it very easy to understand the language and the process.  There's no fancy syntax, and most of the time he speaks very plainly (though he does have a fair amount of technical jargon).   This is a book that you need to own. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a genre of books which often has so much sex, or in a genre which generally is not all that sexy, I really enjoyed this book. This is definitely not for all women. If you're looking for a story about sex and relationships with a really great plot, then you'll be disappointed. But for women who love sex and want something they can read that has a little more depth to it, or a little less of a "slut" theme, this book is a winner. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to a very interesting idea by Professor Manktelow while I was listening to one of his lectures at a college. At first I did not want to give it a try since he was not well known, but it just kept nagging me until I gave it a shot.   The theory is amazing and I am very excited to see how the world responds to this new paradigm of science. I highly recommend this book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very fun and funny story. I enjoyed the humor and the plotline. This is a fun read that I look forward to reading again in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is difficult to be critical of a book that I have loved and want to read more of.   There are so many wonderful stories in this book that have never been told.  A few of the characters I have liked the most.  My only real complaint is that I am not sure what exactly happened between them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a little disappointed in this book. I like to read, but I am finding myself getting lost in the descriptions and getting lost with all the characters. However, I really enjoyed the story!  I just wish I hadn't bought this in the first place.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to read this book for a long time and finally got around to it last month. I loved it! The story was so well done that I've read it twice already.   The pacing was perfect and the writing was spot on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I started to read The Great Gatsby about six months ago. We were really drawn to the book, but at first we were a bit hesitant about picking it up as we hadn't read anything by F. Scott Fitzgerald before. We both agreed that it was a wonderful book and enjoyed every page.    The only things we didn't like was that I couldn't find any information on where this novel was originally published and that it took us four tries to get through the whole thing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.  It has a wonderful story that keeps me reading.  I recommend this book to all of my friends!

Write a positive review about a good book:    In the midst of all my other fiction I started reading this one. I am currently in the middle of the book. As the characters move through the city one character's name is constantly repeated. I have a pretty good memory but I often get it wrong. The last person I had it right was the last person to be born in this house.   So now I am reading the novel for my own enjoyment.  Posted by Sarah at 8:10 AM
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very interesting look at life and what it means to be human, and an intriguing and well-written book. I am interested in what will happen in the future as artificial intelligence and robotics becomes more sophisticated and advanced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main point of this book is a powerful idea about the human heart.  In fact, the book may be one of the most powerful, beautiful and life changing things I've read in my life.   I had read about the heart before, but this one hit me much harder.  I found it very easy to relate to the book's message because of the feelings I have been having ever since.  If you've struggled with feelings of anger, sadness, sadness over the loss of a loved one, then you should read this book and get it, if you haven't, give it a read.  It's one of my most cherished books, and I wish I could have written a better review for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing I can say is "Read It Later."   
Write a positive review about a good book:    An interesting and well written book about how one man became the most important political figure of his time. The author is a good friend of mine and I think he did a wonderful job.   Read Full Review Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore, January 30, 2011 It has been a long time since I came across a book that was a genuine love story. The protagonist was a humble businessman but he loved his family and wife very much. At the end of the story he married a daughter of an old family who had the same tastes and wants. I am very happy that I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This was an excellent book. I love the details about the origins of the modern U.S. and its relationship with Canada. The book is informative and provides great information. I think it would be great for kids as well as adults. It is a great read and I'd recommend it to anyone who has interest in this subject."
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a good example of the 'classic' science fiction series in which the science is pretty solid and the plot and characters are great. It has the kind of depth and characterization you want in a SF novel, and the story makes you want to read the next one. - Michael T. H. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased a copy of The Good Book: The Ten Commandments of Loving God, for my wife and I. She is an Evangelical Christian and I'm an Atheist who believes that God is good. Although I have always been in the closet, the fact that someone was willing to write a book about a Christian's "philosophy of God" made me want to be a Christian and attend church.  I am very interested to learn more about the history and theology of the Bible.  If the Christian God is a God of love and truth and that's all that the bible has to say about it, then I am going to believe it.   It's the first time I've ever seen a book that's both factual and inspirational, which is a rare thing in the book world.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I was blown away by this book - I love everything about it, but it was the final essay that made this book such a great read." -TJ, author of The Bigger Picture: How to Use Your Brain and Your Words to Think Big and Break New Ground "I have a lot of respect for Dr. Greene. Not only is this a book that's worth reading, but I think I might have found one of the most inspiring books on our own potential to find and express our own truths." -J, book reviewer "It is a beautiful piece of writing, an intellectual tour de force. Greene is in fine fettle on this particular subject, writing in the first person, which is extremely refreshing for a book written in the 20th century." -LH, book reviewer Posted by John Niewiska at 12:35 PM
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of the "classic" books that I grew up reading. I read them as a kid because they were the only books that had black characters in them.  These books really stuck with me and I'm glad that I finally got to read them in a quality book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would buy this book again. A great story with a great ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited to get this book, I wanted to start reading right away.   The first few pages of this book were all over the place.  A lot of the information is redundant or confusing.  As an English major who wants to learn how to use a computer or other technology in the classroom, I found this book very hard to read.  One time, the author did explain a lot of information well but the explanations were not complete and a lot more explanation needs to be given. The author also stated the book was written in the 1990's when everything could be accessed on the web with the right knowledge.  This book is outdated and the information would not be helpful today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very well written and interesting book about the rise of the Catholic Church in Ireland. Highly recommended.    "A detailed history that can be read in a single sitting, in a short time. A great read." —The Irish Catholic "I am a historian, and this book was invaluable. It provides a fascinating perspective of the early years of the Church, and the early modern Ireland in which the early church was set up. I was able to make use of this book in my class, where the history of the faith was explored. The material is very clear, and it was easy to follow and find the information I needed. As well, the author did a wonderful job of making the history understandable. " —Dr. Paul O'Connor, University of Limerick "I absolutely loved this book. I'm a professor, but I just don't get bored reading about Catholic Ireland. This is a very well-researched, well-documented history. This was a great read, with lots of fun reading ahead." —Dr John O'Mahony, Irish Catholic University of Ireland
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a couple of weeks ago and it was well written and quite informative. It has a few parts that aren't too interesting but most of it is interesting and helpful.   It was good to see how women cope with things like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've just finished a book that was well written and entertaining. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.   It is a story that had me hooked for days, and I'm glad to have it done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was excellent! I had a great time in the book and I learned a lot.   My only suggestion would be that I would like to see some more examples from the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has a strong science base and is easy to follow. I got the book through Kindle Unlimited for $1.99 and read it in a week. I enjoyed the book immensely and it will be a good reference book in the near future. I really like the idea of the Earth having three layers: a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, and a gas mantle that contains the energy for fusion (and also holds the planet together). The author is great and I love the way the book is put together. It is like a really good book and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject of space and the interior of the earth.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    For a young adult novel that is very well written and a very enjoyable read, I would suggest this one.   The author's background as a former nurse was interesting to read about and the story took me by surprise in the way the character's development and what they did and said changed my perception on them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well done book. It has a good mix of physics and metaphysics and the explanation is quite detailed and clear.  I love this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading a lot of fantasy recently (I'm a big fan of R.A. Salvatore's Ravenloft ), and have been particularly enjoying Dancer in the Dust. I've read this book before and had the same problems, but this time, I read it through again and got the answers I was looking for. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the definitive history of the World War I period. While it does focus largely on French and British fighting men, the authors have done a fine job of covering the other Allied powers, as well as the many other nations that participated in the war.    My only criticism of this book is that, for lack of a better term, it gets too bogged down in the details of the war to really focus on the major events. It makes a lot more sense in the long run to just read a single book by the author and then discuss the information with others, or to go to Wikipedia, but I would have preferred a more accessible treatment of the issues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book in this series has a nice blend of historical, psychological, and biological aspects to it. It explains and illustrates the biological factors which cause most human behaviour. It also presents the most sophisticated model we have so far to account for why these human traits evolved. The author is also able to weave in some historical perspective to show that this development in evolutionary psychology came at a time when there was a lack of any other real theories about the causes of human behaviour.  The first book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm sorry I bought the first part of this series a year ago but it was a great read, and I've enjoyed all of the sequels as well.    The characters have grown so much in the last few years, and their development is quite remarkable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased this book and read it while commuting to my first day of teaching. This book was very informative and well written. It would be a good tool for someone who's a new teacher, or for someone with less experience as a teacher. This is very good book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book because I have always wanted to read about the life and times of a Native American princess. This book is definitely the book for me! The illustrations and information are perfect.   The writing is not as good as some of the others, but I still think this is a must read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really impressed with the research on this one.   It's written from the point of view of the parents, which is rare to find.  I love the way that the author takes the time to explain the issues parents have to deal with, and how those issues are often ignored because they're not as "stressful".  It makes you think a lot more about your own life and your own children's lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is an excellent example of using a variety of materials to help build a body of knowledge in the area of body language.   I would like to give this book 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been wanting to get back into reading but only reading what I could find in paperback. This is definitely a good start.   You can make the comparison with the Harry Potter books as the plot and characters are both the same, but the writing style is much better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very enjoyable book.   Although a little dated at times, the book is well written, with an engaging plot and interesting characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most enjoyable book I have read in years and a huge help for those of us who are struggling with infertility.   It helps you understand your own body and what can cause it to fail and gives you the tools to deal with it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed reading this book more than I have any of my other books, and I do recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about human nature.   It's hard to convey in words exactly how fascinating it is to learn more about people's emotions and what drives them, and it's easy to get lost in the descriptions of the characters.  If you're interested in reading about the psychology of love and the importance of being a good friend and being a decent human being in the end, then I recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    There's been no shortage of books on my Kindle lately, but this is the only one that has given me a real reason to be motivated. I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new, interesting, well-written story. This one is the perfect combination of a literary, mystery and science fiction adventure.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My mother taught me to be brave and not give up no matter what. A true story book that is not too long.   I'm looking forward to reading it again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of the book is a good introduction to the subject and explains the principles from which I developed the approach to learning to read/write in my teens/early twenties. The second half of this book, especially, is just full of good and insightful stories from people who have taken the book's lessons to heart.   It's not a comprehensive book about reading and writing, but it's certainly a great way to start.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book.   Very informative, and as usual, well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really enjoying reading this book. It's a good blend of humour and social commentary.  It is well written, with many examples of the author's personal experiences that he uses to explain various points he wants to make in the book.  This is a very good book, well written and very well researched, if you're looking for a laugh read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best book I have read on self defense. The author is a retired FBI agent and had great insight and insight into a subject that is very important to those who seek to protect their own lives.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    A new and very interesting look at the old-time religion. I love the author's perspective on the history and future of this religion. As an experienced researcher, she has a great command of details. I am very interested to see where the book will go.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at a party and it was a great way to get to know a few people who were having a party.   This book has been a great reference for the ones I have read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is good, I liked it, my kids liked it.   It was short, and although the writing is a bit cheesy, the story is interesting and thought provoking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The stories are intriguing and interesting. They keep you thinking and keep you interested.   A nice collection of short stories that is well written and intriguing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about the art of teaching. I have taught for a number of years in both high school and university courses and am currently at a higher level teaching chemistry in a university.   What attracted me to the book was the concept of teaching by teaching.  I think there is a large amount of value in this book for both teachers and students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is one of the more enjoyable books I've read in a long while. The characters are realistic and the plot is complex and well written, with plenty of twists and turns. "
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are a real treat.   I had a few people comment that they could see them in real life.  But really, they're just a couple of kids who decide to take up a cause (which they do with relish).   For those who have never read this book, it is a quick read that is enjoyable.  The only thing that annoyed me, at least in part, was the spelling and grammar errors.  It's definitely a "let's go do something" book, but it's easy to read if you have the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been fascinated by how the human body works and how it responds to environmental stimuli, so I was intrigued when I came across The Human Body in the Art of Manliness and found it to be a very engaging book.   I enjoyed the text, which is in a very easy-to-read style.  It's not science-y enough for me, though, and I have the sense that it has a lot of room for more information and discussion.  This book was really interesting and interesting, but for the first half of the book, I was mostly confused about some of the concepts.  The second half is much more logical, however, which was extremely helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! I'm a fan of all the Doctor Who novels and this is the best of the bunch, though it has some flaws.   There is no mention of the Daleks in the story but this would have been a nice addition since there are only a few stories that include them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent book, worth reading.   There's not a lot of information out there about the subject of the book, so the author, Ms.  Toni Morrison, writes in a very clear and concise manner.  The book is very well researched and the author uses her personal experiences with the subject to make her case, which is impressive.  This is the second book I have read by Ms. Toni "T.A." Morrison.  I was attracted to this book because of the "The Bluest Eye" and "The Purple Rose of Cairo" series.  The first book was about my experience growing up in a Christian home.  Here's how I described the Bluest Eyes:   I was reading this book for a reading group at church and my students were asking questions, and I couldn't really give answers.  This is exactly what you need in a book for teenagers.  So I think this is really   the "Toni" to the books I have been reading in the past few years that talk about a variety of issues, and also have stories.  Ms. Morrison has been living and teaching in the United States since the 1970's.  She's a former Baptist who grew up in an old people's home and who went to Baptist Sunday School as a young girl.  In the introduction of the first book in the series (Blue Eyes, "The Blue"), she describes herself as a "born-again Christian".  She's always written about religion and has many books and articles on religion and Christianity, including a recent book on the Bible.   The first novel in the "Purple Rose" series was about her family's visits to Egypt during the summer of 1978.  When we read about the trip, we got an idea that what was happening in Egypt could have something to do with the events of "Purplestriest Eyes" and that, in fact, there is a connection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have tried lots of books on Buddhism and have come to the conclusion that this is the best book on it that I have found. It is easy to read, clear and very comprehensive.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've ever read.  This book changed my life.  The first chapter about his parents is one of the most important things I've read in a long time.  I had read a couple books before this, but it was the first one that opened my eyes to what it really means to be a human being.  Thank you, Mr. O'Neil.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book   is very thorough and informative about a very technical topic. I was surprised how many good resources there are on the web. I have been working with Arduino and other small electronic devices, and the book  seems to have everything. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at a young age when I was really interested in anything historical. I thought it would be boring but after reading it, I changed my mind. This is one of the most accurate portrayals of history I've ever seen. I especially like the fact that the author does not present the historical events with political agendas. The author is accurate and he makes you feel like you are there and that you understand the historical setting. This was such a great book for kids when they ask me what I have in the library, this is the one that always made me laugh.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for the perfect gift for my husband and my daughter since this book came out. The writing is amazing and the images are clear and easy to understand.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about the life of a great man.  The author is a friend of mine, and he knows his stuff.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book! A great read about what I do for a living.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a nice little history of the Russian Revolution. It is a good study of the role of the Bolsheviks in the Revolution. The book is well written. It also explains the role the Red Army played and what its role was. The military aspect is well done. There are a number of interesting historical tidbits that provide more background information. This is just a nice book for those that are interested in the revolutionary struggle and the people who led it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was so helpful! I bought the book when I first read it, but didn't know if it was really relevant. I don't remember the first chapter at all, but I remembered it after finishing the book, as the advice it gave is still helping me today. It was actually really helpful because I was having a hard time understanding a lot of things, and it helped me realize that a lot was being left out of my mind. The author wrote a lot about different types of women and things she's encountered in her life, and some of it was useful. It's kind of like a guidebook to being a well-rounded woman, and that's something I need!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very nice book about the history of the "Moral Re-Armament" movement, which is a group that fought the Soviet Union during the Cold War in a "moral" and "anti-imperialist" way.   There are many great sources on the moral Re-armament movement, but this one was very comprehensive and informative.  I have read many books on the war in Vietnam, but I am happy to see one book on it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful. I like the humor, but I'm not sure I want to give it to my son because I think I will learn all I can from him about how to not be a complete pussy. I think he will want to do the "I'm not a bad person" thing when he has some time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very good book. It was very easy to read, and it really helps you get a better sense of what's wrong with the economy and why the Fed is keeping interest rates so low.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The plot is good, the characters are well-written, the writing is clean, and the plot takes a little time to set up, but it gets better. I recommend this book to those looking for a solid adventure, who don't mind having some of the story spoiled for them by a few bits of a long flashback.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have learned so much.  It's just the best I've come across and a good read   It is easy to read and really helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a lot of information in this book. This includes a good overview of what is going on with the current legal status of cannabis and how it is being used. There is also a good discussion on the role of government and the role that corporations and governments have in the legalization of cannabis. This book will hopefully be valuable as we work towards the eventual legalization of marijuana.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The world needs more fiction that's like this: a man meets a woman at a library, they fall in love, and they live happily ever after (as long as there's no cheating or getting sick or any other bad thing that could happen to them).  I read this while listening to the audiobook, which has some really nice narration, and loved that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a ton of novels about the Vietnam War. This book by John S. Dower is the only one I have not finished and will not read until I'm finished with the whole series.   A story about an average American soldier caught up in the war is very interesting, but when he gets a "second chance" in Vietnam, things start to get a little more complicated. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well written book. It is not an easy read but it is an enjoyable one.   I like this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book, along with The Golden Compass and The Fault in Our Stars, in a single sitting in a few days, and I am glad I did. I read the first two books in a row on the way to work (and read the second one on my way home). I've enjoyed most of my time with these books so far, and would recommend them to anyone who likes them.   Thanks for the time you put in making these books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book so much. The pacing is just right and there are only a few things that make it seem like it's not at all the same book as the first.   The characters are good and I love that it includes a couple who have mental disabilities. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book. There were a few things about the story that did not go according to plan and I was not surprised by that.   The characters were well drawn and I felt like I was reading a story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pretty shocked at how this book dealt with sexual assault.   This book is about the experience of being sexually assaulted, not about the perpetrators or what their punishment should be.  This is definitely a story I will be re-reading in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book over Christmas. This is the first book I've read where I felt like the author really gave a lot of thought and detail to the historical events.  The book covers almost 100 years of warfare and I really liked the historical accuracy that the author has.  I liked that the book kept things as historical as possible.   The author gave me a good amount of information about a lot more people than I usually learn about in a history book, which I like.  My favorite part was when he covered some of the lesser known battles.  Overall, this book is great and worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a number of good books, but never one that is a true reflection of the writer and his/her skill. "The Long Goodbye" is a good and highly entertaining book that I recommend to all readers.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The two authors, both PhD's, have done an excellent job on this book. I've found that some of the scientific information they cite is flawed and some of it is just plain wrong. However, most of the information they give is useful. The author is very aware of the current state of knowledge about DNA and he does a good job of keeping it all straight. His book is much more of a discussion of how different people interpret what they read about DNA. I was quite interested in the theory behind the genetic test rather than the actual results.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very pleased with this book.    My son was able to understand and absorb all the lessons.  I was pleasantly surprised by this book because I have heard conflicting views.  A book that gives a comprehensive overview of the current medical paradigm is very helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about the subject of the paranormal. It was thorough in detailing the history of the subject, and the writing style is extremely clear and to the point. I'm not a believer, but I found the book extremely informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book made me think about the importance of education in modern society and what might be done to improve it. I was surprised to find out the history of slavery was almost completely omitted from history textbooks; but it would seem that there is a lot of work to be done in the United States and it should be on the minds of politicians, the educational community, and everyone else. I would recommend this book to any high school student and anyone with an interest in history. -K.O.K. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of books on various aspects of quantum mechanics, but this one is the only one to really stick out to me. It is short and easy to read. I think it will be very useful for physicists and engineers who want a brief but very clear description of some of the key ideas, in the context of quantum physics.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was pretty good - although there were a few typos and a few things that should have been done differently but wasn't (like the introduction).
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story of this book was very moving. I had to work through it to get to the bottom of it. This is a book worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be interesting and informative. It explains the subject of genetic inheritance with a very balanced and unbiased approach.   Thanks for the great research. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I wanted to see how a vegan could cook something "vegan-ish".  After reading this book, I have no doubt that I can cook vegan food just fine.   As an avid vegetarian, I find that some of the more complicated recipes are often vegan.  I used to have to use vegetable broth in order to make a stock, but this book has a page on how to make your own without using broth.  You really do have to be careful about the type of fats used because the fat is what turns them into emulsifiers.  While they will add richness to any recipe,  some people may be sensitive to them.  The only other thing I'm nitpicking about is that the cookbook doesn't provide an index, which is a bit of a bummer, but if I can find the recipe in another cookbook I might not be as picky.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters are interesting, the plot was exciting and the story line was interesting enough to keep my attention throughout. I liked the fact that the book didn't make me feel like I was reading a page-turner. The only reason I gave it four stars was that it was hard to keep in the right mood in the last few pages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book I was able to have a discussion about the problem with the "garden of forking paths" and the fact that there are several good ways to approach a problem.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There are many good books about the Cold War. This is a must read for anyone interested in the war and the history of its nuclear weapons. The author is very clear, concise and concise and his book is easy to read. This book provides the reader with all the facts you need to understand the Cold war and how both sides are very human and very complex. The Cold War can be difficult to understand because we only remember the good times of the ColdWar. This author writes the history in an unbiased manner which helps the reader to understand more about the complexities of both sides in this conflict. The facts are presented with such clarity and the author's voice adds the realism to make the events of the last few decades seem very real to the reader.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read The World's Best Secret in the first week of November, and I've loved every second of it. This is a terrific book.  It contains over a hundred pages of a wonderful story that really made me feel a lot more positive and happy about life.  I'd recommend it to any reader who is looking for something good to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book.   It wasn't for me, but the title alone is a big reason.  This is a wonderful book for the beginning student, with just enough history and general information to satisfy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character does not really get the world's respect until he gets a tattoo which makes him the most popular man in town and he's not even all that attractive.  After the gang tries to have sex with him the tattoos begin to get more and more detailed and the story gets really good!  I loved the story line and I enjoyed reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this book was great and fun.   The only problem I have with it is that I kept reading it, but I had to put it down because I got bored.  It is great to look back at old things.  I am in my 40s and would have loved this book when I was younger.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be very useful in getting a sense of the various types of animals that would be interesting for children to play with. For a first book, it is nicely written and the illustrations are very detailed.   There is an excellent discussion of the different species, how they were domesticated and the reasons for their domestication. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my 2nd edition of the book. This time around, I've read it in a year and I must say that it is one of the best books on the subject of teaching your children. The author clearly lays out all the important points. It is an excellent resource for children as well as adults.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must have for anyone interested in a good fantasy story. It is well written and entertaining.   The main character, Gwen is a very likable heroine and has a lot of potential. Her character development is fantastic and I love how she starts off with such a strong sense of self, but then finds that her own sense of identity is not what she thinks it is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never read a book like this, and it's a real shame that I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  The story was gripping and the plot was very complex.  I really enjoyed it.  This was a very well-written book that has everything going for it. It's well-done and it makes sense.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first chapter gave me no idea of the story of the book, I only knew it was about a girl who falls in love with a girl with a dragon tattoo, but she didn't read much beyond that because of the dragon tattoo thing. As I read on I got a few hints about how this story would go, but they were too subtle for me to get. As the book went on I really began to get more of a feel for the story and where the characters were at. The end is where I was most worried, but I still liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is like an advanced calculus text, in that it uses a mathematical formula to tell you what happens next. I found the formula (and the resulting stories) extremely engaging and entertaining, and I found myself actually learning a bit about calculus by the end of the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is great! I'm a beginner in Japanese, so this is a great start to learning Japanese. It has pictures, explanations, and many audio clips. I would recommend this to any beginner who is really trying to learn Japanese. The audio is amazing and really helps put into words what the author is trying to convey. Also, the book is quite expensive, but the service is really good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very informative and I learned a lot of things that I had to learn by myself.   It is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful, comprehensive overview of basic topics in biology, including the evolution of human beings, the genetics of human disorders and the genetics and development of the human immune system. I am a scientist/enthusiast and my knowledge of science is not great. This book has been a huge help and it has been the only book I have purchased in the last two years. I don't know how this book could have been written better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading a lot lately.  The stories in these books are so original and unique.  It's a pleasure to read and enjoy!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very happy with this. It's a very good book, and a good introduction to the field. I thought that some aspects of it were lacking though, in the sense that there was not enough discussion of the field itself. However, I thought this was due to the fact that the author is a bit old for the field, and may not have heard of some of the current research in this area, so he or she went in a bit too deeply. It could have been a lot better if he or her had said a little bit more about the field and its history, and just a little more about its current state of development. I'm glad that I picked up this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is written by a great and experienced author.   She explains the basics of using the web.  I like the explanation of "how-to" and how to use HTML.  This book contains lots of information and is full of useful pictures and images.  It is very useful and useful for someone starting out or for someone who wants to learn HTML and CSS.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this because I was a little confused. I already had my doubts. However, as I read it I thought "what if." The book really made me think about some of the questions I've asked myself, and the answers were quite intriguing and I really liked it. I liked that the author included the "why" and "how" to the question, so the reasons why this one might not be for everyone aren't obvious. It's a good read if you want to think a bit.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of "The Great Gatsby" for a long time, but never actually finished it. I've heard that it is an amazing book, and when I finally got around to finishing it (I was on vacation, and the kids were sick so I couldn't really finish it on my own), it's not what I expected. It's very well written, but the main character is a terrible person. I'm glad it's out there, but I can't wait to read some other author's take on the characters and the world. This will definitely be on my shelf for quite a while!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, along with others, can be used to improve one's ability to use one's brain. I have a serious brain disease, so I don't read very much, but this book helps me keep up with my classes and other activities I have to do. Thanks!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had always wanted to read about an ex-Marine and his friendship with a former Marine (a vet) and his ex-wife. They lived together on the west side of Milwaukee for a number of years and they were always looking for things to do that were different. The author is funny, smart and full of personality.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a book written by a guy who's trying to be a feminist and who's only being kind and kind of pretentious, it does get better, it gets better. The thing is, I'm a woman. So, if you're a man, you're gonna have to watch it a couple of times, because you're not gonna know what's going on. I'm sure he'll say some really misogynistic things, but he's trying really hard to be as progressive as possible, and I think it's a very positive book."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read with some strong points. It is not an easy read but I think it is worth the effort. I was intrigued by the story and the way the author is trying to get the story across but fails miserably.   It would be great if the author had more experience with writing in general as I believe he's at a major disadvantage.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this is the only one that I have read that deals with the actual science of what they are discussing.   The science is what it needs to be, and the writing is what I like the most about it.  I know that many people don't agree with what they're saying, but I'm not one of them, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to a fascinating topic. I am now well acquainted with how the system of government in the United States works, and I find the book to be fairly comprehensive. It is also quite well written, making it an excellent read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It is well written, well researched, and well presented. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in how people deal with mental illness and other serious mental disorders. This book includes a lot of information about the history and research on schizophrenia, and many of the issues are very relevant to the treatment of today's mental health patients.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for this book for a while. A nice, light, fast read. This book is the perfect introduction to using Linux to create a system-on-a-chip (SoC) device. It has a lot of good info on the different components of a SoC, but you should understand that it's only a step in creating a true, working system with the SoC.   For anyone interested in Linux, this book will be a nice start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great because it takes a very simple concept--finding out your identity and discovering who you are--and builds a world around it. The concept is also very relatable--it's a very real feeling and a very common feeling for most people.   I had never thought of my personality as something that would define who I am, until I read this book.  Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book for a good man. He was never satisfied with how he had gone about running his business and is just getting to the point where he can live with the work he does.   This book is very comprehensive in every way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In general, the writing is quite good, even if it is just a few sentences long at a time. I've never seen a series that was so fun to read, but the chapters are short enough to read without much trouble.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A nice book on the history of the Church from the perspective of the most contemporary scholars and churchmen of the day. The author does a nice job of giving his history from different perspectives, which I think is the best way to go about this. It does not paint the LDS Church in a bad light, and there is nothing in the book that would suggest that the church is a bunch of liars. The book is certainly a work of scholarship and has some interesting insights. I would recommend it for anyone interested in the history and philosophy of the church as well as the history in general. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "It is a very thought provoking book, well written and filled with information."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read many of the books in the Goodreads group "Children and Loneliness" by other children (and adults). The books have all had a special place in my heart, even though I am a long way from being a parent.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite short stories of all time, and it's great to have some background on it for my college essays.   It's really a great example of a horror short story and a great illustration of the style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This book is full of good information and does a good job of describing the way the United States government and the world of espionage operate. I especially liked the explanation of the many different intelligence agencies, and the variety of techniques they employ to gain information and to get secrets. "
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book for those who have never had the chance to read a Tolkien book. I love the style of Tolkien, and enjoy his writings. There are so many references and so much knowledge I find myself just quoting him. I was surprised how well this book matches the stories he wrote in his books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book and found it very enlightening. I think it's very important to think about the causes of violence in our society and the social conditions that promote the perpetuation of violence and the glorification of violence. This book was very enlightning to me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have any problems with reading a book that was written for adults, this is a great place to find a book on the topic. I found this book helpful as a way to teach basic computer skills to my son.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the bible to my understanding of the human psyche and how it operates. It has everything you need to understand the mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book at the recommendation of my co-workers and have really enjoyed it.   There are some minor spoilers in this review but it is not a major spoiler so it is fine.  I enjoy the character development in this story and I really like the setting in this book.  My only complaint is that some of the characters don't develop at the same rate they should. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a lot of science fiction books over the years, and this one is probably my favourite. It has a good blend of science and humour, and even if the ending is a bit strange, I really enjoyed it. I'm very interested to see how this story develops.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. The first three books in the "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" are great, and this is no exception, but I don't know if this one will keep up with the others. The plot is excellent and the characters are all well portrayed, but this book's focus seems to be on the journey of Bilbo rather than the narrative.   In my opinion, this is a "tour book" in many ways, and I don�t think it is the "final" part of the trilogy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a lot of fun, I'm learning a lot about the ancient Greeks from it.   If you like the ancient world, this is the book for you.  I like it. It was nice to read a book that I have always wanted to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was completely taken in by this book on the first read. It's a great story and an excellent book. The writing is superb and I love the way you can tell the story from the little details, even though this story is very long.   The best part is the ending; it was a great ending for me to come to, to know that the book was not over. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm reading the  The Great Gatsby  now, and while it might not be an original novel like  Gone Girl, the story is still really well written. I read  The Good  by Mary Stewart and loved it. I thought I'd read some of the other Gatsbys before, but  The  Good  is different. It's a bit shorter than that other one, and that is probably because I've been binge-watching shows on Netflix, so I didn't have to wait for the series to come out, but it's still a great story. I can't wait for it to end!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been looking for this book for quite some time. It is a good introduction to the topic. A good introduction.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a great read.   Very informative and fun for kids and adults to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found it useful to have a brief understanding of what was going on with this particular story and what its relation was to the events of the novel. I do think it would be useful for me to read the book again, though, to make sure what I think I know is correct.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My daughter and I got together to read this book together on an evening we could spend together after school. She loved the book and even read it in class (not on her own, of course) and she's about a third of the way through the book now.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is great, the descriptions are vivid, and the writing is strong. The illustrations and prose fit the theme.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very excited about this book when I saw it on my Amazon bookshelf. I was also concerned that the plot may not have been well thought out as I read. In the end, I was satisfied with the overall plot and the characters were likable. I would highly recommend this book to any child who has a fondness for pirates.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book in an online bookstore. I loved it from the very first page. The writing style is wonderful and the ideas are interesting. It's a shame I could not finish it. It is really a "pick up a copy and let it sink" type of read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful, detailed exploration of the history of the Jews. I was not impressed with it at first, but then I found the book, read through it a couple of times and it became clear why I was so disappointed. The author makes two basic errors. The first is that he does not know the history. The second is that the Jews of today are not as bad as the Jews are in the past.   A number of Jewish authors have written about the Jews, but it was not until the last couple of years that anyone took a serious look at the history, and this book is the best example I've found. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for my son's seventh birthday, a few days after his birthday, and he loved it. He loved every single page, and I thought it was amazing.   When he's ready to learn more about computers, this is the book to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have ever read that is very accurate and straight forward. I am just finishing my first draft on the next book in the series, but so far the new one is better.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book, you will not get into all the science and history, but will get a general view of human evolution and culture in Europe during the Middle Ages.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read the first couple of chapters, and although I do not find it easy reading, it is entertaining and well-researched. My problem is I read this book during my work day, and it is difficult to stop me doing so. As a result, I have to have a little coffee and a lot of reading to stay awake.    If you do read this work, please do not do more than you would be able to finish it in one sitting, and do not give it a bad review as I have done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a copy of the original version of This Ain't Hell on Earth  by the late Mark Twain. I was so excited when I saw that the movie version was coming out that I rushed to order it for Christmas.   The book, as the title implies, is very different from the movie.  Instead of being set in the late 1800's, it is set in 1882.  It has a different pace to the story (I felt that the book was a bit slower).   It also has a darker, more depressing tone.  I felt that it was a much better book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books I've been looking for for a long time, and it's an excellent one, with some amazing insights and useful advice.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A little dark and depressing, but I found the writing to be excellent, and the overall message, though somewhat difficult to wrap one's head around, did stick. This book is a must read for anyone who cares about the history of the war and the causes behind it, and a good reminder of how our history is still being rewritten and distorted."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was completely blown away by this book.  This was the first book I've ever read that did not leave me wanting more and that I'm excited to read the sequel to.   It is not just a great story - it is also a great way to learn about the history of the Civil War.  If you are interested in learning more about the Civil war or Civil War memorabilia - this is the book for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:   " This is a very well written book. It will help a lot of the students in my class who do not speak English to learn how to write fluently.   " " Good book. I think that many people will enjoy it."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am now reading the complete works of John Buchan, and my old bookshelves are bursting at the seams with his writings, both fiction and non-fiction.   It's nice to have an assortment of the classics in one convenient place. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to say that I was pretty happy with my book. I've read lots of things from many authors but never a book that has been written by the same author in different forms and that has had several incarnations written in several different genres.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think the main reason I liked this book is the way that it portrays what it means to be a non-binary person, the difference between a masculine and a feminine experience, how the way one presents themselves affects the way others treat them, and how our bodies affect the way we think and feel about our bodies, sexuality, and self-concept.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so helpful. I'm a teacher and I needed a bit of guidance.   It's also a really good introduction to the different ways of thinking and learning in math.  Thanks for putting this together!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this story.   It's a good, light book that is good for a light book night.  I like how the story focuses on a couple's relationship.  They really get along and don't seem like they're doing it for attention or for the fun of it, but for deep emotional reasons.  This is a good story to start with because it doesn't need to be deep or complex.  And as I said in my other review, it's good for getting through the night on a good day.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, and was happy with the way it ended. I loved the ending, as I had expected it to be very well-done. The pacing was good, and the story was interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this well-researched and entertaining book, Dvorak discusses his musical development in great detail, giving us the history of his interest in music, his musical equipment and his most cherished musical instruments.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was extremely interested in this book, and I enjoyed it. It didn't have a "story" that stuck with me. This book was good as a "how to" guide to finding a spouse, but it didn't seem like anything really "interesting" happened.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have recently finished John T. Edge's " The Making of the American Century.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It was a well-written, well-researched and interesting book on the subject of "fear" and "security". I like to take a "fascinating" approach, which is why I liked this book so much. I am interested in this topic and wanted to read something that would explain what I was learning. I was also interested in exploring the psychology of fear and security.   In my opinion this book is really important.  It provides useful information for people who are trying to figure out how to handle their own fears and keep themselves secure.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book on the market and is very much worth your money.  The content is very clear and easy to understand.  I read this book from start to finish with no gaps in the flow of the information.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is new to programming.  This book is very well laid out and covers all the bases.  Thank you for the effort and time you put into this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've enjoyed all of the books I've read by this author. They've helped me become a better communicator as a writer and as a person. This book is a great reference book for those who want to learn more about how to become a good communicator.   The "How to Write Great Dialogue" section is definitely a helpful reference for anyone interested in writing dialogue. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The plot, writing, and world building in this book are fantastic. My favorite thing about the world-building was that I had the chance to get to know the characters. I have a feeling that I'll be revisiting the world and the world's characters many times in the future.   This book has a LOT of detail and depth. The authors do a fantastic job of weaving in and out of the main characters, making it feel a lot more like an "in-world" book (I'm a bit of a world-builder myself).   I love the worldbuilding, it's amazing.  Rating: 4.25 stars  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had no idea what to expect from this book, but I'm glad I picked this up.   My husband and I have known each other for 15 years and we both enjoy books that are light-hearted and funny.  My favorite is "The Big Red Book" by Bill Murray.  I bought this book because I wanted something light-en, a humorous read.  This book is hilarious, yet has a deeper meaning that will stick with me for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The premise of this book is not new, but it is well-conceived and a good story.     In a nutshell, the "good" is that it offers a new perspective on the story of the Holy Grail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book. I first picked this up because I saw it on my flight to DC. I was very excited, thinking it would be a great reading companion, and I was so wrong.   If you like YA fantasy with a twist, I think you'll enjoy this book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book of Mormon came at the right time for me! When I was about to give up on my desire to become an LDS convert, I read the Book of Abraham. I had read about the prophet's experiences in the book of Abraham and I knew that the story of his life was the reason Joseph Smith wrote the book. But when I finally finished the book, I was totally floored. The story is so wonderful and beautiful and it was very moving. I read every word of the book (and have a feeling I will read the rest too soon)!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great and I read it in about two days.   I enjoyed it and I think it is an important addition to the field.  The author gives an excellent overview of the different ways of studying.  He doesn't just talk about the different things you need to study, but also how to think about it.  This is good advice for anyone who wants to get better at studying.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would like to thank my great aunt, for she passed on to me her wisdom on living a life of gratitude.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've read for quite some time. As the author points out, there's no need to wait until you're married before you decide to leave the religion of your childhood.   The author has given the best of all worlds to me and my family. I feel more free to leave religion and the "right way" of life.  I do feel a bit guilty that I'm reading a book in a store at the same time that the kids are in bed but we are in our new place and we feel very happy.  I like that the author is honest and straightforward when it comes to writing about this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book about some pretty common things. I do hope it'll inspire me to take a class about gender and power/ privilege issues, and learn how to be a better person.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to say that I've been thinking of doing this for many years. The book does a great job at describing how to set up a simple, portable power system. It was very easy to understand, I enjoyed it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm an avid reader and I read this book in the middle of a busy day. The book is very well-organized and well-written. I love this book's approach to writing and the book helps you learn how to be more productive in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not very good at chess but when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. It is very informative and gives many good ideas on how to play against stronger players. I have not found a game-like book about how to improve in chess, but this book is an excellent resource for improving your skill.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been interested in learning more about Buddhism for awhile. I have always thought that the real value of Buddhism is the dharma itself, and I've had to get very comfortable with the idea that I'm not quite ready for the whole thing.   This book is like going to a Buddhist temple for the first time.  The teacher is very patient and friendly, and she is able to teach about a lot of different topics, all in a very short time.    I am looking forward to reading many other books on Buddhism in the future, and this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent, useful, and inspiring book about working with people on problems that are challenging. I found this book an excellent addition to the field of human interaction, not only in terms of the techniques covered, but also in terms...
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best part of the book is the discussion section on the first 10 chapters. I love reading books so I enjoy reading discussion on any book, but it was a pleasure to read what other people thought. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in a couple of sittings and felt like I was having a conversation with the author.   The information was easy to understand and the book covers an extensive area.  As a programmer, I would look at this and try to follow a lot of the concepts and references the author used. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A beautiful story and one that I loved! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book when I was in the first year of college and I got to know quite a bit about the subject matter. It was well written, and I liked the way it portrayed certain things. It might not be the ideal introduction to a subject, but I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn more.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good and helpful book.  The plot, dialogue and character development is extremely well written.  I highly recommend this book for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book.   The story and the plot are excellent.  A great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really great book for people who enjoy science fiction.   It has great reviews from reviewers who also enjoy science.  It is not a deep, scholarly treatise, but it does a lot of good things:  1) it makes it clear that the aliens in this novel are not "dumb and evil," and that they will not harm humans if they don't make war with them (even though that is the scenario in the movie).   2) it is a good example of the type of worldbuilding that works best in sci-fi.  3) it shows that alien species do not necessarily have to be totally evil (some of them seem pretty nice).  I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes sci- fi.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've bought this book in the past but I find it to be a bit redundant and not very compelling to me.   In the last two sections I've done that and made it about the character development of two of my favorite female characters but I could have just done this whole book in a different style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most excellent work on history by a professor I have had the pleasure of studying with. It does a superb job of showing the human dimension in the ancient Near East, and I can not recommend it highly enough.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was excellent. I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons for decades and have seen a number of good books on the subject, but nothing that really stood out to me. I think the book was the best I've read for the subject.   In addition to good game balance, the author has provided a great introduction to D&D. I can't wait to see where this book goes.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The description of "The New Class Struggle" is exactly what I was looking for. The book provides a very clear explanation of the class struggle.   This book contains an extensive analysis of all the current "isms" that plague our society, including feminism, queer theory, anti-racism, and anarchism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well-written book on the psychology and science of writing. I especially liked the idea that writing is a creative process and it's possible to make any project more productive. The book talks about a lot of really cool techniques and how to use them.   Overall I'd give it a 9/10.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to wait for months, but my book was well worth the wait. It is written well, has a nice cover, a decent bibliography, and the illustrations are pretty cool. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in history of science and mathematics.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books. I feel I understand the psychology behind the narcissist's and the way they operate. Although the narcissists I've had in my life are very controlling and will leave you when you're not performing, this book helps you be in control of your own life and your mind. The author describes how some of these characteristics could develop into the personality of a narcissist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the story. I also loved the book's style.   It is easy to read because the prose is clean and simple.  It tells a story.  My only criticism is that the book is not a historical novel, but rather an investigation into the man at the center of it all. I was interested to learn more about the man. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. I am an adult with a child of two and have had a really hard time figuring out how to have a child. This book has really helped me! It has also helped me understand why this is so hard to do! My child is learning some great skills and has become more confident in herself. I have started teaching her to read and the older she gets the more confident she is! It is well worth the time and money!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent, the concept is interesting, and the way that the author presents his ideas is good. I found the main concept of the book to be fascinating and, as a former college psychology major, the author's work is the most convincing work I've seen on the subject of decision making for good decisions.   A great book that I will probably buy again in the future, because it is really well presented. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book. I've got two kids (and a very well behaved toddler) who love to read, and this book was perfect to get them going. I also loved the fact that there is an index of some very useful terms and references at the end of the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is by far my favourite book.   It gives a strong overview of what the whole body of scientific research says about what happens after your first child is born.  I don't believe that I can be more clear or succinct about the importance of being informed and that babies are born with an incredible amount of potential. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I loved it. I enjoyed it. The style of the prose is so engaging. The narrator has an awesome sense of humor. She is just right for me."
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those "best-of" collections which should be added to any library. The "The Book of The Book" is very interesting and very useful.  I highly recommend it to all my friends who study ancient and medieval history and who want to do better research.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It was very interesting and engaging and is well worth the time to read."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have really enjoyed this book, especially the description of the culture and the events that led to the "rebel" culture, and the history behind it.   The author has a lot of history behind the "revolution" - how the country became so isolated, how people lost faith in the government, how they wanted a leader who was willing to step aside to let a more qualified person run (I also like the quote in the back of the book about how it was the US who brought the Russians back from the brink of collapse).   
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I thought this was a very good book. It is a nice look at the Jewish community, and the author did a wonderful job in describing the hardships, triumphs and tragedies. I think we are all better for knowing more of the past, and I have now discovered the Jewish History and Culture Society in Toronto. The Jewish Museum, with its huge selection of Judaica and books, is definitely one of the best museums in the city. "  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was a fantastic book that I have had many times over the last few years, and have found that it is just about perfect for this type of book. It takes the traditional approach of looking for a good author, and then goes right into the story.  It doesn't bog down the story with unnecessary details like other books do and provides a good summary of the characters and plot.    The characters are great, and the romance between them is very good.  You will get a good understanding of why the couple is together, and it is easy to find yourself rooting for them.  I don't know what the author is going for with the romance, but I am really hoping he will be able to bring that element into the book and not leave us wondering what is going on.  5 stars: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just got thru the last book and it was great.   It was very interesting and I enjoyed the fact that the book talks about many different topics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are looking for something different, then look no further.   A unique, interesting look at a real problem, that does not focus on the same thing over and over and try to explain why that is. I highly recommend this book for any type of person, for sure! A wonderful work of true art.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is fantastic   I bought it to use as a "freebie"   It is the only book that gives me the "full picture" as it were   What I don't understand     The fact that he was going to be a professor   after he was dead  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book about the origins of the modern American economy. I'm fascinated by how this history is still relevant.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a book on an excellent subject, so I think it is a very good resource for anyone wanting to start a study of the topic. I have already used it as an introduction to the subject, and I can assure you that it will be very helpful to all future students of quantum mechanics and related areas, including those studying quantum information. The book has some very practical and well written information that is very relevant to a beginning student's study.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of how I fell in love with the great science fiction books of the 60s and 70s is told in detail.   This is a great read and I am going to make it my primary science fiction read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic book on how to become a strong, confident person. I enjoyed every bit of it!   If you're seeking some great motivation, this book is perfect for you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book really hit the nail on the head. The topic is important, the information is fascinating, the writing is strong and the information was very factual.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am currently reading this book and it has been fun. I think it's a good time for those who are just beginning their journey in learning guitar and those who have not been successful in finding other books on the topic.   It's not an easy book to read because it uses lots of notation but it's not so difficult to learn that the technique is lost.  I'm sure I'll use this book for a long time, especially since I am starting to think about getting into this guitar thing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my 2nd favourite book by Lizzie Bennet.   In a way, this book is more a sequel to The Cuckoo's Calling than a continuation of the previous book.  In terms of characters,  It is very different from the previous books.  She has a much more mature and complex character than Lizz's previous characters.  I found that most of the characters were interesting and even some of the villains in the book were interesting.  It was fun to read.  Overall, a really great book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book that is fun to read.   I got the second volume of the series but missed the first.  I don't plan to read any more of this series but will continue to read other books in the series as I get through the first one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book which can be used as a starting point for the creation of your own personal spirituality, and I would strongly recommend it.   The author is very clear on what he wants his readers to take away and I believe that the result is more than worth the price of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad I bought this book to read at bedtime and to study.   The characters were just too realistic.  It was not like the book's description of their lives was accurate.  But,  the story was very good and the world building was also very good.  I wish it was more of a story like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book, Professor Stephen C. Miller, a renowned psychiatrist, describes the process by which someone with borderline personality disorder can overcome their difficulties. While the book is focused on BPD, the concepts are equally applicable to all kinds of borderline personality disorders.   I was impressed by the author's ability to describe the complex interplay of personality traits, the biological and environmental components, and the emotional difficulties faced by someone with BPD. The author's perspective on BPs is insightful, accurate and thorough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. I like reading good books so, I decided to buy it.   The story is good and the characters were well-developed.  I'm looking forward to the next book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought the author went into great detail in describing the story and explaining his reasoning in writing it. It's quite interesting! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book and enjoyed it.   This book is excellent.  I've had to spend a great deal of time to get the hang of it so that I have the best chance of completing my novel.  For the most part the book works, but if you get stuck on a problem and have to refer to a section that you've already read, it can be very hard to make progress.  After reading it, I will have to re-read it and try to get to the end of the chapter.  This is a great book for a beginner because there is little more to learn.  My only wish is that the book had a little more information in it about the terminology used and how to properly utilize the techniques.  Thanks for writing this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as part of a class that included A History of the World in 20 Centuries.   This book has a wealth of information.  As an historian, I can see how the authors came to their conclusion, but in my opinion they have neglected a few facts or had a major error in logic.  In this book, the authors refer to the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the French and British Empires.  However, the author never mentions any of those empires that were conquered by the Ottomans and/or the British,   who also controlled the Nile River and were at war with the Romans for most of the Middle Ages.  The reason for the omission of such a history is not clear to me.  I also found it strange that the author did not make references to the Byzantine Empire, which was conquered by Rome in 476 and ruled for nearly 1,500 years until 1253. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have loved this book from the first paragraph. As a veteran of many combat roles, I have come to appreciate the value of the warrior. The author writes clearly, with compassion for the many different aspects of the military lifestyle and the many men and women who make up the armed forces.    This is a very insightful and helpful book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book by a very good author. I recommend it to those interested in the history of the Chinese and the relationship between the West and China.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good introduction to the subject.  It's not very detailed, but what it does tell you is valuable, especially for a non-tech guy like myself.   It was a good experience for me and I plan on buying more books in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed this book. The information provided is all too well referenced, easy to understand, and extremely useful.   The author goes into great detail and provides good examples and tips for how to implement many of these methods. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I read this book together and I am so glad we did. We both loved it.   The author had the right idea to take the time to explain things in simple terms that would make the information easy to understand.  I am not so sure how this book would work for people who are not as familiar with psychology, but that's what made it such a great book.  My husband and me - we loved it! I've read a lot about personality differences and these three different personality types (Sanguine, Sensitive and Agreeable) as well as the four types of people (Chameleon, Artist, Engineer and Spy) and I'm still trying to figure out what I'm like. This book really helps us to understand how we make decisions and what our inner personality is like and I really enjoyed the explanations of each of the different personality traits.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a fan of the original, but I have been thinking about this one for quite some time now, and I'm glad that I finally got around to reading it.   The style is similar to that of Tolkien's books, but there is a different feel to it. This book will certainly be on my list of favorite fantasy books for a while.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I read this book at my daughter's school, and when I read it, I was quite disappointed that it did not explain the science and technology behind my phone. As a mechanical engineer I was looking for a little more insight into why they made such a great phone, and how I could make it even better. I was glad to find that the book did that.   It also explains a lot of the common problems and concerns of anyone who's ever built a phone.  "
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like the fact that this book is really in the genre of "a woman's story", but what really stood out to me was the fact how well this novel managed to include a diverse and interesting cast of characters that was both realistic and not.    There were a few people that I would not have expected to be represented at all.  That said, I think there are a few that do make the cut.  A great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been using this for over a year. I had to stop after one month but it has made a big impact on my life and my mood.   The way the author explains the benefits of the various exercises and the steps to get there is very clear and easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I love that it is about something much deeper than the usual self-help material. This book has helped me to better understand how to live and love myself better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical of this book at first but it worked perfectly for me and really got me started on the road to finding my calling in life.   My husband and I read this book together while on a road trip to California. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best English book on this subject. This is one of the most important books I have read. It is both historical and philosophical. I find myself frequently revisiting the ideas presented in this book and thinking about them and what they mean for the present and the future. The author does not shy away from making his arguments and using his vocabulary as forcefully as possible. I particularly like the chapters on the role of violence, slavery, and the impact of technology.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a wonderful read. It was a lot of fun, and I feel very satisfied and informed. This book is much better than I ever could have imagined. The author makes this work in such a different way, and does so in a way that is actually exciting and interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because it had been recommended to me as a suitable reading material for high schoolers.   The book focuses on one subject (sexuality) in great detail and does a very good job of presenting a balanced picture of the subject matter.  There were several points of contention (which the author acknowledges) but the end result is quite satisfying to the reader. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good basic reference book and very good at it.  The chapter on writing will not be to everyone's liking but the information was good and the overall presentation was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely loved this book.   The style was the best in a book of this sort I have read.  I'm an average reader who read quite a few short stories and reviews, and this was the first one that really stood out.  It is very well written and made for a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best non-fiction I have ever read on how the human mind works is The Thinking MIND: How Our Brains Think.   It tells the story of how a young child is taught to think and make decisions by a loving father.  This book is wonderful for children of all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very good.  The author has an extensive background in biology and genetics.   I'm fascinated by genetics, especially the way it relates to the development of an organism.  It's been a long time since I read a good genetics book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorites from the last couple of years, The Art of The Deal is a book I always have on the top of my "To Read" list.   This is one of the only times that I've come across a presidential deal with a deal that I'd have a hard time giving up on.  The deal that brought down the house when he got there.  I thought it was brilliant and it's a shame Trump was not able to pull it off.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just finished reading This is not your traditional children's book. While it is filled with characters and funny scenes, the plot is much more serious and the themes are much more realistic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very readable book, with the best of the best authors.   I have just finished the first two books in the series, and I am excited about the third book.  I am sure this series will be highly successful, especially given that the author is a well-known science fiction and fantasy author.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book, and very important. One of the most thorough and helpful books I've read in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great, easy read with great illustrations.   It is a very good introduction to the subject.  If you have a good understanding of the concepts and the terminology you will be able to use this book to teach yourself more about the subject matter.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read with a very good moral. A good read for the moral/philosophical seeker and/or for the more analytical minded.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was great. I enjoyed reading it more than I would have without the internet. The style is a bit different, but it is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very surprised by this book, both the good and the bad. The bad was the fact that I really didn't like the author's style or approach. He wrote about "real people" who suffered from mental illness, and that's it. In my opinion, he should write about his "real life" experiences, not about people who were not as mentally ill as he was. I would've preferred to read about other, less-famous "real-life" people (such as a "regular person" who has depression or schizophrenia). But whatever, the good is that this book really opened my eyes to things that I had already thought a lot about (such a long, complex, and hard-to-understand book...!). In the end, the book does help us to better understand the mental illness world we live in, and hopefully, will encourage us to get a more accurate, more in-depth, and more professional diagnosis and treatment.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading " The Power of Good Intentions " (a great read).   It's not the best book I've read (some great ones I haven't had time to read yet like "The Secret" and "The Happiness Project") but the information presented in it is very easy to get through.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading books on the internet for some time and I've noticed that the more books there are on a particular subject, the more I tend to read more books about that subject. I have read this book from cover to cover twice and I am going to read the rest at least twice and maybe even three times.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've bought several of these by now, and they all hold up quite well. The writing and illustrations are top notch and the characters are interesting.   This is one of the first fantasy novels I've read that I truly relate to.  I enjoy a lot of fantasy in general, and I'm glad I was exposed to the kind of things that made me fall in love with these characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book! It is extremely well written. The premise was really interesting, and I found myself wanting to go and watch a video to see how they solved it, especially since I thought I knew the basics.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion, this is one of the most profound works in modern philosophy. There are many books about the mind, but this is probably the first one written by someone who has actually studied it and who has attempted to make sense of it.   If you want to know what it is like to live in a world of free will, and if you want an interesting discussion of such issues, this book will give you all you need. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has changed my life, and I'm not just saying that because I've been diagnosed with Lyme disease. I've taken this course on how to live a healthy life and make healthier decisions every single day, because I'm just that addicted.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was not expecting much from this book.  I had not read much about the war in Vietnam or the politics behind the war, and as such, I did not know what to expect.   When I started reading it, I was taken aback by the breadth of the subject matter, by the fact that it was told by both the men who fought and those who observed, and by the way the authors managed to incorporate the experiences of people from both sides of the war.    This book is a real treat and is well worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well written book on the history of the Second World War. It is very clear in its argument, and it is full of interesting material. It includes some good biographical details and facts on the personalities of the major players. I think it is a useful work that should be required reading in the history departments of universities. It will be interesting to see how the situation plays out as the new historians and historians of the current conflict work their way through the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really interested in learning more about the Black Power movement.  The book has many good pictures and is interesting to read.   The chapter on the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party is really interesting.  It gave me much insight into why the party was able to get so much power. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The  The  Great  Book of Fantasy    is one of those rare books that does not fall victim to the pitfalls of too much hype and over-selling.  It's a book that I want to read again and again.  I know this is not a "high fantasy" novel, but it's far closer to the type of fantasy I prefer.   I'm going to be picking it up and re-reading it many times.  Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book on a plane, and was so glad that I did.   It was the perfect introduction to fantasy and magic that will keep me glued to the book until the end.  The illustrations are awesome, the magic system is fun, and there's an element of realism in the story that will really appeal to fans of fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had read about this book on the internet and I was a little skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised with this book. It is a very accessible introduction to basic programming concepts and techniques and very easily explains what a computer program is and how it works. It's easy to use as well, no calculus or other complicated math needed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is full of excellent information on the subject of money. There are plenty of facts in the book that would be useful in an undergraduate college class on economics. The book is an excellent summary of most of the major theories of the subject. The chapters that deal with the theory and the history of economics, however, do not do justice to the subject matter. The explanations are simple, but they are not entirely clear. Also, the book is too short to be a definitive reference. Nevertheless, I would recommend it. If you are going to read a good economics book, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, which I had forgotten I had on my shelf.  This is a good, easy-to-read book on the history of the Jews in Europe.   There is a lot of material, including a lot about the Jews' contributions to society.  While the book does not do justice to the contribution of Jews in other ways, it is a must-have for anyone who wants a good discussion of the past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading this book for a few weeks and enjoyed it. This is probably my favorite book in the collection.   It has been fun reading about this period and I enjoyed the historical background, especially given how much I didn't know about the period. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A nice read with a few errors. If you are a student, especially math/sci-fi/fantasy, this book is well written and very informative. I found a few problems with grammar and some spelling, but all in all, it's worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well done novel. The author does a fantastic job of making the characters, both good and bad, interesting and relatable. It's difficult to read because the story is somewhat slow but I really enjoyed the author's description of the situation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I had read this a long time ago I probably wouldn't have loved it. But since I have I love it! I think I'll be reading more by the same author.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author had a great idea for a novel, and he developed the book into a really nice read. The characters are all interesting and believable, and the plot is easy to follow.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book in my The Great American Novel series is great. It has lots of interesting and well done characters with different goals and motives and it just keeps adding to it. This book is probably the best book so far in the series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book and it really helped me in my own personal journey to live a "good" life. I do not think it would have helped me if I hadn't already been a huge fan of Buddhism. I had started off in the Christian community, and I had to completely re-evaluate myself because the Christian concept of "sin" is completely antithetical to the Buddhist concept of enlightenment. The Buddha, on the other hand, does not hold the concept of sin against you, he gives you the tools to live as a good human being. I was very interested to find out that the book had been translated into English from Japanese to English. It's such a shame that it had to be put into a different language for the English-speaking world. I wish that more books could be translated from the original language so that people like me who can't read Japanese can have access to the books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has great insights into a difficult topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am in love with this book and I have the entire set.  I don't really know how you can get more from this book.  It gives the reader a thorough grounding in the historical and political issues around abortion, the history of abortion, and the politics surrounding the Supreme Court decision that allowed abortion in the first place.   The book doesn't have a point-by-point answer for every question, but you still have a solid understanding of the history behind the subject and the political battles that have taken place.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm reading this book right now, and it has a lot to offer. The writing is very clear. The story and the world are very well thought-out. The book has a good mix of action, romance and adventure, with a few other things thrown in too. The art, even the original Japanese art, is wonderful, and while it is a bit dated now, I've gotten used to the character design.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have read on the subject of writing an introverted book. While it can get a bit confusing at times, the writing style and the explanation of how to write about your own inner world is wonderful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book useful, although a bit dry.  I really enjoyed this book.   It has a very positive tone and teaches good principles to be applied, without going too far into the weeds. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My friend and I recently read The Art of Non-Violence. I'm not a pacifist myself, but my friend was an avid fan of Gandhi. The book gave us a few insight into his life. He is a real inspiration to me, and I know I'll be reading this book again. Thanks again to the author. :)
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most interesting thing about this book was that I never realized until about page 40 or 50 how many different styles I had been reading and what I really wanted to learn from them. It is easy to find books that are only good for one kind of learning (think "learning jazz scales") and then to discover that they are quite different from other books. The author is very well-read and has the ability to pull together the many ideas from many different kinds of learning into a clear and easily understood framework, which I always appreciate.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was one of the best reads of the year! I have been reading a lot of the paranormal genre, and while I really enjoyed them all I thought that this one had it all, with just the right balance of the macabre and the spiritual. This is not a perfect book, but it was a wonderful read! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was very helpful. I've been having issues with intermittent, severe stomach cramping for a month or so. The book helped me see how much of my problems are from food in general and not just an irritable gut.   Thank you so much!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book because the title sounded so cool and I just had to give it a try.   It was so easy to start with, I just finished it in two days.  It's very interesting, has some great anecdotes, and I think it would be really interesting to see what happens in a community when people get together to talk.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a lot of fun reading this book. It was one of those books that really had everything I like about reading. The writing is crisp and descriptive, and I loved all the different characters (I am a big fan of science fiction). I also like that she really focuses on the characters as people and not just stereotypes. I loved that she writes about the difficulties and how this society really works. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi and/or fantasy, because it makes for a nice read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a bit more of the fun and the lightheartedness of the genre I love. I think it's just what I needed, as I have been a bit burned out by books in the genre that feature heavy amounts of angst. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best part about this book was its humor.   One of the characters is named Dave.  And he has this weird accent  he pronounces each "doo" like "dooe" and it makes me laugh every time.  I have never thought of that before, and Dave's accent is not that bad.  The first time I read it, I thought the last paragraph was too long but after a few pages I got used to it.  This was my first comic book since college and I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book.   It was quite challenging, but well worth it.  I have always been frustrated with the difficulty of understanding the language.  This book has helped me overcome that problem.  Thanks for the excellent book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! This book is well written and very informative. I really enjoyed the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the way this one came out. It's one of my favorite stories so far. It was great to read in a new way, and I liked the fact that the characters don't think they're being funny. The writing is very good and the prose is pretty vivid and fun. I'm planning to read all of the books in this series and have been meaning to read a story about a woman named Helen from the 18th century (it's her husband's family's ancestor). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love how this book tells the stories of some of the best characters I've ever encountered.   The worldbuilding was interesting enough and interesting enough that I thought I knew the characters but never quite was able to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this collection, which I read on my flight back from vacation, I discovered two more of the very best short stories in the genre.   I have enjoyed each of the other stories in this collection.  The first story, "Bury Me Not With the Dead," is about a young woman who returns to her childhood home for her own funeral.  It is one of the best short fiction I've ever read, and one of my favorites in the whole genre. I also enjoyed "The Bitter Cup," the second story.  I've heard some people complaining about the narrator's voice, and it's certainly not my favorite voice for short fiction.  But I still enjoyed the story. The last story, titled "The White House," is one that I would be interested in reading the next time I fly.  This story is about the day that a group of friends plan a family reunion, and the problems that follow.  As usual, there are plenty of laughs, good writing, and good stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are three things I've learned about myself from reading this book: 1. The best way to make a good impression is by saying nothing. I was too embarrassed to start a conversation. My only purpose in the book was to not let anyone down. The only thing I learned was to stay silent and pretend not to have heard anyone. 2. I am not the only one who has bad luck.   I felt so lucky to have made friends in the industry with people I admire. I hope this book doesn't ruin their friendship, but it really was a reminder to not listen to my gut. It's not true that if you don't try, you can't fail. I learned that in college and I'm trying to live my life in the same way. I try hard, but I make mistakes too.  3. People want you to be nice. I got it in my teens, and it's so true here. I didn't feel good enough when I wrote about all the times I screwed up and tried to be a bad person, and then ended up being a good person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great story about an amazing character that is also a hero.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great story of a man who was raised Catholic, became an atheist and then became a Buddhist. It was a fascinating experience and I appreciated its clarity and simplicity.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, I feel like I can relate more to my fellow students and it really helped me feel like someone in the same boat, and I had a great time. I'm glad I bought it, even though I haven't finished reading it yet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book. It is a history of the Great Depression. It was very interesting reading about what led to the depression. The author had an interesting opinion on why things changed and I think that his book is worth reading because it provides a great view on how things really happened.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A nice, readable book on how to take advantage of the internet. There's a lot of info, but not overwhelming.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is so well done that I found it to be the kind of book I never thought I'd read in my life. It does take a bit of getting used to but once you do you'll find it's an enjoyable read. I had a lot of fun with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about the history of the Chinese language and its influence on the world. The author does a nice job of introducing the history in an understandable way.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history and language of the Far East or Asian languages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book!   This is the first book I've read about the history of our culture that was written from the perspective of an Asian American woman.   There are a lot of other books that tell the history from an Anglo-Protestant perspective.  This book, however, is different in that it doesn't shy away from the fact that Chinese immigrants were both marginalized and excluded from society.  She highlights the Chinese Americans who were involved in the civil rights and feminist movements.  They are portrayed as successful and productive members of society, not to be taken lightly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I've read. I'm sure you'll love it as well.   A fascinating book about the history of mental illness and how it relates to society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I had been looking for some great books on Buddhism and it was the first one that I found.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not only for people with ADD. I don't think I have ever had ADD, but I would think that this book would be a good guide for anyone who has this condition. The author explains all of the signs that you may have ADD and tells how to treat it. I have seen improvement in my ADD after reading this book. I still struggle with the occasional misbehaviors, but not enough to let it ruin a good day.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. I liked how it was different in the way it dealt with some of the more "mystical" aspects of our world. I enjoyed it in the sense that it was both very detailed and quite a bit longer than one might think. It was interesting and challenging, and I got a lot out of it. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the olden days and is open to new thought.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first began to read this book, I was afraid I wouldn't like it at all. I was worried that I would get a "huh?" I just couldn't picture the good guys saving the day - as if it's the characters who do this and the hero, as if the hero only wants to do good and is in it to make sure the good characters don't suffer. I'm glad I read it. The bad guys are much more likable than I thought.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book, it's fun, very easy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    " It has been a long time since I've read a book this good. I have been looking for a book like this for a long while. This is the kind of book I would read over and over again. The author is very good, writing about his own life and how it relates to other things. I wish he had done more research and been more open about his background, but that's the only thing that bothered me about the book. My husband and I will be looking at the reference and reading the book with great interest."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love that they included real world information about the disease (like the fact that the FDA will not approve an effective drug). I hope this book has been translated and is available in other languages.   The book is informative, and I hope you can read it without any medical knowledge to follow along. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a good science fiction book with the sci-fi atmosphere of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The book comes highly recommended by a good friend and I look forward to reading it often.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books, it is very well written, easy to read and very interesting. The author also talks about some of his own experiences in writing it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been a bit worried about taking a look at the original (and now out of print) edition of this book. I didn't find any real problems with the first edition of the book. The only other negative was that the book had very little "flavor."   However, I was pleasantly surprised at what I got from the third edition.   The most interesting thing about this book is the way it combines a wide range of historical, literary, and sociological perspectives into a single book.  The book is organized into several parts, beginning with a discussion of the history of science and the development of the scientific method.  Then the book discusses the evolution of philosophy, particularly the "natural law" theories of David Hume and Immanuel Kant, and the subsequent influence that this had on the development and development of political philosophy.  These chapters were well written and provided a good overview.  In addition to these, the book goes on to look at other key philosophical questions.  For example, it discusses the relationship between freedom and morality. It also considers the social context of science.  It also looks at the influence of the social sciences on natural science. It covers a number of other topics including the evolution and development in the fields of literature and language.  This book is a wonderful addition to the history books I have in my library and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The idea of "bio" is still very much a thing.  It's only been about 2 years since I started reading and I am loving it.  I also have been reading a lot of fiction and I don't really get into this genre, but now I read a couple of books and this is where my interest is.  A friend told me she read a book the same year I started. I really like her books.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is a must-read, for those interested in the history of the Church and in the development of Mormon belief.   While I have some minor criticisms, it's a nice addition to my library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of the series. I have been reading them for quite some time now and it is really great to see the series finally coming to an end. The beginning was really hard to get into, but once I did I was completely hooked. This series really focuses on two characters, but has enough to go around for a good story.  I really want the series to continue! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is not so much about the book but is rather about the human condition and how to overcome all odds. There is very little plot, but it is well thought out and is a fun read for any age. It is recommended to all who wish to learn more about their own strengths and weaknesses. I highly recommend it. -- Robert I would like to have read more about her in the book. The book focuses on her life, her life as an artist, her experiences, and her work. I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been searching for a book that will help me better understand some of the key concepts of physics, as well as physics in general, and this is the first book I've found which has done just that.   My students have had a great deal of success in developing and understanding the physics concepts in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book I am very happy to have, and it is an excellent guide to understanding the psychology and physiology of the human mind. I am a scientist, and I have always been interested in the mind. This book covers everything from neuroanatomy to pharmacology. This guide should also help to make you a better scientist. I plan to refer to this guide often.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book to give it as a gift. I had purchased many books in the past, and have always been disappointed in their quality. This book exceeded my expectations. I love the style and the subject matter. It's about a woman with a very special gift, a gift from the past that was passed down through many generations, and not to be taken away. The gift is also used by her husband in his work. My daughter loved the story and the cover. Thank you for your hard work. You deserve a round of applause.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a classic, one of the very best (of the last hundred or so). I've been a fan of the Dresden Files since I read them as an adult, and The Darkest Mind was a nice introduction to the series.   The characters are well-developed, the plot is original, and the worldbuilding is fantastic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have tried many time to learn how to read. I started with a paperback book that I bought at the library, but I was just unable to follow the illustrations and didn't understand any of the words. I have finally found a book that teaches how to understand a book, including the illustrations. The illustrations are not as beautiful as the book's illustrations, but they are still pretty. The book has illustrations that make you laugh out loud. My 5 year old son is a big fan of the illustrations!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was introduced to this book by my friend. I had heard good things but have no real familiarity with it. I'm very glad to have gotten a copy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've never been much for the Harry Potter books, and this is the first book I've read that has been any good. It does have a certain amount of the 'Hedwig' feel, but unlike so many of the other Potter books that I've enjoyed, this one doesn't over-use it. It's a very solid book, with interesting characters and the usual entertaining bits, but it has a more mature tone than most of the Potter books I've ever read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't believe that in 2011 I got my first read of  The Unfinished Man  and thought, "this is just what I've been looking for.   It's the perfect book for a woman who has read other women's books, but wants something that isn't a retelling.  "   The first time I read this book, I kept saying to my partner that it sounded like "an autobiography, written by a woman.  The whole point of the book is to illustrate how women feel, and how they see themselves.  I've never felt quite like the woman in the book, though I do still have a lot of growing up to do.  As a child, I felt like I was in two different worlds.  So I always felt the need to separate myself from other children.  It would make things a lot easier if I could just pretend that I was some other girl.  There are few stories in the world that have a more honest description of a woman's relationship with her father than this.  But I'm always going to be the girl, and I'm fine with that.
Write a positive review about a good book:    After a very enjoyable read, I was intrigued by this book.   It is a good follow up to my first (and still my favourite) book on the subject ( The War in Yugoslavia: A Short History ).   The author, John Stossel, has a good grasp of the historical details and he does a very good job of making the details understandable to a non-historian.  He covers the entire history of Yugoslavia from World War II to the present (even taking you through the collapse of communism).   I found the book to be very well documented.  The book is well organized and contains a good number of footnotes to help you to read the source material.    This book is a bit heavy on the "you" stuff but it would be a good read to get a history of the Balkans on your shelf. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really impressed by the depth of the writing, and the wide range of topics covered, including religion, art, politics, history, science, philosophy and more.   The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that there's a few instances of plagiarism and sloppy work throughout the book, which I'm fine with considering it's a non-fiction book.  If it's all true and you need to read the whole thing, definitely give it a try.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just finished the great book "The Spirit Level" by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett. They show how the wealth gap is widening in Britain because the poor are less educated and they are less intelligent. This is not a new topic, but there is much that is new about the two book. I was particularly impressed by the fact that the two authors have looked at the wealth of the top 1 percent and then the wealth for the bottom 1 percent. The bottom 80% of the population have less than 1 percent of the total wealth of society but they have a lot of the income. The rich people have lots of wealth, but the poor people have less. This means that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. What a terrible policy of wealth redistribution. But what is not said is that the poor do have access to a better quality of life than the rich. This book should be mandatory reading for everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book a few weeks ago. My wife and I are avid bookworms and this book was recommended by a friend of ours (we haven't read many of her recommendation books, but loved this one). My wife loved the story, I thought the author wrote an interesting story with the illustrations. It took me a while to get into it. But once I did, I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful, thought-provoking book about how to be a man.   I have read a great deal about the "manly" virtues and what a man needs, and while I have learned a few lessons, I still lack some of the fundamentals.  A very good book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what it takes to be masculine. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent resource for students who want to learn the basics of medieval history.   The book contains many examples, many of which are illustrated.  This book would be perfect for beginning historians or any other students who need a good introduction to the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not for everyone, but if you are looking for a good, well-written and clear introduction to political science, you won't be disappointed.   It is, in a way, the opposite of my other books: for that matter, it is not the opposite at all.  I read all kinds of political science stuff--from the more popular books to the more obscure--but this book is one of the best. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Good book. Interesting and informative. The author does an excellent job of taking an historical event and making it relevant to present-day issues.   It's interesting reading." --M. M. Reads from a distance, in person. The first time I read this book was when I came across it on Amazon. I had read a number of historical books on my Amazon shopping spree, and as I always do, I picked this one up to give it a go. I was pleased to find that the book itself is a good one, and to be honest, I was also surprised at how well researched it is. I particularly liked how the author looked into all the little details which you wouldn't normally think to look into, and then came up with fascinating connections between the two books in question.  It is a little slow going at the beginning and a little dry at the end, but I found the whole thing very interesting, especially as I found myself coming back to it a number time throughout the book.  " A well written and well researched historical account which should be read by anyone who wishes to get a better understanding of the role of women in the church before the First Presidency issued their "Woman's Ordination Manifesto" in 1978."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really happy with this book. It's a good introduction to the field and a good overview of its history.   The book is written in a very easy to understand manner that does not require a PhD in biology to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading The Lord of the Rings for over two decades and I feel that I finally finished it this year. It is a complex and lengthy narrative but I enjoyed it for its very dense yet still accessible writing.   The plot is complex and convoluted but I found myself able to follow most of the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is great. I've enjoyed it a lot.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great example of the genre "science fiction" that was really popular in the 1960's-1970's and that the "hard SF" sub-genre has been trying to shed.   It was published in 1984 and is still the best book ever published about the genre, and I know several people who read it over and over again when they were younger.  It's a good story with a few neat ideas thrown in for good measure.  I have to be careful though because in the beginning it goes into deep space but then gets pulled out at the end, but still it's great science fiction that is well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received the Kindle edition in order to review the book for my students.   The book is well written, easy to understand and easy to read.  There are some great pictures which I appreciated.  This is a very well put together book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book contains a lot of information, but most of it is not that useful for my current project.  It's not difficult to use but I've found a lot more help on the internet for the same thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished an excellent book on the early history of the U.S. That history has been long ignored and almost entirely overlooked. If you have any interest in American history it is the best book you could pick up.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's amazing how many people seem to love this book and to hate it in the same breath, I wonder how many of them will actually read the second part of the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love that you wrote this book. The idea of getting a better understanding of the world is really intriguing to me.  The way the main character explains his background is interesting.  My favorite thing about the book is how it brings the whole "real world" of war to light.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My mom gave this to me for Christmas, and I was blown away by its quality. This is such a good read, but it also provides such a clear and accurate view of the world today.   The book is also very informative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading this book since it came out on my recommendation.   This was a wonderful way to learn more about the world of Islam.  The book covers Islamic history, and covers the major Islamic religions.  In particular, it looks at Islam in a historical context.  I think this is a great book for anyone with an interest in Islamic history.  It is a bit dry and technical but still informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is perfect for those who need to learn the basics of working with a computer but want to learn more about the advanced aspects of working computer.   I found the material I learned in this book useful and I hope it can be of help to the many computer users who are starting out.  Thanks again for providing this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after a great lecture by Dr. Eben Alexander on "How to Become Rich". He makes great points about the value of a strong work ethic. The book does not cover everything but it does go through a whole lot of the topics that make a person rich and provides plenty of great information and links to many good resources. The first thing that stood out for me was the way Dr. Alexander explains the power of self control and the value in being a leader of one's self instead of just following others.   It sounds so true.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book about some very challenging experiences. The author uses his own experiences to explain how the world sees us. In particular the chapter on race relations in the United States, and how whites and blacks are treated by the law, is excellent. My biggest problem is that the author does a very poor job of explaining why the author thinks this is the case. As a whole it is very well written, and the advice of this book should be required reading for people interested in understanding how race and the law interact. Recommended.   From a book review:  "The point that Mr. Taylor makes is, if we want to be free, if it's really important, we have to deal with each other."  (P.S. "When a Black Man Cries" is available as an audiobook for a very reasonable price. )
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book that I've read that has brought me into discussions about how we can better our lives and be happier. The author has taken many great insights from Buddhist wisdom and put it into an accessible and very easy to read format. I am sure that this is a valuable book for everyone who seeks to improve their mental health and get into deeper and deeper states of meditation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife and I both enjoyed this book very much. The book contains a good balance of factual and historical information and does not fall short of describing the situation correctly, especially in its discussion of the rise of nationalism. The author takes a different approach, instead focusing on the cultural issues, which are of interest to many readers. I liked how she presented the rise to power of the French-Canadian government and its opposition, and how this was related to the rise in nationalism throughout the country. The only problem I had with the book was the lack of a table of contents. I would have appreciated the inclusion of a complete list of the book's subjects, since I couldn't find a map of Quebec, a bibliography, and other basic information about the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm pretty sure you could tell that this is a work of art in every way.   You have a wonderful understanding of history, and you have a very clear grasp of the themes you are exploring.  I like that you go into the different eras of history and the different types of characters, and explain why they were the way they were.  There are many books on history with more information, but I think this one was well written and well researched. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book. It took a while for me to get through the book, but once I did, the writing was enjoyable. There were a few pages where I was confused, but after a few more minutes of looking at my notes, I got it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My daughter is now a woman with an unshakeable sense of identity. It's taken many years to get there. I got to the point where she was comfortable identifying as a woman and I let her. This book made it easy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent for those who are not particularly interested in modern Chinese history or culture but would like to learn more about the period of Chinese history covered by the work and how it compares to later periods of Chinese political and cultural history. It is also excellent for students of history, both undergraduate and graduate, and for those interested in learning about other cultures.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A little on the slow side, but a good read. The characters were well written, the pacing was excellent, and the ending was wonderful. The only negative, which I'll try to explain, is that there was one scene that just was not quite right for me. The main character, who I believe is gay and married, is described as a "good Christian". So, after about half of the book, I found myself thinking "so, he's still a good Christian, but he's married and has children". Not sure if this is a fault in the book (it's not like it would be explained at the beginning), but that's my only slight negative.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book. I liked it from the first page.  The description of the history is right on point, the story is interesting, and the characters are likeable. The first 3/4 of the book is an "out of the woods" sort of tale. As the author, he goes to various countries and cultures and brings back various items. The best part of the story, is that it has a happy ending. The author is a gifted storyteller.  I recommend this book to all the fans of historical fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is really fun, and easy to understand.   I am a big fan of the series and was looking for something easy to read and quick to read.  I would definitely buy this book again."
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story line of a young boy with leukemia and his amazing team of nurses in the hospital were beautifully illustrated.  I loved the way the team worked together to provide each of the kids with treatment.   I thought this book was a wonderful way to relate the importance of teamwork and caring and respect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book has helped me immensely with my learning process.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've never read a more engrossing story than the one in This Book is a Wonderful Life by Charles Dickens. It's a fascinating and well written story of life in a poor area of Britain. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion this book, like the first in the series,   is a great continuation of the series.   The art is the same, the writing is the most perfect in the story.  Also, I feel like this book gives an overview of the world, which is important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The title is just too cute! I like to call it a children's book on her own because of the fact that the main character is a girl. It is also one of the more well written books I have ever read. My only gripe is that the book is not as good as the book from the library that I borrowed from.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of the work of David Foster Wallace and he has not aged all that well. This novel was a little disappointing but I was glad I got to read it.   The story is very interesting but there were parts of it I found frustrating.  One of my biggest peeves is the lack of research, especially about his hometown, which I knew little about. I was just surprised he was able to come up with all the stories he did about that. The story was definitely readable but it was hard to get into. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's very well done. I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter books and movies. They inspired me to become a writer in my teens. This book made me want to do the same thing, but with a Harry Potter character instead. I can't wait to read more from J.K.Rowling, especially her upcoming books! I think I'll get all my Harry Potter needs from this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful, entertaining read! I learned a lot from this book, and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought and read this book after I had bought my Kindle Fire for myself. It was a bit long in the book, so I put it back and then found out that this book can be downloaded. If you can put up with the length, this is a great book. I do not like the idea of putting a ton of books on my Kindle, and this is much more manageable and less stressful to browse through. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the second time I've read this book, and both times I have been pleasantly surprised. I haven't been able to find an easy book to follow in a long time, and after reading the first half of this one, I can say that it isn't bad, and I'd recommend it to any fan of fantasy, steampunk, urban fantasy, and paranormal.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm reading The Last of the Enforcers by David Goodis.   The narrator is well done and well told.    The characters are very well done too.  The only complaint I have is that the ending is a little ambiguous.  But, that's why I'm enjoying this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book! I am so happy I finally bought this book because I have been meaning to read it for years but never found a time. The book talks about various types of "bad karma". This is one of those books you have to read and then think about for a long time because you are definitely going to be inspired.  I love how different people's karma is from another's. It's interesting how some people's "bad" karma are so different from how other people's are. Sometimes you can't help but be "offended" by someone's bad karma. But I feel as if I am more open to "good" karma than other people, and this is because I already have such a strong negative belief system in my life. I know that "badness" does not necessarily have to do with my inner state, but it's interesting that a very different type of karma has occurred to me than other peoples' karma. I also really enjoyed how the author presented the book and talked about what it's like to actually live as someone whose inner nature is very different from everyone else's. The book itself is very easy to read. I liked the way that he described his life.   This book will definitely make you want to read all of the other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes, then this book is for you. It's one of my favorite Holmes stories and I have been looking for a good translation of it. This one was definitely a hit!"
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading a lot of science fiction recently and have enjoyed a lot. I have never read a book that has me actually thinking about what I'm reading.   This book definitely has me thinking more about the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have never read a book that moved me so much, and this one is no exception. The book is a good introduction to many of the things I find fascinating. The author does a good job at explaining the science, but also does a great job at providing a sense of the beauty of nature.   While there are many aspects to this book that are good, I especially liked the parts that focused on ecology. This is a very good book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book several months ago and found it interesting, if not a little frustrating in its conclusion. There are some nice points here and there, and the characters are interesting, but the author spends too much time trying to prove that there are no such things as atheists. That is not necessary, and I have heard from plenty of atheists who are not as convinced of God's existence as I am, but this book leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my first time reading "Makers of Modern Japan." I had heard of the book through some of the people I had been talking with about how they were going to Japan. I have always been interested in the history of Japan, so it was interesting to see how they did things and their inventions. I am planning on reading more books by these authors.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a fun read about an eccentric man who is living on the edge. I think it's a little more light-hearted than the other books I have read by this author, but the humor is still good. I hope the next book in the series is good because I'd like to get into this world.  "The Great Game" by C. J. Cherryh "This book is fun to read. You can see the author's interest in the characters and their adventures. The only thing that makes me wish for more is that he would have made the other character a little bit more likeable. It doesn't really make much difference in the overall story as a whole but I do wish he would make it more of a conflict and not just the two sides. "
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! It's a must read for anyone interested in what the bible really says. I got the first two books on a Kindle with the free bible study app and now I'm reading this one on my Nook. I can't wait to find out what the next three will be!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of the books in this series and I read them all in one sitting. I love that the books are fun, funny and fast-paced. I really liked this year's novel, 'The Last Samurai'. It wasn't as fun as 'Last Samurai', but it was good and that's all that counts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author's research has been well worth the time and effort it took to complete. The subject matter is in keeping with the general theme of this blog and the writing is good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I liked how she kept the chapters fresh and interesting. As far as a novel of this subject, this book is good enough. It had some very interesting scenes but some of the plot lines didn't come together until after I had read the last chapter. Also it's a bit too long for me. It's okay though.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for the first time over the summer and had absolutely no idea how much I would like it.  It's great!   The pacing is perfect, and the plot is interesting and has a lot of twists.   Overall, this book was quite good and very well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book. I was not looking forward to reading the first two sections of the book and I really didn't enjoy them. However, there were some good parts and after finishing the book I felt really good about my own intelligence. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about myself and my own family.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of my favorites. A great study in the psychology of decision-making. I found this book to be especially helpful when making decisions in a work setting. I have had to deal with many people who were interested in my research, who would be extremely helpful to me, but just didn't seem interested in reading the material because they were interested first in the information they wanted and second in getting what they wanted. This book made the material very accessible to both groups.   I also like the fact that the author is both an anthropologist and a professional statistician. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really well written. I really liked it.   The author's research is really good and detailed.  It's a wonderful resource for those interested in the topic of "sex differences".   It will certainly provide useful information for a more educated and informed public. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an excellent book!   A clear and readable presentation on the most important topic:  If a dog or cat is a pet and not a companion, and if the dog or the cat has a human who treats the dog as a pet, and the dog continues to be a pet even though the human is away, then that's sad.   If the dog and the cat continue to be pets, and they enjoy each other's company, and are allowed to be friendly and friendly-minded, but the dog never becomes comfortable, is unhappy, or is unhappy in her human's absence, then the dog is sad. A dog is not a puppy, and even though a puppy may look cute and act cute, a dog is a dog and a dog must know when he's being petted, but also when he is being petting; it is not the same thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleased to see the author's approach to the book. In fact, she seems to have taken some ideas from her own previous books and put them into this one.   As a teacher of African American and Latino students, I found the book very helpful in helping us to better understand and discuss these issues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is like an encyclopedia of Chinese folklore, but more so. It is the story of two brothers and a sister who live in China, and the adventures they get into (or don't) because of their differences and their mutual love for the fairy tales and legends of the region. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only negative thing I can say about this is that it can be a bit long, so it is not really a good read for the time it was written. I had no problem reading it in one sitting, but I would have loved to have seen more out of the first book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I enjoyed the book. It wasn't as good as the first time I read it (I think, as a young adult, that might have been more of a criticism) but it had enough good ideas that I was left thinking. The prose is pretty good as well. I have a couple of quibbles about the ending (it would have been better if it had been a little more explicit about his death and what it meant), but otherwise it was a pretty good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have tried many diets and have lost lots of weight. This is by far the best one I have used. It is not the hardest, it is not going to kill you, and it works!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. The author does a very good job presenting information and providing sources in a way that is not only understandable but easy to use. It is very accessible to students and parents, and it is fun reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the new edition of The Way of the Superior Man. This new edition is very well-written and explains a lot. It is a book that is more than a few years old and is well-worth the investment. The new edition does an amazing job explaining the old material. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    While   is a good choice as a first book,  is more about the author and his ideas.   It is more an exercise in reading,    than a book about books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the most interesting books I've read in years. I'm very intrigued by all the various angles that are discussed. The information and opinions given by the authors makes this book an excellent companion to the research. I find it interesting, but I'm really glad it was not required reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book and find it well researched, well written and interesting.   The main thesis of this book is that humans are in a struggle to keep the balance between our instincts to explore and to conserve, as well as our need to conserve and exploit the natural resources of the world.  The most interesting part of this paper is how it uses evolutionary biology, psychology and economics to explain how our species has evolved over many millions of years to create the complex society we have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book very much. It is a history of the Irish people from the ancient times to the present day, in a very clear way, and the research is excellent, and very well done.   It contains information about the Gaelic religion, as well as information about Gaelic history, and its influence on the Irish today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an entertaining read, but the writing was rather stilted.   I think the book does have a very interesting premise, but it failed to deliver on that premise. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   The author does a good job of showing how the world has changed through time. I particularly enjoyed the story about how the Catholic Church got into the way that it is today. It gave me a good insight into the current Church in the west. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful read. There are a lot of books out there for kids like me, but I have yet to see one so much fun to read as "The Bookworm's World." I've always enjoyed books that are funny. This book definitely hits that spot.   The author gives a wonderful explanation of how to make the books, and even the t-shirts, as well as the coloring books and other projects. I look forward to coming back for more :)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked the book, it was well written and informative. The author went into detail on a wide variety of topics including nutrition, medical and biological information.    A couple of months ago I wrote about how I think we should all be living healthier by living off of our food budget. This book really hit that nail on the head.  If I lived by my food budget, I'd be in shape and probably be able to afford a better apartment. I've been reading this book for a few months and really like the way it went into more detail than what I usually read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! It was great at giving some history about a group of people who weren't always well known in the United States, but are pretty well known now: the Amish. The Amish are a religious sect in the USA that still hold to the belief of their faith while having a lot of modern conveniences, like cars, refrigerators, and modern technology.   The book was written by a historian who studied the Amist religion for a while, and it was pretty interesting reading. I enjoyed that there was an overview of the Amists life, not just their religion but their culture as well, in an American context, and the history that they've helped to preserve, both before and after they left the land of their birth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. The main characters are likeable, the writing is good, the illustrations are lovely and the plot was interesting enough to me to read the first 3 volumes, and the end of the book is very good and makes for a good end to a great read.
