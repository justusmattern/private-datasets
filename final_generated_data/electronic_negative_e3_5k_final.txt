Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This card is great for recording a few videos. The sound quality is not great. In fact it isn't that great at all, if you want sound quality you'll be better with a cheap sound card. The card works great for some games and not so great for others. The only thing that is redeeming it for me is the HDMI connectivity. For my purposes it is a big waste of $15+ cash. The driver software is a bit of a pain to use.It is a total piece of junk for my business pc's. If you have an AMD Radeon HD 6000 series card don't buy this card. It will NOT work with an iGPU. I have since replaced it with the sound card I've had for 4 months now, which works great. The new card has sound quality better but is still not good. I am completely disappointed with Soundblaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is not quality and I've used other brands for more sound quality.  It is cheap and not to mention it is very cheap compared to other sound card products.  I don't recommend this product at all unless you use this sound card more than once.  Don't buy this card unless you are serious about sound quality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product works, but the sound quality is horrendous. The sound quality on this product is horrible compared to other sound cards that I have. I really dislike the sound card with the sound coming from my speakers, I wish they would upgrade this sound card instead. It does sound OK when I turn the volume up, but for the most part, it's not the sound I want. Do not buy this item.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is pretty poor, if you listen to anything then its pretty poor. The sound chip is junk!!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product has a very short product life.  It will not stay in my car for at least a month.  If you have a GPS device, like my Garmin GPS+, this product will not work well.   The sound quality is not great at all.  I can't tell whether it is the sound or the microphone that is defective.  The microphone does not work properly with all my cars.  So it sounds better than my iPod, but it doesn't work as well as my GPS.  Don't buy this product unless you want something that works great with all your other GPS devices

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item expecting it to sound great, but when I started using it, I was disappointed. It's loud!

It also just wouldn't work with mp3 files, and I don't have any other sound system. I'll be returning it.I'd advise anyone who buys this product to use my recommendation: Get a sound card with Dolby surround sound capability if you plan to use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product has one major drawback - the sound quality does not match the product on Amazon.

The product works well for other products. The microphone is good, but the sound does not. I am returning both units

Amazon support advised me to call Sony customer service and have them call Sony support about the monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the product from Amazon. I have never received it. I returned the item and Amazon will not refund me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to play my iPod Classic and I only have one problem. I bought these as they worked with my iPods before and were easy to keep in my car. The sound quality is poor. The headphones sound a little tinny, the mic sound is muffled, the sound is generally not great... and I am VERY SURE that there is nothing I can do about it. I will return them. Do yourself a favor, do your research 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound was good, but when I loaded the drivers, i could not hear any sound out of the sound card.  The card had an internal sound chip that had a sound volume level of only about 20-30% of what the card should normally have.  Even if you don't use the sound cards, you will not be able to hear the sound that is produced by your sound card unless you use a software sound card decoder that specifically uses the sound frequencies your sound chip uses.This is a very basic sound card, there was no option of adding a sound card to my sound card sound driver.  Don't buy this card 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my iPod for free, and received no box from Amazon.  However I have to call Apple Support because it has a faulty iPod connector (I've owned it for 3 months and now the picture is blurred and it doesn't play music).  The connector that came with my iPod had a scratch in it, and the label is missing from my case.  Apple recommends they send me a replacement connector to replace it...but Amazon's warranty doesn't cover the connector--that's for the shipping.  Do not buy from Amazon...they're a bad electronics service.  Don't buy anything from Amazon

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this router because I wanted the extra speed and had great service from other wireless routers I've owned.  I have no problem with the performance of my router and its wireless network.However, when I did some work in my home network (running Windows Media Center Media Center server) my wireless network dropped significantly. I'm using the wireless client to stream audio to my sound system which does not use the wireless network's internet connection. I don't use it for gaming, so I don;t know whether the quality was noticeably better on the network than when using wired.This product is slow.  It sends my Internet connection out to the network for no reason. I think that my internet service has a lower QoS setting than the default.  Don't even bother buying this product if you plan on playing video. The sound quality is very poor, and the lack of WiFi coverage is annoying 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product to replace my wireless mouse and wireless mousepad. Upon receipt I found that the mouse was not compatible with the newer wireless mouse models from Logitech (which are wireless mousepads).

My wireless keyboard has a Logitech Wireless Keyboard and the mouse is no longer wireless compatible. I will never buy another Logitech mouse unless they offer an exchange for my discontinued product

If you do not know your mouse can it's worth buying.

I bought two for my home office and it was the worse mouse I have ever bought

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to be able to play XM Radio.  The product worked for that. BUT! when it came time to remove the mic from the remote (for playing XM), I found that the sound would be muted out of the sound system.  I could still hear the music from my CD player...BUT...I now have to switch to my wireless transmitter to hear the sound.  This is a huge let down considering the fact that it's been good so far.  It doesn't even play music that works fine when it's in the car and it would sound great with my stereo system...It's just not a sound system after all the other cheap products that I've bought before.   The sound quality is definitely not great - it sounds very muffled

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The card is not compatible with the new model VPCK2.3.1 (1GB RAM). We will be returning it for another product (or not), because it does not work with VPCJ2.1/3.2.0 cards. The sound quality was the worst we've experienced on a sound card for a wireless device, if it's not compatible! The sound card is also not compatible when used with wireless cards.The sound card also doesn't work with the wireless sound card we've tested. The manufacturer will not replace the card without sending us the original, which we'll have to send back.The driver software for this card is really a pain. We are hoping that VPC will update their drivers soon, but the only thing the sound card will work with now is the Windows Media Player software for sound card, and we had to purchase and install it. So if you don't have Windows Media player, then don't purchase this sound card...you won't get any sound at all

Unfortunately, the wireless system did not work with my Sonoma wireless router, so I purchased a different one and did not receive any sound on the wireless (I could not turn it off) from the soundcard!I wish I had bought this product instead of Soundport, they have an excellent product...if your wireless system is not compatible you will waste your money!  The product did work on my Apple Airplane Wireless Audio system, but that was not an 802.11 compatible product!If you don't know your wireless cards model number, go buy the Sonoma, it does work with all other wireless products

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have the VHS camcorder that works great. I bought this camcorders for use on my camcorded television, which is great. But when I use it in 1080P mode, it freezes. Not very useful feature.The sound is also a little muffled. But it's not good...I guess it's ok for my use, but not my cam corder. My wife also has the C-20 camcording machine and the sound is perfect. I am hoping it works fine in both.  I will be returning this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this item in November 2011 and it took me 1 day to ship it.  When it arrived, I noticed the product had the wrong label on the box.  It said "KIPRA" on the label.  What kind of product is that?  The product label was completely misspelled.  The label was also very thin.  There was no option to purchase any kind of replacement product.I would never use a product like this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product thinking it would be great. I can't even use it, it has not even worked. It does not work for any DVD player. If you use your DVD player to play DVD, you can't find that you did not get it because it does not have the product in the player. This thing is a nightmare to use 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been purchasing these adapters for wireless routers. They work, but they are not worth the $20.00 purchase price. They fail to receive any wireless signal when used with the stock wireless network that comes with my router.  I spent 2 nights trying to get a signal from my wireless router, and finally had to take it off the network and buy one of the models that works when connected to the factory network.  If you are using wireless connectivity with a wired router, purchase the standard model from Amazon and do not buy these adapters.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product works great, but unfortunately does not produce a clear picture.  The product did work for my video system and the sound, however it is only for one channel (audio).  I cannot even get it to work for the other channel (video).  The sound itself is very weak.  I use a cheap sound system that sound great at the sound level I need.  This Soundcard would be very disappointing if it could not produce sound at all.I have used this product for several months now and it has been the worst audio sound device I have ever had.  Very loud and clear, but very small sound quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product thinking it would be a great sound device, I can now tell you this item is a complete waste.  The sound is NOT that great.  It is extremely loud but it has a very small sound quality, you won't notice it in the car when you turn your car radio on and turn the volume up.   The only good thing about it is the sound isolation the ear cup provides for the sound speakers.  I bought the item thinking it was great for the drivers, it did NOT fit my car perfectly, at least not for the speakers.I cannot even return my item since they will not take it back, the shipping to my house was pretty much a joke.

Both products sound fine in comparison, but they don't sound better than the JVC sound system sound quality earphones I also have.I've heard nothing but problems with the iPod mini - it never goes or stays sound for long!I have sent it back for defective product, and I am leaving MP3 player sales to JVC.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item to help with my sound card but I didn't expect it to sound better than my speakers (which have sound hardware that sound great).  The sound is a bit tinny.  It's not very clear. I've had to turn off the sound to get it sound better, but it's also not very loud. I'm not happy with it.  I'm pretty sure the sound card is the problem but there are many other sound card models that sound a little better than the Sound Card-to-USB combo I got. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used the product for a while and it worked for that device.I was thinking of the SDHC card for my Nikon 5D camera, however, I don't like the fact that my card has a small square sticker that looks like it will "stick to the edge of the card". It doesn't work well at all, and won't mount any SDHC cards that have those square stickers on them

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was a very thin case - only 25% of the case made -and the buttons did not fit the plastic handles of this product. I couldn't get the mouse to work for a day after the purchase.The software was slow to install and would sometimes crash. I had to remove the software in order to get it running. It was a complete waste of my time - and now it is unusable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product on December 12, 2014.   When it arrived, it had only the box in my possession.  I tried both to reset it and it does not recognize the memory.  The packaging that came with it was cheaply made.  Very poorly made. I called the manufacturer and was told they had it sent to Amazon.  Amazon said the shipping fee had to be paid.  On June 16, 2015 I ordered another product from Amazon and the product was defective, too.  They said the cost was $7.90 plus shipping.  This is unacceptable!  I will never purchase Amazon again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound is nice, the sound quality is excellent when playing MP3's, but the sound card is extremely unreliable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product has never worked as advertised. The product will not print the card without the paper roller, which requires you to hold it for a few seconds. I was just a little disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have an HP DL580 desktop PC running windows XP and had a sound card that used Audio EQ4. Now the sound is terrible and the sound card won't work on my sound system. I tried contacting HP support, they said that it would be a software/sound card issue and that I could send the unit back. I do NOT RECOMMEND HP FOR PRODUCTS. I am using the sound cards included with my HP products (Soundcard-SPX) and they sound great.The soundcard has an HP logo on it. HP has replaced it with the soundcard that HP replaced.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product because it worked for my iPods before they changed the sound chip to JVC for me. It would sound OK for my iPod, but not if I used the built-in sound card I bought at Amazon. The sound would be muddled, not crisp.  This sound card is worthless for iPods with built- in sound cards like the Soundcraft S1 sound card, which allows you to hear sound through the headphones. This sound blaster doesn't have any sound when using my headphones with it because my headphones use the headphone jack.It is no longer a sound card and they're not fixing this problem. I will return it as I find my other sound cards work fine without this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound was very mediocre, but that doesn't matter if the cable is defective. I got a cheap sound card from Amazon, and it worked great...until my next phone call. Now my sound is only available in the FM stations, and FM radio is not sound-quality quality. In my case, it's a cheap mp3 player from Amazon. The sound on my HDT3 was the same as the FM sound card, but it wasn't clear enough to distinguish between the two (the sound was muddy).  I'm returning the sound card

They gave me a warranty for the product which I have never received. So I have returned my item. I bought the item over at Target because they have great customer service. I was very happy with the product but in a few months after my item was returned, the product had gone dead. I am now waiting for HP to send me a new product for the same item. HP has since sent me a small box full of defective products. They have apparently never responded to customer support, which is very disappointing. It appears HP has stopped support for these products...if you buy a mouse on sale or clearance for $40-50, don't buy this product. This mouse worked well for 2 years and now it has been downgraded several times and the buttons no longer work. Don't waste your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound of my DVD player sounded much better than that of the sound that I got out of the earphone when I bought it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item based on the size and color I was told I would receive. I got it, but my mouse stopped functioning properly and the product never shipped. This is what I'm currently using.The mouse is unusable.  I used it for two weeks and it had been broken and I have had to replace it with another mouse with the same type of software and the same problems.  The mouse is currently unusable and I'm unable to get it fixed because I cannot find a support web site!  Don't buy this mouse unless you want a mouse with a mouse button which doesn't work at all. This mouse should be junk. Don't waste your money on this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had these headphones for about 6 months and the sound is horrible. I had bought these hoping they would sound better than my Sony SVPX headphones. Well, the sound that I have gotten is horrible, even with my small car stereo. I also ordered two pairs for my wife, thinking they would help us. They just make sound worse, in my opinion. I have tried all the sound settings, all the way up to -6dB. I returned them both and will never order from SoundSport again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have the sound card that came with my sound system. I use this sound card only for the DVD player, not the sound system itself.  I did not expect that this card would not be compatible with my other sound cards and it is very very frustrating.  The sound card itself is quite sound, but the sound from the DVD sound system is very poor.  It sounds like it is barely audible. The sound is really bad, and the sound is too weak to even use in conjunction with the sound.If you buy this product, make sure you have an extra sound card just in case there is a problem with the one that you bought. I bought a sound card and it sounded great.

After several tries, I finally received it to work, but there was a severe delay in connecting it to the sound device. The sound was poor and I had to turn down the volume to get any sound. The microphone is worthless, at best, if it is not the sound card. Don't buy this microphone, buy another, you will save yourself some cash 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a wireless mouse with Logitech product, and I use it all the time.  But when I received this mouse I found it to be less than half price at Amazon, it was a pain for me to ship it to Amazon.  It is too slow.  The software was unusable, and it doesn't work well, so you'll be wasting your money on it.  I don't like the fact that Logitech won't support the mouse anymore.  This mouse requires at least 20 clicks per second for the mouse to respond.  Don't buy this mouse.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this to be able to use it as an mp3 player.  Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor, and the sound on my CD player was significantly worse than my other products I have purchased.  The only thing it would play was a few low-quality mp3 files, even though I had it working with my car stereo, and it would burn out my player too!  The earbuds also would not stay in place, in spite of the fact that I had them set to earbud mode 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The mouse is made of foam. Very uncomfortable to use. My only other mouse had an X-360 Mousepad and it lasted longer than this one, so it was time to find a mouse without this type of plastic. This mouse does NOT stay in your mouse pad or on your desk. It does not grip well, which makes me very uncomfortable using it. I will be returning it

It is cheap to buy, but poor sound quality.  I will never order this again! This product has two problems - (1) the connector cable broke right away from being inserted, and (2) the sound quality does not sound that great.  There are worse cable companies out there, and I can no longer trust them to produce sound quality - my recommendation is to try a different item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this product with a free shipping option.  I have never had any problems with the item.  However, the sound quality is not even close to what I had on my Pioneer CDJ earphones.  What happened to this product is it is not stereo earphone sound quality.  In fact, it is terrible.  This sound headset is a big step down from earphones that I normally use.  It is not comfortable at all.  So, I would advise that you purchase something else.I am returning this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product did not come with any type of warranty.It is my opinion that these batteries don't work well for the batteries we ordered. They usually lasted for less than a full charge, and usually only lasted for a few hours before they started draining the batteries like a drain. If you are looking for a good battery pack, order something else, this is the one for you.I have returned mine as they are not worth the cost of return 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought 2 of these printers for $300 and didn't even get them set up right.  The only thing is they're not touch printer.

I will never buy another printer

It is no longer an mp3 player for me.I will be returning this product! I don't need it anymore

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is ok, the sound is fine except that the FM station reception is too weak to actually listen to radio stations (and the CD player doesn't seem to work either). The only thing is that it has a cheap sound chip which is not available for all radios (in most of the cases). I tried both wireless and wired, both worked ok, so I bought this because it's the best sound card I have, and I have my old sound card that has it. It doesn't even work with wired iPod's that I have.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I wanted a nice sound system at a reasonable price. Unfortunately I found it to be very poorly designed. The sound quality is terrible - barely usable sound, barely works. You'll need to get a quality sound system (like Shure) or use other sound gear for stereo. It is a sound deadcard so it has to be turned on for the sound to sound. I've had to buy one of the better sound setups from another manufacturer and I've been extremely disappointed.

I bought these headphones and when I tried to turn the volume up the sound started to fall. I called TBS and was told that this was the headphone's problem, so I returned it. TBS sent me an RMA number and had not returned the item. Do not buy these headphones! They don't sound any better than the Tonex BX9's that I had been buying for a while! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This antenna works great for me, but don't have any other reviews about it. The sound quality is very poor when compared to the product I bought from Pioneer. I am using it for a small FM station that has satellite channels. I had to turn the sound down to compensate for the weak reception. I do not have an antenna for another antenna to pick up the station signal. This product does NOT cut the signal. Don't buy this antenna

I have just returned my pair, and am now returning any other product that I can get rid of these because they don't sound great, which means I will have to buy my next pair of cheap earbuds instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product did not work for my iPod. I got two complaints about the product not working.  I returned it because it was defective and the manufacturer should stand behind its products. This product will not work with any iPods not that I use. The product will only work with newer iPods. This is the second one I have returned since they don't work with my iPod either.The company is so slow in sending the products out that I can't even find out how to send my product back because I will not buy it from them any more

There's a chance they will replace it.So far I've bought $14 ones from Pioneer and used it for 2 hours, the sound is just not quality

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the mouse 2 for a small monitor. I ordered this mouse and never received it. After about a month of not getting any information from Amazon I called them, they sent me a return label and it was in the mail. I was told they'd send me a new one. Well when I got it, there was a big scratch on it, so I contacted Amazon and they sent them a new mouse to replace it. The manufacturer was not able to deliver my original mouse so I'm pretty disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is extremely poor. The sound is very distorted. It is very loud and can't really be heard if you have any kind of speakers or headphones attached. The only good thing about the sound is the mic sound that it has when it is recording or talking to the sound card. I was very disappointed in Sound Card for the price I paid.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality was mediocre compared to my Pioneer sound system.  I can't use it with any sound app because it refuses to play songs with CD's (some of my MP3s would freeze up) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used the card with 2 PCI-E adapters and 2 Firewire adapters, and have had no problems.  The sound quality on these adapters is very poor and sound of the card will sometimes sound too quiet.  There's no sound output except when using headphones.  So I bought a stereo sound card which works better than this card.  Unfortunately, this card doesn't use the sound card port when using it as a sound device for the wireless card or any sound card that's not an HDMI card. In other words, if you use the card without any sound out, it doesn't sound any better then my sound card. There's not even sound when using the wireless sound card

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is the cheapest product we have ever bought.

We have returned it and will be using other software to record music 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This antenna is great for the size it is. The noise and reception of this antenna is horrible. I do not recommend this product because it will not last. It will break or clip out at some point (if you don't use it) in a week. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been very happy with this product for years, but after one update to my sound card, it does not work anymore. I've tried every sound card on the market with sound and no luck, yet it seems to be something that HP has not fixed, although it has not caused any more problems for my HD player that I've had. It seems like HP is making these sound cards so poorly they don't work at all, so I cannot use these products anymore with my PC. I have to pay for a new sound card (if I can find one). I am leaving this product on sale because I have other products with sound.

I've tried it with no sound at all.I just can't trust the sound quality on this product, and have decided to throw it away.  I bought this item thinking it was an entry level sound system, however the sound is far from ideal.  If your house has a sound system there is no reason for buying this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is junk. I bought it because the color is very close to my Apple Macs and I wanted a quality product to replace my HP product.I received it at the end of January 2010 and now I have it sitting in my office waiting for service. The sound quality is poor for a sound card, I was hoping I'd get the sound quality that I got with my Sony sound card. I've had to return this product as well.  It has absolutely no sound quality! It doesn't sound louder or better than the sound on my stereo. The only thing it does is make the sound blower sound.  I'm not sure if it's the sound card that is broken or something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a cheap product with an easy-to-use product button that is easy to break. The microphone is not very loud - in my experience, it's average at best - so I returned it. The sound quality is OK, but when you try to record, it just stops playing. I bought it thinking it would be a great piece of equipment - it sounds OK when you record yourself - but it just doesn't work. Don't buy this product - it's not worth $15!!

It is a complete waste of $20. I now have to wait to receive a replacement for the same thing. If I had used an HDMI 1-8HD cable, it would have been a perfect product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this antenna about 2 weeks ago, and installed it and it was absolutely not working.  The sound quality was very poor and I could not hear it when recording at my home. I was unable to get any feedback from the antenna. I contacted Amazon, and they said it was because my satellite receiver had no antenna.  I ended up shipping it back to them to get it fixed.  A week later it started ringing in my car and I had to call customer service again because the antenna was now working and the sound was better.  They said the sound still wasn't good, and I said I was having trouble getting it to record. They said there was a technical problem, and it's been 2 months.  If it's a problem with the antenna... then maybe you should get an antenna with better reception! I'm not that tech savvy, and Amazon should be looking for another product...

Don't buy this item unless you have a  compatible player with a similar product that works with these iPods.  The sound quality is disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was shipped very late, and it wasn't until Monday after I received it that I realized there is a defect in the cable that connects to the USB device.  The cable is made of thin metal that will get scratched, which will not have a chance of being fully waterproof when used with my Samsung cell phone for 10+ hours a day... this item was not fully waterproof at all!  It's now in my box marked as "unused" or "unsupported".   It is very cheap cable, which I was hoping I would never need.  If your device is an HP PC laptop (that supports USB 1.0), this product won't work!  I have returned it, and I would recommend getting a better cable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality was acceptable.  However, the buttons were not in any position to use sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was only able to receive 7 cards when I ordered. I was unable to check shipping status before purchase because of no credit card number.

The customer service reps said to scan for the serial number, wait a few minutes, and then send it back to the vendor with a new card. So what happens when you don't get a serial number? The cards that are not working will be voided

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It has the ability to work with my sound card but not with my network sound. The sound quality was terrible and the sound was just a big mess that would have to be kept in the car for over 10 minutes when you turn the volume up.  I returned the item and bought a generic sound card which worked better.

It has the same sound card issues as other Soundblasters (Soundcard issues). I have purchased one from Amazon and now the sound quality is far worse than my factory sound card which uses Dolby Headphones and have sound quality to spare... if you don't have the sound card, don't buy this product!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I returned this item on Nov. 1. The only reason I returned it was because the sound quality was terrible. I have my trusty pair of Soundengine ear phones, they sound great. They don't sound this cheap. Soundengine sound cards are very sound-starred. I returned them because of the sound distortion from this sound card. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this product. It is clearly not sound compatible.

This is now an annoying printer and I will not use it anymore because of the poor print quality, price gouging, etc

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used this product before and it works great for connecting my HD to my network.  However, I have now had a couple of issues with it. The first one is that it doesn't work for the IPTOS 5.1 Network Card.I have now switched to the 8-QWP product which works well. The second one is a wireless sound adapter, which works great, but I've had a negative experience with the wireless sound product.  It doesn't play any sound from my car speakers at all.  If it does, it is usually muffling, or it has static.  Either way, if it doesn's working, don't use it for wireless sound because the sound quality is terrible

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product thinking it would be great for my Apple Power Mac 755 running Power Windows XP Professional. I used it for two days and it was slow as a death trap. It does the same thing on each of my other Macs. The thing is that I have both a second-gen PowerMac G5 and iMac G3. The iMacs do not work with the card, although the card works with both my other devices. You can try to find a better product - they all are slower than this product.  I would never have bought this item if it was not for the warranty.  You will have to contact Apple for a replacement or something if you're not satisfied with a bad card

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have an HP 9100c office computer and an HP 300 HP portable CD player. These devices use optical discs. As the pictures are smaller than the disks themselves these discs sound terrible. The sound quality is poor and the player is constantly playing the same sound. Sound from the player with no sound is not that great. This sound card does not play back CDs. The only thing that it does is burn them. The player is unusable. It would be nice if HP could provide a sound card with sound quality. I would buy it from Pioneer instead.

I had the product in my Dell laptop (HP Elite XPS 15) which has sound very good. The sound quality on this sound card is almost nothing. The mic sound is a weak noise and the sound is almost impossible to hear with the volume. Don't waste your money on these cards, even if they have a lower price, because they're going to fail your sound system. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this antenna to pick up satellite signals at my office in PA only to find that the antenna stopped working for me on the satellite channels.

It's also not sent via a normal Amazon shipping label, so I had trouble even getting it tracked and shipped correctly.I was told the item was "not defective" - so I sent them a message that I didn't want my money back.  Amazon's support service staff gave me a 1-star customer service rating...but I had expected at least a phone call.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is advertised as a wireless mouse, but it does not have any wireless functionality.The only thing you can use it for is to click on the mouse pad on the keyboard (I am using it as a mouse). It also has a wireless antenna, which we had to remove and cover the mouse with because it could not pick up signals from the mousepad. It was a pain to remove the antenna because it kept moving around on the base, and if it was not flat enough, it kept pointing in the wrong direction. I wouldn't recommend this item because I do have other products that are wireless mice with better features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've only had a few weeks of use with this unit, and it is already showing the dreaded "low quality sound" when playing music.  I have been unable to turn it off, and I've sent it back to Amazon.  The sound is almost identical to my sound card (Audio-Speak SE2 card).If you have a sound card that is compatible with these headphones, don't buy these - they are junk!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this mouse to use with my XPS mouse (I had ordered it a few months ago). However, I have had to send it back due to poor tracking accuracy. My customer service representative was very rude, and gave me the runaround on the warranty claim. I have since contacted Logitech support regarding this problem. They are very slow in responding to emails. They have since given me some more time to see if they can get it fixed. However, when I sent in my mouse (for them to pick up), they told me that it would not be returned since the mouse is at Logitech's repair center.  I do not trust Logitech for any electronic device, and I've spent more time than I can count fixing this product. I wish I had used an other mouse instead.I had to return the mouse to them as it did not work well with my mouse, and my receipt was the only thing I could get them to accept.I bought the mouse because I would not have bought one that did not have a built in optical mousepad. However... the tracking is not great, and this mouse mouse is not built in at all. I'm very disappointed with this mouse, as its tracking is pretty poor. I still use it occasionally, but I don't recommend this mouse (it was a waste of money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I do not use the sound card since it is only for audio only and not for sound. The sound card did not work with my sound card until I bought the 2nd-gen sound card. This product does not work!! There is no sound for me, the only thing it does is making the sound go away. It sucks. Buy something else

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used this sound card several times, but I can't believe it can sound any better than my sound card from Pioneer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking it would be a great deal.  I only needed the mouse, which was defective.  The mouse is very inexpensive, but the software to track and mouse movement is terrible, the product is unusable, and the mouse itself is very cheap.  It is very difficult to get it to work with the mouse pad because it doesn't fit well.  If it worked, it would save me tons of time in the future.  Unfortunately it has a terrible electronic device that crashes on every single mouse click, making the mouse unusable

Don't waste your money on this mouse

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is advertised as being brand new.  In fact, it is not.  The ear plugs that came in my pair of headphones have ripped threads, which is why they are not sound-quality rated.  It does sound OK but the sound is not very decent.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod Classic is the only mp3 player that runs poorly when I have it connected to my computer.  I have never used any other player, so I don't know if this is a common problem with any product from these companies.  The sound quality is pretty awful, but I use it a lot less than the CD player on my laptop so I'm not complaining.  There are plenty of MP3 players out there that sound better than this product, so the sound quality isn't the biggest problem with the product, but it's hard to find a sound quality adapter

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is only good for the mousepad because it is not the mouse that is compatible with the V500.  I was never able to find any software to disable the tracking software.  Other products I had to purchase (Mousepad and Mousepad) did not work when used with this mousepad.  The mouse pad would crash my computer with no warning before I had taken it to a friend's office, and when I tried to reinstall it it would crash without any warning.  Don't buy this product unless you want a mousepad only! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is really poor on this sound card, but what's worse is the price. It will not run out of sound quality, even with very little sound (under 50 mbps) even if it is set to the maximum sound level.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product doesn't work well at all. It would frequently freeze up the sound or would have static or other problems and even when you use sound scan and speaker check it would be almost unusable.  I'm sure it works better if you use it with headphones but not for your car stereo system (which is what I use). The sound quality is a little weak. I've had it for about a month and have only been able to use it twice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The headset is so cheap and I thought it was great until it broke after 1 day, after 6+ calls, and it's now $19.00 USD!  I do not recommend the product! Do not buy this product unless you have a working headset with mic! I had a good sound with the old model, but now my headset sounds like a small, poorly made, crackling sound. Don't waste your money. You can buy a more sound-quality headset for less than this, at least with a sound-card, and you can save yourself $20 bucks 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a Samsung 64GB laptop. It is a very good monitor with a sharp picture, but it runs very poorly with this product. I bought this monitor to replace my aging 120GB Toshiba model that the manufacturer discontinued in 2008.  The picture is very grainy.It is hard to even tell the difference between the screen and the other side of the screen. I don't use it much anyway, so I'm not sure about the picture quality. I returned it after just a few weeks. It has been in my bag every day for the past three weeks now. It doesn't work that well!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this mouse because of its low price.  It worked for 2 weeks.  I was really disappointed when it stopped working.  This is the third mouse that I have had to return from Jitter.com.  Please be aware of this mouse as it is the brand name one.  The mouse is also quite cheap, but does not have the specifications that other brands have.  They all have very poor mouse buttons and the buttons don't feel that they work.  My mouse clicks in the same spot every time.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product hoping it would be a sound card with sound quality that I could use with my sound system.  I got it when it arrived and had it only for use with the sound system and this FM radio only plays a prerecorded signal for 30 seconds a week.  The sound quality is very poor, the sound doesn't sound loud enough.I wouldn't purchase another item from Sound Card for this sound card because it was too slow! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product thinking that it would be a good sound quality earphone for me.  It was loud, and it sounds okay for outdoor music. However, when I use the product in the car, it sounds too much like the headphones I have on my headphones.  The sound quality is much better with earphones that have a better sound quality (like the Sennheiser Etyphon).  The battery lasts only 2 hours, and the sound is noticeably worse with these earphones, so I do not recommend these ear phones 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The mouse is great. It is a great mouse but the buttons are useless.

I do not recommend buying this mouse at all

The sound is extremely poor when playing back music.It's not as loud as my sound card from an iPod or MP3 player. I've had the soundcard replaced twice because of this and I still have a problem with it! The sound card is very loud, I could easily hear my neighbors in the room, even at max volume, but this one is too weak.  I've returned it to Amazon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product thinking I would save a little money.

I am currently waiting for a replacement card. I also ordered this product on a business day and the shipping cost was significantly higher than normal. This is the worst electronic device I have ever bought. It is not compatible with my sound card because it only works if you turn the volume up to max.If you are considering getting this product, do so with caution. There are at least two other iPods that I have that also have sound issues and sound great!! Don't waste your money. Also, if you decide to use the sound card, you'll be left with an unusable product because it won't work on iPods. Do yourself a favor buy something that works with your sound card!

I don't know if there is a problem with the product, but when I tried to activate it, the FM station started playing my "ding sound" every time there was a crash on the remote and it took about 30 seconds of the remote getting between the screen and my mouse (I was using my mouse) to get it back to working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item was not what I ordered. It shipped and installed but took two weeks to arrive. The sound is pretty small. I was disappointed. I'm glad I didn't order this item because of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these headphones for the price and sound quality. I could have used another pair of headphones.  However, the sound of the sound quality did not meet my expectation of good sound quality from these headphones. The sound was way too small for what I was trying to use them for. What was worse was the sound leakage when I played music, it sounded almost like static to me... I have spent so much time with these headphones and there was no sound quality improvement at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was defective. The screen worked fine, but after a few weeks of use, the light on the screen started fading away and was too difficult to see at night when my wife was sleeping.  So I returned the product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does not work with Macs with Intel 2-in-1 DVD changer and VHS player.  I got this product as a rebate on eBay and have used it on my Vista and Macs Macs which use DVD drives and VDSVC (for Picture Discs) video players.  Still don't use it on the newer Macs.  Don't buy this product if you are looking for this type of product.  It is useless.  The product is great for video games on VHS and DVD drives that don't work with Windows Vista, which I know because I've bought other products and they work fine with both.   I am not a big seller on eBay, so I had no idea the product would fail to work with newer Mac.  So beware...you're buying this product unless you have Macs that have VDS VC and video drivers installed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very dissapointed, the sound quality of the soundcard is very poor. I tried both sound cards on my SoundMagic iPods both recording and MP3 player, both sound card worked. The sound quality is not the best sound quality I have used, sound on my iPods from the sound card, earbuds sound a little muffled. The only reason I had to upgrade my sound card is because I can now hear the sound through my earphones, sound from my mp3 player is not as clear. The microphone is very cheap! I have bought cheap microphones many times and sound quality from them is much better! Please don't use the sound cards with ipods when recording and mp3 players have sound quality such as the sound on the iPod doesn't have 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is not functional. The sound quality is not great. The mic does not stay in a good spot.The only thing that I will give it is it is because I like the sound on the stereo, but it's only worth maybe 10 bucks less than the mvp soundbar and the sound of my mp2mp sound system! I will not purchase it again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am currently using the Ralink i5 soundcard and the sound card is only recording 2 hours of audio. My sound card does not have any sort of sound cards that work with the AudioPortable sound card (as well as the AudioClip sound card) so I would have bought this product if there were other options out there! The sound card was a piece of junk that they sent me. It has been very slow in recording audio and has only recorded two hours of sound. I will not be buying it again

In addition, they don't have a clip that the cable clips to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because it was so easy to use, but when I tried to play my DVD, it would freeze. It would only play the DVD for a few seconds, then it would cut the movie and quit. It is extremely disappointing to find out that it is a sound card that freezes on a DVD player! I spent a whole day trying to fix this, but ended up taking my media out of my computer.  The sound card will only play one DVD that I tried. I've replaced it with an HP DVD burner, which works fine, but I still don't like the sound card, and I wish HP would support my other sound card (Audio sounder). This card is not compatible with sounder2

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the printer to print more documents at less cost than the price advertised.  I am a low-volume user and decided to use it as a desktop printer to save on printing costs, so I thought it was the best thing I bought.However, after two months, this is the only printer that doesn't print any more than the basic black cartridge, even when I remove the paper spools. This was so frustrating as I could barely get a line of paper out, I had to do twice as much.  In addition, the only reason for purchasing this printer was because of the scanner, which is fast enough, so it should have worked fine.  It didn't. I'm very disappointed with this product, I will never buy from this company again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product was defective.  I'm a reseller and I've bought other products from Amazon.  Amazon's product does not have a warranty that it works for this iPod.  In addition, it's not the best product it is a cheap piece of plastic, and I'm sure it isn't the best sound system for the price of it.  It is an iPod Audio Playback system that has poor sound quality.  The sound quality is very poor in comparison to my SOUNDCAPS3 product that came in my box! I've spent over $10 on iPod accessories, just to be sure I would have good sound on this iPod 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product has a sound problem. I have the sound card and the sound driver and both of them do not work together. There is no sound using either one of these products together. I had to turn the sound off and use it with my sound system (Spektrific Sound Card). I will be returning it and will not purchase another product from HP...I will use my old sound card if there is another sound card out there that works well

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am absolutely disgusted with this product. I have spent $25 plus shipping for these product and had to return it. I am only using it as my wireless mouse, and its software crashed every time I loaded it up. Any software updates required have stopped updating it. This mouse now hangs on my desk every time it is switched off. I will not purchase any more products from this vendor...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this microphone for a long time and it worked great for voice, and voice calls on my T-Mobile phone. It is sound quality is acceptable, but the mic doesn't sound very clear with phone calls, so that is a negative thing. You have to use your cell phone's sound quality for voice calls to hear the signal

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is nothing special about this product - it appears to be the product you get when you buy a piece of software on Amazon.  This product is absolutely useless.  I've already sent it back twice because it won't play CDs - it would be too easy to lose discs - I've only used it to burn DVDs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing that makes this product a little special is the color of the buttons. When we tested a lot of buttons from other product the buttons would frequently not stay in place.  If your buttons break or don't stay in position like this you are going to get a lot more clicks than you would have with a regular mouse.  It is extremely frustrating for the user.  Buyer beware, this mouse is the only mouse we've used which would not quit even when used with a normal mouse. It is also very noisy.  Don't buy this product if your mouse is not already broken 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is a total disappointment. It does not work properly at all!

This is one of the worst mp3/mp4 player I've ever bought

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this antenna for about 3 weeks and it has not worked very well. I have tried all sorts of stuff to try and fix it and have not been able to get it to work. It is a very small antenna. The sound quality is very poor compared to the ones with the bigger ones on the market. If you plan to use it for listening to AM or FM, be aware that it will not pick up the stations you are listening to. You may get good reception, but not enough to hear the broadcast stations

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product thinking it would be a great sound system - it was a disappointment. The sound quality is a joke - at best it is barely tolerable. The buttons are almost impossible to hit - which is annoying, as the sound system I use has buttons which have a little bit of a give.  I was hoping for better sound quality - i would have gladly returned it but not a sound card as that sucks the sound away from your sound system. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is horrible, it is almost impossible to hear anything except for an occasional sound when the microphone is up or close to the sound speaker.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've spent $70.00 on this product and the sound is absolutely terrible.   There are no bass or background sound in this soundbar.  The soundcard sounds a little louder than my soundcard and has little volume control on it.  I bought a Logitech X-Fi soundbar which is an easy soundbar for my laptop sound.I'm sorry I had to spend $70 on something when it doesn't work.  It doesn't even work with my sound card!!  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this microphone for a couple of years now, and its always sound really nice. Now I have to say its extremely poor sound quality. The microphone itself sounds very poor, with too much echo and echo-y sound. This thing will not work with any other sound device (not an mp3 player). It even cuts out my surround sound when recording a live show, I cannot find any other mic that works well with this one. I will never buy another microphone, because this one is an absolute fail!!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing it does is sound perfect for its purposes, however this product does have several problems.1. It has sound-quality issues with some games that use Dolby sound, and it is not noticeable when playing with others without this product.2. It is a piece of junk--it doesn't work with DVD or Game sound.3. I am currently using it as a sound source for my sound system that uses Dolby Digital sound. It's not recording anything, it just has sound from my computer (which I have not tested).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This iPod nano has no volume control on it, and the battery doesn't last that long.  The earbuds are cheap and the only way to control them is through iTunes, which requires a web-update each time you want to change them. It sucks to have to keep them there all the time, especially if you're playing the iPod music, but when you do play them, they don't sound. This is a cheap earphone that just won't last the way it is supposed to. It's not worth buying. Don't buy these for the sound quality.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these for my car. However, in my experience they were not even remotely user-friendly. The product was just a piece of plastic that could not slide from the base for my model, and even when the "pop-up" was close, the product slid. The sound quality sounded like something out of an ear-phone -- terrible sound. The microphone sound was just not very sensitive enough. I returned them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery lasts for a while but then is too low and the sound starts to be too quiet, and then it is too heavy to hold for longer than 20 minutes before it is exhausted.  I'd rather have the stereo sound quality if this product had sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product about a month ago. It worked well for a few weeks, then stopped functioning altogether.

So when I tried to upload the image, I got an error message saying "this image has been uploaded to a system that does not support this image".  I don't use Mac, so it was not a major inconvenience, but the product itself did not work.  The CD player worked at first, but after several tries the sound would cut out for no reason, at times even when my computer was stationary.  Don't buy this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This mouse was discontinued on the second week and never worked again.  Please be aware of this when ordering any wireless mouse.  It would be good to get an HP branded wireless mouse, I bought it on Amazon because I needed the mouse for my business so I didn't have to deal with wireless mouse manufacturers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This soundcard has the problem of constantly rebooting. In addition, it won't play mp3 files with any regularity. The sound quality is quite nice, but it is almost impossible to find any mp3 or mp2 files that have played on this unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   the remote is very hard to use when you're not close to the TV and have to hit the buttons, this is not a good product.   I have been through 2 units and one broke after less than 24 hours use, which means it could be defective.  The only solution is to find a better model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered a 25-pack of this sound card and received it only 6 days after I ordered. After 2 of them weren't even available, I couldn't get my order fulfilled. The sound card didn't work right out of the box. I was very disappointed, so I had to return it to Amazon. The card was defective. Amazon was not even able to help me.

I will not purchase any sound card from Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My product arrived broken.  Do not order from this vendor for defective products.  This product has a built in microphone that is totally ineffective.  It is a pain in the neck to use with the sound volume button and sound volume control buttons.  The sound is distorted, no sound with any of the sound programs I tried.  What a piece of garbage that Sony is using such a cheap product.  Return this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't like the sound of this sound card, but for the amount of time it takes to record and play back the sound is acceptable. The sound is OK at least it's no louder than my sound card with my other sound card and it's not that much slower! Now I have to spend time re-testing my sound system to make sure it works - it won't sound if I don´t press any buttons

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this product. After just a few months it didn't work correctly. It wouldn't play any sound. The sound was horrible. I tried everything from sound purifier to sound cards, etc. After about a week of this I decided to call customer service. They sent me a new item and voilace the sound system, but it didnot solve the problem. They also sent me this instruction card (which would void my warranty).  I still haven't been able to get it to work correctly, because they don't answer any emails. I will never purchase Sony audio products from Amazon again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased 2 of these for my wireless headphones, one was broken in two weeks.  The second one stopped functioning after a few weeks of use.  I have a set of Logitech Sound Card Mic-Headphones with wireless sound and wireless microphone and the sound quality is great, but the sound has a lot of static when you use the earphones with other wireless headphones (like a sound-card headset) that use the sound-amp sound-in microphone.  These headphones are too big, bulky and not easy to get in-line with the mic port on the earphone jack.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The headphones sound nice when I use them, but when I put them in my ears they don't have a sound quality.The sound quality is not that great when you are sitting next to the computer speakers.
