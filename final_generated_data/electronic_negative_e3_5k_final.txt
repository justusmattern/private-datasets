Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It had nothing to do with the problems of this product:  It only came with a bad sticker, not a good product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product about a month ago. It worked fine initially, but then one day it was showing no internet connection. I tried to turn it off and on again, and it did the same thing, so I bought a different router.The router came with a one-year warranty. So I bought another one, and same thing happened. I returned it to Best Buy and they told me I didn't need it anymore. So that is how I ended up with this bad piece of junk that doesn't work.I just paid over $70 for this piece of crap. It's a waste of money, and I would not recommend this to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was not impressed with the noise reduction that was advertised, especially after using it for several weeks.  It was not as loud as advertised 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought a new unit and it was bad. We had to return it. It was too bad that we didn't realize that we already had this unit and the one we bought had the bad electronic unit and we didn�t even use it. I would rather buy another brand if this was a problem in the first place.I am not a person who can tolerate bad electronic equipment.I think that all manufacturers should make their electronic equipment better with their products, not worse. I hope that they make their warranty more meaningful and it gives more satisfaction 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Got it on Thursday and it was defective within a few days. No customer service was offered, no response.  No explanation for such a defect.  I sent it back but after I sent my money, it was still defective 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So I purchased this speakers and it took them over a month to arrive. I thought I would receive them sooner than that. I called the customer service number and they stated that they ship only on weekdays (or something like that). They gave me a credit for $60 (which I immediately gave back to them). The customer service representative said that the shipping cost would be refunded. I never got them so I'm really not sure about how that works. I'm disappointed in this device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The cable is very small and it's easy to lose it. It's not very secure and the length is very short. I had to order from two different sites to get the correct length. The one you receive from Amazon is not the same.  I'm very disappointed with the quality and the price for such a large piece of junk

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried to install it by attaching the HDMI cable to my VCR. I then attached it to my HDTV but, that didn't work. So I connected the cables to the VCR instead and then to the TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The printer does not have any print heads, and only has a standard A5 printer paper. The printer is a generic A5 and not the top of the line, but still a good printer for the money. However, it is not designed to print at a fast rate. The paper that comes with the printer does a decent job for about 10 pages at a time. However it is obvious that this printer needs to be used with some serious care to get good results. This is not an easy printer to use. It is not easy to line up the paper in the printer properly, and the paper itself does not print well. I've used a similar printer, and it worked fine, but you have to use very careful paper placement and positioning to get consistent results. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's no longer in production. The LCD is in good shape and will last until someone else buys it. Don't expect to receive a refund when the LCD is no longer manufactured. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used the Samsung Series 5 for several years. I've replaced a number of them, but it's still an excellent phone, for the most part. However, it's not a good quality phone if you have a very important document that must be viewed on a monitor. It doesn't even display the video correctly. On top of that, there is no way to remotely connect a PC from this phone. There's no way you can use the Samsung USB drive to share files with your PC.   In the future I will definitely return the phone to Amazon and I'll probably buy a new one for the same amount 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit would not work as advertised. This is the first one that I ever purchased, so I was not sure if this was a bad unit or my fault. I am still not happy with this unit and cannot recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the new Sennheiser HD 6xx headphones (also the one for the HD-650) and the headphones were shipped at the wrong time. They were missing from the package and I did not even receive the tracking number to see if they arrived. I have already spent about 30 hours to try and find them in my box and I'm still without them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the cheapest one that works and has decent reviews, but I find it very difficult to use with my ipod. I bought it and had it shipped from China to Australia where I live. The box and the ipod was already damaged from the packaging and the box was opened and damaged in transit. I ended up buying from Amazon which is much cheaper. The problem is that the ipods never arrive. If you buy it from China the packaging will be damaged from shipping. I would advise that you buy from Amazon if you are not going to use your ipod with your ipods and will not mind paying a little extra for shipping. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this to install in a house that had only a single microwave in the living room. I thought that it would be a perfect match for the microwave. The problem was that the microwave never came with a thermostat. The thermometer was only about 6 degrees off. The unit did not come with a box to mount on the wall. I returned the unit and bought a different one that was designed for multiple locations.I would not recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price on these is outrageous for the quality of audio they provide.  I will never buy a set of these for myself 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this product and it was the exact same device as the one that I already own. I went online and searched for a different device that was as good and as cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this and did everything right to try to get it to work. All I could find was that it does not work with other computers, even though it says it does. I called support and they said they would email the software from Amazon for me. However, I never got the email so I called them again, and they did not have the software either. All this time, I'm having to rewire everything in my house to get the device to work with my computer.I have purchased this item on several occasions and it has always done the same thing.I would not buy it again.I really hope Amazon changes their software. I have not had it for two weeks and I still do not have it. I am really disappointed with their customer service 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I took the chance to get it for Christmas but it is only usable when plugged into a powered USB port. This is not only not portable but  it doesn't charge and it is noisy 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say, I am very disappointed with this device.  This unit does not come with any accessories.  Also, the device does not fit my device's case very well.  I bought this product because it is advertised as a stereo speaker for my laptop and it's not that.  It just plugs into the computer.  The audio output on this unit is only a little louder than a cd player.   This does not even match up with the CD player output of my laptop.  Overall, I gave this a low rating.  For me, it's just a speaker in the computer case.  If you are looking for a good stereo audio device, you better be looking for something more than a stereo device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The remote works fine, but the actual remote itself is of poor quality. I have purchased two of these in the past few months, and have had to return both.The remote is so small that if you are having trouble adjusting the volume or switching channels, it will be very difficult to use the remote for anything else.The built in audio input/output jack is useless, because there is no way to plug a USB device into it.I hope you can appreciate that I paid full price for the remote, and the company is charging me for return shipping, shipping, and a 15% restocking fee!I would rather have spent a little more on a good quality remote, but this is not the remote you get for the price.The only positive aspect about the remote is that it's easy to install, and is very easy to use.The keypad on the remote isn't as nice as the one on my iPod, so you may find the keys difficult to press. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We have had problems with this product from the beginning. No matter what it is, it is always damaged and the cables get destroyed. This is the most expensive item we purchase. The other products we have purchased for our home have lasted 2 or 3 years without any issues.This is the first thing that we buy with our home. We have tried to return it, but they refuse. No refund is ever offered. I recommend you read the reviews before you make any purchase, this is a bad item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this thinking it was a DVD burner. I read all the reviews on Amazon.com and the reviews were very good. However I was out of town when I bought it and I just returned. When I got home the unit was not functioning. I returned it to Amazon.Com and they sent me a new one. However it did not work when I used it to put my DVD on my computer. I tried hard to see if there was a problem with the connection of the unit to my computer but it just worked for me. After about an hour of tryng, I sent it back to Amazon and they just sent me another unit. It has been 6 weeks and I have not received a new unit. I do not recommend this product, I am out of money and will not be using it anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one because I wanted it to fit inside of my laptop. It was too short (which is common for laptop and desk accessories), and when I tried to turn it upside down it did not fit, and I ended up with a big mess. I returned it and ordered a different one, and it fit right away, but I don't know if the adapter is the problem. I will have to return it to Best Buy 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would not recommend this product to anyone. It doesn't come with a storage card, and it doesn't provide a backup function, which is very disappointing. I did not receive my order until the first week of August, and I had already sent a positive review about another electronic device that works as advertised: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a used CD player from Best Buy, and the first thing I did was to set up the USB cable. I had not yet received the unit from Best buy and when I finally did, it took a while to transfer the files. It's also a little too heavy to use with a computer. The unit is much too expensive for the amount of data it provides and only lasts one year. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   For a first time user, it did not come with a remote (even if you order it, no remote is included). I have not received a refund as of yet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The printer just died after 20 minutes of printing on a glossy glossy photo. I sent the print to my office and was waiting for them to send it back. It finally showed up, but it wouldn't print because the print head couldn't reach the edge of the print. I contacted Amazon and they were sending another printer. I was waiting impatiently for that one to show up so that I could print my regular size photos. I returned the first printer and that was the last printer I used. It was only $29.99 and I didn't even buy the glossy photo that I originally ordered, just the regular color image. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I thought it was a good idea, but it didn't last very long. I can't believe the return cost was higher than what I paid. Not worth it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product only to have it failed within 2 weeks. I ordered it from Amazon because they said they would ship fast. However, they did not ship in the way promised. They shipped a defective item. It was returned to them. The company was not happy with the return policy so they kept delaying the shipping of the item.I was very disappointed because I was very excited about this device.  I expected a fast delivery because I bought it on Amazon. Instead, I got a 2 week delay because they couldn't provide me with the shipment address. My return policy stated that the item can't be returned to the original purchaser for any reason. So when I returned it, they didn't even have a return address on the package. When I called Amazon, the customer service rep told me they would have a tracking number for me. But, Amazon's website is not updated with tracking information for returned packages. And, they don't allow tracking information to be set until they ship the item to me.I contacted Amazon again and the rep told to email their customer service and that I would get a tracking information as soon as they shipped the item back to me from Amazon.When I sent the email to Amazon, Amazon refused to provide the tracking information even though I had contacted them via email. As soon as I sent them the tracking info, they denied my return. In short, they refused to honor the return policies of Amazon.I called Amazon again, but Amazon had no idea why I sent a refund to Amazon and not them.I eventually got a tracking on the item and when I called, they told me the item has not shipped to me yet. After 2 weeks, Amazon still refused to ship the package to me I was pretty disappointed with Amazon's customer service,but I understand there is some risk involved in purchasing products on Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with this TV. I had the most negative reviews from my friends. They said the TV had low quality picture. I believe this is because it is so compact. It is not very big on your sofa. It gives very bad picture quality. I bought this because I thought the picture quality would be great. I guess I was wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After ordering this, my computer had no signal and I needed an adapter to send the signal to my monitor.  They did a terrible job with this and the monitor was unusable and needed to be replaced.  It is a shame that the customer service representatives are not trained in electronic products. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The speaker is very weak, I have them on three walls and they do not even fill the room with sound.I returned the unit within a few days and they never even mailed it back. If I can get a decent speaker, I will return it and get another one for my computer, but if you are not getting great sound with your speaker set up, go with something else.The soundcard is worthless, they sold the speakers separately and you can't use the software to remap the speaker input to your input.The unit was a gift so they didn't think through all the possibilities.I gave up after three days, and I'm just glad I got rid of it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't recommend these for anything other than small to medium sized cameras, and maybe some small mobile phones. The noise level was not very good. The lenses are plastic. These are not good for any serious photographic use. I don't know why they are listed as interchangeable in their specifications, but they are not compatible. I've had to buy replacements for all the cameras that I use with these lenses, and I can't do it any other way. The only thing that is even close to the same is using other manufacturers' lenses. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried it for three months and then I decided to take a few months off from working on it. This time it took over a year to return it to working condition. I have read many positive reviews about this item, but they were all posted by people who already had it for some time.  I did not have any problems with it when I first installed it. The only problem I have is that the battery gets full quickly.  All of a sudden I find it running on batteries for a couple of hours.  This is something you will need to look into before buying the device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this router, but only received it a few days after ordering it. The router came with no instructions on how to set it up. I called  the router support and asked if they could give me the instructions to set this up, but  never heard back.  I tried several times, but they never replied.  To make a long story short, I returned it in favor of a different router 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this, and I couldn't use it with my camera due to the angle of the lens. Not a good feature for a camera

I have tried to contact Sony but have received no response. They are making a refund to me but I am hesitant to spend the money since I am out hundreds of dollars. The unit came with a warranty and they don't offer a replacement. It is very disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this for my daughter to use in her studio but after two days the first one didn't charge and it was useless. She went back and got another. Same thing happened each time and I finally gave up and went back to a generic electronic device that had a USB port 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The video signal is very strong. We use it to support a VCR which produces only 50Hz signals. This caused my son to complain about his inability to watch the video. He also complained about the noise in the video signal. I sent him for a new one with better signal strength, and he is still complaining about the signal strength. I suggest buying a different video signal from Amazon or Best Buy. It has a strong, but not the strongest signal of any I've found. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The thing was designed to attach to a TV set, but it didn't come with a cord extension cord. I had to cut the cords on the TV set (I was expecting a longer cord that runs under the TV) and attach the cord to the USB port.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought one of these speakers from a different store, but was very disappointed. It was all black with no grills and no plastic trim. Not even the rubber pads came with these speakers. The only good thing about these speakers is the good sound quality, but they are only $10 each at Radio Shack. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got this about 2 weeks ago and so far the picture was poor. It just isn't that good. We used to have it and was quite happy with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered one for my iPod. The picture was very bad, I thought this would be good for my family, but it turned out to be not. After two days of waiting, I returned the unit and was very disappointed. The image was not so bad, but the sound was horrible. The battery was not included, but I could have found it on eBay.I also thought I'd be able to buy it at the local store. I ended up going back to Amazon and they didn't ship it out. I have to wait until they do to have a chance of getting one.I was really looking forward to this product, and was looking forward for my review to be positive. Unfortunately, it was not. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this monitor from Amazon and it was shipped very quickly. Unfortunately it did not arrive in the time promised, it arrived in less than a week. I was also told that it is only available in the USA. I returned it and returned it with another order. I'm not entirely sure why I didn't receive the monitor I ordered at all. I also believe that I received it in less time than it was promised to arrive, but I don't know for sure, I'm just getting angry that I am getting my money wasted, and this is a very good monitor at a very high price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is a joke and I've tried to return it. I was told this would be free of charge and it wouldn't, which isn't true. I sent it back anyway, which cost me another month's worth of work. I didn't get any refund from them either, which was even more disheartening. It just went on and on with no sign of stopping. I am so disappointed in this device, I would not recommend it to anybody. I'm so much more of a Mac user. But, I don't think I'll be buying any more of these, so I'll get a cheaper alternative 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only problem with this is that it doesn't fit in most pocket cases. If you need a device to record video for you, this is not the way to go 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If this is the kind of device you use, do not expect it to hold up to normal use.  It is a cheap plastic case, and not very rigid.  If you plan on mounting it over a hard drive, you will not be able to adjust the drive mounting bracket.  I ended up taking it apart, and replacing it with an aluminum enclosure.  There is just no way that this product is going to hold a strong enough magnetic charge to protect your data.  This is just not a good value for money for any electronic device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't know about you, but this product is just terrible. I returned this device the very same day I received it and they only offered a refund if I returned it the next day. I had to return it again the next week.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because it says it is designed for  high power output.  It turned out to be very difficult to get the volume  set.  The unit will not even start.  I had to set the volume to 5 in my stereo.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This speaker is not the best, not the worst I have had. I was given it as a gift. It is not waterproof. It does not allow to put the speakers in a plastic bag to transport. I found this to be a major problem. Very disappointed in the quality and the price. I have been buying speakers from different stores for a while and I am not disappointed in this speaker.I would suggest avoiding this speaker 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD display is horrible, colors are not vibrant, LCD has black borders and the black screen turns black on every press of the "pause" button, it will show an image only if you press it for about 15 seconds, not enough time to read the screen. There is only one problem I've found, and it's only with the newer models. On my older Sony LCD I had problems with it turning off, turning on, and back again. The newer model is fine. However, with my newer TV I have to press the screen a lot to turn the LCD off. I have had to change my mind about my Sony LCD's over the years, and now I will not buy another LCD unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen does not look great. And the only thing I can recommend is buy a monitor that is different from the one I have.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought it would be a nice way to connect two computers and monitor them from the same machine. However, it did not.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The item arrived broken. I called for a replacement. I have had this item before, and have never had any problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD player is a piece of junk. I tried several times to get it to work but it was always inoperative, then it would stop working entirely. I did not want to spend the money on the repair of my home stereo. I was so disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this unit for my daughter with no problems, but in two weeks, the TV turned off. There was nothing I could do about it.

It's too bad, because the other electronic device I bought was less than half the price. The only reason it works is because the battery is on the inside. I was very disappointed with the quality. I even took it to the store to return it, but the clerk didn't even have time to see if it was damaged or not.I'm not even sure if it's a good electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very unhappy with this product, I have been using a Dell desktop with this computer for about 6 years and it still works fine, the only problem is that I cannot get it to stay on the desk, it moves around a lot.

I would recommend you buy a different brand of monitor if you are a Windows user, I can't say the same for the Dell PowerConnect system

The sound is bad, the noise is very poor and the sensitivity is not good for most people (if you are very sensitive to sound, this device is probably not for you).  The unit is very cumbersome to use and takes up a lot of space. You have to buy a large box (40cm x 50cm x 60cm), buy an adapter for the input (about 10cm) and then attach it to the speaker.  It is not a good solution if you're not going to be doing any kind of sound reproduction, you have to find a good one for a different purpose

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very disappointing that this product cannot be fully installed using the supplied instructions. After several attempts, this piece of junk failed to install properly on my Samsung 4K monitor. It worked fine on my laptop and on other monitors but this is the only one that works.  I even had to purchase another set of mounting plates and hardware to achieve the same result.  To be honest, this is a very annoying, very fiddly, and annoying installation method that leaves you very frustrated.  It also doesn't allow for any kind of adjustment of the monitor positioning so the whole installation becomes very fiddling with

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this to use on my computer. It works fine on my desktops and laptops, but not at all on my laptops. I sent it back to B&H in hopes that they would send a replacement, but I received no such information. This is the worst electronic device I have ever purchased from B& H. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These earphones are absolutely horrible. I bought them in December 2015, and they haven't been working properly since January 2016. The earphone wire is very cheap, and the earphone doesn't seem to stay in my ear when I'm running or biking.  The earphones don't seem like they're supposed to last all that long either. If you don't mind spending $80 for a pair of earphones, just don't buy them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought it to go with my new electronic device.  I tried it out yesterday and it was not even close to what I expected.  The screen had a yellow glow and it wasn't even working right.  No matter how hard I tried, it just didn't work.  My eyes were glued to the screen.  It was absolutely ridiculous.   It is clearly designed for people who are very physically able and are looking for a high-resolution screen 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this a few months ago, and it has only performed poorly twice, even though I have tried all the settings and software available on my computer. It still won't load, or is very slow. I called tech support and they sent me a tech support replacement, which was good but not enough to fix the issue. This is the third time this has happened, and every time I have returned the defective unit. I will not buy from this vendor again, unless the problem is fixed or I am not satisfied with their customer service.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with this one. I ordered mine only to find it was in box less than a week. I returned it within 7 days.  The product was defective and the package did not include an instruction manual. I called customer service and they did not replace it.  They refused to refund my money.  My experience is that of a bad computer:  Buy a different monitor if you are in a different location 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The batteries did not last more than a few hours. I would recommend that you replace the batteries, not sure if this is a fault with the device or with the battery itself. I have had to return the batteries a number of times for this reason. I was unable to purchase the replacements from Amazon. I ended up ordering these from Lowe's for about twice the price. I had to give them two weeks before they arrived. So I had already paid for two batteries when I ordered these from Amazon!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The headphones work well, but they do not have the capacity to be connected to a mobile device. The headphones sound as good as they did with a full-size computer and are still too heavy to transport comfortably.The only negative is that the headphones have no remote control. The only way to change tracks is through the mouse. The earcups are too big to fit over my ears. I am not sure if I can return the headphones and buy a set of larger headphones.The headphones are not bad, but these headphones are no substitute for a good, comfortable listening device and I would strongly recommend you buy a good pair of full-sized headphones instead of using the headphones with a laptop."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to return my HP Deskjet 5000 on Sunday due to a bad screen. I took it back to store and it was returned to my house in less than 1 day. They were unwilling to offer a refund and only offer to return the original box. I have a Dell printer but it was very bad. It was still in the box and the printer had the ink cartridge on it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered a couple of these, and it did not take long for it to show how badly it worked. I had to go in to a local electronics store and order replacement cables, and the cable itself was too short. The new cable that I got after returning it was too long, and broke the connector. Then I called Amazon, and they sent me another one. Then they sent another one, and another one - all breaking. I called them again, and when I got to the Customer Service Desk, I was told the cable was defective, and no refund was offered. I could not even get it repaired, which is a major bummer, since these cables cost a pretty penny, and I am an experienced tech. I even went in to an Apple store and they couldn't even fix the problem. So I returned it, and now am back with a couple more, and still no luck. I don't even know how they're supposed to work if they don't stick together!I've already returned these, because I just can't stand it any longer, but now I'm not sure how I'm going to take this one. I do love the idea of the "magic" of having a remote that opens a book on the television, or even lets you turn on a device using the remote itself. But there are just too many issues with it to even consider using it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this speaker and was so excited to receive it, but soon noticed that the speaker unit would not stay in the speaker. I called Bose and they said to return it and order a new one. I didn't want to send it back, but that was too late. I returned it for a refund, but the good news is that the return process is quicker and easier than any return service I've experienced in the past. If you want to return a bad item, do it sooner rather than later 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had the same problems with the soundcard that the other reviewer, Mike, had. I replaced the cards with the Yamaha cards and the sound was terrible. I'm not sure if the problem is the sound card or the interface. Either way, I won't buy these cards again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I did not use this device for a very long time. The buttons were stuck in my hand too often. I was never happy about using this device. Then I came across a site for this device on Amazon. They have a much better description of what it's supposed to do. Then Amazon sent me a defective device, so I ordered a new one and returned it, so that I wouldn't be charged any fees. I did like the idea of having some kind of indicator to let me know what it was doing when the buttons were not in my control, but the function of the buttons on this particular model was very limited. There are lots of buttons on other models on Amazon, so the fact that this device only has six is very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two of these in my studio and they don't sound very good. One of them only has a 1 inch cable coming into it from the mixing board, the other has two cables from the board coming out. It is noisy when the soundcard and recording card are not connected. I have to adjust the volume in my computer to get it right. And when I do, it is even worse. The soundcard doesn't even work. This is the first time I have ever had this problem with any of my Sony products. I am waiting for Sony to release a new version with longer cable.I will not buy these again and I recommend to others that they stay away 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these monitors, which I thought would be the best for my family, but I have to admit that I have not had any problem yet with the pictures being distorted and images coming out of the monitor.

They will stay powered on but you will not be able to use them for more than a couple of minutes.  I don't know why.  Maybe they are so far apart from each other that they will not charge.  It is impossible for me to get them to charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a replacement unit.  The CD player had no problem playing my CD's.  However the DVD player would only read the video signal.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was quite disappointed in this device. The display was a little blurry and the image quality was a bit shaky.  But the most frustrating thing is that it wasn't supposed to ship with the unit. I contacted Lenovo Customer Service and they gave me two options: buy this unit from Staples, which is overpriced, or send it back to Lenovo. I'm thinking both options were bad. It is so frustrating to try to return something from a store that does not honor returns.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this monitor for 4 months now. It has not come with a warranty card. It only came with a one year warranty card for a good price, so it's not as if the price of it was the problem, but I ordered it at full price and it was delivered in less than a week. I called to see if it could be returned to me and they said no. I sent them the money, but it would not ship until the card came in the mail, and so I returned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered it, and I didn't get it until the day I got to pick it up. When I opened the package, I saw the packaging had been damaged. I called customer service and the girl that was on the phone said she was sending out another package. I told her that I would return it and she said she would put it back in the packaging and put it into my mailbox. I paid for a second package, and it never came. I contacted customer service, and they said that if I paid $50 to return it, they would send it out to me right away. They never sent it out, but it was still sitting in the box. I ordered a different printer, and that package was waiting for me to pick up when I left for my vacation. The only problem with this printer is the cartridges. I had to return one cartridge to get a replacement, and even then, they didn't have any replacement cartridges in stock for me. I ended up spending $100 on three cartridges, and then I ended having to go back and order more cartridges from Staples. The cost was well worth the headache and frustration, but this printer definitely needs an upgrade in quality to keep it competitive. I did get the printer for the price that I paid, and honestly, I paid more because it was so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Just received this monitor but so far, I am not impressed. I have tried to adjust the image to appear a little darker and I still can't do that. It's obvious that the colors are not accurate and the display has a lot of light bleed. It even looks as though I'm looking at a bad print from a printshop (I'm at work right now and it's dark outside). I'm not even trying to save the image, I'm just trying to see the difference between a bad monitor and a good one. The screen seems to be fine if I change the color temperature to the mid-range. But, even at those settings, the image is very washed out and I have no idea why it's that way 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this monitor about a month ago and received it today. The picture quality is very poor, black border is noticeable at any distance. The monitor works fine if you have a direct connection, but you cannot get a picture from any distance even from the side of a wall. If you want picture quality for a small screen, this is not a good monitor for you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the product. I took it out of the box, set it up, and within a few minutes, I had the screen flickering off and the sound quality coming out of my headphones at a high volume. I was able to return it to Amazon for a refund within a day of purchasing. I also ordered a second monitor which was also returned within hours. I did not expect to be disappointed so quickly

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   For those of you thinking that the sound on this is bad, I've tried it on 4 different Yamaha system's. All were very noisy and very boomy. I think I'm looking for something with more bass, maybe a subwoofer, and I ended up buying this. I also ordered the 2.1 channel, but it has never arrived 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of the subwoofer is horrible.  I purchased 2 of these and ended up with just the one.  So, if you do buy this subwoofers, be prepared for very poor sound.  Also, the wires get stuck in very easily.  If you don't do your homework, you will be disappointed

But for the price I paid for this unit it just shouldn't be this bad 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This works ok in my living room, but the only problem is that it does not work properly in my room.  I have a small room and it seems that my wireless is limited to a small area.  But after one night of the router being connected to it, it did not connect again to any other devices.  Even when I disconnected the wireless adapter, it kept on showing that I am connected to the router, even though I was disconnected.  It took me two days before I finally decided to call the manufacturer and get it fixed.  The problem is not with the router or the wireless system itself, but with the adapter.   So if I wanted to use it as a wireless extender, I would have to buy another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used this device with an older laptop. In the beginning, the device worked fine. But as time passed, the sound became so weak and distorted that I couldn't listen to it. After a lot of searching, I found the best results using the Audio-Technica ATH-M50BT. If I buy the ATH model, I should be able to get the same results. It's not the fault of the device, but rather the poor sound of the older laptop I've been using it on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a set of four of these to hang on the front panel of my computer. Unfortunately, my printer does not print well in this orientation.  The cables run out of the computer and the switches don't seem to stay connected. The print screen is the worst part. I've already had to return these and return the next set of switches as well.I'd like to recommend the product, but only if the printer can print in its recommended orientation. I have been trying for about a week to print correctly in this position, but so far I haven't been successful.  If I could send out a set, I would recommend trying it with the printer on the end of the cables, but if you already have them, don't bother

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very skeptical about the quality of these earphones. Not only were they cheap but I also thought the material was fragile.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the Epson printer and the screen and printer cartridges were not delivered to me until 11 days after I had received the printer.  I called and sent a check and got a refund on the order as well.  The printer arrived and I had to install it with the included Epson Screen, then I had problems with it.  After some searching and doing research I determined that this printer had bad firmware.  It only works if it has an Epson Display Screen attached and has the cartridge installed.  This printer does not work without the ESS screen installed, so you will have to cut your losses and buy a printer that comes with the screen included.  If you do buy this printer, make sure that the cartridge does not have any of the ETCS chips installed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have tried many different brands over the years and this is one of the worst I have ever used.  I had it in my basement for months and finally broke it.  The unit would only record on the channel with the antenna, so the sound would cut out and the pictures would be garbled.  All you need to do is turn the unit over and the sound and pictures will appear as they should.  When I had my unit out in the middle of the night, I heard static as I was recording.  At that point, I tried to plug in the tape and the unit would not recognize it. I then called for a technician, who quickly returned with a defective unit.  No problem, I just returned it and returned it again.  Then I had a technician come to me.  What did I have to do to get my unit back

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought it because I thought it would be good for a temporary mount to a car mount on a rear bumper. I ordered it with a little trouble, the package was labeled as a car dock, and didn't even come with the mounting brackets. We tried to contact the factory and even with our own shipping carrier (Fed Ex) the problem was not resolved. They were also unable to help us as they said they were in the process of setting up the mounting bracket and couldn't make it in time to pick up the package.  I contacted the warranty company, but they never returned our phone calls or emails. The only response I got was a quick email from Amazon asking if we would like to send back the unit, which we did. We received an email in return with a return authorization code, but the package still wasn't ready when we returned the unit. I contacted Amazon again with a phone call and they assured us that it would ship, but it did not. I called the return shipping company again to see if they could help, and they told me that the unit would arrive at the UPS depot for pickup, and would be there in time for Christmas

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The packaging for this thing is very unprofessional. There was nothing on the box about how to mount the earphone.  The product itself is of little value 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I took a chance on the Epson Epson Photo Inkjet printer (Epson's highest end option) and this didn't work very well. The ink doesn't bleed very well from the cartridge and it doesn't write very well either. It's very expensive for the ink cartridge, and very little ink comes out. I've purchased three different cartridges, and they have to be changed every five days. It sucks that they don't make this printer for home use."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you want to make it seem like it is always good to buy cheap electronic equipment, you must have the  bad taste of a salesman. I wish I could have  bought the same item from another supplier instead 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought that it was a good speaker for the money. But it's terrible! I've been reading reviews on this device for some time and it's all been the same. They're all saying the same thing: The speaker doesn't sound the best and it does not do it in large room environments. And it's really hard to turn it on. I can barely even turn it off. I have to keep turning it on and off to get anything to come out of it.  I ordered the unit and got it and the cable on Monday. I called customer service on Wednesday, still nothing. I got it back on Thursday and the problem is still the same 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The case is so heavy it almost moves around the desk, but it's more about the fact that the case is too big to fit in my work area.  The only thing I could find to make it less bad is to shorten the case, but that's a huge expense.  No good: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Just as with every other review, you have to ask yourself what kind of value you are getting for this device. When it works it's great, but it can't even keep the batteries in their sealed packaging. Don't pay a lot of money for a crappy device if you're looking for a quality, dependable device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product came fine, but it was a dead end 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was shipped to me with a damaged cable. The whole thing was wrapped in cellophane. I sent it back to the store and they sent me a new cable. It is now very obvious that the package was opened and the product is damaged. It does not seem to be in use yet. I have contacted the store as well as the manufacturer and am awaiting a reply.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The electronic device worked fine, no problems.However, I couldn't understand why it wasn't working correctly. I thought that it was working because I was using the power adapter, which is a proprietary solution.I tried this with other different brands and didn't have any problem with it. It also didn't work with the included remote. I am looking for a replacement remote for my other computer, as well as trying to get a replacement to repair it from this seller. I can't recommend this device as I haven't gotten it to work yet. I may have to go through Amazon for another device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought these on Amazon to put on our new PC's. We received them and they all turned out to be very flimsy. We didn't use them and returned them for a different brand. They're not even worth the money they cost.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've tried it once and was unable to connect my phone to my PC. It was very slow and I have the HP Pavilion Pro (16GB). No other issues. I was able to connect to the PC from the laptop but it was very sluggish. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There's no way that a product like this can be installed and work properly. There's an air gap between the card and the case. I had to remove the case and then mount it with a plastic brace. I was able to run a video card (but not an i7-2600m) and I only have 8Gb of storage.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I can't say I had much luck with this. I used it as an external hard drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works, but the remote doesn't work with my TV, or even with the Xbox. The only solution for that is to buy a separate adapter from Amazon. It doesn't even support my TV.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got these for Christmas but didn't use them until mid-February. I did them at work and they worked for about two months. But then I went on vacation and they started working fine until I returned. I haven't used them since. I don't think it's the cables, but more the plugs. I use plugs from old radios and connectors from old PC adapters. I'd rather just buy the cable.I'm sure some of you have a similar problem.But I can't recommend them to anyone, because I've had the same problem, plus my equipment is very similar to yours.I just got a set of these yesterday, and I have the same experience as you have. I have used them for a couple of months but have had to go on vacation before I got it working again. I hope it's just a matter of time before I get it working for good. But it's been a very frustrating experience for me. I know the cable is the problem because I have had this problem for a year or so. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this for my son and it works great. I have no idea why it only works in one mode: either the remote or the light itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These batteries are useless.  If you buy them, you get a big bill with the shipping and taxes, not enough to cover a couple days worth of battery use.  I'm sure they have better stuff, but at the cost of having to pay for batteries that will never work.  It's very sad.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased one of these speakers, and within a month, it was dead. I tried different speakers, but the issue is still the same. I contacted a service provider, and they said the problem is with the electronic device. The price I paid for the speaker is $150, but I am only getting about 4 hours of sound. I have no idea why they make these speakers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought it about 6 months ago and put it in the front seat of our  car.  We drove about 8K miles over the course of a week, with  no problems.  I called the company and they told me that they had been  making changes in the past 6 months, and I wouldn't  be surprised if this was the reason why  we didn't see any problems after 6 months.   They've failed to notify customers of any changes,  so we're out about $100, which is really an  exorbitant price for a unit that we don't use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried the product for about 5-6 weeks with good results. However, my son recently had a problem with his Samsung laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have owned this device for almost 3 years.

I tried both my iPad Mini and iPhone 5 (both purchased at the same time) and the iPad Mini with it's great microphone is the best.  But these are cheap and don't come with any extra software that is required to use them as I wanted.  Very disappointed with this

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have bought and sold several of these for years. The ones that I get from them are not working as they are supposed to. I ordered new ones, but they did not arrive until a week after I placed my order. I was not happy with the service I received. I returned them all and am waiting to hear from the company about my return charges. No word on any refund for me, so I am looking for another electronic device seller now 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When you install a new CDROM in your computer, you are not likely to notice any improvement, if any.  I got this drive about a month ago and never used it.  After about 8 hours of running it I took it out and it would not read the media.  It's only usable if you buy a CD to read from it. This product is nothing more than a CD-ROM-caddy for your printer!  The device is not compatible with a PC. It would be great if they could put it on a CDROM-drive without using it as a CDRom-cadence! The problem is, you'll end up buying new software to work with this device. I'm going to return it to the store, because there are so many good software on the Net. If you are planning on buying this product, you will want to buy a copy of the printer driver, the software that will let you print to it.If you buy from an electronics store, just try to install the device by yourself. You'll end in disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product came with 4 CDs of the same, no  replacement discs were provided to store them on. The disc I received had only the first disc and no replacement.  The CD is very small, and the plastic case is very  fragile.  When I received the replacement discs they were so weak that I could not use them.  I could get them to work, but they did not look as good as they did before 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have one of these in my collection.  It is very noisy.  I would recommend that you buy a good cheap electronic device like a CD-ROM drive or a printer.  You do not want to invest in something that is so noisy that you will not have a good quality printer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I thought it was a good deal at $30.95 and it arrived with no problems. Then I had to return it because it would not fit in my computer. I didn't return it, I just sent it back to Best Buy. Then they sent it to me a few days later. It still doesn't fit. I sent it again and I got it. But it doesn't work. So it's a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got one of these. I am happy I could not afford to get a one that is the same size. But, when the unit arrived, I could only use it for 1 hour, and then I could never use it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item thinking it would be a good choice for a small device, when I got it home, the screen was too bright for it to be usable. I was disappointed because I thought it would have a bigger range of use than it did. The product is really good for the money, but it's also pretty bulky, and the warranty doesn't cover the screen's brightness, only a minor scratch or other minor issue.I ended up throwing it out because it's not really portable, and I wouldn't be able to use it for a regular job.I would have liked a slightly smaller screen, but I'm not really unhappy with it.I got a much better LCD monitor and it's much more portable, but for the same price, I'd rather have the larger screen.Overall, I don't recommend this item. The screen has a lot of brightness that you don't need for a simple small project, the only reason I was willing to buy it was because I saw some online reviews that said it had some brightness in the lower end of the brightness spectrum, but once I got the product home, it was way too bright.The screen's price is good for what you're getting, but if you want something a little smaller, then buy a bigger LCD monitor or use a tripod instead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item at Target for $100.00. It came with 2 cables and a hard drive. I received the product in less than 5 days and it was defective. The drives weren't working and I had to return it. The cable is made of plastic. The package was defective with the hard drive inside and there was no sign of the warranty card. I returned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this router because I wanted to share my home with other computers. However, it took a long time to get it working. The first time I tried to use it, it wouldn't connect to the modem. After waiting a few days, it worked. Then, I ran into a number of problems and I was eventually charged a $49.99 fee to troubleshoot. After I resolved most of these problems, it didn't work at all after I paid the fee. The second time it worked, it was too slow and would not even connect to my home network. I ended up giving up on it and it just sat there.   It is an expensive piece of junk for the price you pay. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got it for $35 and I am not impressed. The product description says that it will work, but it only did so once. I had to do a firmware update to get it to work. I think I might have to pay $10 for a replacement unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a defective monitor from Amazon. I ordered this monitor, which was supposed to be a perfect fit. However, it came in a box so bad that it wouldn't fit even though I ordered the right size. It was defective from the start and would only fit into the tray on the side.  Amazon won't fix a bad monitor that I already paid for, and I'd rather spend my money on something I know will last me the whole year

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product about a year ago. The battery lasts just two months. I would give it a one star rating if I could. I have used this product for 5 years but it never lasts long enough to justify the price. I'm giving up on it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am giving it one star because it took a while for it to start up. I had to put it on to charge it. Then it took several tries to get it to show on the screen, which I think was the problem with the software.The screen would show as an HDMI video device, but the video was choppy and not that smooth. If I didn't have a computer nearby, I wouldn't have even noticed it.It takes about 10 seconds to boot up. It only takes about 5 to 10 seconds for the monitor to display. If you want something that you can just plug in and get on, buy a TV or something else that will work. This doesn't.If I had a better computer, I would give it a positive review 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would have been much happier with the other brand 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have tried this product in several instances, each time I have found the antenna to be loose.

This product is not a good choice for outdoor use, if you are looking for a simple antenna for your patio or back yard then you might want to look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got one of these and it has stopped working since I put it in. I've contacted LG twice and neither company could give me any help.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device works fine but the antenna connector on the box is very poor quality. I replaced it with an RCA connector.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this speaker for about a month and it has been just the same. Nothing  positive about this item: no matter what music you play on this speaker, the sound will not be the same as it is on the box.  The box works fine, but I would rather not have to listen to this thing all day long.  I tried a different brand that had better sound, but it didn't matter. I would have purchased the same speaker if it worked out, but there's no way that it will work out for me 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The electronic device that comes with this TV does not include the stand. I am very disappointed with this product. It did not come with a stand and we were unable to set the TV up for installation without it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are terrible.  They were installed in my car and the sound was not as good as they claimed it would be.  I called customer service and they gave me an alternative brand.  This time, it was just as bad.  It has to do with the fact that you have to do something to the amplifier in order to get it to work.  But, once the problems were solved, it worked fine.  And I was still stuck with this terrible brand

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This USB 3.0 device is not compatible with Windows and only works with VMware Workstation. This is why I have only had it for two days.

After two days it stopped working. This time I was able to get it working using the adapters supplied. I have not had any other issues. I would not recommend this device to anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had to return both the dvd player and the blu ray player that I ordered from this company. I had to call customer service and they tried to tell me they had already shipped them.  I called to inquire about the bad communication. I was told they were only to be available for an extra week, and they would deliver right to my front door.  It turned out that my order was not listed with other items, so they couldn't send my order out to other customers. I didn't feel comfortable about having to go to the company to return my purchase.  As soon as I called customer service, they told me that they didn't know anything about these return policies and wouldn't be shipping out my items to other potential customers.  They also told me they could take the goods back, but I would have to pay shipping fees.  And the good thing about that is, I paid shipping fees for my order!   So that's why I returned everything 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have not had any issues with this item. But it is a lot harder to put a sound card into an external USB device than it is to get a standard USB port. So if you want a soundcard to use with an external sound card, get a USB hub.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item from Walmart and received it about a month later. I found that after the warranty expired, it was no longer possible to return it to Walmart for replacement.  So I had to return the item to Amazon.  There was no way that I could return it back to Walmart.  I returned it back as I could, and sent it back with a return label.  The label was stuck, but Walmart did not return it with the original box.  And so I had a box that was full of water, that was not sealed, and that had to be thrown out.  This was all in the box. I called customer service and the operator was very polite but said that the return label had to come with the box as a part of the return.  At this point, I had already spent a month and a half of money just on the box, so I was very disappointed.  But, after I did this, I ordered the item from Amazon, and it worked with no problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this cable to work with a Playstation 3 (PS3 does not work with my PC), but it failed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace the front right speaker, but they are too tall to be used with the same speakers. I would've thought the price would've been good enough to buy two, but there are no instructions that include a height adjustment, so you might just have to pay another $20-$40 to get it in the right position 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you're looking for something that can hold a camera, this will not work.  I was going to buy the XL-Flex version of the Mavic which comes with a little bracket for mounting an iPhone 6+ or other accessories, but it's not included.  So I used a similar bracket for another camera and it worked, but still only for shooting from a flat surface.  For more challenging situations, I'd consider buying the larger Mavica.  Either way, if you're really looking for versatility, buy the larger one.  Otherwise, the Mavi doesn't offer that much.  If it only did, I could see myself buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is easy to replace a bad memory card.  The problem is that the replacement card is slightly bigger.  This causes the monitor to have a strange height and the software to have problems with the resolution.  No one has come out and stated a reason why this happens, but I have seen it happen twice and twice is a lot of trouble to endure.  I had a similar problem with a new hard disk drive.  Both of these problems were eventually resolved by replacing the defective card with another one from another manufacturer.   I know this may not be a common problem, but it is a problem with the monitor, not with the memory card, and it is frustrating to see a good electronic device fail in such a spectacular manner.  If anyone out there has any ideas about what might be causing this problem, please let me know 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased the 4 channel, I have yet to use it. It came with two small rubber plugs, and I still have to glue them to my car. This product is useless for our cars. I've purchased 3 of these, and they still have the rubber plugs. If I put them on my car, I can't use them. I would recommend saving your money, buy some real cable and not wasting your money on this bad electronic product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones are made for the ears of people with larger ears. These are not for me. I am a small ear and these fit well enough. If your ears are smaller and your need larger volume I would recommend you try some other headphones. I will be sticking with the pair that come with the case. If you like the sound you want to buy, go for them. If not, try the other headphones in the collection. I would not trust these to be durable enough to be used for more than one or two hours. I thought these would have been better for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When the box was delivered, it came in a big box full of junk. I have to go get a new electronic device and this is the cheapest one. The only thing that the price of this item is right is that it is a dead link.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thinking it would be like the Apple Wireless Keyboard. Instead, I was really disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered a pair of these, and the audio only worked on one. We had them delivered and they didn't work at all. It took a whole day to figure out the problem. We have 2 different sets of speakers and none of them worked. We didn't order it from Amazon, but from Radio Shack. I called the guy on the phone, and he said they could be shipped out for less, but that they would have to wait till next business day to get to me. So, next day we're waiting for a return shipment. Next day after that, he gave us a new box to try. Same problem. So we sent it back and they did their best to ship it again. Same issue. Radio Shack is kind of a bad place to order from, especially for audio. I'll keep on checking, but they'll have to change their shipping policy to be a better service for their customers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit came with a very poor box, which was so badly made it made it difficult to open.

So you'd better not waste your money on this unit

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with this purchase. I bought one and found that it did not fit the motherboard and was too short for my motherboard. I returned the item and ordered one that is wider for the motherboard, and it fit perfectly. But, it cost more, had to return the return shipping, and had to order the same width motherboard again (for the same price) from another manufacturer.The other electronic devices from the same manufacturer also did not work with this motherboard, so I returned it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say the design is very bad. I don't even like to have to unplug it. I have it in a car, and it won't even turn off. There is nothing on the packaging about how to plug in the connector. It doesn't come with any instructions either. It is very hard to install, and has lots of dust build up inside. I would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We had this speaker for a year and a half, but it never worked. The cable broke and now it's just a big piece of junk. I'm afraid to recommend this speaker to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device with the intention of having my home audio system in my bedroom. It doesn't work. I've tried different brands of wire and no one has worked. I have tried different outlets and none of them worked. It has been a year now and I'm still not getting any benefit from this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't have anything bad to say about this product, but I did have issues with it and my laptop refused to connect to it. I ordered an extension cord for it and that worked for a while. I then tried to plug in the extension cord and it wouldn't even recognize it. Eventually I tried connecting the USB cable directly to the computer, and that also failed.I finally tried to connect it to a monitor using my VGA adapter, but that only caused issues.Finally I just decided to return it.I should also mention that I have two other Mac laptops with the same monitor and this is my second Apple computer with the monitor and the keyboard attached.So I don' t think I'm doing anything wrong with this laptop and the product itself, but the price was very cheap and the extension cable (which I had to order after two attempts because of problems) was extremely expensive.If I'm forced to return this product I will go with something else.I don't know about any other Mac laptop that can do what this laptop can, but it was supposed to be the ideal solution for this specific application.Unfortunately the extension cords don't work, which is why I was able to connect directly to my computer, but if you're using it for a lot of hard drive or network operations that's going to make your life a lot harder.I have to wonder how much better the alternative is

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking that it would make my headphones sound good, it turned out to be useless. I tried three different brands of headphones and none of them sound very good, not even close. I also tried the earbuds, no difference. I was really upset, I would have thought that something that cheap would be able to make them sound great.I tried Amazon and got the headphones, but only after I spent about 30 minutes complaining about the quality.It was useless from the very first time. I had tried other brands and I did not expect any improvement from the price I paid. It is very annoying, but I do not recommend buying these earphones 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought it thinking it was the most convenient way to take photos of my children while they were sleeping. I didn't realize that the wires would be hanging and then be difficult to cover with a pillow, so we ended up using a blanket instead. I ended up having to take the blanket away from my children several times because the wires kept getting hung up. Even if you don't buy the cover, it's better to buy the blanket instead of the cover. The cover is not necessary for a good quality photo. Plus, if you want to be more efficient, just use the camera you already have in your camera bag instead of buying the cover and paying more for the accessory. But if you really want to take great quality photos, buy the covers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got the TV only to find that I could only connect it to one TV. After that I tried for the second time, and that worked, but I ended up having to get an HDMI cable to go into the TV. I had a bunch of time off this month and couldn't wait to try the third time, so I picked a different cable and plugged it into the wall and it worked. So I'll stick with this until I can get a different one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this in the spring of 2007 and it was fine until my home got very hot (it is in the desert) and the water meter stopped working. It has been 3 years and I still have the same problem. I have been to numerous Home Depots and no luck at all. My advice to anyone who buys one of these is to go back to a good electronic device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for a Christmas gift. It arrived damaged, and there were no instructions. I was so excited and excited to see it was working that I left the house in the middle of the night. When I returned to retrieve the device it was in pieces.  I called and emailed the company to try to solve the issue, but they said they would refund the money.  All of this is frustrating.  Please do not purchase this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is great for a home theater. If you want to watch a movie in your home with no sound in the background, this is the device for you.  For a home cinema, you don't have the ability to set the screen to your liking, which is what I wanted. This device just doesn't do it for me. I'll keep looking for other options to upgrade this, but so far I've had little luck.  I can't give a bad review about something I haven't seen and I don't intend to, so I'm not saying this is a bad product, only that I haven, as usual, been disappointed in every electronic device I've ever owned 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, I needed to change my DVD player to Sony and they did not have this part in stock. I called and they were very nice, but unfortunately, they did sell it, but not this one. Then the cable arrived and, as usual, they had no stock, no way to order it, and I got it, then returned it, because they sold it out. I can't recommend them, either, they seem to be getting more and more confusing. But, at least I ordered the wrong part, and, when it arrived, I was still unable to do anything about it. And, I'm on vacation and can't wait to get home to do some work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable for the video output is way too short, and the sound output is horrible. If I could give it 0 stars I would, it would have been so much better if you had put a longer cable. I can't hear any sound from the device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Had to order this item again, because there were no more stock. I was expecting much more than this and I don't care about the good reviews, because I still don't have a working unit, and they haven't shipped it back yet. It seems that when you order the item, the order is processed immediately. When it doesn't show up for the third time (as ordered), you will have to wait a few days for the UPS to bring it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just ordered two of these adapters on eBay for one of my customers. We had a bad connection to his system for some reason so I needed to order two adapters.   So far both of them worked great only to be switched off two days later.  I called eBay and they informed me that the company would not repair such adapters since they are not guaranteed to be in the network. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product has nothing to do with electronic sound amplification. I received the product, installed it, and was ready to take it out of the box and into my home theater system. I was then informed that there was no electronic device to power the speaker in the system.  I was told that the item was being returned to the manufacturer.  When I called the manufacturer, I was informed that they had already shipped the speaker to another retailer, and there was nothing they could do about it.  They have no control over the return or shipment, and the shipping fee was already paid for by the customer.  In other words, I wasted a ton of time and money, and I'm not even sure that I should have returned it. The product is bad, and should be returned. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD and DVD burner is the weakest link in the system, and when you're not using it, it seems to hang up every few minutes. I'm going to return this CD and I don't know why they make it such a huge expense 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device was shipped in a plastic bag and it was not returned in any kind of box. It was not even returned to the store to be shipped back. I ordered and had it shipped and returned as soon as I got it. I then waited a few weeks for the return shipping to be processed. The return shipping was not processed and returned to us a couple of times. We called Apple and had them refund the money to the credit card that we had issued to them. I also contacted the store and they would not refund my money back and they were not willing to give me a replacement, which is a great thing for a store to do. I have not gotten a refund yet from Apple for the defective purchase as of yet. I feel bad about having to return it because I paid for a great product and they could have been more helpful with the return process.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've been using the CD-RW in my car for years. I never used it for a CD or DVD-R to my MP3 player. This one is a big bust.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very excited about these units but after some time I am beginning to see the limitations. The only time they worked perfectly was when I had it in the garage. But even then I had to put the unit on the floor for the unit to work properly. I am not sure if I will ever use this unit again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the best speaker in a large room. No matter what I place over it, the speakers will only reproduce a very small portion of what is being played.  The sound gets worse and worse with time.  I'm not very sensitive to speakers of this quality, but I cannot stand it at this time. I have found better speakers in other brands which are much less expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item in September 2008 and it was the last item I ordered.I have never had an issue with any of the cables,but I found that this one was too short to be useful.I also found that the connectors were not strong enough to handle the cable pull,especially on a power line where I live.All in all,I was happy with the item until I ordered the following month and it did not arrive on time.I was able to purchase the item in August and I sent the same email to return that I did with all my other return.I expected to get my item back,but no such luck,they said that they cannot refund returns on electronic items.I sent an email to the company to find out the reason and they sent me another order from China.I tried to return the return shipment from China,but they did not ship the return item back to the original sender so it returned to them.I ordered the item again from China and this time they did return my item,but it cost me an additional $40 for return shipping.It was so much hassle I just stopped buying electronic items from this company.My wife and I decided to return our items from China as well,so now I am trying to return items from all the other websites they carry.I am also trying to order from eBay but I have not been able to locate anything with a good return policy.I wish I knew why they did this to me,but if you ever have a problem with the return service please don't give up.You can ask for an additional credit,or even ask for a new item.I think you are entitled to a refund and compensation for all the trouble you have gone through.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this in July for my daughter who had a severe case of the    annoying blue/purple screen.  The screen was bright, the sound was  great, and the remote worked fine.  Unfortunately, the remote is just not the most reliable.  This is true for every remote I've owned.  It often fails to transmit the signal at all.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I have not yet tried to use the camera on my 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this product for my wife. She likes it better than the other brands on the market. However, she has had to use it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn't worked as well as it should. I'm pretty sure that's a lack of knowledge on the part of the manufacturer.I am pretty much out of ideas, or patience, so I'm just going to have to cut my losses and hope that I can get it to work.It is a great product, but it needs to work better. I will stick to the other brand of USB devices that I have.If I were you, I would wait for this thing to work, or you could just use a printer with a standard printer cable instead of this one.I do feel sorry for you, if you had to wait for two weeks for the device to work like this. But, this is the fault of the product's manufacturer, so maybe you're not supposed to trust it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The USB cable was defective. After one week, the device was still not working. I did not return the device, as I had already ordered the correct cable. So I was stuck with the defective cable. After several days, the cable was working fine, and I was not able to use the device. So, the purchase was a mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered a pair of these for my Sonos speaker system and they worked fine. However, the Sonos system requires the speaker to be plugged into a wall outlet which, by my reckoning, meant there was no room in my living room.I tried to work with Sonos to fix the problem but, despite several attempts, they simply have refused to issue refunds. They also, to my knowledge, will not return any defective products.I'm pretty certain these won't perform as advertised and, in my opinion, there's nothing better than getting a pair off the shelf. If you're interested in this, go ahead. I'm not. I ordered them and I'm disappointed that I wasted money on something that simply didn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It came with the case which I didn't like, it is a nice case, but the screen wasn't in any way the reason for me to return it.The display itself isn't any better. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The receiver worked fine with the sound of the TV. However, I can no longer view the HD channels on the TV, even though I have no problem with the cable. I have the AV input in the TV and no audio is transmitted through the TV or cable. It does not work as expected. I am not sure if this is just my TV, but it is annoying and the receiver will not pick up the audio signals. I tried a different TV model and it worked fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The product came in in great condition. However, the wires were not as expected. There was no way to clean or even try to fix the wires. I took the product back to the store and they refused to exchange it. I returned it to Amazon and returned again. There's just no way for me to return these cables. I don't even have the packaging with me to ship the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought it was a great buy at first, but it only worked well with some of my older monitors.  But I was able to get it to work with all my newer monitors. It only came with one cable.  I also had to purchase the cable from Apple for it to function.  It also has to be plugged into a power outlet, and my computer can't power on or off while I have this. I returned this and went back to the store for another one.  Unfortunately, it has to use another dvd player, and you also have to buy another dvr box. The dvd box is over $100 dollars I was not even able to try this one out, because it didn't even work with my older monitor.  If I would have spent another $100, then I could've tried out the more advanced features that came with the other monitor, but this one didn't have any. If you are only going to buy this to play the latest dvd games, then it may not be worth the money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am disappointed that I didn't even consider buying this device in its original version. I did have it shipped to me from one of my supplier's and was ready to use it right out of the box. However, just a couple days later it was returned for a faulty part. This is a very serious issue and I doubt that they will honor their return policy. I would not consider purchasing this device again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD on my monitor is a big step down from the quality of the ones that I have seen advertised on other websites. I don't know if this is a factory defect, or if I'm just getting my hopes up. The unit comes with two blank backs, one black, one blue. I put the black back on to see how it would hold up to color printing, and it looks like you can only print in black. I have the blue back, and no problem at all, so I don´t know what to think about the LCD.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This headphone cable is junk.  We've had it on for 3 years, and the only reason it's still in the box is because we still haven't replaced it.  This is not good quality or value for money.  It's about $2, which is more than enough for a good pair of headphones, but not for a pair of earbuds.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm very disappointed with the product I ordered. The device itself was fine. The problem is that the remote does not stay in the remote. It does not have a locking device on it. So it can slip out of the case. The remote itself can slip into the case from the top, but it is very easy to pull the remote out and put it back in the case if you need to change a memory card. If you try to hold it on with one hand, it slips away from you. Very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This tv was delivered to me and had a box that was never properly installed. I never had it working with any TV tuners. After several days of this, the item was returned to the retailer and I had it sent to HDT. The item is still in the packaging, and has not been returned. So it is now in my closet with my other items, but it has not worked, even though the box has been returned to HD TV. I sent HD TV two different emails, neither of which they responded to. HD TV is supposed to give me a refund, but I am still stuck with this item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I did not like the fact that I couldn't use the laptop as a primary portable when it was in my bag. This laptop, however, has a separate compartment to hold your books, pens, etc, that you would otherwise need to take with you. However, it is rather difficult to open. There are also issues with the keyboard being uncomfortable to type on. This is not the best laptop. But it does not work at all unless you are sitting directly in front of it.I don't recommend this laptop 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So far the picture shows great quality and the sound is good. However the color saturation is horrible. I have to put it next to the TV and that gives the best contrast. There are some slight differences between a Blu-ray and DVD player but it's not very obvious. It also won't work with my AppleTV or my HD DVD player. I'm really disappointed that it will not work with such devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This set of batteries works well if you like to use your iPhone only as a portable device.  The set works fine with a larger iPhone if you use it like a camera.  Unfortunately, you have to get a special charger to make these batteries work for iPhone users, so don't expect a lot of battery life.  I would recommend you buy a set that will give you more battery life (or a longer time with your charger) before you buy this battery set.   I wish I had known about this set sooner, but they didn't even list them as compatible with the iPhone 5.  For the rest of us who like to travel light and use iPhones only as camera attachments, this set is not worth the money."
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this device for two months. It is working great for my laptop, but not for my desktop.

I had to go to the local Apple store and get the "Color Enhancer Kit" and "Advanced Keyboard Kit" to make my computer look like it does on the monitor. I am going to send it back but I will not be able to use any software for my computer because of this company's poor support.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The speakers are horrible and very bad quality. I have only bought one pair of these and they have the most annoying sound coming out of them. They do not even sound the same. They sound like your getting on a plane when you play them, they sound like you are in a bad quality car listening to bad radio signals. I am so disgusted with these speakers. I would rather pay for a better speaker system and have less problems with noise. It's been over a year and I still have to buy new pairs for my TV. I don't know how anyone can buy these things and make a decent living off of them

However, the volume control with the buttons is not working and you have to use the Volume rocker on the iPhone to use it. I would suggest to avoid this device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The headphones are way too small for me to wear comfortably. Not the greatest sound quality either. It's a good headset though if you don't have a lot of room for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this speaker as a Christmas present for my husband and son. I wanted to give it to them but the store clerk refused to put it in their hands. The other clerk told them I would send them a refund. I would rather have them buy something else.I would not recommend it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got this unit a few weeks ago. Unfortunately it seems it's all in the package and the cable doesn't even have the product name on it. So I called Customer Service and was told to come back in a few days when they had received the product. Needless to say, I have not returned as promised. What happened to the cable??
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these on sale and was never happy. After less than a month, the device didn't work and it was time to throw it out.  The new models were fine, but I'm going to stick with what I have.  They do have good reviews, but beware if you are the same, buy from other sellers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought one to hold a small, but very heavy item:  This thing is too large for my hand to hold securely.  It barely fits my middle finger.  I have to bend forward to pick up small items.  For the money, I think this thing is way overpriced.  The instructions that came with it are confusing and do not make any sense.  Just purchase the 2-pack and make sure you get the correct sizes for each item you want to store.  These sizes are so far off, you will be paying the same money for each one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So far, this has not stopped me from using this monitor, but it will not let me get it to do anything. Every time I turn it on or off, it tries to "settle" to the last time I was connected to a signal, and then the picture just flickers and flashes.  There are only two options for changing the picture mode: either the monitor automatically switches to the picture preset you have set, or you have to do it manually.  The only other option is to "press reset" to make the monitor back to normal.  So, unless I'm paying $600 for a monitor, and that's why I'm giving this three stars instead of four:  I have had two different types of problems with this monitor:  The picture never changes, and the flicker and picture flickering only happen when I turn the monitor on and off.  I don't know how the problem is resolved, and when it does work it doesn't seem to do so consistently, so I haven't had any problems so far with this device.  You can change the picture settings on the back of the monitor, however, the image is all blurry if you look at it for too long.  If you don't need the picture changing at all, I wouldn't bother with the picture, and I would just use my HDTV for most things.  But if I'm looking for anything with picture changing, this doesn't make it worth it.  And I don`t use HDTV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This printer is not able to print documents with any type of paper, including photo quality papers, and has a very bad print quality, not even worth $200 for a low quality print.  The printer itself is only usable for documents in black and white, not color, and the print quality is very poor.  This is a great printer for print quality documents only. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased and received this item on May 30th, 2015. It arrived broken and with an old label that was not attached properly. Upon unpacking and reading the description, I was not impressed with how many people in the comments were complaining about not being able to use the device with other brands of speakers or other electronic devices.I would love to have seen a picture of the label before it was attached to the unit. There is no way in my opinion to attach the label.The label is clearly marked with a picture. This is the label I received.It appears that there is another label that looks like a sticker on the back of the unit that has the same problem. I was even more unhappy when I tried to add a piece of tape to cover the sticker. This left the back cover on the unit upside down.I returned the unit to Best Buy on June 1st, 2015, along with a note about the issues. I received another unit and have contacted Best Buy, but I have not heard anything back from them yet. I really want to recommend this item, but it is not worth the price to return the broken unit and ask for a refund, or buy a replacement. The warranty is only good for 90 days after purchase and they do not even support them for this kind of issue."
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It doesn't like to do what it's supposed to. You have to use the supplied battery to get it to charge. Then, it is useless. You can't use it as a portable power supply, nor can you charge anything else. It doesn,t even allow you to charge your camera or other electronic device with it. So, if you need to recharge batteries and other electronic devices, I wouldn't recommend this for you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these speakers and they sound great, but I have been disappointed with my own speakers.   There was no problem with shipping, but when I got them, they were dead.  I returned them for a refund. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was advertised as working on all kinds of devices: Windows, MAC, etc. Well, it does not. The image quality of the image is not high enough to compensate for the lack of any color gradations. I would be hard pressed to recommend this product to any customer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had it in one ear and it didn't seem to fit.  The earbuds are so light, the sound is so lacking, the speakers are so weak, The only good thing is they're inexpensive and easy to find.  I'd rather pay more for a good pair of earphones 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to replace the battery in my TV remote control. The remote works fine, but it would not automatically turn on and adjust the volume. I called TVtech and they refused to send me a replacement remote.The store told me that I needed to send the remote to them, so I had it sent.I did not receive the replacement remote until two weeks after I received the defective remote. I contacted TVtech, and they again refused to issue me another remote. I then returned the defective product and returned it for a refund. It is now two weeks and they have still not delivered the replacement. If I had not returned my defective item, I would have returned it with no problem, but the store kept insisting that I take it to them for a replacement. I told them that I would not take any product until it was returned in working condition I then called TV tech and they sent me another defective remote, but again did not send it out until it arrived two days later. I would be very concerned about replacing these products without taking the product to them. Once I contacted TV tech I was told that if I do not return my defective product within two weeks they would return it to me.I do not feel they should issue me a new remote until they can ship a new one out The store sent me a defective remote in a different color, the replacement is in gray, but they refused me to return the defective item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to do some searching for other reviews on here and came across this one:  The product is not listed in the device itself. I got it in the mail yesterday. It was in bad shape when I got the device in. I could have sent it back and gotten a replacement. I did. I also did some searching online, but can't find anything about this other than what it says on the packaging:  Looks like a good buy if you're only looking to use it on a small screen but not wanting to use the battery as it is at the bottom of the device. This is the only bad review I've ever seen on here

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So far this is the only piece of equipment I have not been able to get to work properly. The cables are too long, the connectors are loose and the cable itself is bad. The only way I have found to solve this issue is to either buy a slightly different cable or have a person cut the cables lengthwise. Both of these are very costly and not ideal solutions for someone who is still working on this device. The customer service at Best Buy is horrible, they can not be bothered to answer my calls or emails. I've even been to a store and asked to return it and was told that the item is already out of stock 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The remote does not work on this unit. If you are like me, and use it to program your HDTV on the fly to a specific channel or picture quality setting (it doesn't), it doesn't work with this remote.  I have two other HDTV's (not using the remote) and they do work with it.  It does NOT work on the set itself.  Do not buy this unit, it doesn`t work with your TV.  Just buy a different one, and not use this remote with it
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very expensive device for the price you pay. I got this in for review only and returned it because of the faulty cable. It is only good if you are looking for a large amount of audio signals. This product is very expensive and there is no return policy for it, so be prepared for a bad experience 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought it would help for some of us to have a device that can't be connected to our computers.  I was hoping this was an electronic device but it's more a computer adapter.  It allows you to connect to your computer but cannot access it.  Not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've owned this unit for about two months. I've replaced the batteries a few times, and it still works fine.  No, it doesn't even come close to the advertised 6 hours.  This thing will not hold the charge for more than half an hour, and will eventually drain your batteries out.  It even won't hold the same charge as the original battery, it seems.  I'm giving it only one star because, at this price, you have to be really careful about the charging time you use.  The battery is cheap and disposable.  Just not sure why they didn't figure out that charging it for over an hour will result in problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I purchased this device, it looked like it would be an excellent device for capturing video from the computer screen. However, I had a great experience with it until I used it for video processing. While the video quality was excellent, the screen was very low resolution. I was not able to watch any of my video clips on the LCD screen. This is the first time I have purchased an HDTV and I am extremely disappointed. I paid over $150 for a LCD device and I was extremely disappointed with the performance. I will be returning this unit and spending my money on a good HDTV instead.I can't comment on how other people may respond to this device. I only purchased it based on the good reviews here

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The box was not sealed very well and did not fit in the case that was provided. I thought it would fit, but it was not as snug as I was expecting and I ended up having to cut a little bit of the plastic to get it in. After that the sound quality was terrible, it was very much like an amplifier on a bad speaker, the speakers sounded harsh and harsh. I was also very disappointed with the included manual. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD is very small.  The buttons are very small and do not fit into the LCD.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only reason to buy these was because of the low price. I wish I had been able to test these at my local store and give a better review:  I bought a couple of them (2-3) and installed them into a VCR. I'm not happy with the quality of the picture or sound that comes out of the speakers. I would buy these again if I could find them in the stores near me, but I don't plan on doing any serious watching for the foreseeable future. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing I'd like is that there is a way to save your preferences for later use. If I want to save the date on the picture, I don't want to see it immediately when the picture is taken. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only problem I had with my unit was when I went to insert the USB device to connect my computer and my wireless network. It went blank. I didn't even have to do anything to re-activate the computer, it just went blank! So far the only thing I can do is turn the unit off and on again but I don't really like the way that this does it. I'll have to send it back for repair. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First I used this to take a photo of a car's hood. The photo was fine, but then I tried taking a photo with the flash on. The car would not stop and it seemed like the only thing going wrong was that the car had no hood. It didn't work right.  I tried using this with my iPhone as well, but it didn't seem to have the same problem.  It worked on my laptop, but I had to use a wireless adapter.  The only positive about this is that you can still use it with a camera, but your photo quality won't be very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound on these is horrible. I have a high-end sound system and these speakers were only meant to be used with the system on. I took out the speakers and then mounted them on a small box. The sound output was horrendous. I did not know what I was doing. I am going to return these speakers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two of these units and one failed right away. I called and they replaced one for free. That lasted three days. The one that I received didn't even have the shipping label. They shipped it to me in a box. They tried to send another unit, but couldn't do it because of lack of space. The unit I received was clearly labeled and had all the appropriate components.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first electronic device, and I was extremely disappointed.  I will not purchase it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does not come with a cover. It comes with only a small black cover. But, it is very easy to put it on or take it off. If you are a person that only uses the wireless adapter, then you may get away with using only one cover and have it work. However, if you plan on using the wireless in a lot of different locations, then I would not recommend using just one cover. I would recommend purchasing the additional cover.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this in November 2012 and it still isn't working. It only took about two weeks for it to finally shut down. This was probably because I was using it as my primary TV device and not using the adapter that came with it. So I returned it, and now have nothing. No refund, no support. It doesn't even show up in the product search in the Apple store. I don't know if I will ever see a second computer from Apple as a purchase again.I will try a different brand and hope for better results.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this to have a quick, easy and inexpensive way to add speakers to the wall. I was very disappointed when I got it. I have only used it once to hook a 2nd stereo speaker to the same speaker. I ordered a new receiver to replace it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the high price. I have to agree that it doesn't provide the performance needed for an internal audio recorder. It would seem that this product could have been engineered more to handle real time recording. It's really disappointing considering the price point I paid 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this as a "dumb" computer for my wife's computer and she loves it. However, I am running a dual monitor set up and the only solution to this is to purchase a separate monitor (or get a second monitor). I bought the VGA cable for about $35.00, and even with that I only needed one cable to do it. It looks like the picture on the VESA mount on the back is warped due to the mounting design. It doesn't fit well. It's simply not worth the cost. The VGA Cable should be sold separately so I can mount it to the back and fix my problem.The screen is terrible, the viewing angle is atrocious, the colors are terrible, and the brightness is also terrible, as you can see in the pictures.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as part of a set and it is a dud. I did get to try it out in a few settings, but it didn't work right. This is my fourth Apple device (MacBook, PowerBook, MacBook) and I am sure I am not alone in having this problem with these speakers. The only option was to return it and I would have lost that money on it. I don't recommend this speaker, don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have never had a problem with it, but it had a strange smell. I sent it back in a few days, but the smell continued. I returned it a few times, with no luck. So I decided to exchange it for the same model, with the same warranty. I took the product into a local electronics store and ordered a replacement. The clerk told me that it would be shipping by next week. I called the UPS company, and they told me it would ship the next day. No problem. I checked it out at 3:00 pm and had it at my house at 5:00 PM. The next day, the package was still missing. The store told me UPS had it. No way.I called UPS again and they had the package on the same day. UPS had my package at 5pm, but no longer had it the next morning. I was furious. UPS has been a total bad customer, and it took me three times before I had UPS ship it. It's an excellent item, but just plain wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought three of these. The first arrived just fine, but the second arrived damaged. It was too bad since I only needed one to get going. Unfortunately, the third arrived damaged, and the company had no answer for why. It is only worth it for an emergency situation, but not for the purpose of a permanent installation. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought two and they are both very heavy. I would not recommend them for a portable device like a laptop. The product description on Amazon is completely misleading, I believe it is not the same thickness as the other model in the package. I have had mine for about a month now and no complaints yet. But the two that I have received so far have already broken. If you want a good quality laptop, buy a different laptop model than the HP ZBook 15, Dell XPS 15, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought two sets of the cables, and they are terrible. They are made of a weak material that is difficult to bend. The product is supposed to make the sound more consistent, but I was having trouble achieving that using the cable. The sound is not as clear as I thought it would be, and the cables are uncomfortable. The cable itself is cheap, and it will easily break in two days. It is a good idea to buy a different set of cables, but if you buy this set, you're basically screwed, if you want a good sounding speaker, buy a proper cable, not these cheap knock-off cables

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 2 of these for my wife and I. I purchased the 4 foot version and installed it. She used one and put it in my son's room. The only good thing about the product is the fact that you get one more year to use it. The next time I bought it, she installed it, and used it for about 2 months. I ordered the 10 foot version of the product, but it arrived very quickly. But she installed her monitor, and put everything she could get on it. It was never used. I sent a complaint to Philips, and they replied within a week. Now it has only 1 month left of use. If you are thinking about buying one of these, just wait. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I returned it because it was very difficult to use. And my car's inoperable CD player is also defective. It is clear that Honda does not care about customers' complaints about faulty items, which I do not understand. As for those that can use the CD player in their cars, please buy a new one. They won't have any problems if they use it correctly. I am very disappointed with Honda and I hope they will get back to me to solve this problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor after reading the positive reviews.  It is easy to use, but the screen is very small.  I also have a bigger monitor, and it works fine on that monitor.  The only reason I bought these is to be able to use these on a larger screen, but it is only so you can run more programs and it doesn't appear the program loads any faster.  They are not as responsive as I thought they were going to be.  My only real problem is that they don't come with the adapter cable for the smaller screen.  And I thought that it would come with one as well.  But I guess not

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had it for about 3 weeks now and still have not received my receipt. I have called Amazon and they said I would be given a refund if I was able to give them the receipt by the end of the week, but I haven't heard from them since. I ordered it on Tuesday afternoon and it was shipped the following Monday. I called Amazon again this evening and no one would take the receipt until the end Monday. On Tuesday I called back and the rep told me it would take 3 days for the receipt to arrive. But I hadn't gotten it yet. It has been 10 days now and I still have NOT gotten my receipt...This device has been extremely disappointing to me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I didn't expect it to work. I was looking for something that would allow me to turn off my wireless router for gaming. I did not expect this device to turn on while in the process of uninstalling. My router is unplugged from the wall, and I've only had it for a few days. I'm going to replace it with another router once I get it back, and we'll see if it's worth the $100.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have yet to find a good way to connect a VHS/VCD/HDD recorder to my TV.  I am disappointed with the purchase.  If you're willing to cut up a VCR and stick it in a VTR, then fine.   But I've seen no reliable way to make a connection between the VCR, the VTR or the VHS player. I tried to use the old fashioned method of screwing the cable from the VST to the VTM. The VTM seemed to work fine, and I used a VTC-50 receiver to hook it to the TV. But neither the VTV or the receiver seemed to be able to accept the VCD-receiver. My TV didn't display anything.  The VTR appeared to record fine. But I have to admit, I'm quite tired of all this hassle, so I won't be going back to this.  Instead, I'll stick with the Tandy DVD-3000 which is also able to connect to a VSC-50/VTC-60 VCR.  So, there really is no need for this product.  But if you're looking for something to do with your VCR (as opposed to the more "proper" way of hooking it to your TV) then I don't think you will be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to buy a replacement for the speaker on my new computer. It didn't sound very good and I wasn't too pleased with how it worked. They sent me a box with three boxes of new speakers and no instructions. I ended up returning it. The speakers looked OK in the box but I didn't like them, they were so small, very small, and they had little rubber pads for mounting them on my computer. So I returned it. That didn't help, the box was so small and the speaker was so hard to mount. I finally ended up with the same speaker, in the same box, but with slightly smaller speakers, and it worked like a charm. The price was reasonable and the sound was poor, but for $25 bucks, you can't beat it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We got it in last weekend. Had to do several calibrations and it didn't work. I returned it and got a second one from Amazon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this TV set to put in our guest bedroom and it was delivered, assembled and worked for about a week. Then I found that the set was not properly installed into our entertainment center. I called customer service and was told that if I wanted to change the TV I would have to take it to the store. They told me they would not be replacing the unit until they had had time to properly install it. I was not very happy with the whole thing. The first thing I needed to do was to remove the baseplate and the frame from the TV. The next thing was to buy all new screws. I also had to buy the rubber feet as well. The only way I was able to get this TV on the couch was to have it moved by the kids to a different location. It was an expensive way to do it and the result was the TV was not level. I could not even read the screen properly. All of this came out to be a big headache. I am not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that I had it installed by myself, that it was in our entertainment section and we only had one TV in there. The TV is very tall and very hard to put on the sofa. Also, there is a slight delay in the signal from the source to the receiver when you put the TV on your screen. This may also have something to do. Also I am quite disappointed that the unit shipped with the power cord on the wrong end. I will be returning the unit and I will probably purchase another one once I have had time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had this receiver for over 6 months and after buying two other receivers to make it seem less "special" (one of them lasted about two months!) I finally gave up.  I'm not a very good receiver user, but I have used it very sparingly over the last several months.  It was just starting to sound like an inferior receiver.   The sound from the TV was barely better than that from this receiver. This receiver was barely any better than the generic receivers I had bought a year or two earlier, and it had only two inputs (I had four of them installed).  It seemed to be the most "invaluable" feature that I had been buying with this receiver; the TV would only output one channel from this unit.  However, it still only had two inputs, and that meant I could only get the TV's input to work if I had multiple receivers installed.  In short, I couldn't even get a TV to record on it.  The picture quality was horrible, and the TV sounded like a cheapo.  This receiver is clearly not suited for my use. If you're looking for a good receiver, I recommend you go with the Marantz, Kenwood, or Denon models.  They're all better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is NO difference in the sound quality between the V-C and the original V-100. They just look the same 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for the very good reason that it does have an analog output, but it is not an accurate digital output. The only reason it is a good deal on eBay is because there are only 5 available options. That means there are not many to choose from. It also only has 2 audio outputs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit arrived with no instructions for the installation. I have ordered replacement cable and an additional unit. I am calling the customer service department because they have not contacted me to cancel the order. If they want to make a quick buck, they could at least email me to get the item and instructions. I will not pay $35 for this product and I am going to return the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The TV works fine for about 5 months. Now it's dead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very poor quality item. It is almost impossible to install. The video is very low quality, with no shadows or colors.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We've been using this product for over 5 years, and I still have it! And I don't know a single good reason to buy it, other than the fact that we just keep buying it. I wish they would just come out with a good, long lasting product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping to use this for my home theatre speakers, but the only thing that worked was the audio connection to my computer.   The connectors for the power line output had broken.  I'm still working on fixing the connection, but I would not recommend this device.  The sound was very distorted.  It did come with two adapters, but they were of bad quality.  They were not sturdy enough for my needs.  You would need to buy some kind of rubber enclosure for your unit.  Overall, it was not very usable.  Very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item and got it within two days. It worked fine until about a week ago, then it would not work. I called Tech Support and they said they would send it out in a week or so, but they never sent it out. I returned it to them, and it was shipped out within two weeks. After a few days, it broke. I contacted Amazon and they told me that my computer is not compatible with this item. I have a Mac, but I cannot install this product on my PC. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the 6-pin female to male adapter for my Dell computer, and the video was distorted, so I had to return it. I tried different video card adapters and adapters, nothing worked, not even a bad one. I was very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It will not be long before they have a "Made for Mac" version that supports USB 2.0 devices. Then you have to use the Apple USB Driver for Mac, which has a lot of bugs and crashes. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used the monitor for two years and never had any problems. I just returned it to the store to get a replacement. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a couple of these today. But the video does not work and I have no clue what is going wrong with the system. I am in Canada, but it is very hot out, so I am waiting for it to cool down before I do anything. The warranty was clearly marked that it is limited to 60 days on this product (no warranty on the other items), but as it is still only 60 days, I'm going to take a chance that it may still be working. I have already called customer service and they are going to send me another one of the same product (I'm just waiting for one of them to turn up). I haven't even had the chance to play my Blu-ray yet, and it already cost me over $80. I will write about the other problems when I see a difference, but not the fact that it isn't working. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The packaging is poor, the box is very heavy, and the USB cable is very thick.  The receiver itself, however, is great.  I don't know why the company is marketing this as a "pro-grade" receiver when the quality is so bad.  Maybe the "green" color scheme will give people some hope 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The remote was in working order but it would not turn on. I tried it on three different models and it was all three models with the same problem. I have a lot of different audio products and they all have the same problems. This remote is not an MP3 player and it should not be advertised as such 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this phone, and it does not have a camera. I have had it for almost a week, and am in the process of returning it. I paid $90 for it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The item did not arrive in the promised time period. And, I did not receive my order until after Christmas. After I contacted them and complained about this issue, they stated that they would ship the item out to me on January 8th. The item arrived on January 9th. I paid for the item. They do not offer refunds or exchanges, they did not even contact me with an estimated time of arrival. I returned the item and they never contacted me about my refund. I do not recommend purchasing any electronic device from them
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This is the worst computer i ever had. The computer didn't work. I called them and they told me it was the case with everyone else. They gave me a $35 coupon for a new computer. I was so frustrated, I dropped the computer in the trash and returned it. I returned and returned and still no refund. I went through a refund process with them and still nothing.I called both Microsoft and HP. There is nothing I can do, there is no customer support.I am very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the bad version. It is not clear if they have changed the internal battery voltage, the charger voltage or something else. Either way, it doesn't make any sense for a $30 product to only accept two voltages. I'd never buy this device again unless they had something to do with it. I am really disappointed in a good electronic device that has become so faulty. I would give this a one star rating if I could. The fact that it will only charge when the charger is plugged in also makes no sense. If you need more than six charges, buy a USB rechargeable battery. If it's only available in a couple of color options, go for the red color with the black cable. This is not a quality product from Apple, and I will not support it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The quality of this product is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor because the first one I ordered from Best Buy failed after about two months. But I am still waiting for it to arrive so that I can see exactly what I'm paying for and get a full refund. The only saving grace is that Best Buy had a 60% off sale this past weekend and I was able to take advantage of that sale. But the only way I will be able to keep this monitor is if Best Buy does not refund the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound card has no problem with it. It was very easy to install and it worked fine when I first tried it out. However, after about two months of being on my system, it began to make noise. I had to uninstall and reinstall the driver several times. After installing it several times and uninstalling it and installing it again, it finally worked. But after about a month or so, it wouldn't work for me. And then I started using Windows Media Player and the problem still exists 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works but is really annoying to use.  I thought it was a bad review but it was actually the best review 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Just don't get this! I would not recommend purchasing these if you don't need to, they are designed for storage of electronic media, not a portable device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used this device for many years now and have seen several generations of it.  They do not change with the times.  The most recent generation is not even the same model.  It is just a bad design and an unreliable device in my opinion.  If you like the old style of the Philips and other brands of electronics this is a great product, but if you want something reliable you will have to spend some money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed by the fact that there is not any information about the warranty or return for return/refund. However, I didn't have the money to buy an extended warranty for my electronic device. I could not return my electronic item. All I could do was exchange it, and I was unhappy with the exchange. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought the first two pairs of earbuds for my new Samsung Galaxy S5. The first pair of the earbud's broke within about a week of my using them. I returned the pair to Samsung and received replacements but it was still less than two months before I was able to use the earphones again.  I would have given them a higher rating if the first pair did not break within about two weeks and the second pair broke within several days.I was unable to get a replacement of the original earbudge's because Samsung no longer offers them.  So I will be looking for a replacement from someother source.  This was an absolute waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for an office computer, and it never worked. I returned it and got a new one, but still no success. The return policy states you will get a new unit, but it never arrived. I have the return address at my workplace, so I can't be held responsible, but I have returned a replacement unit. I'm looking for a decent computer case, not a piece of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would just rate the product as bad.  The product should be rated as good if you use it with an LCD display but the electronic device itself is very weak. I would give it a 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I gave this a negative rating because of my experience. I ordered it about a week ago and just got it today. I thought I ordered the wrong item and was expecting it sooner. I was very disappointed. I would have liked to get it in a timely manner. If you're looking for a good piece of gear, don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, the USB cable is not included, and you need to buy another, expensive USB cable to connect both devices. I tried it once, and it just didn't work. I returned it. I'm thinking of buying another, pricey cable, because I have a lot of other stuff on my computer that connects via USB, and I don't want to buy extra cables just to use the PC's own software to set up the ports.I wish it worked better.Also, the included software can be very slow, especially if you have a huge collection of files to transfer. I often have to quit it and wait for it to complete the transfer. That is a huge pain.The software can also be very unstable. I have not yet tried the latest version, but I know it's pretty much the same software as the previous versions.I recommend spending a couple of dollars more on a better USB cable for your PC, and just trying it out. I'll post my thoughts if you'd like me to.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, I must say I was a very pleased customer. I got my screen, monitor and mouse installed in about 3 hours. But the screen itself didn't work properly from the first use, and had to be returned. I did have to return the mouse as it was damaged, and the screen had to come in again from a local office. My problems continued for the next three days. They finally returned the screen and mouse on Saturday night. So I returned the monitor on Sunday morning, the only problem is that the monitor was not returned. So today, the monitor finally came in and I returned it, but had to return that mouse as well. I am a very disappointed customer.I have contacted Dell several times, and have never gotten a good response. I have tried to contact my credit card company as well, but have had no luck with a resolution.I am really disappointed, and I will not be recommending this product to anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is for those who are used to having good quality TV but with the  cheaper price point. It's not very well built, has only 2 HDMI inputs (2x2), and requires a lot of space for mounting.  I've seen people with larger TV's complain about it too.  Not a good idea

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There are a lot of reviews about this product. I read them but I just couldn't find one that had something positive to say about it.  After a bad experience with another electronic device I just got it. I have to say, I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this device thinking it was a good buy.  I ended up having to return it because I didn't like how loud it was.  The sound was better for my needs, so I returned it.  Then it started giving out on me.  All my accessories would not fit.  It even went out of battery one day.  My only good point about the device is that it has 4 AA batteries that fit inside.  If they were to be removed, they would have to be screwed to the underside of the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this product a while back, worked fine until I installed my new DVD drive. The DVD drive would not accept the video card. It would only work with the TV's. I returned the device, and the problems were repeated.  I returned this card again, and was able to use it for a while but soon found the TV problems. I sent the card back, and it works fine now, but I haven't had any problems since.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had two issues with my Mac Mini. One was that it would not install on my external CD drive. The other was that the Mac Mini would not start from a cold boot. These problems were solved by the purchase of a more expensive model. However, these problems occurred over and over and I eventually lost patience with this product. I returned it to the store and returned it again. I sent it back with the receipt attached. The second return was to Apple Store customer support. After that, it did not work. If I could not get the MacMini to work, I was not interested in trying to return this defective product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device will only work with computers. The CD itself will not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got my new HP printer, and the ink cartridge for it is horrible. So I ordered some new ink and it came, but the print quality was terrible. It only prints fine if you put lots of thin lines, but it is not easy to do that. If I wanted to print something small, it took a while to print anything at all, even at medium resolution. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these to use in my studio, but they only fit on a desk. I am very disappointed in these speakers. I have ordered the same speakers from the store twice and both times, they didn't fit on the desk and were too big to get near the speakers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It did not come with the battery. The instructions stated that you could simply buy the batteries from another source, but I couldn't find them. So I just ordered a couple and didn't realize that when I got it that the batteries came with the unit.  I have already spent at least 30 hours trying to figure out how to charge the unit and it just doesn't work. The instruction manual tells you to charge it with a laptop, but the laptop would not even charge it for several hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this set because it is advertised as a high quality set. However I've had to send mine back because it didn't come with the right type of screwdriver. I also noticed that this set doesn't come in the correct color.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this CD player about a year ago, and have not been able to use it since, to date. I have tried several different models, and they have all been less than reliable.  This one does not have any CD player controls on the back, only one on the front.  There is no instructions for how to install, or information about the CD software.  I'm afraid to recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two, and the first one died after a month or so of use. The other one was fine after two months but then died after 10 months. The price was reasonable at $45, but the service was awful. It took 2 days to ship, and then only 2 days of the 2nd day of shipping to return my unit. They only sent replacements, not replacements with a second return label. If you're going to pay over $100 for these, expect quality service, and decent packaging. The only reason I got one was because I had one in my closet and thought   I needed it. I should have checked it with a credit card first.

I have tried different methods and all of them have resulted in an error message and not working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I wanted to write a positive review about this electronic device. The sound was good, but the volume did not respond to my changing music selections. The unit could not be used on an airplane. I have had no problems with my other electronic device either.I gave it 4 stars because the electronic device does not sound great, but it is a good device to use for airplane travel.I would recommend this device only for those who want good quality sound.The device's price is reasonable, but not cheap.If you do not want to use the wireless device to travel with your CD player, then buy this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought a 2nd hand Acer for our son, but had to return it to the seller. He couldn't repair the problem, and then we had to buy a new one, and had to repeat the whole process.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really don't recommend this product as I have had many failures with it. I'm a novice on computers so I purchased it thinking it was the answer to my problems. It was not. I was in and out of my apartment with it every time I needed to use it.  I spent a total of 30 min in it. My wife had to come over and remove it from my apartment and put it on a shelf. I was not impressed with the instructions. It seems that every single time I have an issue I have to take it apart and figure out how to put it back together. You are supposed to set it up and have it automatically detect the hard drive. When I would use it I would get the prompt from the computer to "Restore from DVD". When that would fail, I would have to have my laptop sit in bed and it would reset every time. There was no manual for it. No help book. The box itself is a huge pain in the ass. My laptop has a really good screen and I have a very heavy keyboard. With the laptop and the keyboard on my lap, it is almost impossible to use this thing. If you want a cheap device that does what it is supposed to, this is not it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would not trust this product to do what it is supposed to do, it would seem to me that it would have trouble communicating if the other device is powered on. The only thing it is good for is the fact that it seems to be waterproof and that I would never even try to use it in a rain shower. I would just go for the wireless product instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to disagree. I installed this on my Macbook Pro to test the function and it is fine as I expected. However I am now in the process of replacing this and this is the reason I was giving it a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They did a great job for the first 2 days but they didn't even know the battery was dead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two and had them shipped within three weeks, but they arrived dead. When I called their customer service, they couldn't offer a good explanation of how it happened. I called return and refund and they told me that they would send it again. Three weeks later, they still could not provide a good reason. I am not sure that they are capable of providing quality service. I would not recommend them. I also found that I paid extra for the two sets of cables because they did not fit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this to play my computer sound, and it is working fine, but that is about it. The sound is horrible. I called the customer service, and they told me it is normal for electronic items to wear out, and to be replaced after a certain period.  I am returning this bad electronic item to my local electronic store.  They have other similar products, and no doubt they have better sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am looking for something with good quality sound. I am a complete novice to audio. The price of this product is just a little high compared to the other speakers I have in my house. I have looked at other speakers and they have sound just fine, but are just as expensive. I don't recommend this speaker for a beginner to audio, but for anyone looking for the best sound.

Unfortunately, the warranty was not extended for this purchase. After 6 months  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this speaker on sale. When I first plugged it in, I thought it was on, but it wasn't. I would not recommend this for anyone who has trouble hearing their speakers properly (no one can). I thought I might get some good sound out of it for the first few weeks, but the quality quickly diminished to the point where I had to stop buying these. They were not worth the money I was spending, and the company didn't offer a return policy to remedy my mistake. I should have gotten a second pair, but I would never buy from this company again. The speakers were not even defective, they just failed to fulfill the advertised specifications. I was able to replace them, and they sounded fine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The connection works okay, but the cable does not keep its shape properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing I can say about it is it is not that nice. It feels flimsy and doesn't feel very strong. The only good thing about it I can think of is that it is waterproof. If you don't do anything on it, you have to take the unit out of the package to get it wet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this radio about a week before it was supposed to arrive. It did arrive, but there was no manual to tell you how to activate.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would not recommend this product, because it is too weak and cannot support my large monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this in April, and it arrived in less than a week. However, I received a defective model with poor sound. I returned the defective unit, and sent in another defective unit that arrived in just under two weeks. In total, this was just over 2 months.I received a replacement unit with the same problem. I then contacted Apple customer support and was told the unit was defective, and to ship the defective replacement unit to me for free.After a year of waiting, I still have not received my replacement device. I have sent the defective model in several times. This is frustrating because I have to take the time to return the defective units, which can add time to the return process. Apple is just trying to cover themselves. It's not like I needed new hardware. The unit was fine when I first purchased it, and I had no problems with it.The return process should not take so long because I already took the trouble to return defective units. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to send the unit back to Amazon for a refund because the device was not able to communicate with the receiver. I sent back a refund.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst case scenario.   I put this unit on my computer.  The sound quality is the same as when I used a Yamaha receiver, and the volume is so much lower.  I am now putting the receiver into a separate desktop computer and it sounds much better.  It does not come with a mic, it has a built-in speaker, but this combination makes it worse 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered it for the purpose of connecting to my DVD-RW drive. I was able to connect only by using the supplied HDMI adapter.

I am very disappointed with this purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This receiver is not designed for use in a portable, so if you have one or more iPod's, the receiver will not work, and it is useless for the 2nd or 3rd channel of your home stereo system.  The receiver's sound quality deteriorates after several hours in the car.  It seems to be able to hold up under extreme temperatures, but it is a flimsy unit that will rust very quickly.  If you are thinking about purchasing this product, then look at a good quality model like the one from AudioQuest, or an inexpensive receiver from one of the companies that sells iPod receivers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this to put an Epson inkjet printer on my scanner. However, I couldn't get it to print out correctly. It printed a bit but the image wasn't clear. I sent it back and they got it corrected. I also sent it to them and they took some time to fix it. The scan was fine. I'm sorry, but I couldn´t use it with my scanner! I ended up returning it to Ebay with no refund because I'm not happy. I didn't even like the look of the printer so I ended it up.

I was also very disappointed with the "refurbished" price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought I would try out a different brand. When I received my order, I thought it was because I didn't order right. But, I contacted support and they told me that I needed to order one of the first ones, so I ordered it. But when I started using it, it wouldn't charge my phone, so when I called support, they couldn't help. So, I called Apple and they said I needed a new phone. I have the same problem, so this is the only brand that works for me, but I have to return the phone because they are not giving me the solution.

I called Bose and they told me to return it to them. So I did. However, I will never buy another Bose product. I got a great price, but I would not recommend these products to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I returned mine, because it didn't work. The customer service agent did not know how to tell the customer that it worked, and then he came back to me, told me I had to return it, and said he would email a new part to me.  If I would have stayed and dealt with this issue, I would not have received my money back from him.  I got only one return email, and I am not going to send another e-mail 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Had to buy a new CRT screen for my TV. Not a good idea at all. I would have been much better off buying the TV with the original CRT and cutting out all the unnecessary electronics. I am glad I didn't pay for the LCD screen. If I could have had it any cheaper I probably would have. I was expecting to see the TV come with the LCD panel already installed.I am going to return it and get the LCD installed in my own TV. That way I don't have to deal with the unnecessary wiring that was included with the screen 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this as a gift, and it is not even usable. I have had this on my PC for 3 months and it still has not worked properly. The unit will not boot, I have to connect the unit through another machine. I sent a RMA to Epson, and will have to wait a couple of weeks before I get my money back

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two of these speakers, one for my wife's TV and one for the TV I keep in the living room. These speakers look great, sound great, but when I plug them in to the TV, my TV speakers get really loud. I have had them in for about two weeks, and they have not improved. I just bought two new sets of speakers for my TV and sound system, and the speakers for the tv are getting really loud, but these are not doing any better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They are hard to install, the screws are too long, and the screws on the rear of the unit don't fit flush. So the screws just rub against the back panel of the screen, which doesn't look good. And, they don't come with the case, which is a huge waste of money.  I ended up ordering a replacement and they shipped it within 5 days. But the replacement came with a different case, not the one I was expecting. So I ended getting another replacement. The screen isn't as bright as the factory one. The viewing angles are horrible, and you have to move the screen forward and back to get a good view. Plus, they charge you extra for it.I don't see how this is going to be good for the environment as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just got my new eos 20d wireless and it works great for a short period, then it starts to cut in and out intermittently. I have to unplug the unit every 30 minutes or so.   It is so difficult to use, and is so unreliable. I cannot understand why this product is made. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took a lot longer than expected for it to show up. When it finally did, I opened it to find a broken screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is nothing worse than having to listen to crappy music over and over again. You can listen to it if you like but for me, that's it. I have had this unit for a couple of months and so far it's only on for a few minutes before it fails. If this continues I'll be canceling my order 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We purchased 4 of these units, and I got about 3 months of service from the first one, and about 4 months from the 2nd unit. No problems. All the units worked fine at about a month. This year, we have ordered 10 more units and will most likely have to return the first three units. The units were so cheap, I was tempted to buy them, but the prices kept dropping. The second unit I ordered, was sent with the wrong color, and the shipping was very slow. The third unit, was delivered, and worked great until it had to be returned. I did get the fourth unit, but it is now returned, and has had many problems with the last one. All these units are returned, with no return label. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this device and it worked fine, but after just a few weeks it stopped working. Not because I didn't follow directions, but because the battery couldn't hold any more charge. After many weeks of calling and e-mailing Apple I was told to return the item, I was given a credit for the device and the return fee.  I returned the device, but now I can't even get it to work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this for my daughter's first electronic device (USB to VGA adapter) and it is the least secure product I've ever seen. The whole thing came with the unit. She's never had it on her, so she can't give a positive review about it. I don't know what happened, but it was the very last unit they had left in the store, so no other units would be available for purchase. I was very disappointed when I got it. This is a very weak USB device. I'm going to return it, even though it was a good price for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the monitor and was extremely disappointed when it arrived. It was wrapped in packing tape, and there was no instruction manual. The monitor was mounted using the mounting screws.The monitor was very unstable. I couldn't move it in any direction.It was difficult to turn it up in brightness level. The mounting holes were too small.The plastic backing panel was loose and warped. I was able to remove it by carefully pulling it away from the monitor.The screen was covered in dust.I ended up having to take it back to the store to return it. I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    We have had a bad experience with this brand of adapter since the day we bought it. I have tried several other brands of adapters.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This receiver only works on the Tv and not the Satellite tuner. It's so easy to lose the satellite tuner when you use this one. This receiver's receiver only comes with a satellite tunable receiver. I have been searching for a good receiver for months without success. The Tv's are good but have a slight loss of reception. This one has none of those problems. However, this receiver is so small, you can't really use it on your TV. You have to buy a TV and then mount it on a stand, and that is a big pain. If you can get a decent TV, you will probably need a receiver for both the Tvd and Sd, and have to mount your receiver in another room where it will be out of the way and you won't lose any reception. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only bad thing about this TV is that you have to buy two adapters to plug it in. You have to go to Best Buy and buy two of the most expensive cables. I would avoid this TV unless you want to spend alot on a TV
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a Sony digital TV and did not like the picture on the Sony set. I was having problems with the receiver and decided to get the receiver in store. When I got home from the store, I saw my Sony TV had been returned. I contacted a store employee and was told that there was no issue with the Sony receiver.The problem was with the set. So I returned it and was charged $150.00 to return it.So I will not be purchasing Sony TV in the future 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace a hard drive on my desktop PC. It was defective. I returned it to Amazon and they gave me a $50 credit to exchange it for a new hard drive. So I guess I wasted my money. If you want to have your computer working the next day, buy an external drive instead of buying the unit from Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't understand why the company is charging such a high price for an electronic device that is virtually useless for most users.  I've been using this electronic device for the past 5 years or more without any problems, and all my neighbors have been using it for years as well.  It is very heavy, and is so big that my wife would never fit in it, but I can never convince her to get rid of it, since I buy her every electronic device she wants.  The only people I've seen using it in the past year is my husband and I.  Even though we've had to use our own power adapters and cords to hook it up, the devices are still not working properly.  We both use the "Easy Connect" system on the outside of the unit to connect to our computers, which also does not work correctly.  They're either not connected to the unit, or they're not plugged into anything.  If I'm to be honest, we have to resort to taking the unit apart to get it to work.  With this product, I could probably take it apart for an hour and not lose any equipment.  However, the unit is a pain in the ass to take apart, and I can't blame them for charging this much money for an item that is essentially useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this monitor from Walmart online. It arrived yesterday and the picture looked good, but not good enough to use the monitor for my needs. When I received it I noticed that there was a lot of dust on the picture. The only way that I can see the dust is from inside the monitor.  I would recommend the monitor not being used if you have allergies or are sensitive to dust or dirt.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was about to buy this item but did not have the money in the budget, so I bought an other device. When I returned from the store, I found out that it is not compatible with any of my wireless devices. I tried a few times and then called customer support. It is not a good electronic device, there is no warranty or support. I have returned it to the store. I am very disappointed, I can't recommend it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, the product description is inaccurate. The device works in my computer as described. However, when I try to connect the device to the computer, it says it is not compatible with my OS. It is impossible to get the device, even after I reboot the computer several times. I've tried with different versions of Windows, but no luck. This device is not worth my money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to order several cables for this device and they came at least a week late. Not to mention that I had just received my computer and I don't have a router yet. I'm not sure if I'm going to pay $15 for the cables if I have to order them separately from Amazon or wait for Amazon to send them. I know that it can be used to connect to a computer network, but it's not the most user-friendly solution 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this to replace the older, inferior monitor. Great idea, but monitor wasn't the problem. No picture quality at all. I got it installed yesterday. It's not working right, and I have no way to return the unit.

I called both the dealer and the dealer's customer service and they were unable to help me.I have had to return the speakers which they sent me. I will not order from you again.I hope I don't have to return any more speakers as well. I would never buy anything from you ever again
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We spent thousands of dollars upgrading the sound system and speakers to get better sound for a party.  The sound card was not reliable.  When the sound card failed and the party was over we had to go with a different sound card.  No one was able to install our audio card. It was stuck on "error".  We ended up hiring a professional to install the new sound card, but the card was only usable for a few hours.  After two days it quit working completely.  This is one of the worst products we have ever purchased.  We are only giving it a 2 star review because we had no idea there would be a problem with this unit.  It is so bad it was almost impossible to install 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with the product I received. I ordered it online from China and it was shipped to my office.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I paid about $200 for the printer, but it would not print. I sent it back for a refund, but they never sent it. I emailed support, and they told me to come back next day. Then they tell me to call them.  I did call, but the answer was "Sorry, we've sent it to our printer." I called a second time and they said that it has been delivered to their printer, so I called them back.  They said to call the UPS man at that time. I called another time, and he said that they will get it to you that night or early the next morning.  Then I called the UPS Man, and that's when I found out that it had not been sent. I was extremely upset about this. So I called, and I was able to talk to a person at the call center, who was very apologetic, but couldn't be reached at the UPS location. They offered me a $10 credit.  So, I called back the next day, and the same thing happened. The support didn't seem to understand what I was talking about, and said to "talk to the UPS person."  No, you have to talk directly to them, and it's all over.  It's just very frustrating. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this set thinking it would be easy to connect the cables to my TV, but it was extremely difficult. I tried to return it as soon as I got it but it would not. I eventually just ended up using an HDMI extender to connect to my computer. I still have the cable, but this is definitely not a set that I would buy again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping for better performance, but I would be much happier with another device, not this one.

If you want to buy this one, you will be disappointed with the performance 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am extremely disappointed with this device.  I purchased the same item from B&H and was completely satisfied.  But, when I opened the package, the item was very dirty and I could not believe the quality of the item I was receiving.  So, I sent it back to B&h.  However, after sending them a new sample, I received the same same issue.   After sending them back a second time, I still have not received my item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using the  Dell Latitude E6430 for the past 5 years and it has performed about the same as the Dell XPS 13. The Latitude is more stable and has a better display and has more power.  I did buy a new monitor and new USB port from Dell to get a better image on the monitor but nothing was done about the stability issue. The display does not seem to have the highest resolution so resolution will be decreased and the picture quality of the screen will go down.  Dell should take this matter seriously and have a new image resolution setting for the laptop 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my laptop and it does nothing. I have tried the whole range of adapters and nothing worked. If this is all about image quality and performance, it isn't really suitable for my need 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this unit for a good while. I bought one in each of my two households. They all worked fine for one week. Then one night I switched them back to the old mode. I had to go through the trouble of replacing them all again. I gave up on that one night. No problem for them, but I had no luck with mine. They were the same for three days. It was the same every time. I got tired of the whole process. I took a chance on a new one from Amazon, and that worked fine. But that's the only one I had for over a month. I ended up buying one of those bad-looking ones from my nephew. So I just stopped using it. I was planning to buy another one, but then I remembered the one I already had. I didn't think I could go through another hassle.So that's it for me. I hope this will help others, who are suffering the same problems, to avoid this whole fiasco 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this speaker and it works fine, but it will crackle for 2 to 3 seconds, every time it changes to the next song. I've tried using a different TV tuner for a different source, but no matter what I do, the crackle continues. The speaker is also very heavy, it's very easy to slide off the table when you're doing anything else. I hope that someone will fix these issues for me before I decide to return this item. I have tried calling customer service for a refund, but they don't seem to be able to answer the phone. I thought I was getting a good value for the money, but I'm not happy with the speaker. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using it for a long time and I don't see a good reason why this is being discontinued.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is nothing wrong with these but I thought about it a lot before making my purchase.

This is a problem that I have always faced with ASUS products, and I am always hesitant to buy from them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the monitor and it arrived, but when I opened the packaging and plugged it in, it turned off. It took me about 5 hours to figure out that the VESA mount is very difficult to install, and that the monitor is not compatible with VESA V3. I returned the monitor, and I'm planning on returning it for a new one that has much better mounting options and a better electronic component. I did return it because of mounting issues, but I do not recommend purchasing anything without the support of their support and warranty. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have bought these monitors for years and this is the first one that will not turn on. The other monitor was okay but this one has been totally useless. I guess I should have been more patient in paying a higher price for this monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with this purchase.  The only good thing about it is the fact that it came with a case, but you still have to have a good monitor (or TV) to display the images on the LCD screen. I bought it for a new computer and it wouldn't even show the monitor. It would only go in portrait mode, and in this mode it was very difficult to see the images. This monitor is not even compatible with the Dell Ultrabook that I'm currently using.  In short, it sucks!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We bought this to make an audio splitter. The splitter worked fine when used on the speakers but the audio turned out to be distorted when played through this device. I called the support and they could not fix the problem. I returned it. We bought two other models and they did the same thing. There is nothing wrong with these products. They are great quality and easy to install but the problem with the audio was caused by the cables and not the splitter itself. There was no way to fix it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the receiver and it came with an extension cord, but I didn't install it because I didn.t know where to connect it. I went back to eBay and bought another extension cord to connect. After installing it, I was only able to receive a few channels.The unit worked fine on my TV. The receiver came with a DVD player.The receiver works fine on the Xbox, but you need to have Xbox Live Gold to use the receiver. I bought another Xbox 360 and did not use it. It worked fine after I removed the receiver, but there was no difference on TV. It was a good idea to buy Xbox 360 when I bought it, but it's not an easy option to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had one of these in a PC build, and it worked out great, but when I moved to another computer (an x64 server) it broke within a few hours.  I thought it was a bad case, but it was just that it was made of plastic and would get hot.  This computer was not much smaller and was made with aluminum for more heat dissipation, but I still lost a good 4 hours a day building it.  After that, I just put a rubber band in and that solved the problem.  The problem is that this plastic case is expensive for a good reason, and I would never buy one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first heard about it I was thinking about my bad CD player but I was too cheap to buy a CD player that could support the sound. And, this product was too small for the sound to come through. I bought one because I thought that it was a good idea to try it. I was hoping that it would work. But after only one listen I realized that it does not have good sound. I don't even want to listen to it. It is too expensive and I don`t feel it is worth $100

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this to replace my existing keyboard and mouse. When it arrived, it was very stiff, barely pressed onto the keyboard, and the mouse wasn't even close to being able to click on it. I tried several times to use my PC and my wireless cards and the same results. After spending hours on this product and a few others, I finally gave up on it and ordered an actual keyboard. I did not even have a mouse with me when I was leaving for work. I was so disappointed with the product and the customer service that I returned it to the store to refund it. There was no information on the back of the box on the warranty or any warnings about this problem, it's a very basic product and I would have no reason to ever buy it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my wife, but she didn't like it at all.  I am pretty disappointed with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the product in less than 5 days and when it came, it was wrapped in bubble wrap. It was so bad, I asked to return it and get a refund. But, they refused. They are not concerned about the price because their customers are not.  The whole company is very unprofessional. The packaging was so terrible I wouldn't even be able to open it.  They should be ashamed.  I would not recommend this item to anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the monitor in October, and it arrived on November 27. The monitors arrived damaged. I received the monitor a few days later, and installed it on an HP server. I have only had it running for a couple of weeks, and already the left side has started to flicker. There is also a noticeable distortion effect at a certain distance away. It is very obvious when the monitor is near my computer. The whole setup has now become a complete nightmare. I called HP support to see if they would exchange the defective monitors for another pair, but they are not accepting new replacement units. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm extremely disappointed with the way it performs. I did not buy the unit to use it as a PC/Mac/LAN card replacement. Instead, I purchased it to use in a Windows XP PC to add a monitor, and to do some file transfer.  I also tried to use the card as a replacement for the DVD recorder that comes with the computer. The card is of poor quality, so I decided to discard the recorder. So far, I have not used the card for anything.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this speaker because it was a little too large for me. However, I have it mounted behind the TV and sound is very tinny. It sounds like there is a big hole in the space between the speakers. So I ended up with this speaker mounted behind my TV. However it does not even come close to matching the sound quality of the sound from the TV. It is very loud and has lots of distortion, but it is not even close to the sound in my room from the speaker. It was made by Pioneer, but the quality of its sound was not the greatest. I returned it and ordered the same speaker from Ebay, and it works perfect. You can not go wrong with either of those speakers.

I also read a lot about this player and have heard many positive reviews on various websites about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The monitor is terrible. It looks great in the picture and the picture is not even a good quality. I gave the monitor a 2 star review, because it is not that it is bad, but the picture quality is not as good as some of the others, it is just not the monitor I expected to see and expected to receive from Dell 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have owned a Pioneer stereo system for 35 years. It was so much fun to listen to music on the radio. Then I bought a digital audio system and never used the radio again. After this purchase I haven't touched a CD player in 15 years. Then came the Xonar 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this unit to replace my samsung camry camper, it has not worked in two weeks. The warranty is only good for 90 days, so it seems the camry is the problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these and had to return them, because the earbuds were defective. I'm going to return these because of the fact they are not as strong as others, and also they don't have good battery life. I'll probably try a different brand out there, because of that the price seems a bit high for what they are 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Had to get it replaced yesterday. Now it shows the screen is cracked. I went on line today to get a replacement, and was charged about $40 for the same replacement.I will get another one and send it back to get this fixed. But, it seems my computer's only protection against crack is my hard drive, so I will have to replace the motherboard and hard drive for $50+ I've had to replace a couple of times in the past.I don't recommend this item for anyone. I wish I would have bought from another vendor.The price seems to be going up each month, and the warranty is only 2 years. I'm still waiting on my replacement. I also am not happy with how this computer was built. I understand there was a problem with the motherboard, but if it was so bad that they need a new motherboard, why didn't they just send an old one to us instead of re-buying it and having us pay the shipping fees? 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device is advertised as being very easy to set up but the installation instructions don't mention anything about selecting the correct audio output device or USB device. I've read the directions but have yet to try the device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is too slow and the signal does not work very well. If you do not need 4 channels and you only need stereo audio, then this would be a good choice. However, if you want to listen to stereo, and you want a very portable set up, then there are much better choices that are much less expensive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Samsung Smart TV about 3 years ago and it has done nothing to improve it's picture quality. The Smart TV only uses the picture mode which causes the picture to go out of focus and the picture on the screen turns fuzzy.  So I went to a local store and bought a new TV, and now I find out that Samsung was sending out refurbished TV's and they did not have any picture mode that would improve the picture quality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very skeptical about purchasing a $30 wireless router, thinking it was just for high speed Internet.  I am now very disappointed with the wireless performance.  The quality is poor, and it seems to be working with a lot of noise.   It is a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They work well, but the screen seems flimsy to me. I was planning to buy them, but it looks like the prices are just going to keep going up. Not to mention the shipping costs on these are insane. If this is the way they're marketing these, then I'm pretty much out of business

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this CD with hopes it would help my CD player. Well it never did. I returned it to the store, got it back and returned it again. Still nothing. I was so frustrated I called the company and they did not return my call. They also did not offer a replacement. I decided to return it and buy a CD player from another store. It would work better. It did. Now it is broken and the CD drive is not moving. I called them again to give it to them. They still did not take it. My credit card is not covered because they are making a bad mistake and they have yet to apologize for the poor quality of the product.I had bought 5 or 6 CD's from this company in the past and they always sent me the same ones. I will never buy from them again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was defective, was sent in to my home with no instructions and no guarantee it would work. However, after two days my wife had the unit running and all functions were working. However after a week the unit did not work, all functions could not be activated. Customer service was non-existent.  I emailed them again with a photo of the unit and I was told they were shipping a replacement unit and would send me a receipt. I received the replacement unit in less than a week but then another one failed. I returned both units and was told I had to return the defective one to get a refund. No explanation as to how they could not find it and how that made a difference in my warranty?  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really expecting much better performance from a higher end piece of equipment than a basic USB device. I am disappointed, but I have not had any problems with my laptop yet. This is my first time buying something like this. I hope that the quality is consistent and that we can expect better than this from the rest of these products. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It only works when plugged in and in a room. If you turn on the TV or put on some music the device is useless. I tried plugging it in and out multiple times to make it work but it never did. If this is a serious product  I would give it a bad review and return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It was a pain in the ass to use. It was only available on 2 computer systems. If you are just looking to get some music or movies to play on your computer you should really look elsewhere. I have a good sound card with an ethernet port and it works fine. I ended up paying $500.00 for the adapter that came with my motherboard. If I needed any more functionality I would have been better off buying a dvb box or something similar and spending the extra money. That said, the adapter is just that, an adapter. I don't think I would buy a different product from this manufacturer ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I gave it a fair amount of time before I returned it and I have already used all that time to find out that the unit does not even fit the case.I'm not going to waste more money on something that is clearly not a good purchase for those who want to save money on wireless networking.I'd give it one more chance if they sent a new case. I have a smaller case, but if it does not fit the larger case, I'm done.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The picture on the web page shows it with a black wire, but it doesn't look that way in real life. I would say, the price was good, but the color of the wire is way too dark. I'd prefer a more pleasant color, like cream or something like that. It would also look much better with a good case

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried this adapter on three computers and it didn't fit. I had to go through and remove the case to get it to fit. So it's not worth the money, but I'm just glad I didn't get a chance to try it out before buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I first got this device I ordered a new one. It was for my daughter, not for me. I then thought it would be OK to order two. I have yet to get any electronic device. I ordered two more, for a total of 6. So now I have 4.  I have tried them out on the same computer.  They work fine.  However, there is a problem with the display.  The black is so dark that I can not see anything.  It looks like the screen is broken. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received one of these in the mail a few weeks ago.  The quality of the case was awful, the latch was broken, and the box had holes in it, so I returned it and ordered a new one.  A couple weeks ago it arrived.  I opened it and it had scratches all over the box and on the inside of the packaging.  It was so ugly and scratched that I was afraid I would have to return it.  That was after I had already spent $300 on a different case.  This product was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very impressed with the product, until one day it stopped working. The manual had to be downloaded and printed, and then I found out it was only for the "older" computers. No one knew where to buy it, and all I could find was a used unit on Ebay. I was a little disappointed, but was very thankful that it worked so well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just received my PDA. I thought I was getting a good deal on a good electronic device.  I tried to turn the dial with my thumb. And the cursor was jumping from one position to another. I called tech support. I also posted my problems with tech support on the Internet. But they only want to help the person who bought the unit.  The unit was delivered.  But the unit does not work. It is only working after I turn the unit off.  This is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It doesn't work with any PC/Mac. It's cheap, the connectors are too far apart, and the computer needs an external monitor to be able to use it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping for something good and compact, but it was just a regular sized USB-to-VHS-R adapter, with no support for USB drives or the like. I bought this unit for the 2.1 audio connection, and it worked fine. But then I bought the VHS-C, and found that it doesn't work that well with this adapter. So I returned it and picked up the normal adapter. But the problem is the same.  This product just doesn't give you much functionality.  I would just consider returning it, as I have, but the price was just too much for me 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just returned from a Christmas trip and found my TV set on, but there was no way to turn off the power. It needed to be charged while in a hotel. I called the company and they gave me no advice. I thought this was ridiculous. I contacted customer service again and they told me it would take about a week to get it fixed. I'm calling to make them apologize, not because I'm an idiot.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This USB port is so cheaply made that it seems I have to take it in my hand to feel it. Buttons and connectors bend, but the port itself is not waterproof. I would rather have a USB cable, but this is the price for this USB port 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price seems very high for a product of this quality.  There are not many cases for this size, and they cost twice as much.  The included instructions are very basic and not helpful for anything more than moving around the case.  All in all, I found the unit to be of little use.  I found that if I removed the front panel and installed a standard DVD tray, the display worked fine.  This is the same result as with the case installed.  Not an optimal setup for me. The bottom of the DVD tray slides in easily, so I don't have to worry about losing any discs.  However, I can only watch a few minutes at a time and have to wait for the disc to eject before I can start a new movie.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had an issue where the usb ports on both the laptop and the computer wouldn't work. I sent in a replacement. The replacement worked just fine for about a week. After that it stopped working again.  I finally had to return it.  The replacement came with the same problem.   They could've easily replaced the entire laptop with a USB hub. Instead they sent me two USB hubs, none of which worked. The only USB port on the laptop worked. I returned both.  If you don't want to have to return your laptop you may want to stay away from these products

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this, with good reason, because it did not have the battery level display feature, and it was very difficult to set up and calibrate it. It also did not work on Mac computers.I returned it because the batteries only lasted about half the time they should have. They were very unreliable. The display, although good, was very fuzzy. And it was not particularly easy to calibrate.I would like to return it and purchase the "pro" version, which has more features that I was expecting, but I am disappointed that it was the only option. I have already sent it back to eBay

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this for my TV and it works fine on my Sony TV but when I moved it to my Samsung I had to use the HDMI to HDMI cable to connect both TVs. I have seen many reviews saying that this cable will work with both TVs, however the cable I bought does not come with any plugs. I ordered the cable with the plugs and was able to connect the two TVs but it is not compatible with the Sony TV. I ended up buying one with the HDMI port and one without the HDMI. This may not be an issue for you as you only have one TV to connect and this does come with the ports. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The picture and the product picture do not correspond with each other. The picture on the picture tag is bigger and on the back of the product it says "Made in China".  I received the device as a gift and it's so bad that I can't take it out of my case.  I hope the company will take this up so that the product is of good quality and can be purchased at a reasonable price."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was so hopeful when I ordered that I thought they would be the best, but unfortunately, they were not.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product came only as an adhesive card, and I couldn't get it to stay on a magnet.  I had to tape over the top of it before it would stick to the magnet. I found that I could only get it on the front of the case with the adhesive card.  If you don't stick to anything you can't really use it.  It took me quite a while to try it, but the product itself was poorly made.  The card itself could not hold onto the magnet on a large magnet. If you do get it in place with the card, then it can work if the magnet is small enough.  In most cases I found it stuck on to a magnet at least 4 inches away from the case, which means that you'd need to find a larger magnet that could accommodate it and move it around.  You'd have to be careful where you move it as you would with any adhesive card or foam.  Then you have to find some places to stick it. And then you have a tough time making the card stick to your case.  But after trying it, it doesn't seem to work.  Even when it's sticky, it's very hard to get it where you need it to be

So I guess he's got some sort of problem with it. I would like to know how many people it's working with. If we used it all three times, we would have wasted our money.�

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this on sale for $24.99 and I used it only two times.  I didn't like it at all, but I bought it anyway.  After just one use, I knew it was defective.  So I sent it back to Amazon.  That cost me $35.00.  Amazon doesn't refund the cost of shipping so I had to pay another $10.00 for shipping to return it to Amazon and that cost me another $25.00   Amazon would not accept any returns on defective items.  But I still had to do the expensive return shipping because I was trying to return something  that was defective 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, they were very small, but not in a good way. The light would flicker on and off.  Second, it took a very long time to turn off, and you had to use your fingers to stop the light from flicker after that. I ended up going back to my more familiar red light bulbs. I bought a lot of those because the cheap bulbs were about 5 bucks apiece. They came with the right connector, and I wasn't disappointed in the look, although they were small and easy to misplace. I tried them with the "low profile" connectors and the bulb would stick out of the connector almost twice as far, making it impossible to keep it near your lamp.  The only positive aspect is the lights are bright enough to read by and you can dim them up, but the wires are too short to run under the arm of your bed.  This light is way to expensive for the results you get.  I am glad I went with some of the more expensive bulbs, but there are better choices out there 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor with the intention of using it for a photo shoot. The display quality is great, the only thing is that it is not bright enough. I think the screen is too dim. I bought a light-table to compensate for this, but the monitor is still too dim for my taste. If you are going to use this monitor for a long time or you have very sensitive eyes, then it might be for you. However, if you want to use the monitor for photo shoots, then you must buy something that is bright and brighter than this display 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When you first get it, it is very bright and easy to install. It does work.

The box was in the mail for about 6 days. I called the company and the technician I spoke to was not able to fix the device because it was not compatible with his device. He suggested that I contact Sears to order the item. I contacted Sears and they sent a replacement device and they did not send instructions with the replacement. I sent it back and tried it again with the technician. He was able to repair the device and sent instructions with it. The device was still not compatible and he was not willing to repair my device. I am extremely disappointed. The customer service representative said the product had nothing to do with Sears.I contacted Sears directly. I was told they had no information for me on the issue and I had to contact the company on my own. They did not even give me a chance to return the item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD was very dirty when I received it. The picture quality was also horrible. No color, no contrast, etc. I tried to use it for a few pictures, and it was simply unreadable. The unit is basically unusable. I have used many brand new LCDs in the past, and they never look like this. You will never be able to read the image in this unit.It does come with a cleaning cloth, so this is the only positive thing I can say about this purchase. However, I have had this LCD for about one month, and I am starting to feel like I will never use it again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit thinking that I could hook up my Sony TV to the unit and control the volume of the TV.  Unfortunately, this unit did not come with a stereo receiver cable.  I called the sales person and he told me that I would have to purchase one.  So, I did.  Then, as I was setting up my unit, the TV went into a strange, silent mode.  The volume was completely off and I couldn't find any control buttons on the unit.  Finally, I was able to change the volume and the TV was back to normal.  In addition, I found that the TV could not record the program.  No matter how long I held down the menu button, the program would play, but I couldn not record it!   Finally I received a replacement unit and it worked fine.  There was a noticeable difference in volume from the original unit. I'm just glad that I didn't buy the optional cable. This unit will not record your program, no matter what you do.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased two of these from Amazon.com and they are not as good as advertised. I have had them on my desk for two months, and I still cannot get my workstation to operate on the Ethernet. I've returned them to Amazon. I would recommend against purchasing these for the price you have to pay at the Amazon.Com website. You are probably paying about $40 dollars for these. There are two problems:  First, they are difficult to install and difficult to use. I got them installed on my two work stations, and they did not work properly at all. They only worked in one of the work stations and worked fine when connected to another workstation in the other room. I had to change to an Ethernet cable in the room to have these work.  Second, the quality of these is not great. The audio output was not very good.  I wish these had a great sound output, as they sound pretty good, but the audio output is not good.

Very difficult to find on Amazon, so I ordered it at a Best Buy in Pennsylvania. I called Amazon customer support and they said it is not a part of the warranty. I didn't buy the defective product and return it. If this product is not part of your warranty then why are you making it a limited warranty?

It's now 3 weeks since I got it and I still have not received the replacement device.  Don't bother with this device, you'll only be disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing that the USB dongle is good for is turning off your computer. If you don't use that many programs, you may be better off with an internal USB hub. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thinking that it would come with USB connectors, which would allow it to be plugged into my laptop's optical drive. Instead, the USB connectors only connect to the rear of the case. The optical drive is only slightly smaller, so it was barely possible to mount it to the case with the included Velcro. I was quite disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not entirely sure about this one. I bought mine as soon as it was available. Unfortunately I didn't wait to see if it would come in a different color. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   For $12.95, this has little to offer other than a black background and some sounds that are not too interesting. It's not as cheap as the others, so I am not so surprised. You are getting a lot less features from these, and some of them look very generic. Not only that, but this is very heavy, which is the worst way to go 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device and it did not fit my laptop. It also came with no warranty. I called the local store in my city to ask them to mail me a replacement. They did not do so and it was returned to me. I have to return it as well as get another one from Amazon, even though I'm not a Prime member

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First it started making a strange buzzing sound that was only audible outdoors. Then it just didn't turn on anymore. I replaced it, and now it's making even less noise. I'm pretty sure the batteries are dead, but even if they are not, they should have at least been able to survive the first six months of my use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got the Sennheiser IE2 for my wife for Christmas and I must say it's horrible. I returned the unit after about 1 month because I noticed the earphone was constantly leaking noise. She complained about it and we are still talking about it today.I have had better luck with the IE5 and the MEElec Q1, but if your earbuds are too tight it just leaks even worse. I just returned the IE2 and I'm going to get the IE4 tomorrow because I don't trust anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these to connect my  LG DVD recorder to my HP Pavilion.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There's no way to even describe the horrible electronic device I bought from Target and shipped to my home. Not only does it not work, it doesn't even turn on. My wife is having problems with it too. It's frustrating as hell! I called Target tech support a few days ago and was told that they would mail me a replacement item the next day. When that didn't happen I called again and the representative told me they would have to send me another item. So I waited, and still I didn't have a replacement for over 4 weeks. I called another company, who told me the same thing. I am at the end of the rope, I don't know if I can even afford a new item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these in February 2010. Got them in June 2010. It was just a few weeks ago that the batteries were drained from the box. After sending it back to Amazon to get a refund, Amazon gave me a new order and gave me to wait for three weeks for the new order to arrive.I returned the whole box with the batteries and told them the new battery was here and that they need to ship it to me.They didn't.Three weeks later they got back to me saying that they will ship it now but it will take them some time to ship out the new batteries. I called them several times and they said they have to go home and write a big check to Amazon so I had to wait. After two weeks I called Amazon and they got me a credit with my first order.I was angry but I was happy to see that I got a credit. Then I called the next week and they never answered.Two more weeks passed and I called a few times, no answer. So I ordered another two boxes. After three weeks I got another shipment in the mail with the new (cheaper) batteries, but no new batteries were shipped from Amazon to me, so I got to wait two more weeks for them to ship back.The last box arrived on Wednesday and they sent me a check.I called Amazon today and the manager said the new boxes will arrive soon and the new ones will be delivered to me today, so we will probably be done with that and I can get the replacement batteries. So it will be 3 weeks after that for the batteries to arrive and they'll probably ship them today to me as well. But you know how it is: you can't plan for problems. They're everywhere 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I took a chance on this one because it's a high resolution scanner, and had no problems using it to scan a piece of paper for a report. I didn't even bother trying to scan with it on my computer. The scanner has no problem with any resolution larger than 200 dpi. The image quality was poor, and scanning the paper took too long. I returned it after about an hour of scanning and didn't like what I saw at all. I'm not surprised that this device is bad. I hope this problem is fixed with a software update. I also wonder how many other people have had this problem. It's disappointing that they can't fix this simple problem for those of us that just want to scan, not scan and scan and then print out. I've got a scanner, I don't want to be wasting money on this device, especially since it seems like it's so popular. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried the remote control system on my Honda but this doesn't work. I had to take it apart to see where the problem is. There are no instructions to tell you where to find the switches and that sort of stuff. So I had no choice but to get an electronic device and get back out there and try it. Not good at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought I would buy this because I like the way it looked, but when I opened it the speaker was not the way I thought it would be. It was not a good speaker. The sound was weak, the speaker worked fine when installed on the wall, but then I had to cut the wires, so the sound was gone. I'm not sure if it is the same on all monitors or if I have made a mistake, but I'd suggest you take your time and consider purchasing the monitor if you want to use this sound device, and cut the wire as necessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item for my office machine only. I could never get it to turn on. I did everything I could think of. I have not received any communication from Microsoft or the warranty department. I hope that this item is cancelled soon so I can buy another one. This is the only computer I have ever owned that did not turn on when I took it out of the box.I have since returned it to the store where I bought it. I don't want to return this item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very disappointing. The device worked fine once on, but then, the CD drive stopped working. The unit never even booted. I returned it to Best Buy, but when they opened the package, it was not even shipped.   The warranty is a total joke.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this electronic device and had it in three days. It is extremely heavy, and the case has holes all over it. So if you're trying to put something heavy and bulky in your back pack, the case is going to be the death of your backpack, because you won't be able to easily store a big notebook or something in your case.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have it and I can't believe it. This has all of the advantages of the original, but it's no longer the same quality as it used to be, not even close. And the shipping is outrageous and it's pretty much all I get: empty boxes, no manuals, no pictures and no warranty.  I had to return my  because I felt that there was a better way.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I first plugged this in it was set up and was a big improvement. I called my local electronics store to have the computer picked up at a good price. I ended up returning the device because it had gone bad and the return cost was $80. I was also charged for shipping. I returned my computer on November 28, 2012, it had not been picked up by the store.I called the store, they told me it was in the warehouse and I needed to call before I returned it to them. I did not. It was shipped out to my house on December 13, 2012. I received the package on December 16 and I called the computer store in my town to inquire about the status of the order.They said they would take care of it. I never received a call.I then called the local electronics center and they said I needed a new order. I told them I had called them about it about a week prior, I would call them again.I did not call them, I called another store and placed another order.I waited about two weeks, and was informed that they had received another computer order for me.I was told to call again about it, which I did on January 15.I went back to the store and was told they received two computer orders from me and they would send out another one. I waited, and no one called me. I went home, called my friend, he called me, and I went back.I returned my original computer on January 30,2013 and called to verify they did receive it.I received an electronic device back on January 31,2013. They did not pick it up.I contacted them again, this time on February 1,2013, and again I was not called.They sent me a new electronic device on February 3,2013 which I called to confirm and was called and did not hear from them.I told them about the electronic device I received, but no one would call me.Weeks went by, no word.I finally contacted a third party electronic store in another town and he called the same day I called them. He told me to call them now.I have not heard from them in about two months.They called me about a month ago about it. They said they were out of stock.I would have to ship it to the next closest electronic store and would have no coverage.I do not recommend this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've owned one of these for about 10 years and it has always been the problem. It would always stop working after a few minutes, so I switched to my iPod, and it kept working. Then it stopped working. I've tried several combinations of software and drivers, and nothing worked.  I had it shipped from Apple, but they apparently lost it.  The one I purchased from Best Buy was the same. I can't believe how bad these things are. I purchased a third-party Apple device that would fix the problem, but I ended up returning it because it wouldn't even work at all

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used the RCA Digital Studio VHS and VHS to DVD converter to convert my VHS tapes to DVD, and they both worked fine, however I've never been satisfied with their quality or the amount of data that could be transferred.  After ordering the RCD VHS, I decided to order the Digital Studio to DVD which is a different process.  I was very disappointed with their workmanship and the results.  They have poor quality standards, and I have been sending them back and forth for over a year.   So when I came upon the Digital VHS VHS Converter, I was excited about its potential, however it was much more expensive and very difficult to work with.  The VHS is much easier to work on and does not require a high level of expertise

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only reason I purchased it was because I wanted to listen to it through the stereo system. The other end of the stereo sounded great. Then, it decided that I was a bad user, so it shut down the stereo. Not sure if I could have heard anything over the speakers with the speakers still on. I will keep it for future use, but I do not recommend anyone else to do so.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound and imaging is poor, it comes with very few features, is very cheap, and not compatible with most media player, and it is a pain to set it up.

I really don't see much of a good reason to spend the money on this device if you are just looking for the image and sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am not sure what is wrong with these speakers, I bought the two pair of them and have not found one that works well.They are designed to be used on the floor, I have mine mounted about an inch away from the speakers and I don't know why they don't work that way. They don't have a way to adjust the height.They have two volume controls and they are hard to find with the plastic covers.I haven't found a good solution for this problem.If I buy another pair, I will purchase the metal covers as I really don't like them.I will not buy these again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item on the recommendation of a fellow home owner who is using it for a baby monitor.The monitor is on the same desk that the monitor is mounted on.I would have no use for it in any other environment. The monitor has an unimpressive resolution.The image looks like a fuzzy mess, even though it was sent with my normal monitor cable.I have to mount the monitor on a table in front of my computer, and then I have to install the software that comes with the monitor to display the image.The cable looks like it's about 1.5 inch too long.It's definitely not the right size for most users who will be viewing this monitor through a large window.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works fine for the limited range of applications. When you try to send/receive video, it gives you a black screen. After you get over it, you get nothing.  The only good point is that you can plug your laptop into this, and it will work fine.  Otherwise, it just gets in the way, and makes it impossible to connect to another laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I gave it three stars because it works only with the internet (and it's a bit pricey). The device does have all the options, but there is nothing in the manual about this and the user support is poor. The instructions are not up to date 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It takes very little time to find a good place to mount it. After one day, it didn't stay where it was supposed to, so I took it back home. By that time, it had already been installed. The instructions are vague and there is no good guide out there for mounting the antenna in my case. I ended up using my wife's (who's been installing antennas for years) antenna, which is not very high quality, and the unit just didn't come close to my living room. I don't think I will be getting this again, even though it is less than $40 shipped from Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These were very cheap, plastic and barely functional. I bought them to use with a VCR that I purchased in a local store only to realize that the plastic casing was warped and damaged after less than a month. The VCR itself is not broken, but the plastic cover is extremely warped. I returned the defective item and they sent me replacement units, but only after the damage had already been done. I did not receive the replacement unit, so I was forced to return the defective unit. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the plastic and warranty

But when I opened it, I found the same old old cord connector in the device.  I returned it to Amazon.Com and they sent me a new one.  But, when I plugged the cable in, it produced sound only.  Amazon. com. won't refund the cost for a return and I can't use it in any other way.  It has nothing to do with the audio output.  If I buy a good TV, it will work just fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried to install the new unit on the car and it came off in the middle of the installation, the installer would not even give me the proper instructions, he was not even able to properly connect to the computer, the instructions only say to unplug the unit to be certain it is set to'safe' mode, but that's what you do to remove the unit from the car, not install it. After 2 weeks I sent the computer in for an inspection, the unit is bent and the mounting screws are all missing, there is absolutely no way to mount it correctly. The only other option is to buy the unit again and have it professionally installed.  I have had a couple other electronic products fail on me in the same manner, I was skeptical about this unit since the installation is not included, I ordered the unit anyway thinking I would be able to use it as-is. I was not able to find any 'guidelines' for installing this unit properly so I returned it.  After the installation failed and the unit failed to come off the car in the correct orientation, I have yet to receive a replacement.  So, all I can say about this product is that you get what you pay for, or in this case, you buy it, buy it right away, and buy it wrong.  If you like your electronics to work, I would recommend you not buy this product, if you are looking for a 'quick and dirty' installation, then this is definitely for you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The CD-ROM drive is not included, it comes with a CD-R-RW drive. It does not work with Windows NT or Windows 2000. It will not work on Windows 2000 either. I would rather purchase a CD or DVD reader, but I would not recommend this CD-Rom drive for use with Microsoft products. The driver is not compatible with Microsoft's CD-RW software, and it will not write to any CD-Drives on your computer. The CD-WDRIVE, which is included with the CD-Drive is much more reliable.If you really must have this drive, buy it for $18.99, it is not a good deal. If you are looking for a great CD-rom drive for Windows 2000 or Windows XP, buy an Epson Reader or an ETCS Reader.

They just wouldn't quiet down enough to be usable. I was told by someone that they were from China, so maybe I'm just lucky with these. I think the only way they could have worked is with a stronger case for the computer. I also found that they would not work with the included cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just received my Zunes, I am in a rush, and don't have any extra time to set it up so I am thinking about returning it. However, when I saw my order with the Zunes on sale and a 30% off coupon code included, I couldn't resist getting one!   But, as it is currently the only way I can get them, I have been having a bad experience with them. They don't seem to listen to any volume when it is quiet, and it doesn't seem as if it is working on my TV.  The sound quality has been terrible, I had to stop listening to anything that I had been listening to and put on the TV's volume.  But this is the only other issue with them, nothing to do with the software.    They are so expensive and they only seem to be in stock in a few retailers, so if you don't live in an area that can get it, just wait a few months until they go out of stock 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've been using this item for the past few years. I've tried a number of other brands, and they're all in the same range, so it seems to be the only one that has it for more than two years.The first time I used the product, I couldn't hold it against it.  I left the product unused for several months to get use of it. I even had to remove the device and put it on a different shelf in a different room in the house because it would not stay attached to the wall.When I finally had it attached to my wall, I had to move the item to a new room before I could use it. It is not stable at all to hold the item on the wall or even to put it next to the top of a box.I also find that the cable attachment is far too difficult to remove, and I cannot find a way to install it without pulling the unit off the wall and leaving the device hanging. In my opinion, it is one of the biggest waste of money I have ever seen in my life.I don't see a reason to buy another one, and the product just has to be in the clear from everything else that I've read.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a bad item, it is not usable at all for video applications and does not have any way to detect or identify the source. It's just a stupid little card. I gave up on it, because I didn't want to have to worry about my home security system being monitored in real time, and I wanted a simple interface for my security system, so I just upgraded to a card that is compatible with my existing hardware. So the card I've bought is the same card that I had in my home network, only it is missing the security features that I've purchased, so the whole experience of buying it was worthless to me.It's still in the box, it's just that the security part of it is just not working.I have also had problems with it, with the card working on my network and not working off of my network.I would suggest that you purchase this item if you are planning on placing your home security on the internet.If you are using it to monitor the activity of your security system within the house, that's fine, I use it that way because it's very useful, but if you plan on placing it on a network card, then you're better off getting something that is more secure and more accurate. It will work, but it's not a great device, and it's definitely not something you should use for video application.

I have to use the mouse buttons to navigate and it is very slow to react. I even used the touch-pad on my desktop to do the same thing and it was even worse. I recommend a third party to take this product off the market ASAP 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable is very thin and is only about three times the length of the unit itself. I have seen some reviews about it not being good for VCRs. I disagree. It will not keep a decent amount of information. You would have to do an HD scan, which I am not a fan of. You need to be very specific when setting up a scan, like not only keeping the picture, but also making sure you get all the audio information. That requires a lot of data. It's a bad idea, just don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The item is in great condition, but the sound quality is very bad. I can't even use it without headphones, and the batteries won't last very long. I would rather pay for one that's in perfect working condition and works well.I would never recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The speaker works great in my living room but the sound isn't very good at any distance, about 15 feet away. I bought two for two rooms. One was the first room we had to put it in and I don't really like it. This may be a problem with the product but I wish I had gone with one of the other speakers. The sound gets worse as you move away from it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The picture is fine, but not the color and that is why I got this product. The sound is good, but I do not like it. The unit works fine with music, but that is it.  The box says that the unit works on both music and video, and it is true. The problem is that the sound is not loud enough to be on.  Even the slightest noise will ruin the sound.  No sound can be heard from the speakers and none can be made on the video.  It is like there is no sound coming from the television.  I do have a few sound cards, and I could not get it to work.  My speakers are not too loud, and with a little more room, it might work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's an LED indicator light, not a battery indicator. The plastic casing is so thin, the light has to stick out of the case. The case comes off easily, but I have to return it because the cover was damaged during shipping.  The LED is very bright in the dark, but it is extremely hard to use and doesn't do what the instructions say it does. The instructions say to connect it to the camera with the USB cable, but that's impossible because there's a slot that's too small to hold it. I returned the product immediately 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for a holiday gift for a family member. The cord and the product are so poorly constructed. It has no easy way to attach to the television, and the cord is so thick and unwieldy. The product came damaged in transit, and I had to return it. The instructions on how to mount it are a joke. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to use it again. I'll just have to put it in my kids room and hope they don't have the same problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used them for years. My problem is that they last about a month or less. I usually get a couple of days out of them before they start to fail. It also makes the device hard to clean. I tried putting it in a microwave oven and it doesn't even come out. This is after 3 years of using them.I'm very dissatisfied with this device. I don't recommend these for anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I did not buy this because I wanted to use it as my only speaker. I do however use it in a couple of rooms and it does not perform well in any of them. The bass gets lost and it is hard to understand what is happening when I plug it in for an extended period. I have not found anything to help me with this problem. I would not recommend this item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this is, the power lead has no clamp, the clamp is on the end of the power leads. What happens is, your computer can't turn on, the lights go out, and the computer shuts off itself.  This means, if you don't plug it in, and let the computer turn on for a few minutes, the computer will still be in the sleep mode, but won't boot up.  So, if your computer shuts down during this period, you won't be able to turn it back on.   Just don't buy it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Just got mine and it doesn't have an optical drive. I thought I'd take a look around at what I thought was a good deal on Amazon.com:  I ordered on Nov 27th. I ordered 8 units. There are 9 more units.  It only has one USB connector, and the unit is missing its USB cable. I've gotten them back in.  They all have a good video card.  If you want to order a USB monitor, then you're out of luck

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this with hopes of using it on my computer. I received my monitor, and just got to a point where I realized it wasn't working.

So, now I have to wait another 5 days to get a new one.  I would strongly suggest avoiding this brand.

I had to buy another one from amamazon and it was a pain to find out that the amazon package had a bad cable and was not able to order a new cable. The replacement cable from amAZont cost around $30 and they had to pay for shipping and delivery. If they had a better way to provide replacements for bad cables I would have returned it, but they didn't even include a case with the product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The case is great but the DVD drive has no read marks, and is useless. No warning, no problem. I thought it would be a good idea to try using an older hard disk, but even that does not work. You may want to consider getting a replacement drive. This case is not designed for hard drives, and doesn't come with one. It was $100, and was returned after only a few days. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two and two days after I received them the unit stopped working. I contacted the electronic support. When I told them that it's a defective product and I'm going to be returning it. It took them a week to come back with a new unit. Now they had sent me a new one and it was in the mail! The bad review:  This was the only electronic device I ordered from them. I ordered 2 units and then canceled and canceled again and they never called me to cancel it and it's taken about 8 days to return. If you order electronic devices you will be waiting for a very long time. It's not worth it if you're looking for great prices 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got the item and it took only about 10 minutes to set it up. The only thing I'm disappointed about is that the device is not as robust as I expected it to be. The unit has no rubber seal around the edge so it's easy to break. I ended up ripping off the plastic case to get to the metal edges. You'd think that something that's this big would be sturdy but it's not

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm on the third of four boxes  I have purchased from Dixie Computers. I ordered the boxes a few months ago. I didn't need them at first, but since then I've had to replace the boxes. I contacted customer service several times and they never responded. I finally gave up on ordering new boxes and ordered a box of them from another retailer. I did this, and the box of new boxes I ordered did not arrive  and I received one box that had a small crack on the side. I sent it back to Dixie and they sent me another box with the same problem. It was sent to another store.  I called the store again and told them I was calling customer service. I was told    to return the box, wait until they shipped it out to me, return it, wait for it to be shipped out, and return it.  The customer service rep was extremely unhelpful 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought these for a baby monitor. We didn't need them as the baby was sleeping, but when he woke up it was too late. I bought these hoping to save some money on something less than high end. I was quite disappointed when I got the box of 10, and saw that there was only a limited number of adapters to choose from.I would suggest ordering only the adapters to your monitor if you're going to keep it for more than a few days.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The picture on the package says that these are the same as the other electronic boxes on the market, but I am disappointed to say that the sound quality is NOT as good as what I've heard on other systems. My system is a Yamaha, so I know the sound, and I was excited about buying these for my house. I was disappointed.I hope this was a mistake and not a design flaw.I also tried to order these and received different numbers than what I ordered.I received an incorrect number and was told to return to order it, which I did.This is the end of this item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not sure why this device is so bad. It's a cheap plastic case that fits no better than a paper sleeve. It has no support for mounting your laptop to the case or protecting it from scratches.  I had to get one of these and it's a good size case, but it just doesn't fit. I can't see how a small laptop can be protected from scratches when it has to go in a case of this size.  Also, it's difficult to use with a thin laptop because of the way the case folds over to make it more compact. It can get in the way of the LCD touch pad.  If you have to go with this case, you may have to give up on getting the other size cases for your laptop and just go for this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was purchased with the intention of putting it on my TV. However, the cables were extremely short and I could never finish putting it in the television cabinet.I returned it for a refund. I do not recommend that anyone purchase this item.The connectors are very short so there is not a lot of flexibility when putting it into your TV.Also, it requires you to take a heavy item and place it in a thin plastic case to allow for proper connection. I would not recommend anyone buy this item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit arrived broken. It came as a large piece of plastic. I took it apart and found that there was a small hole in the plastic.

I would return it again and purchase another from eBay
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this for 2 years, and I must say it's extremely difficult to plug it in. I've tried many different types of cable, with different brands of connectors, and it just doesn't work at all. You have to do some trial and error and figure out the right lengths of cable.I've tried several times to take the unit apart, but it never works. I finally found the best solution to the problem:  I cut my cables with scissors, then bend them back into the unit. It's not the prettiest solution, but  it works great.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD player is very difficult to set up. You have to buy the adapters and set them to "Off" before you can play anything. The interface card is useless, and the CD is not read by it. You cannot install any software on your hard disk. The only way I have found to play is to use CD-Live software, and that will only work if you have already set up the CD player correctly. If you don't want to use it, then don't buy it

I ended up giving up on the unit and returning it.  If this unit works correctly, it would be a very expensive mistake to return 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had one of these in my studio for almost 10 years and it just stopped working the other day.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got this thing out of the box and it took about 10 minutes of plugging and unplugging it to get it to work. I found out it didn't work because I tried plugging it in backwards. I then returned it to Wal-mart and they shipped it back to me. I waited and waited and got another one. The third one also didn't plug in right so I returned it. The fourth one didn't do any better and it has been 5 weeks with no success.The product itself is great. The picture on the box is terrible and does not look good at all.I got it for $12.99 on sale at my local Wal-Mart and it's about $50 extra to ship it back because of shipping. I wouldn't buy again. I wish it worked right away, but it never does. I have also returned it twice because of the product.The warranty is worthless. I've tried calling the warranty line and they are only able to do their best to repair for a month. No one ever calls back.I'm very disappointed with this product, and I'm very reluctant to recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this monitor about a year ago. The picture quality is poor, and there is no option to adjust the brightness. I had it installed in my TV. The monitor was placed in a dark room with no ambient light, and I could hardly tell the difference between it and any other monitor. The color and contrast are off, and the picture was very distorted. I couldn't tell the different monitors apart from a mile away. I returned the monitor because of the poor picture. I am only now taking it back because I decided I needed something with higher resolution. I'm so frustrated with this monitor that I'm moving to a less expensive model for a month before I purchase a new one, because I am sick of the picture quality

Not only that, but the store was closed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with this device,  It didn't seem to do anything on my monitor.  I could only get it to work after disconnecting my computer from the power source.  No problem, I just took my monitors,  plugged them into the USB ports on the device, and it worked.   But the quality of the device was very bad 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor from Best Buy. I ordered it for Christmas, and then waited until after the monitor was already delivered. I'm sorry for the bad review, but I had to wait several days before I saw the monitor. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace the original Iphone 5, and it turned out to be a bad buy. I had the phone for about 3 months, and then all of a sudden it stopped working.  This phone was already bad, and  this one just wasn't any better. I returned it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the 4gb of memory from amazon and the drive arrived a few days later. Unfortunately, this drive failed right away. I sent it back to Amazon to get a replacement, but they did not deliver. I contacted Amazon support and they sent a replacement right away, and it arrived in less than a week. But it failed. Amazon sent a refund on my credit card, but it was sent after the drive failed. So the money was wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought two of these and they never worked. They just never turned on. And one lasted about 1.5 months and the other lasted about 2 months and both of them were broken. It took about 3 weeks to finally break one, and then another 2 weeks to break the other. These weren't a good buy

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my parents but I don't see any reviews about this one.  I used it for about 2 weeks and the battery only last about 8 hours.  They don't recommend it for use under any conditions.  You have to be a technician to install the battery in this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very excited about it, it's great for use in studios, but unfortunately it is not very durable. The tape will eventually lose it's stickiness, and it just won't hold the shape it should. It's not even clear how you can take the tape off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had purchased two of these units, and one of them didn't work. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a refund for the one that didn't fit. However, I don't believe they have any information about these units. I haven't tried the other unit yet. I guess I'll be buying from the local dealer as it is a good price. I just don't see why you need to use these units if they don't work and it is still a bad price for the units. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The audio system only works with one device. If you have other audio equipment on your system, this won't work. It is not a bad device but it is too bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item expecting great picture quality and great sound. I was very disappointed. It sounds great in the store, but not in the home. I don't understand how you can charge a large device like this through the wall, and have this poor picture quality. The quality of the image is the same, but there is much less detail. The sound quality is also poor. It is very difficult to distinguish much of the audio content. If you are thinking about buying this item, you may want to look at other models on the market, as it is extremely overpriced. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We ordered these to replace the broken cables on our computers. They only work for one computer, and even then only half the time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this laptop for over a year and have not had any problems. However, I was sent the wrong version of the software for my installation of the latest Windows 7 and had to do some troubleshooting to install it on my HP laptop. Then I tried installing the version of windows I had and it did not work. I got to the point that I just took my laptop to my local store for a return, returned it and sent back another one.  This laptop should have come with Windows 7 or even 8 installed, but the only way to install them is through the software. I am sure I am not the only one who has had to troubleshoot this issue. I will be returning the other one immediately and this one may take a while to come back from HP as the software is now in a different version. I would not buy this laptop again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and after opening and playing about an hour of music the sound was not very pleasant. It was very loud but not as good as I would like. The price was very reasonable but not the quality I expected 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are great, but the sound quality is lousy. They're not as loud as my other cheap speakers. I tried switching out some of the speakers, but it made no difference. The only other positive thing is the price. These are definitely overpriced 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This CD player is defective, it only plays a few songs, the volume is not adjustable, and the unit can't be powered down.  It works great in a computer system, however.  There is not much I can do to fix it, and I would buy something else if I had to.  I am very disappointed, and am considering getting another unit of the same brand 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This speaker is a big disappointment. I was very impressed with the quality of the speakers that I bought from Amazon. After several days of heavy use and heavy vibrations I have started to notice a problem. It sounds worse than before! So now I am calling off the order. I will be looking elsewhere for my speakers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones seem to be very fragile, so be careful about them if you drop them. They do not keep well after they're bent, so make sure you have a good pair of shoes/pants to protect the headphones before putting them on.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wanted the remote control for my new Dell notebook, but the product I received did not have the CD and DVD compatibility, so I returned it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The monitor was not the problem. The monitor is not compatible with a newer MacPro and the Mac does not support it. The Mac was a good price for a high end monitor but was not worth the money. I had a hard time getting the monitor to work with a Mac. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are cheap plastic replacement buttons, I thought they were the same as the original but they're not. I ordered 3 to be on the safe side, but they came in 2 days in bad packaging, no packaging and the wrong color, they just look like the original ones. I returned them and bought a new set from another store and got it the next day. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a bad idea for the reason I've mentioned above. I have always thought that the HD DVD format was the best format for making a Blu Ray disc. If I had it to do over again I would buy a good DVD-A burner, buy a blank DVD and burn that to a blank HD DVD-R, then use that as the master for the Blu Ray. I'm not sure how this will work for HD DVD. If you buy the DVD-D and only use that DVD as the DVD master, you'll have a blank disc with a burned DVD in it. If that makes you feel better, buy another blank DVD if you have it, and that will do as a master. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these with great expectations. They're very well made, but the audio quality is terrible. I haven't had any problems with these yet, but I'd probably get something else. I've tried everything from a generic headset to a pair of generic earbuds to a cheap pair of cheap earphones and it's never worked.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are great, but the only problem is that they aren't waterproof. You can only put them in your pocket or bag if you have a waterproof jacket or bathing suit (which I do not). So you must buy more adapters (I have six, but only two are good enough for my needs). And, they aren�t strong enough to withstand all the water that I try to dump on them, so you must keep the adapter on your pocket with you at all times.� So much for the idea of these being simple to install and easy to use.� I really don�t know what they�d do without them� 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these for my new home and they did not arrive until well after the estimated delivery. I had to go through the UPS website and call them to see if it would be possible to have the delivery sent back to me. The reason for this was because my computer was already shipped. It is unfortunate that they did this but they should have told me beforehand that it would take a while. I will be trying again and hope that the issue is resolved soon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this monitor because it was very inexpensive. But, it was not what I expected. It was very bulky and the color contrast was not very high. I have ordered more color monitors and they have been much more compact. However, this monitor is not very light weight, and it was a bit too bulky for my use. I was able to get better color balance and viewing angles by ordering a different monitor from a different brand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After several hours of searching for the same item, I finally found a few units that were as advertised, but with too much lead, and did not come with any adapters.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these and they arrived broken. They didn't fit well and I sent them back. I've never used a cordless phone before, and I don't intend to get any other phone from this company. I'm a long-time cable modem user who has been very happy with the high-quality products from Sennheiser, and these were no exception. So I returned them and ordered two additional cords. The same problem exists. I guess I've gotten to the end of this line. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the only way to use these, no USB port, and not compatible with any Windows based computer.  The only way I could get it to work was to put it in a mini-server with 4 vc-switch.  I had to manually move each cable from one switch to another in order for it to function.  If you want to use this, go buy a cheap switch or buy one of the cable-stays that come with your printer, and you will have more problems with getting it to sync.  There is no need to purchase a printer if you want sync, just buy a usb printer.  It would be nice if we could just use a standard serial cable or something for the software to talk to.  We have to find a way to communicate that works between the printer and the software.  For this reason I do not recommend this, we will just have to make our own. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my third time receiving this and is the only one I had. I would never recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was my first electronic device to fail. I followed all the instructions and it worked out of the box, but when I took it out of my pocket the cable broke. I ordered it from Home Depot and they sent me a replacement. So I tried again to use the same cable but it broke again. I finally got it out and put it back in the pocket and it broke. This is a high priced item and I didn't expect it to break. I was very frustrated. I ended up calling Kinkos about it, and they couldn't even exchange it. I returned it and paid a $50 return fee. I'm not happy with this item. I would have thought I could have saved a lot of money by buying the same cables from Home Depots and just swapping it out with my own cables. I hope Home Depot would consider the customer experience before making a huge mistake like this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was not installed properly, and was not very durable.  The cable was also very small and uncomfortable to carry. The screen could not be adjusted and was too dim and washed out

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device arrived broken on day one. I sent it back to Walmart ( I ordered from Amazon and it came with a defective pack). The next day they sent me a new one. It worked for about a week then quit. I did send it back again but the package was missing. I called and Walmart had it. So I called Amazon and they sent the new one out. So the package came, then broke. I tried another day, again the package is missing. So now I'm back in Walmart buying new. No refund 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this and after a week and a half of use it stopped working. I called the number on the box, the phone was disconnected. I took it back to the store but they did nothing, and when I called them again they disconnected my call. I tried calling it, no luck, and called the store again. Again they disconnected the call. My wife and I tried everything and couldn't do anything about it. Finally we took it into our home office and we called the customer support and she disconnected my calling card for me. They said that they did this because they are doing everything they can to fix it, but she wouldn't let me use it until I paid for shipping. We went back and forth for 3 days, and still she wouldn,t allow me to use it. I told them I would return it and they did a little refund processing to get the price down, but it was still too much. I am just not having any luck with them, and this isn't the first bad purchase I have had to deal with from them. I think I am going to return it, because I don't like the store's customer service or service for that matter, but I may just stick to my HP printer and use the paper cartridge I have for that.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had mine for a while. I've read good reviews about this device but was never confident about using it. I just bought it today and tried to start a music playlist. This thing is completely inaudible. No discernable audio from the speakers. I don't want to put this in my computer and risk messing up the software. I guess I'm stuck with this device for now. I would not recommend this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this for my brother to listen to his favorite music. We got to have fun with the TV tuner and it didn't work. I ordered a second one and it did work, but it did not look as nice as this one. He said it looked like a plastic case. So I ordered an aluminum case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this item as an inexpensive, but poor quality, portable device. It works fine in terms of audio recording, but there's nothing on the web to show that the recording works. In fact, the unit works great for only about 3-4 minutes, then it starts recording only in low-quality mono. I would recommend this product only for recording the occasional voice-over, not for audio-visual purposes. It can also be set to record in high-quality stereo for broadcast or to record from a tape recorder. If you need it to record voice-overs, please go with a high-grade tape recorder 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen was the weakest part of this monitor.  I also did not get the bright picture that I expected, but the contrast was fine.  The only thing I didn't like is the software is a bit too difficult to navigate, so you have to click to get what you want.  Also, the resolution of the monitor is very low.  You get a lot of black areas in the picture

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had this device about 4 years ago.  The only difference I've noticed is that the units that come with a case are significantly larger than the ones with a card sleeve and rubber pad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very poor quality at this price point. I have had it for over a month now and it still is not working. No matter how hard I try, I cannot get it to turn on. It's not dead either. It just doesn't work. It doesn't have enough power, it turns off before it gets too hot. I returned it and sent it back to Amazon for refund, and they sent me the same item, except they didn't refund my shipping cost.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had a very bad experience with this device, the color and the sound quality was horrible.  I have the same issue with some of the other VEON.com branded devices.  It's a shame because I bought a lot of the products from VE ON after purchasing all of them on sale and I wasn't expecting this issue to occur.  However, the problem was solved by me returning the product and buying another brand.  The difference in sound and quality is very small, and I returned my device because I wanted to try out a few other products.  As I did so, I noticed that VE On was out of stock, and my only other option was to buy from e-Bay for a small extra fee.  After returning the other device, I bought and returned my first one, and VEONE did not even offer the exchange.  The price was still lower than the other retailers, but VEone gave me a bad review about how they are not supporting their product.  My only hope is that VOEON has gotten the problem fixed.  Unfortunately, it appears that they don't care about their customer's happiness 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the item for a Christmas gift. However, when I received it, I discovered that the cable to attach it to my TV was broken. I called customer support and they were very helpful. But when I took the TV and the unit off to put it back on in my house, I found that the HDMI cable snapped. I contacted customer support again and they told me that I would have to purchase a new one. But, I was unable to order it from Amazon due to my negative review. I guess Amazon is just getting greedy with poor reviews

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a 4gb Seagate Desktop HD for my husband and found the drive in the box was defective.  The drive was not usable for the remainder of the holiday shopping season and we ended up returning the drive.  We returned the Seagate desktops to Seagate but were unable to recover our money.  Seagate was not able to exchange this product and my husband had to return it for a refund.  I did not find Seagate to be the responsible party on this situation.  They did not make any attempt to contact me to make any sort of return or exchange.  There is a reason for this and it's that you do not need the drives to use the Seas, they are not necessary to install or run.  For this reason, I decided to give up on purchasing Seagate products and decided to purchase a Seagate RAID.

I contacted ebay and e-Bay replied that it doesn't have the right number to ship them to me.

I returned in Feb. 2013 and received an email from the dealer stating that they would be replacing the receiver, but they would need to send the unit to Apple for shipping first.

Eventually they were forced to ship the unit back to Apple.I gave up and returned the unit in Nov., 2012. The problem continued until the unit was shipped back to me in Jan.2013. That is 6 years later and I still have yet to receive a refund for the inconvenience.The product itself is completely unacceptable, it is junk and I cannot recommend it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So my wife bought this for the TV. But she had only a limited amount of data storage, and the price was ridiculous. We tried to return it for a full refund, but Amazon didn't have it. I've called, talked to, and been through the process at multiple stores. Amazon is not responsive. I went to a different store, but then had to return the item again for a refund. I then called Amazon's customer service, and had a lady on the phone for 20 minutes, then hung up on me. The lady at Amazon has since been on my case, and my return is now pending for over a month. I'm now having to return items from every store we go to, since I'm not going to risk it all on a refund that may not even be granted

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price of this device is outrageous, when I purchased it I thought it would last forever. The first month of use, I had to have the product repaired as the electronic device was being scratched, so it had to be replaced.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound is very high and is hard to control. It doesn't even work when I'm holding the remote. The buttons on the remote control unit are very difficult to control, you need to move the knob or press on the top of the remote to go back and forth to control your audio. It only works if you turn it on and off quickly. This product is not good quality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had hoped this would fit the case, but it's just too big, especially for the tiny case I'm using.I have several items in the cabinet, and all of them work just fine, but the keyboard is nowhere to be found. It's just in the way. The case is also too small for the keyboard, so it also ends up in the middle of the table.This item is worthless. Don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a defective unit. I called RCA and they offered a refund if I paid them the difference. I decided not to buy them because of this, but I could not get RCA to refund my money. I will not buy them again. The unit is the only thing I do not like about the TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one of these speakers and it doesn't work. The sound is not what I had expected for the price. I paid over $100 for one of those speakers 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I thought it was a good speaker but they sound just the same as my old Panasonic speaker system. The speaker on the right only has 2 channel and the sound is very muffled. The volume controls seem to be not working. The sub woofer is good and the top speaker is very bad. The system is very unstable. The bass is very low, it is very hard to listen to music.The sound is also very low. I have 2 different sets of speakers so I can play in different places. I wish that I had bought the one for the subwoofer. I bought this because I thought there was a nice stereo system. But that is not the case

I contacted a local electronics store and they recommended they get me a new unit. It arrived 2 days later and they replaced the batteries. But, it wasn't working on the second set of batteries. So,I returned the device and they sent me a replacement unit. Then the unit just stopped working on its own!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy note 2. I ordered the same model, and it arrived as promised. But, after a few days of using it, the screen cracked. I was quite disappointed. It would be nice if  Samsung would replace it with a  model that would last longer. Otherwise, I will not be purchasing  this product any longer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with this purchase, and the quality was horrible.  It was very noisy and had a lot of static.  If this is the case with your unit, then try buying an older model with less expensive components.  I didn't see any of the promised support in the forums.  This is the most expensive item I have ever bought, and I am looking at the price for only a couple of days!  I would highly recommend looking for a used model, and do some research to see if it fits your needs.  Hopefully this will be resolved in the future, and this can be an example of why you should do your own research before you buy any item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit arrived broken. We ordered it from Amazon.com and they sent it to us on a Monday instead of Wednesday. We still have to wait for shipping from Amazon to be credited and received. The unit we received had a lot of damage. We called Amazon to ask for the unit and it was delivered today but we still have not received the new unit. The quality is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I ordered this, I expected it to be at least as good as it looks in the picture. It's not. It sucks. It works great when it works, but when it doesn't, it gets very noisy.I would have returned it if they had sent it to me. I would have also returned the box if I had to, but I have since received the replacement box, and the replacement device is exactly the same as the original (they had the same product at Best Buy in a previous order).
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I paid a good amount of money for this and then had to have it repaired by my local store. I took it back and they fixed it. Then I had to pay them again to have them repair it.   It would not be a big deal if the unit worked but it doesn't.  I have to use a computer to do anything that involves audio. So that is just a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased this TV 4 years ago. Had only one month with it. I was thinking the Samsung had finally solved the problem of black and white, but it is worse than the original.  The picture and sound is not even consistent from picture to picture. I have tried many brands, and I have had the same results. I can see why it is so expensive. I'm sure I'm not the only person with this problem. I hope this isn't the case with all Samsung's. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So I ordered a set of these speaker cones and it did not come with the instructions for installation, so I emailed them. I sent them a picture of my speakers and they sent me a new set, which did not include instructions for the installation. I then received a return notice that the cones were "not returnable". I contacted the company and they refunded me my money, but did not give me the correct instructions for how to install them. The cones came in a box with no instructions, so it was not a good product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really love my VCR, but this little box had a major setback after two weeks.  It worked fine for a week and then one day I noticed it would stop working and it would only work with one video file.  My VCR was already in an awful state because of all the bad electronics that had accumulated in it.  No way was I gonna keep using this box any longer.  This little box is no longer in my home because of this.  I don't understand why they only want you to keep this for 30 days and then take it out and sell it to someone else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because it looked like the item would fit my computer perfectly. Unfortunately I had to return it because the rubber part stuck to the monitor and couldn't be removed from my computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is a warning on the box. It's not clear whether it's a bad part, or I made a bad purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First of all, it is very very difficult to find the correct one. I tried to buy one from Amazon and it didn't work, it was too heavy to carry. I finally found them on eBay. The one that I got was from a European shop (they seem to ship only in Europe). The unit I got from eBay was defective. I thought it would come with an electronic device or something like that, but it was not. So I had to send it back to eBay. I had sent it back twice before that before it even arrived. The seller that I bought the unit from in Australia sent it out of my country without any problems. They are very slow to respond 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This device works with my Mac but the batteries tend to not last for more than a week. Not much room for improvement if you are buying this as a first purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First off, this is a very high priced set. I ordered the set, expecting great results, but instead got it delivered to my house within a week. I returned it and they said the set was in my hands. I was expecting it to come from China but they were very slow in getting the parts to me. Even worse, the set doesn't come with any of the necessary cables to use it. So I had to wait for them to send me new ones and pay shipping. But still, I thought I'd give it a try, thinking it might work. It didn't. I would buy it again only to receive the package and return it. I had a long, frustrating discussion with them, but I still didn't receive the item. I did get a refund. No thanks to you, electronic retailers. Don't be a sucker 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery lasts about three days on a single charge but that's only because it was not charged properly. I ended up buying a second battery because the first one only lasted about a day. So I got the battery and charger for about 10 bucks each.  I'm returning the second battery and I would not recommend this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried this and it works as advertised. I had to do a full scan of my whole house, and that was the longest scan so far.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We have used this for years. It is the only one that we bought and have it for about a year.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I returned this item because it is not designed to fit over the ear. I had no problems with this unit, but the sound was way too harsh. I did not like the sound of it either. I wish I knew what was wrong with it, but I'm not sure. I called Kenwood and I tried it on my vehicle, with no luck. The sound was not flat and didn't have a smooth sound. I couldn't believe I bought it, and it's very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have not had this device for long enough to know if it is working as expected.  However I did not find any negative reviews about this device so I thought I would give it a try.  The unit came with two batteries but that does not seem to have held up the unit as expected:  The box states the unit should have four batteries, and I found four batteries not to be on the unit.   There is no mention on the packaging of batteries or charging device, so I have no idea what I could have done wrong.  I am also not the most patient person so I would not expect to receive a unit that would be ready in an hour 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   For $15, you'll pay for the packaging more than the product. I had to take it apart and get it into my office.  This product does not support multiple USB ports. It does not have any sort of software for transferring files, it can only do one connection. I think there is a reason why Apple is not making this product for a good price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am in the process of trying to repair my broken DVD player. After reading all of the negative reviews about this device, I decided to buy it. When I opened the box, I noticed that the battery was missing. I was a little hesitant, but I decided I would buy it anyway. After several tries, I managed to get the battery to work. I then tried to install the software and everything went down the drain. I had to reset the player. This is not a good product, and I had an RMA. I've returned this and will not buy this again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm thinking about buying two of these to use on two PCs. The unit is not small. It has to be mounted so the LCD panel is in the center.I did install two of the units and they did not work. I tried the same thing on my other PC with a different LCD panel. Both worked but not as well as the first unit. This unit is too expensive for what it is. I will be returning it to get a more expensive one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The quality of the microphone is not great. Not much more to say about this. I am currently using the mic with a Yamaha XM-1, which I'm really not pleased with. I'll be trying some other mics for the time being 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you don't have an extra controller port to hook it to, it's just a waste. It works fine on my HP laptop, and my HP EliteBook 8550 only has one controller port, so it doesn't matter if I do it with this or another, I get a blank screen and no functionality with it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very nice computer, however, it is very hard to adjust to a different resolution. It is hard to set a proper video setting that doesn't look like a TV.I have only tried to use the touch screen mode with my old computer, but this only works with windows 7 (or higher) and requires multiple attempts to adjust. I would only recommend this computer to people who are very careful about what they are doing with their computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am not a fan of this item.   The box is flimsy, the speaker is horrible, the remote has a few problems, and you must be very careful with the batteries.  This is the first wireless speaker I have purchased, and I will not buy again.  Very unsatisfying, and not worth your time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product came as ordered but after only 2 days of use, the screen became foggy. I emailed and they told me they would send a replacement on Saturday. However, they sent it only one day after my email.  After I emailed again and they said they would have the replacement in a day or two.  No one has received it. So I called back and was told they would ship a replacement but it's not on its way yet.  I haven't seen any other problems with the product since.  It's not something I would recommend purchasing as the picture and descriptions are horrible.  They really want you to buy it because of the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with the product that I ordered. It's hard to imagine how one can expect the electronic device to last much longer. I am glad I ordered two items, but I would expect a better product from the manufacturers. I can understand the quality for a digital device, but the design of the cable is very un-professional.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The batteries are designed to work with a Sony TV and when I received them they did not fit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had very high hopes for this item, as I am a huge fan of the Zune, and of the iPod. I was so excited for it to be available for purchase, that I ordered it on eBay, and waited for it in the mail. When it arrived, it was still in its packaging, and not even in a box. It was very stiff, and the tape covering the surface looked as if it were cut very thinly. I tried the unit, but the sound quality was just plain bad, the iPod did not even turn on. I returned the unit and returned the postage money.The unit still wasn't in any box, and I was still waiting for it. I called the store and was told they would be sending it to me today. When I returned, and told them that I would not be receiving it for several days, I asked the employee there to call the store. That was the end of my relationship with them. I have spoken to other electronic store employees, and they have told me that Zune products are shipped by the package, so the product must be returned to the store for processing. I would think that this is simply not true, since I see Zune packages being held for several weeks in the box, before they are even opened. So if you want to purchase a Zune product, be aware that you may have to return it if it doesn't arrive within a reasonable time frame.I was very upset, and left a very negative review on Amazon:  So you can have the best looking iPods, and worst sound.  If you want a Zunes, buy a CD player, and a computer, not an iPod. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this for an external device and couldn't wait to get it, but it arrived only after a week.  It is so light and floppy that it takes very little time to throw it out the window when you get it.  I couldn't use the remote that came with it, so I had to buy one that cost $10 more.   The device is so cheap and has such poor reviews, I was hoping that it would work but that just wasn't the case. I returned the device, paid the shipping, and I still haven't gotten it.I think the product is fine if it comes with a remote and that's how it works, but if you want remote control, get a Logitech product from Best Buy, not this!  I returned it and am waiting for a refund 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this unit as a replacement for an external USB hub, but the unit failed to function. After calling Amazon I got a new unit that worked, but it was much more expensive. I thought I would give the Pioneer the benefit of the doubt and try the unit again with different adapters. This time the unit didn't work, it kept blinking and saying it couldn't detect the devices. I called Amazon and they recommended I return the unit. I returned it and tried to return it with the same adapter. The unit would not work. I was told it was the original unit that I had returned.I called Pioneer and they said I should return the same unit I had purchased.The customer support person said I would not be refunded, because they had the wrong item. She told me it was in the box and it was not in the package, she said she would call Amazon and ask them what they were talking about, she would find out the item was not there.I returned the unit, and waited for the UPS to deliver it. It was 4 days before the UPS driver arrived at my house. I went home and waited another 2 days. On the day I was supposed to receive it I called Pioneer again. She said she was sending a new one. I contacted Amazon to see if they would cover the shipping and handling charges, but no answer yet. So I returned the new unit to Pioneer. I tried another adapter that works, but they would not function. I then returned the other unit again.The UPS driver was finally in my garage.The next morning I went to pick up my box from the UPS depot, the driver was here in less than 5 minutes. But as soon as I picked up the box it would not turn on. It didn't shut off with the power switch, I couldn't hear anything. I turned on the TV, looked around and nothing.I had to call Pioneer and tell them about the UPS box. They said the box was in Pioneer's possession and they would call UPS to retrieve it. I waited and waited, and they still did not call UPS. I also called Amazon's customer support. I explained about UPS and the box, they said they would check with UPS and get back to me.I waited and still didn't hear back from UPS. Then I called UPS again and talked to a supervisor.I told him that the unit had not turned on, and that I could hear nothing. So the UPS guy

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is  with the DVD format you can't do anything about a DVD ripping from DVD to DVD. It does not do any compression on the image to make it DVD friendly. If you want to see a DVD rip in video format from a DVD to a DVD just buy a blank DVD with a blank video in it and copy the image into it. You cannot do compression on a DVD image to save space 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So the picture is great, but the sound is awful!I did return it and the next day, they were out of stock for the 4th time.It's not because they ran out of them or anything, it's just that they don't sell them anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So much for the cheap feeling. You get a lot of dust and dirt on the sensor, and you can't see it, the white and black plastic look is awful.

It will take up half the space of the computer.I ordered it, but it didn't arrive until I needed it. I returned it, and they sent me a new one. Then they shipped it again.I'm not sure why they couldn't find it a bit more convenient. Maybe it's because it was sold by Best Buy, but the computer is bigger. It's a good computer, but they didn't fit.I got it, bought it, paid for it, then they sent it to me again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered the 5.1 surround speaker system, hoping to get this device to sit atop my TV. After spending close to $400, it sat on top of my TV with a sound system that would cover any room. After several weeks, I called customer service, and they suggested that I exchange the speakers for another brand. Well, I did not have room for a pair of speakers, so I got two identical speakers for about $50 more. The quality of the sound did not change, but the height of the speakers changed.

I just can't see myself using a smaller unit when I already have a large keyboard. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two of these units to use as my backup HDD and to put a copy of my Windows 7 OS on my secondary hard drive. Unfortunately, the only hard drive I can attach to my system is my primary hard drive, so my system will run slow and be laggy for the next 2-3 days until I upgrade to a faster drive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one of these units to mount my VCR. I was not happy with the unit, and could not mount my camera using the VCR adapter. I returned the unit and ordered the adapter. After a few days, the unit had stopped working. I called and was told that they were going to replace it. I had already paid for the unit. The new one is supposed to work for about 3 days. When I called back today, I got the new one that would be shipped. It arrived late Friday afternoon. I have yet to receive the adapter so I do not know if I will be able to use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The item is defective. If you order it from Amazon, you should receive it on Friday. This  may not be the case if you order from eBay. In either case, if you buy it from eBay,  I'm afraid you will not be able to use it as your main computer, so save your money and go with a different brand. This particular model has a serial number on it that does not correspond to  the computer.  It's difficult to get this  serial number if you don't know about this.  I ordered from Amazon and received the item on Friday, but  was told that the item was not in stock until Monday morning.  At this point, there is no  way for me to know what will happen to my purchase as I have no way to  return it to Amazon.  Unfortunately, I will never be able  to use this computer, even if it was in stock, because it is defective

I did find out that the unit works well with Windows XP but it's not guaranteed. I got a defective unit, but it came with a few additional accessories that I did not get. It is unfortunate because I love the sound. However, if you expect this to sound great, you will be disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item for a Christmas gift for a relative. He received it today and it is not working. I contacted the seller to see what he could do and he said that it was just his machine, so I went back to the original vendor to see if they could help me, and that is the end of that. I will be returning this item. I have never had anything like this problem before. I am very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought and installed on my desktop PC, but after a week was only running with 20% of the battery. I thought it was defective, and returned it to the store. They still don't know what to do with this product and it's about to take another week to see if there's any improvement. I would highly recommend against buying this monitor, unless you're willing to shell out some $$ to replace the battery if it's not working

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Had to return it immediately. This is the only good electronic device I've ever bought and it cost $80.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one of these on Amazon to use in a TV room and I really liked it but when I tried to connect my Sony XBR-700 to the unit to use it as a monitor, it just wouldn't work.  The cable came with a short USB plug which doesn't fit in the Sony cable box so I bought a longer USB plug on eBay. I haven't gotten the Sony unit hooked up to it yet but I'm sure it's connected somewhere on my Sony.  I have a set of Sony wireless receiver's that connect to the Sony device and it's not using any of them.  So why is the Sony receiver going down when it's the receiver that's not doing anything?  I will return this item for a refund and I am really disappointed with Sony. I really don't know why they don't have a simple interface for it or something for the Sony. The fact is, it's very simple to use the device as a wireless receiver.  You just plug it in and use it in a wired setup like Sony has for their receivers.  If this is a basic product, then it should be simple to hook up to a Sony receiver or a set and forget setup. I'm very disappointed with this purchase

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to return mine about a month ago. The electronic device just doesn't work right and the batteries are in constant use. It will go for several months before the battery will eventually charge, and when it does, it'll be very small. This is not an easy device to use 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They are cheap, have to be recharged by a lot of batteries, and the display of the software is pretty poor. I got these for $10 and they are useless after one use. I had them for 2 months, and now I have to replace them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got it in the mail and was very surprised to find that the unit was already cracked in two places on the right front panel. The unit was packaged so poorly, the product was torn open and the cover ripped out. I called the support team and they told me it would ship in 3-5 days. The replacement was not delivered within 5 days, and I didn't get a replacement for over 5 days. I was so frustrated and I ended up returning the unit with no replacement or refund. It is a complete scam and I am very disappointed with Epson. I would never buy from Epson again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works very well, but once I unplugged the power cord from the wall outlet, it immediately began to freeze on the unit, causing it to be off during normal use. I would highly recommend that you either get a new unit that is designed to fit your needs or use a different power cord that isn't a wall outlet cord to avoid this problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When you have the time, buy the right adapter. The adapter is the cheapest on Amazon and they even throw in some extra pins for free. However, that adapter is useless if your HDMI cable has any bend. For example, if you have a TV with a curved TV screen, you'll be unable to run this card. Even with a bent screen, it won't work. I bought two of these adapters and both of them broke after a month of usage. I'm sorry that I wasted $40 on the adapters, but I won't be returning it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If this is the only electronic device you have, I recommend you avoid using it. The picture on the box is quite clear, but the sound is not. You'll sound better with something else. I've read good things about people who have used these things, and they sounded great. It took me about 10 minutes to return this device. It would cost me about $60 for a refund, but I would not recommend this device to anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this for a small display in a cabinet. I took it out and installed the panel within the cabinet. It does not look great. I returned the item and got another one from another supplier. That product looks much better. No other review will change the negative review:  I am back on the hunt for something better. If you want to buy from a good electronic supplier and use it in the right area:  If you are going to use this in a very small area (e.g., for a coffee table or small bookcase), get something else. This is not an appropriate size for a display area.

No option to change the battery.  I'm not even sure if they're compatible with other models.  And the remote is not adjustable enough for the use.  If I don't have to change a bulb, it's a bad idea

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device came with a few scratches. I returned it to Best Buy, but they still wouldn't sell it. I then returned it and returned again, and the same thing happened. I had to return it to a different store. I tried returning it to multiple Best Buy locations, but none would even try to sell it to me. Then I contacted a customer service representative from the electronic store I was returning it from and she offered to pick it up for me. So I just dropped it off there and it sat out for a few days. When I finally got it, it had some scratches on the bottom, but nothing on the top. I called Best Buy and was told the item would be available to pickup in 1 to 2 weeks. So far that has never come, and it will be very difficult to return from Best Buy again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   For the price, I thought this was the perfect addition to my new TV. However, it was an awful experience.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a terrible product, not the slightest vibration. Not worth the $10 I spent on it. I returned it for another unit that did vibration, but this did not. The unit only vibrates if you hold it in your hand or put it on a table. I tried a couple of times with a different computer, it didn't work. It didn't vibrate when it was set to vibrate. I put a couple on the table and it worked, but it's still not vibration. I have to return it and go with something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these to do my computer work.

There was a big shipping label on the box.I returned it and ordered it again online. It was again listed as $23, which was a problem.I called Amazon and they informed me that they would contact the seller to refund me and they would refund me the $23. When the seller returned, I called Amazon again. They informed me they would no longer refund me. I called and called Amazon 5 times. Finally, they told me to return the product.So I returned it, and returned the rest of the box with the missing cables. Amazon took my money.I am very disappointed and have already written a negative reviews about other electronic items that I have ordered. I would rather pay $23 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was not delivered until mid-January. It had to be shipped from China, and was late to receive in my town. There was an assembly instruction, but the manual did not indicate how to attach it to my case. It took several attempts to attach the device correctly, and the instructions were confusing and somewhat confusing. I'm not a heavy weight, but I've had to pull the device a few times while trying to place it correctly. The case itself is cheap, but it is a bit of a squeeze to sit the device on it. I had it on the bottom, and it didn't quite fit, even with some padding underneath.   I ended up cutting the edge of the case to reduce the device's height, and this was not well received by the customer service. I ended ordering another, more comfortable case, which also has the same assembly instructions, but there was no problem with it fitting on my case correctly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this monitor from samsung.com for $400.00. I am not sure if this monitor has a warranty. I have not used it in a long time. I read a good review about how it is easy to install, and easy to operate, but the picture quality is horrible. I will not recommend this product. The picture quality of this monitor is horrible, and it looks like it is not even connected to the computer. I'm very disappointed with Samsung, because it took them so long to recall their defective monitors from the retail stores that I called and asked for a free replacement monitor (I thought I was calling about the same monitor). They said it was too expensive to send it to me, so I never got it. I can't believe that they have not done something about the defective monitors in their stores.I had to pay a secondhand dealer $400+ to have the monitor replaced. So that is $300.00 out the door, minus shipping. If you really want to have a good picture, and you want a good viewing experience, you have to get it from a retail store that has a good warranty (for the retail store, you do have to take the risk to call for a refund). There is nothing that says you have a free display, or that it is a returnable product. Samsung just sold me a defective product for $300 + shipping + $400 in labor. If that is not worth it, I don't know what is.I don't get any good out of it for the money spent. I was thinking about buying an X-Rite monitor, because of the good reviews I read on Amazon.com, but when I realized the price of the X-rite is $150.00 I am going to just stick with this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am returning this device to the store.  I tried it on both ends and it is very very difficult to get the sound quality to even out.  This is the first time I have used an iPad on my television, so I don't know if the sound will be any better with the iPad and its speakers.  It would be a good idea to take the headphone jack out of the box and use the headphones, as the sound on the TV isn't very strong in the low range.  Overall, it sounds like you are in the center of the room.  You can feel a slight lack of bass as you move away from the front.  If you are looking for a great sound for listening to music on your TV, this is not it.  My wife will be going back to her old Audioengine, as I expect she likes it more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the exact opposite of what I wanted. I expected a good quality electronic device, not an inexpensive plastic box. The battery was already dead when I got it and there was no way to return it for a refund because it was damaged. Not to mention that the battery charger was too far apart, which meant the charger did not fit inside the box. I returned it and exchanged it for another one, and it was still not working properly.  I'm returning it for full refund, but I would not recommend buying these for an electronic device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm giving this electronic device 2 stars because the batteries have to be changed every 30 days or so.

It is an unacceptable way to keep the batteries fresh.

If you want it to stay on the hottest setting you have to use a higher temperature sensor. The hot setting worked fine until now.

The results:  They have a great color range, but there is not much of a difference in the sound, so it is extremely hard to use them.  They also tend to go out after a short while.  Even worse:  When you buy one bundle, you get two. But you have to buy separately.  It is just crazy

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought one to replace my old HP digital camera with Canon cameras. The first time I used it it wouldn't connect to the internet. I was about to return it until it finally worked. The only negative is that it requires a Mac laptop to operate it. I had to buy another camera to make my life easier 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This was an absolutely terrible decision and if you order anything this can cause the device to become unstable and the picture to start to disappear. I returned it as soon as I found out what it was and they sent me a different one. They sent me two. Not only was I disappointed that they shipped me two, but I also was looking at purchasing this device for a client for his/her photography and I wanted it to work flawlessly for all images on his/hers device. I am sorry that it was not this time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say,  I'm pretty disappointed with the performance.  It will not play the stereo CD's I bought.  I guess you have to have better speakers.  But, that was the only reason I bought this product.  Otherwise, it worked perfectly.  So I think it was the speakers I needed.  The CD's would not play.  We tried to fix it, but it's so difficult. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not an electronics genius and I've read lots of reviews about these, but I had to return it.   It came with nothing in it except for the case.  The case, cord and cord cover were all missing.  I even had to buy another brand of this case from eBay 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed in the price and quality of these cables. I use these for connecting my Macbook Pro to a TV. The cables are very stiff, and hard to bend. I bought these because I heard good reviews about them, but it's just not worth it to spend this much money on a cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was given this device by the retailer, but I did not get a chance to use it until I got home. It had a bad feeling at first. I had to unplug and then plug it back in. The device did not fit in the case that came with the case, so I had nothing to put my hands on for at least 24 hours. I even tried to put the case in the computer with the unit, but that didn't work. I then had to remove and reinstall the unit. It was very frustrating 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is horrible.  The cables don't have any more than three inches of slack and you have to take it outside or use two batteries to even get through a gig.  So, if you want a good electronic device, get something else.  If you don't want to spend money on a different brand, buy cheap MP3 players on eBay: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit is great for the price. The problem is the price is so low on it that it is very easy to damage.I was very disappointed with the quality. It only came out of the box with a sticker covering the black plastic. I would not buy this unit again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After reading numerous negative reviews about these, I was really disappointed. I was planning on purchasing two of these for my daughter, but she had her first Christmas with her family and her iPod Touch was broken. She now has a new iPod Touch that is fine with her. We had been talking about buying these to replace the broken iPod Touch for a long time. I think I was going to wait until we finally had more time before I started ordering, but this is the first time we have had them.  I would like to give a negative rating as well, but unfortunately I was not able to use the speakers on these and we spent the better part of the afternoon trying to determine which was bad. Both speakers didn't sound good on either, so I had to return them. I've ordered a couple of replacements for our new iPods, but they will not come with speakers because they were defective as well. I will be returning the defective speakers for a refund and I'm not confident about these at this time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very disappointing. I have the same problems with my Samsung DVD player (and other Samsung's) and so I just return it. Samsung is the brand that makes this crap happen, not the manufacturer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this box for about a year now. The first few weeks I would get two or three times the audio level. Then after a few weeks it would drop to just 40% and I have to reset the device. I have returned it three times because it would not function properly. When you buy a $30 unit you expect to not have this problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got the device for my husband to play his CD. He is the type of person who does not listen to much audio gear. He would not notice the difference in sound. He actually preferred the CD player to the CD changer. It was fine for both of us but would not be ideal for someone who does like to listen to music on a CD. I am not even sure I could say it was 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the router and was very pleased with the speed of the router but, I was not satisfied with the ease of set up. When the set up didn't work, I returned the router for a refund. After returning the router I purchased a different router from Amazon, and it worked flawlessly. I then decided to purchase the "Ultimate Pack" which includes a router, ethernet adapter, and cables. But, this did not work for me. I returned both routers

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would like to see a full refund, not just a good one. I had been paying $99.99 a month for Internet and Video since I bought the unit on May 31, 2012, and now it is only available for $199.99 monthly and is on sale now for only $119.99! I'm sorry but, after all, this unit is a total loss! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit arrived damaged. I thought it was my fault but it is actually because it is not packaged very well. So I had to return the unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The item arrived fine, but when we turned on the device, it did not work. It came in an empty box. The customer service did not offer to replace the item or exchange it for a different model. I would not recommend using the "add to cart" option with this item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got it on Friday and it was sent to me on Saturday.  I tried it out on Sunday, and the sound is terrible. I had to put the earbuds in just to hear them properly.  The earbud also doesn't fit very well in my ears.  If you need to use it, it shouldn't be used with you wearing a neck warmer/shorts.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm pretty sure it's not a good quality device for the price. The USB connection is poor and not much space is available to put the disk on. I also think this device is very expensive. You can get a USB 2.0 card for about the same amount 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm sure I can get a better replacement for less money, but I didn't see that it had anything to do with the price, so I thought, "Great, one less product to buy, one more profit for someone else." 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you need to record a live performance, you will not find a more expensive way to do this. However, once recorded, the sound quality is mediocre and the tape is unwieldy. The sound is loud, and it is very easy to miss the kick drums. The recording is so unreliable that you will lose the sound and the performance would be ruined. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is great for a lot of reasons, but not for the size. I'd say about half the size of a normal CD, but then you'd need to carry both. Also, I'm an older man, and the cables are much too long for me. The only thing it does well, and it does a lot better than a normal player, is the fact that it uses very little power. You'd have to buy a bigger battery to get the same performance out of the CD player, and if you did that, you'd probably have to add more buttons on the top of the player. You can still play CDs and play music that way, but it isn't exactly as good as the competition. So, for a device that is great on paper, but doesn't deliver the performance I'd have expected from this device, I'll be avoiding it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very disappointed with this item. It's easy to get stuck on the remote when you're not looking at it. The button is tiny. It takes so much time to find the correct settings that it's really not worth the headache. I could find the same thing with my Sony DSC-A700 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is not even close to working with my Sony A6000. It worked for about a week after the warranty expired and only because I took it out of my bag and walked around with it while using it. The batteries do not hold any charge, you need to replace them on a regular basis and there is no warranty as of yet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this monitor with the intention of running it in a room that has an 80" screen. Unfortunately, I only got the monitor and the stand as shipped. I returned the monitor along with the stand. I ordered a second monitor a few days after I received it, and the same thing happened. The screen didn't fit the wall. It was so small I couldn't see the screen even at that distance. I tried mounting it on a few different kinds of stand, but it didn't come out that great. It's a good monitor, but if you are looking for something that's going to give you the most flexibility, try this instead. It is a good looking monitor, however, you might not see that if you look in the window directly across from the screen. You would only see it on the side when the screen was mounted. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the CD player because it was only $20 and it came with a few CDs, but it only played ONE CD before I returned it. It is too cheap to be worth that much money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit was shipped and I received it. It seems the manual is not in English so I don't know how I'm going to get the unit working. I've never had issues with the products before. This time it appears it may be a defect in the shipping.The only way I can find to get this unit to function correctly is to return it to Wal-Mart,and to return the packaging aswell. This is my second purchase from Wal-mart and my second time getting a defective product. I know for sure that the person who sold it to me has no idea how to actually use it to make a wireless network for a PC.I will not be purchasing from Walmart anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I read some negative reviews about this device and decided I wouldn't buy them for myself, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  The device's not very good, it's quite heavy, it doesn't fit easily under the hood, and it doesn;t look very nice with either of these:  (1)  The blue plastic lens is cheap and thick and doesn't look very good either with the black plastic lens and the black case:  You could say they're not particularly "sexy", if you want something that looks good, get a clear plastic lens  (2) The unit's not easy to fit in the car, it gets stuck and you can't pull the unit out;  It's more of a hassle than the other two  (3) And the price is not the best:  $50 more than some other brands

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the receiver and got it for Christmas, then I did not receive the receiver on Dec. 21st, then on Jan. 24th I received it.  So it is very, very expensive for me to order and receive, and I am very disappointed in the product.  I hope the product will be discontinued soon because there is a great deal of difference in the sound and picture quality between the different models, and the same for picture quality and video. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They can not be disconnected from the computer for me so the only way to get rid of the noise in the room is to unplug the speakers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this speaker and it was very nice to hear in my room, but after 2 weeks it is dead. I have returned it and will try again with a different brand. I was thinking of getting a $50 set of speakers, but this one is the only one I find that has dead batteries. I bought a $40 set, it worked fine until last week. I'm waiting for replacement batteries and hope for better results. I am now buying a different company

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item was defective in the second day of delivery. It came in great condition, but when I opened it, the plastic cover broke off and dropped all over the place. I contacted them and got it replaced with a different one, but there's a good chance it will not be returned and I'll have to send it back. I was very happy with the packaging, the quality of the packaging and the service, but the item didn't even work for two days after I received it. I really hope this is resolved in the near future, or I'll probably get the wrong type of item. I would never trust anything from these guys again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am only using it for a few days and there are a lot of things wrong with it. The volume control is horrible. It does not respond to clicking. Even when the cursor is hidden behind the screen, it still doesn't work. If you're going to be using it this way, try to avoid clicking when you're recording. If not, you could try moving the cursor to the left of the screen a bit more, but that does not seem to do anything. And even when you can click it, it doesn't appear to respond to your click. You will have to move the mouse over the screen to change the volume. The sound is even worse. There is no sound in the recording. I can only guess that it does not get any louder than the monitor is. The buttons work OK, but sometimes they are too far apart from each other, so that you have to click the buttons individually. It will get even worse if you use the mouse with this device. The recording mode is very limited, so it does nothing but record. There's no option to switch from it to the monitor mode. The only thing it can do is play back the audio from the recorded clip. You can't just record in that mode, you have have to press the'stop' button once and it will freeze. Also the playback is poor. If your recording is not very deep, it'll start recording at the first few seconds of the clip. It won't do it again until you stop it. You have to keep pressing the buttons for longer. I don't recommend this product for anyone, even if you have the right equipment. It only works fine for short clips. I have a good sound card and the quality is excellent. However, it will be useless if you don't have good speakers. For my money, you should get a real sound card, because there are tons of better ones for about half the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this device at the local Radio Shack, and in a matter of days it has broken. I called Radio Shack to report the problem, and was told that it was not an issue with the radio, but with the antenna, which was placed too far away from the device. I contacted my local radio shop to see if there was a better antenna available, and they were unable to locate any, either in stores or in home catalogs. I returned the item with no answers from Radio Shack. I have since returned this device and purchased a less expensive one. I could not find any similar problems with this radio. It's obvious that Radio Shack didn't understand the issue. I do not recommend buying this item, nor any radio for that matter. I was only able to purchase it because the local radio store was unable to obtain a replacement for a few days. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was so excited when I received this device that I was not able to take pictures without touching it. As soon as I got the device, I immediately turned off the lights, took my time to set up the devices properly, and then ran off the battery. I finally got around to getting the camera to take picture of my desk, but I had a difficult time getting any images to come out. Even at that point, the image was not that clear.  All in all, this product is a total waste of money, and it would probably have been much better if I had bought a different brand of digital camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 3 of them, and two of the units arrived broken. I ordered another 3, and they did not arrive, and the UPS person I had sent them to told me they had already shipped. It is a shame, I expected better quality.

I am planning on sending it to an electronics store for another replacement. I would recommend you avoid this purchase

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After the first few weeks with the CD player, it is clear this is a piece of crap. The volume is too low.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It did not take long before the speaker was broken. So the stereo wasn't very loud and the volume of the audio was lower.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this speaker in the hope that it would be good for our family of 5. I bought it on Monday and have had it for the past 2 days. However, it is not as quiet as I would have liked and seems to not have as great a range. I feel like I could have ordered a larger speaker and the sound would have been better. I would not recommend this speaker for any price. It is only good for a couple of people. I returned it in hopes that it will come in better. If you buy this speaker, I would recommend that you return it. I am very disappointed

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this adapter and was very disappointed. First off, you cannot plug the adapter into an electronic device. You need to have a power cord attached to the adapter. If you buy it, buy an adapter that allows you to plug into any device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this a few weeks ago, and it works great for my 2 year old. However, I recently took it apart. I am very disappointed with the quality of the unit. I have never had anything like this happen. The cord came out of the case with the camera, and the case cracked open. I took pictures of both the broken case, and cords. The cords were not the right length, so they did not fit properly into the case. I returned it to eBay, and they sent me a new case that has the correct length.  I took it back to my local store, and I told them it was defective. The case came with a 2 year warranty, but when I got it back, it was not the same as the case I returned. I contacted eBay customer service, and told them I needed the original case, but the customer service representative stated it was a factory defect. I decided I would be wasting my time with this, and returned the unit to eBay. I also sent in pictures of the wires that came out, and sent them back. However the unit was returned, the case did not come with a refund or replacement.  The only reason I am giving it two stars is the customer support I had.

I was able to fit about 6 inches of them in there.I returned the boxes, and I'm going to use something else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one of these about a year ago and used it for about one year, it was great, but then I noticed that I could not plug it into my computer.  I searched about a week, found that the problem was with the battery.  No problem, I just replaced the battery, and it worked fine.  But when I wanted to remove the battery from the case, the whole thing would come apart.  So then I went and bought the one they had in store, and that worked fine too, but this thing is really flimsy, and is hard to handle.  Very inconvenient

I also tried the cable it comes with but that's too short, so it's useless.I would have been happy with a replacement, but I had to pay another $50 for shipping when I got it back to the local store.I ordered it from Amazon, and I got to wait a week to get it.The return policy was great but the store was not very helpful at all.I'm sure this is just a matter of inconvenience as I am not getting what I paid for and I can't even return it.If I can get a refund for the price difference, then I'm good, but that seems like a lot to ask.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After over 10 years of use, the product has finally failed. It won't power on, it seems. No matter how much I clean it up, it will still not work. I've contacted several tech support reps, and have heard nothing back from any of them. This is the worst warranty claim I've ever heard, it's ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought I had a good purchase when I ordered it and it was shipped promptly. However, it took over 6 weeks to arrive. I have contacted Apple and they stated that it would ship on a certain day. I received it in September and it is still not in the mail. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  This does not fit the exact dimensions.I have used the 2.5 inch one for years and finally had a chance to purchase it today.I will now never recommend this as I will be replacing it with my new Pioneer CDTV with the same exact measurements. It is a shame. I wish they would take off the foam and have a better fit.They even made a slight modification to the product which was easy to do.It was very hard to measure the right size.I had to buy another one that fit perfectly and I had to measure it with a digital caliper.I could not even measure the foam before I was forced to return it.The product itself is just very loose and cheap feeling

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device thinking it was a very good value for a good quality set of audio cables. But, I've never had a problem with this product so far. I've only had it a couple of days and it already seems to be losing its functionality. There's no way it can be a good value if it doesn't do anything to help with audio problems. This should not be sold as a solution for audio problems. The item is designed to fix audio problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit came with a dead battery. This is why it takes so long to charge. I contacted LG. The rep explained that the batteries must be installed in pairs. This does not eliminate the problem of having a dead cell at the end of the night. I sent the unit back to LG. I have not received a refund. The unit is defective. I hope that they replace this faulty item.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The batteries are very sensitive to voltage fluctuations and it will only take three cycles to get them in the same place. They are so stiff that I had to replace the batteries every month or so. The first one arrived in August 2007 and only lasted three months. After that it would only last a few months until I had my hands on a new one. I purchased the same ones again in November 2007 and received them on December 10th 2007. I have to take care of them every month, but they still do not last long. I finally threw them away. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This TV is defective.  It constantly goes out of power and it is impossible to fix.  I am considering returning this TV to the store for a refund and going with something else.  The cable TV provider that provides me with service is also going out of business.  So, there is no service in my area and they have already notified me that they are not renewing their contract and they will terminate me if I don't sign a new one.  This is not a good TV.  Buy something else 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say this product is a bad one. The picture of it on their website is a poor one. When you try to use the monitor with a VCR or the like it doesn't work.  I guess they will keep selling it but I will never buy another one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got it and the sound wasn't very loud. No other good electronic device came close to it for the price. It's so noisy that you don't want to use it for anything but listening. And if you listen for music it is very distracting as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very disappointed with the sound quality of this. I put in this as a replacement for my Yamaha Tribute. The quality is awful. It is not even audible. If it was a real bad speaker, it wouldn't be like this. It was the worst speaker I ever bought from Yamaha. I have the same pair of Yamaha speakers I purchased from eBay, and they both sound very good 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a couple of these for my wife and I to use. We use a lot of wireless computers in our office. It only took one week before the cables started coming loose. We had to order a replacement cable with a different length. We still had to use that cable to set up the systems and the other one to use it. These cables are cheap, but they are horrible quality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a few issues with this product:  1.  I didn't know I was installing my TV when I installed it. I was trying to install the software so I could add the video source to the receiver.  2. The firmware updates did not update my receiver correctly.  3. I have to install new firmware every few months, which only happens occasionally.  All of this is because of poor firmware updates on the transmitter.  If I were the customer I would not have purchased this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We have a few hundred of these in our office, and we never had any issues with them.

I used a roll of tape to cover the buttons, and it worked well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of the speaker is very poor. I would never recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was advertised as being a "High Power" wireless device, but my device is so weak, I don't think it even has enough power to do anything. The only "extra" I have is my laptop, which is plugged in to the wall via a cable and I have no signal. The device has a lot of flashing lights and is so loud I can barely hear it. I don;t think that's the "correct" way to describe this product, and it will never be my device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only reason this works is because of the packaging. But, if you don't want the box to show, you have to unscrew the case and put in a different kind of hard drive. No, you don'   have to pay for the extra part, because the price isn't the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this printer for Christmas last year and was very pleased with it. It did not last, however, and it has since been replaced. I did not read the instructions and thought that I was going to be able to print very large photos.I returned it and tried printing again, but it took a few times to work. I returned it in March and it was already broken. After searching the web for other reviewers complaining about the printer not working, I ordered a new one and waited several days for the printer to arrive.I was in and out of the office three days and still had to return it again to print.After a few attempts to return the broken printer, I finally got a new printer from Amazon that worked fine.However, the new printer is about $50 more than the first printer, and I would not recommend this printer to anyone who is expecting large prints to come out very quickly.The software is very difficult to configure and does not do a good job in regards to quality control, the printer is noisy and doesn't do the job at all. The printer is also very heavy and I could not print anything smaller than a sheet of 8 x 11 inch paper.In short, I'm not even sure this is a good printer for my purpose:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been very disappointed with this purchase.  If you want to go for a small display but don't want the extra money then this may not be for you.  The screen doesn't fit very well. I also noticed it does not come with any cases.  I haven't had this display for very long so I don't know what kind of problems I'm having with the screen. The screen is small, but it's also very thin so the fit doesn't look very good. If you are looking for a larger display you will have to find another store that is selling it. For what it's worth, the image is not as sharp as I expected, and I've found the picture quality to be worse than what I received from my local store.  It may just be that I have had different experiences with this display than others and I'll have to go with another store to find one that has the same picture quality I'm getting. All in all, I don�t think this display is the right choice for your needs. In addition, if you have a lot of kids, then I think you will find the display is much more suitable for them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had several problems with the product. First off, it was never mentioned that the cables would not be included with the purchase. There is an ebay item with all the cables already attached. This is unacceptable. Secondly, it is advertised as having a 30 feet cable. The cable ends that are in the packaging are only 26 inches. This simply means that there is no cable extension in the kit. The included extension will only be 30 inches long. This means that you cannot use the product as you'd like. I would strongly recommend that the cable extensions are purchased separately. The length of the cable extension is not adequate for my home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Had a problem with the charger, which was supposed to work with my Samsung 4GB memory cards. I returned it and sent in a new one which had the same problem. The battery also began to degrade. I finally figured out that I needed to put in a full charge, then do a short charge for the next 2 hours, then again short charge. The result was that the charger wouldn't charge for two hours. I took it back to a Best Buy store and they told me I could do it this way, but that would cost over $20. I wouldn't bother with a $15 charging station. I will be returning the charger and I suggest you do as well. The product is advertised as "Made in China"

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to send the box back to Amazon. They did fix the problem. However, I can see nothing wrong with this TV, in good lighting or good sunlight.   This TV will do nothing for you in a dark room or at night, even with the blacked out picture.  This is a great investment, you can get the TV for less money on eBay, but this TV will not last forever.  I sent it back to another vendor, but it is almost three weeks and I will have to send it again.  So you will have this TV for around 3-4 months before you have a TV you will use the entire time

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this TV on March 21, and it was delivered on May 22. By the time it was packaged with delivery, it was no longer in stock. I called to order, and when I called back, the salesman was having a technical problem, so I returned to get it. It was late at night, I was tired, and I didn't want to risk buying it when I wasn't sure I could get it before I ran out. So I returned it.I was not thrilled with the service either. The phone service was not good, and the return label was not printed correctly. I couldn't even use the store's credit card to check out.  So I had to return the TV, and return it again. The problem is the store can't print labels or send them, and they don't accept credit cards, so it was impossible to check on the return.I returned it on Friday, and that was the last time I got my TV.  They don't even have any TV inventory in the store. They have a ton of TVs, but they don the TV inventory there only once a year, so if you wanted one of those, you had to go to a different store.  In my case, I spent over $1000 on TVs just to get my TV, so there is not much that I would have done differently. I don't know if it was a bad batch, or if they will ever fix the problems, or even if they would honor my return, but the only option I had was to return it to another store, and hope that they would have them in stock, or I would go out and buy another one.  If I was going to buy one, I would just buy a TV, not a whole box. I would also suggest calling or emailing directly to see if the problem has been solved.  The only reason I could see not returning it is that I did not trust the store with my money. I will just have to stay with the TV until they fix it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I ordered the adapter, the box said that it is "compatible" with most DVD players, but I did not receive one that would work. I would recommend that you buy the adapter separately, because it does not work on Sony. You can purchase a separate adapter for this, for about $30. You may need a separate power supply, as well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this unit yesterday and installed it yesterday, and everything is working fine. But today my DVD player doesn't play movies.  I tried with different DVD players but this one didn't play either.  And my modem didn't work as well as the one I received from Amazon.com.  So, I tried again with the modem, and it didn't even work. So I called Amazon and the customer service said that it would be shipped to me tomorrow.  But it's already late, and there is no way I'm going to wait to have it installed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I didn't like this at all.  The sound was very boomy and not as loud as I expected.  I returned it to Radio Shack and they replaced it with an HP PCL-2000C.  No difference in sound or appearance.  Very dissatisfied with this purchase.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this item to use with my home theatre. When I started using it it worked fine. The problem is that after using it for a short while, my DVD player stopped working. I tried to use the DVD player again and it also stopped working, so I returned it. I then noticed that the speaker on my receiver was also disconnected

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping this would work out well. Instead, it didn't. It would work on my screen, but it wouldn't come to a stand with my monitor. Also, when you turn it off, it turns off instantly and you have to turn it back on again. No fun. It's frustrating because the monitor has to be switched on and off, and it's frustrating that it doesn't come with a stand, and that the monitor can't be rotated.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to use as a speaker in my new house. The cable came with a bad mic cable. I had to return it. But the sound was terrible and the speaker only works in my room. I'm not sure I want to go through the hassle of buying a new one.The mic cable works good though. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this cable for my Sony laptop (which has no USB ports and only has a DVD drive. The cable does work well for my TV. But the laptop only supports DVD drives. So I had to purchase a separate DVD adapter cable.  I have been unable to watch DVD movies on this cable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product expecting it to be more than it is. I thought it would come with a small case for my  computers, and an SD card for my memory cards.  But after a few months,  the case is still as heavy as before. The card is still useless.  The only reason I got it was because it was one of the many cheap products  at the Walmart, and it came with a nice case, SD card, and battery charger.  I figured I could use it to save some money, and I guess I have  done so. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cord from the remote is very short, which means you have to do a lot of shuffling with the remote to change songs. I only recommend this to music lovers who only need the video. It does not work well for watching TV or playing videos. The cord is very flimsy and I was afraid to keep my remote on it because it would break easily. I returned the unit and returned the product itself. I also wish I would have sent a return authorization form and given a full refund. You have to return the product, or you won't receive a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I have had this for about a month. I installed a second computer in the house and I noticed the device was in a lot of use. I had to reset it every day to keep the connection to the computer. I sent the unit back. It's a piece of junk. I would not recommend buying this product for the price it is advertised. I can get better products for less money, but not this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item, but could not use it on my laptop. I called and told them about my issue and they told me to return it.  I did so, and it was sent to me.  A few days later, I got a bill for the shipping fee which was supposed to be $8.00.  The customer service representatives told me that the fee for return was $3.99.  Unfortunately, my return was rejected by them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The item arrived fine, but the device does not work. It is very hard to change channels on this device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the only bad thing about it, the screen is very blurry. I was using a Panasonic screen and the only solution I found to get this thing to work is to turn the brightness down to 10 or less and it works fine. However, if you turn the dial to 5 or higher, the image becomes blurry.  I have not tried to remove the screen protector or remove it from the unit but will report back about that after I have some free time 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these to replace my damaged wireless receiver. I had to return it right away because of the bad connection of the receiver.  The receiver works fine in my other living room. I'll have to return this one, as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, it was the wrong brand for the right price. Second, it is a small, very awkward device. There is no easy way to mount it anywhere and you have to carefully position the unit so it is balanced in the palm of your hand, even with your weight on your shoulder. Finally, the unit has a bad problem of overheating and no matter how much you turn the temperature down, it just doesn't work very well. I don't know what's the deal with the packaging, but I won't buy any more of them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a high end product, but not very versatile.  The microphone on the remote works very well, but the mic is on the back and doesn't fit on the front.  We bought this unit because of the very high price, and it's a great deal to buy this and then add some additional items.  I was disappointed with the performance of the microphone and the remote.  If you don't mind spending a little more money you might be better off sticking with the more versatile models, but for our needs we're getting the mic and remote. There's not much to say about the sound quality, except the sound is not that great on the speakers, and the sound isn't that great through the headphones either

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the same item as others in a big box, and it is not what is in the description. This is not for me. The item is packaged to look like it is, and I don't want to open it to see how it works. The box does not come with a case, nor is the item any different from what is described as the product that is in my order. I am going to return this item, not because of the bad packaging, but because of it's poor instructions and description. You would think the package would be labeled in the same way, or at least have a box or bag that says, "Here are the components in the box. Take them out." So the instructions are simply to take the items out, unpack, and look at it in the package. Why is this not clear? I received one of these boxes. Now that I have received it, it is more complicated.

I did not buy it here

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The thing is, I'm a professional photographer and I don't have that many lenses in my kit. I'm still trying to find one that I like. My Canon lenses are great, the Tokina is okay, and the Sigma has gotten a bit slower. I found that the Tamron works fine, but it wasn't great at all. I would never recommend this lens 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one of these about a year ago thinking I was getting a great deal for a good deal.  The unit arrived with 2 cracked batteries, one of which was in the original packaging, which I was not told about until after I received the package.  I returned the unit, but only because the problem persisted.  These batteries never showed up in the box, which was supposed to be a pre-paid shipment

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have no doubt that this product is more than worthy of the name but the delivery of the unit itself was slow and frustrating. The instructions for opening the unit are not in a single booklet but rather four separate PDFs and one was in very poor quality. I was disappointed and went away disappointed. If this is what you expect from a top quality electronic device why buy it, save yourself a trip and return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  I bought this speaker for my wife and she had the same trouble. I thought it might be my fault but my wife got the same thing. This speaker came with a bad instruction manual. There is a video included in the box that gives all of the correct instructions. But they didn't help my wife or me. We ended up having to return this speaker and get a different one for ourselves.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used this product for years. I have had to return the product for 2 days. I know that's not much, but it's a good idea to make sure you don't use too much power, and when you do, it only lasts a few days, before you need to replace it.I don't want to put a negative rating on something I've always used to make music. I would never buy the product again. I'm just disappointed

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would say that this thing is not durable. The picture of it shows it having a great design, but the case is made of a plastic material that deteriorates over time. It is very, very difficult to keep it looking new. So, for only $150, you can pick up several other cases, and if you take care of it, it will last for a long time. However, it is not worth the trouble, as you can buy many cases for under $100 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this monitor for less than a year and it doesn't work properly with Windows.

This monitor will only work on Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my old Yamaha CD player. But, it doesn't work at all. I called the customer service and they gave me the same answer - they can't replace it. I then called Yamaha and they told me that they don't carry it and they are not able to give a return authorization for the defective unit. I sent it back and told them that I'm done with this electronic device and I just want the defective one. I also bought a cheapo speaker cable and plugged it in and it doesnot work either. I know, it's just a CD player, but it's expensive and is supposed to sound great. So I am giving up

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever used.  The product looks good and is easy to install, but the picture is not to be trusted.  No matter how much you push it down, the device remains attached to the motherboard.  Then you have to push it back up and move it to a different location.  It just doesn't make sense to install on a motherboard and not have it properly secured to the board.  This product should not even be called a product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two and each time the charger I ordered arrived broken.

I sent another charger but the same story.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the first time I'm writing a negative about a  bad electronic  device.

It's time to find a better  router, and  do better work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I didn't need this item but my husband got it and installed it without even looking at the instructions. He couldn't do anything else but move it around the house, which was just enough to get the unit. This was after I said "I need that" and gave him my credit card. I have never seen a positive review about this item, but here it is. I thought I'd give a negative comment since this is the item that my husband installed without even reading the instructions on how to assemble it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I ordered these speakers I expected them to be very durable.  Well, they are a complete disaster.  They barely lasted 2 months out of the box.  The adhesive didn't hold very well and my wife thought they were damaged, but they didn't.  I returned them and tried to return them to Amazon, but Amazon didn't even accept that.  No good on Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was no problem with my router or the modem, but I was unable to connect with any other device to it. The modem's serial number did not show up, but the device's IP was.  I tried calling my ISP, but they were not helpful.  They said they were aware of the issue and would look into it, but no resolution was given to me.  Even though I live in a bad neighborhood and the building is infested with spiders, I would not recommend this device, especially to a first-time user 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased one of these on a whim and used it for a few weeks. When I got the case, I noticed that the rubber on the bottom of the screen cover was already peeling off. So I replaced the rubber and it still peels off. I called Apple, they are not to blame, but they need to put some effort into making this case last. I really do not recommend this case to anybody

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using the Dell Epson Inkjet Pro for over 3 years and it was very durable until today. I called Dell and they were sending me a replacement. I got the new inkjet and I have a new HP Pavilion and HP laptop running the new HP system. Dell didn't bother to replace any of the inkjet media, even when I asked.The new inkjets had the same problem with the ink. I did try to return the old inkjet and they refused to let me return it. So, I tried the new system and the ink is the same, as in the other systems. So I am stuck with both systems and they still will not replace my printer. I have already spent over $800.00 for new ink on two systems and my ink is still not coming. I don't even want the ink because it won't fit on both systems. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to do it, too, but with the new X5R II camera I was able to get a clearer picture, but it was still blurry. The X5L II camera just doesn't do that.  The X10D is a better solution, but still not the same. I have an HP inkjet printer, and it's very expensive to buy the new printer. I would rather have gone with X10A inkjet if the X5D II wasn't available.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was a bit surprised by the low price of this product. I tried it once but had no luck. I didn't get any light after about an hour of use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the most expensive product I have ever purchased and the one which caused the most problems. It's difficult to get it to stay on and it is very unreliable. The first time I used it I needed to put it on very quickly because I put it in my refrigerator and it was in use for less than five minutes. It would still be in use when I came out of the room. The second time I needed a replacement but they only sent me one replacement. One other bad thing about it is that it has a built in power cord and the cord does not fit into the outlet and it just hangs out. It didn't help that I had to unplug it to remove it from the refrigerator. I got a similar product from a local store about three years ago and it worked like a charm. If you are looking for a good value electronic device, this is not it. The product should have been replaced with a different model.

I have a Sony TCD-M903c with a Panasonic LUMIX kit and have yet to experience any issues with this unit. I am sure that this unit is better and much easier to use and set up, but I just cannot recommend it for this unit or any unit that you own. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm using this for a 2 port network switch. So far, all of my ports have shown problems with the soundcard. The first thing I did was buy the Epson printer drivers and then used the built-in monitor to adjust the speaker volume. Then I tried adjusting the sound card using the built in volume controls. Then finally I tried using the ESSO audio device to set it as the default speaker and the sound was horrible. The soundcard works fine on the computer, but on the printer it just doesn't function at all. I would advise not trying to use this with a 3 port network if you have only 1 port available. The Epson drivers don't seem to support 3 port Network printers. I did have to get the EPCOS printer drivers, so that might help. I used the printer to print some of the documentation that I needed for my new network. I just don't see this device being useful for anything else, it doesn't work with a 2nd printer, it seems to only work with the first printer. I can't recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device does not even have the capability to recognize the TV on the back, so you are supposed to take your TV to a friend's house to connect to the router.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this set about a month ago and I was extremely disappointed with the quality. The batteries are very hard to pull out and very difficult to reinsert. Even with the set already installed on the shelf, there is still a good deal of resistance between the batteries. The color of the lights is great, but the overall quality is a big letdown. I had to return these batteries in order to find someone that had better quality. I'm still getting the set from the store, but they will not ship to me any time soon. I have never owned any Apple products and I don't really care for their products, but I have to say that I will not buy anything from them again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this for a few months now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is not exactly what it claims to be. In my case, it would work better if I had some extra wire in my wall socket. Then, after I plugged the unit into the socket, the lights would appear to go off. The unit would also fail to work after the first time I had the unit plugged into the wall socket; but would work right after a few times. I would like to have it work without having wires hanging in the wall sockets, but it simply won't work as advertised. It was hard enough trying to get the unit to work in my garage and it just won't do that. Very disappointed with this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, I was very skeptical about buying this cable. I went through several different sets of cables and this is the least bulky set of cables I have tried so far. I was excited to purchase it, but it took several months to arrive. I sent a written complaint about the delay and it was quickly responded to with a response stating that they have no more inventory for this cable and that I should order from another vendor. It seems to me that they are waiting on inventory to return, not having stock.  I am a loyal customer and bought this cable in anticipation of receiving it in the mail. I haven't received it yet, but I'm willing to wait until they send out an inventory packet for this product and if that doesn't arrive, I'll start again. I don't expect this product to be discontinued, but they need to get stock and inventory in order.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these for my daughter's room but they lasted a very short time. So far the room has had no issues.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable didn't fit in the box, so I ordered an extra set, and found that one did not fit in another.I am giving this cable only two stars. I'm thinking that if you already have a TV that has an analog input, this cable should be able to work with your TV.The only problem I have is that the manual that came with the cable did not give any instructions on how to change the channels with the TV.I gave up on this cable, and ordered the one that was for the TV instead.I did have to pay for the extra cable, however, since it was not included in the package.Also, since you do not see any picture of the TV in the instruction manual, you will have to find it yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit hoping for the best and it did not even come close.

I took it back to the store and they did a refund, but the damage was already done. I could have been in a far more expensive station and had far better reception but I did not want to go back to that

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They are not compatible with any audio player.  They have the most annoying noise in my room. I also get sound interference when I plug them in and out. It takes forever to get them to output and they don't seem to be any quieter.  I ended up returning them because I have too many of these.  The sound quality is horrible

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you buy one of these for your home entertainment system, you are about as far from tech support as you can be. I sent in a return order immediately after purchase and had them send me a new box. No one will even look at your box if you send in one of their boxes, but you do have to do that. That's a bad idea for a home entertainment device. It's all about cost savings here

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this item in early June but only started using it in late June. At that time, it only took one day to lose 2GB of video files due to a glitch in the transfer process. I have already been sent replacement discs. I do not recommend this product for any serious videographer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had been using this phone for over a year and it started to have trouble with calls, text messages, and it became very very difficult to use. I would use it for one minute and it would die. It had no problem with video, but did not have enough battery for my needs. My last order was for a replacement unit and I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm sorry I had to send it back to Amazon. I'll buy another product, but only after I get my replacement. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device itself was fine for my needs, I used it to connect my PC to the TV and it worked fine. However, it was designed to be connected to an older TV set, in my case I've been using it for a while and I can't imagine how this type of device could perform any better.The only other issue I have is that I can never connect my laptop to the USB port, because it's too large for the case. It's fine to have it in the front of the TV, but it's not great if you want to hook it up to your machine for a quick connect. This device has too many issues 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this product and I was not able to connect it at first. I have to return it. I didn't like that the product is not fully packed in a cardboard box. I think it is good quality, but I don't want to send it back to the manufacturer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So this product was so inexpensive that I just used it to record audio for a couple of days. But, once I started to use it to capture the sound of the house from inside my living room, I found that I was only able to record the sound from my own speakers. Therefore, I would not recommend this product for recording, as it may not record all of the sounds inside of your house. And, to add insult to injury, the unit is so fragile that I thought I dropped it when it slipped out of the case. The only other thing that I can recommend is not to use the unit in humid areas. It was a bit too hot inside my house. But I still bought the product anyway. It didn't work at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is NOT the right thing to buy for the price you pay. It looks like the picture is photoshopped, no matter how you look at it it's not going to look like the real thing 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased two of these for my daughters laptop and PC. Both were returned within a few days, with one being too large and the other being just under the size of the product. They both work fine, but the laptop has more of a problem, and it's because of the way the product is packaged. One of the units was shipped with a small foam insert inside, with little foam inside the case. The other unit had a large foam insert, which allowed the computer to sit directly on the foam insert. I was very disappointed, because both units worked fine, and I did return them both within a week. They have never been returned to me since, and now they are sold out on the website, with no sign of them being restocked any time soon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item from Best Buy in September, but I received it only in late February. I received the replacement unit, and it still doesn't work. I called Best Buy, and the technician recommended a return to purchase a new unit. I returned the defective unit and ordered the new unit in March.  I don't have a computer and only have the internet at home and work. So, I can't even use this as a secondary device on my personal computer. I'm extremely frustrated, and don't understand why a good electronic device such as this cannot deliver performance when it is supposed to 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device doesn't fit in any standard USB port. The cable is not strong enough to support it. You can't even plug it in any USB port, since it has to be inserted. You'll have to buy a USB to VGA cable to use it in your computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't really know what else to say, the connector was loose and had to be pulled out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the product for my son and he just couldn't even use it.  I called Amazon and they said it was a bad battery.  He would put it on and he would be able to use it for about 15 minutes.  My son did not even have the proper case for it and he was not able to put it in his car or take it to school. It was just annoying that I couldn't use it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The receiver has no picture quality. The antenna is loose and the receiver itself is not too good. The receiver was sent to me in excellent condition, but the case is not strong enough to hold the receiver. The case only held my receiver up on the table for a short period of time.The receiver can only hold up to 4 devices.I have been using my receiver since the last 6 months and would have been very disappointed if it did not return in good shape. I will not be buying anything from this company again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had one of these in my room for over 4 months. The sound was horrible, it wasn't even able to turn on and off.  Even when it was turned on and set to a specific temperature, the sound was still bad. I finally took it back after my wife told me that I needed a good sound system in my house, not just a room that could be left unplugged for extended periods of time. I still haven't been able to get this system to work, and I'm extremely disappointed.

I have a brand new Sony player and am not the type of person that wants to put up with these type of issues. So I don't have any expectations of getting this to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had several of these, and the worst thing about it is that you have to buy them each separately, and then you have them sitting on the shelf and waiting for you to buy a new one each time you order one. I don't know why they do that 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 2x units of the unit and they did not come from the dealer in NY. They ordered them from Amazon.I am not very impressed with the product as of now.The unit works ok.I would recommend you try and call Amazon Support about this.Their customer service is really bad.I received one unit from Amazon and they returned it.I ordered it from Walmart as my first stop and they shipped it.After that I went to Amazon and tried to make a return order.But Amazon returned it after 7 days!!I will not be ordering from Amazon for now 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I took a few steps to avoid this problem, but after a while I had to return it because I simply cannot use it. It can work if you plug in the adapter, but the only time that it works is if it's at the bottom of the desk where there's no other power sources. You need to be able to reach the adapter by the computer or on the floor, or you'll have to stand up to plug the device in.It's a very clunky piece of equipment. It's got the look of a very old electronic device and does not come with any kind of instructions.If it worked as advertised, I would've been happy with it, but it seems like you can only have a few adapters connected to the unit, which makes it very difficult to plug in if the unit is at the top of the office and you're using the device with other computers. I would really recommend looking elsewhere for a good device.I would suggest looking at this, it works well, it's very easy to use, and it's cheaper.But, I don't think I'll be using this product for many years, 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The device is too low and not adjustable. Not sure how it is that they make these if they are so cheap. I have to put a lot of pressure on it to get it to move in the right direction

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product about a month ago and it is only now that I've tried it. It's only okay if you are working with light sensitive areas. Otherwise it has a low contrast. The only reason I returned this item is because of a bad box. It was not marked as an import and was not even shipped in the usual mail. I returned it and got it from another source.I've returned my other units too. It is a disappointment that I have to return this. I ordered a replacement in a few days

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD is horrible. I couldn't even see my screen, just a black screen. I have had it for a couple weeks and still can't figure out how to switch the output to my TV. I think I might have to buy a new one, or I'll have to go with some black-sheen LCDs.The software is very bad. I've tried to contact Dell several times and each time I have been given the same email. I don't have a clue why it is taking so long to get a response.I don't see how this can be fixed. I know there are a lot of people who don't like this kind of monitor but I have to say that I don:t. The monitor looks so good that I'm not sure why I even have it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these to make some changes on my TV.  The screen is slightly less than I would like it to be, so I had to buy new mounts.  No joy with this product

I am still looking at several options before I buy a new model 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I paid over $400 for this speaker. I'm not sure why they are selling these for so much money, when they are not exactly great speakers at all. There is no bass and it is very boomy and not very clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is the connector is so flimsy and the connector doesn't even have a backside to protect it. I tried it without any luck.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace a pair of cheap earbuds, not knowing the bad thing was the wires. This is where I got the first run-around from the dealer, he said I should return the earbud, and I told him that was an order of magnitude too high. I have a pair that I'm working with. I'm not very pleased with these earbUDis, they are too short, too hard to fit into earcups, and they have a bad cable. I'll have to give them a try and see if I can get a good one with a better cord, or return them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is designed to be mounted in the ceiling. The device is designed and marketed to be used with only one end of the line, with some slight variations. That means that if you are using the device for the purpose that you intended for it, it will not fit.  This device is no good 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed when I took it out of the box. I thought maybe I ordered it incorrectly and when I opened it I found that the batteries did not fit inside.  I tried to cut the cables that came with it but I couldn't get it to fit into my computer case.   Very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this as a gift and it is nothing like I expected. I received it in about a week. My husband and I are both very disappointed. I can't believe the price is $20-$30. I thought we were buying a $100 item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I paid close attention to the other reviews, but my unit was not defective. I was just underwhelmed.  It's the kind of thing that seems to exist to give people the impression that it's cheaper and better than it actually is, and I just don't see how I could have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are not exactly the ones you want to put in the wall. The color doesn't match the wall and the cords are difficult to get to the wall (so hard you can't see through the cables!)  I tried to use the cord holder that comes with the units, but it only worked half way through. I found this out when I tried and soldered a different one on. I did that for three hours. It worked fine, but I didn't care to keep trying. I tried putting the unit in the door of a closet (it didn't fit) and putting it in the side panel of the same closet. It didn't do any better. Finally, I just took it apart (with a bit of pain) and put it in my basement.  It didn\'t fit. It wasn't the same color as the wall, the cord wasn\'t any where near where I wanted it, and the wires were difficult to put up where I would want them. I decided to give it a pass and get something that is better suited for me, and that is the one from Lowe's 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had it for a few weeks, and it is not working with a new computer.  I contacted both Dell and HP, and the only response I got was from Dell.  If it was something Dell could do to fix it, why don't they take care of their customers?  The only way to get Dell to even look at the problem is to send them a defective box (the defective unit).  So basically I'm stuck with the problem for another 5 months until they come out with a replacement 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to buy a new CD player from my local store after my old one broke. I found this CD player to be far more durable, and much easier to set up than the old one. However, the software and documentation are outdated, and they don't support all the features of this model. I did get a good deal on one new CD Player with a lower price point than this one, but you still have to pay for the shipping fees. I ended up with the same model and had to call them to confirm that they could ship a CD player with this model that has all the functionality of the model that I got from them. I was then told that I would be getting a second CD Player and I would have to return the first one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was absolutely no problem in pairing with the iPhone but the Apple logo came up on the screen and the computer would freeze every time I tried to use it. I have it plugged into an Apple television. It is extremely difficult to use on my flat-screen TV with large amounts of text and other graphics, and I have no other way to view graphics on the computer.The problem is not with the monitor, it is with the computer and cable that it is connected to. There is no way to resolve this issue except to return the monitor to Apple for replacement or purchase of another monitor with a better picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the product in Dec 2008, and I waited to see how long it would take to receive the product, so I ordered another item for use with it to give me the full picture of what was going on, and it was not long before I got a call from the company informing me that the item was "not in stock" and I would have to wait. I immediately cancelled the order and called back to order the other item I had ordered (so it would be good for Christmas) and this time, they told me that they have already received the order 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a poor quality product. If I had to use it to control a DVD player or some other device, it would have to be replaced with a better quality product with the same features. I didn't even have a chance to test this product on a few computers before giving up on it. This is an absolute waste of money, if you buy it, don't expect to have any trouble with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very skeptical about this item and then when I received it, it looked like a broken electronic device. I returned it, and tried it again. I am not positive that the broken nature of the device is caused by this defective part, but the fact that I have to use a soldering iron on the connection to the case when removing it from the case to get it out of the way of the cable is annoying and it requires a lot of patience and effort to get this thing out of place 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is only meant for the TV's in my apartment, and not for my regular laptop. The video does not work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is probably one of the worst speakers I have ever had.  The first time I set it up the sound was very poor and the midrange was distorted.  After it was in place for two weeks I had to return it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very poor quality electronic device, only has a 3.5 in. diameter.  We tried to fit it to the inside of the computer case. It was very difficult, and the end result of this was that the device would not go into the computer.  I did not even try to use the card as a video card, and then you can see the results: it looks like you are in an old black and white TV.  The graphics are very bad.   This product was defective, and not only did it fail to fit properly into the case, it failed to come out of the case as well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable has a small plastic covering over it that just makes it look like the whole unit is metal. It is not metal, it's plastic.   I bought this unit thinking it would do everything I needed from an interface card.  Instead I found that it only connects to the VGA monitor, and that's about it.  It has no card support for video, and no software for this monitor. I did have a good deal of luck getting this to work with an AVP, but the VESA support was only for a few programs.  I eventually bought the AVP monitor, which is a good monitor, but I would not recommend this to anybody 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this item and took it home only to discover after use that it needed to be removed from the carton and the case closed to be stored in the refrigerator.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the only device that my wife and I are comfortable with.  The color is not vibrant, the audio does not sound as good as we would like it to.  I would strongly recommend buying a better electronic device, one that works better and looks more attractive.  My wife would not buy it, it looks like a toy.  You could even argue that the display is not large enough to show the most important features, which would also make this device less useful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They are too heavy.  You can't fit one under the table because it weighs too much.  The batteries are very cheap, they are disposable and have to be bought new every time.  I ended up cutting up my carpet so the cables could pass.  It's extremely cumbersome.  If I were to buy them again, I'd take a more hardwearing cord.  And it's not that they're not easy to get.   I have ordered 2 times from them, and had 2 different batteries, yet it's still a mess and I still have to return them every time

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered this for the purpose of monitoring my children. I put them on the couch and monitor them while they play. The unit is very good, but only for monitoring. I did not use the camera, it was not needed. No way to get on the screen with the remote control to monitor. I would not recommend this item to anyone. The quality is not there, the remote is hard to work with, and you need to get an RCA to RCA cable to use the device. I returned it. I was able to use a VHS camcorder for monitoring, which is better, but you need two boxes to do this. You will have to use 2 cameras and get the cables.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item was sent from Amazon via overnight UPS and was supposed to arrive at my house Monday. I sent an e-mail to Amazon and they assured me that I would receive my item in a few days. I have received this item and it is so hard to use. I am sorry for all the time that has gone into this transaction and I have had to deal with the Amazon Customer Service department. The item did not arrive at the time scheduled and it was returned to Amazon with no tracking number. I contacted Amazon again and they told me that they have never sent these kind of items to me and that I need to contact Amazon customer service. It is now 6 days later and I still do not have my product. I do not understand how a product this bad can be shipped by overnight UPS. Please do yourself a favor and return it to Amazon or send me a refund

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had these headphones for the last 6 months, and they have not once provided the performance I expected. They are much too small for my ears, and are quite noisy in my living room. They also come with a bad sounding wire (red wire) that is very difficult to remove. I have tried several different ways of removing the wire, and it has always turned out to be a disaster. I decided to return them and try another brand, and that is exactly what happened. I returned the pair, and ordered another pair. When I received them, they were just the same as the first pair. In fact, they had a horrible and horrible sound quality that was quite difficult to hear in my apartment, and even in the car. I'm back to ordering the same model (i will not even consider this brand again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product arrived packaged in an obvious cardboard box. When opened, it was immediately clear that the product had been placed in a plastic bin and not in its original box.I called for return of product.They said it was not their problem because the product was opened.I then called for a refund of the purchase and the cost of shipping.The customer service representative said that they could not refund because they were not allowed to return the product.I said that it was their problem and the product could be returned. She said she would mail a credit in the future to keep them honest.I have not received a refund yet.I would just suggest to anyone who buys a bad item,that they return the item in its box and not a plastic bag and call for a return of the items.It is not a good idea to buy this item with the intention of returning it and then never receiving the refund.I think there is a better way. I just hope I can get a good credit so that I can keep my bad experience in check.Thank you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable is extremely cheap.  The color and quality are good, but the color of the video signal isn't exactly how it's supposed to be.  I just received my HD video equipment today, and it looks great, but this cable doesn't. The signal color and the video output isn't what it's suppose to be, and the signal quality isn't great either.

There was a bad connection in the line and that was how I ended up with this monitor (and the HDMI cables that I bought at that time). I called my supplier's number and they offered to send me another unit, but it took weeks to get the shipment.  The cables were fine for me (I am a heavy user of them). This unit is not for me and that's because the cable is very short (I usually have to plug it in from the TV into the monitor). There is also a problem that I have with my setup that I am using this for, but I cannot go into details. I will also say that I like the LED indicators on the bottom.  There are some other features I don\'t like about the monitor. The monitor is a little bit too tall for me, so I usually have it on the back of my TV.  However, I do like the large stand, so it\'s not a deal breaker for me

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I thought this was for video recording. I'm thinking I should have just gone with my camcorder that I bought years ago and not this, I'm still looking for the right camcorders 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this speaker from Amazon and I have not had any problems. However, I did receive the same speaker that I had ordered with a different type of cable. However the sound that I received was a lot louder and a lot more rumbling. It also made my room sound a lot better than it did before I purchased it. I don't have any further issues with the speaker yet and it has done nothing to improve my audio quality. I would have received a much better audio quality if I had received a different kind of cable or the speaker itself. I have yet to return the speaker to Amazon and that is why I am not very optimistic about my experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I got it, I was ready to install it on the PC to use as an external hard drive, but it did not do anything. I tried to install windows, and tried it on several computers with no success. I returned it, and bought an island-traveler's laptop, which is much faster than the Thinkpad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, I ordered these with incorrect size. They're exactly the size of the regular ear buds, but the only way to fit them is to have the earpieces that you want to insert in the back of your ear. I ordered them at Amazon and they shipped to my door without any extra packing or instructions. The company that ordered them didn't seem to care about the product that they sent. I was so disappointed, that I couldn't wait to order some other set that I can try. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had to return mine.  But, I will still buy them because they are made for those who are not satisfied with the sound quality, or who are looking to save money on their equipment 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Had to change the adapter. But did not like the fact that it only fit into one end. So I took it to a friend of mine. They are very knowledgeable about these things and the price was too high for a 1/2 hour appointment. I could not return it, since the adapter was already in his office. So he just went out to get it. He returned to find that it was in his car. This happened twice. The adapter is so unreliable that it is not worth buying a good electronic device that only works with one end adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing works great for my home theater system, but the soundstage is not very big. I also had to buy another box with a slightly bigger soundstage. It's very noisy when connected to the speakers. I would recommend you wait for a higher quality AV box that you can buy for cheap 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got it for Christmas. It has to go in your bag if you are traveling. There is a lot of flex in the cord. I got one that fit on my neck but it left a mark on my arm. So I returned it and ordered the right one. It took me 3 days 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very bad, not even worth a mention in the description, but it did nothing for the price: I have to cut it off and put a new connector on the line.It's also way too easy to accidentally short out and ruin your line (I used to do that too many times 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very disappointed with the quality and performance of the unit. It worked out great when connected to a USB cable, but then the cable would not reliably hold a device. It would lose power and then reset. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound of the speaker is weak and I have to turn down the volume and adjust the speaker placement. I would not recommend buying this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this monitor for about two weeks and I still can't figure out why there is a big red border around the picture.  It's fine when the screen is tilted to my right.  When I place the screen back at the default position, the red border comes back.  The monitor has an adjustable black border.  I don't know if it's adjustable because I haven't seen it on any of the online support pages 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I paid $100 for a very bulky unit. It worked fine in one room, then it started leaking.I returned the unit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought the unit today and have only used it once. It is not very easy to adjust the volume or adjust the audio, only with the click of the remote. It takes too much time to set up and then use the device to get any sort of audio from the television. The unit is very noisy, so you can't expect to get a good listening experience out of the TV when you have to stand outside to adjust and use the remote to set the volume. It also has a very loud fan, so it would be a good idea to use a portable fan when you are away from home to keep the unit cooler. I have had no luck with any of the available TV audio connectors, so I would highly recommend avoiding this unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The TV can be adjusted from a set height to 4.3ft, but the sound is awful. I purchased this TV in January, and it arrived in late February.  It looks like I will have to return it, and start the search again for a good sound TV 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product itself was not good, the electronic device itself was even worse.  I contacted several computer stores and no one is carrying this product, not even in the store I'm currently working out of.  We had to return the entire PC and buy another one (even though I've only had it for 4 hours).  The worst part about all of this is that I paid for the warranty only to have to return it and buy yet another computer.  My only good review about this is to note that the return process is easy enough, but I would suggest that you not even bother trying to return a defective unit if you are shopping for something other than a simple cable modem and router solution, unless you want to buy more than one computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very bad. Have to pull my hair out trying to get any information to save money on this item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would not buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There are so many different ways to connect the Sony Walkman to your TV, I've used only one that works for me. And, I have to admit, this product is only marginally better than others on the market. The picture quality is the lowest and sound is also very poor. The cord is thick and heavy, and the device is very heavy and awkward to carry around. I can see the appeal, but I can't justify paying that much money for a product that doesn't work. I'd rather have the more expensive CD player, if you want to be fancy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my VHS card and was hoping to get it working with my Sony DVD player. I have never used a VHS/DVD player. The card doesn't work with my DVD player's card reader. All the DVD player cards I've purchased don't work, and the ones with the most RAM don't even work. I guess that's why they are making VHS cards. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, the software on the CD-RW drive does not look good. Next, the interface was slow and didn't appear in my monitor. Third, the CD drive will not read the CDs. I ended up returning the drive because it was so bad 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the monitor and it came with a cable but it didn't fit very well. I had to run the cable through the back panel and through the monitor itself 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   So far I have used it for about two months and it has broken 3 times. I tried getting it in and out of the device. I bought it thinking that it would be better than the other ones, but it seems like it's going in and making it harder to unstick and release. I am still hoping that they will fix this issue, but for now I will have to go buy another one to have the same problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this product for years and now all my electronic devices have gotten much smaller and thinner. So I was very disappointed to learn that all this was not designed to be used with a computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After reading all the negative reviews about this product  I decided not to buy it for my system. I tried several times and this product is NOT stable and never keeps up with the demands of my computer.  I was hoping for something with better warranty, but sadly, it is not there. I'm a little upset about all of this because this product seemed so good until it didn't work.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a heavy-duty PC user. I use a system with about 4 T4 drives and only about 4 GB of RAM.  So I am looking for a system that I can easily use without any problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased this item as an add on to my Sony E6500.I did not like the way it fit into my TV.The way it comes apart and snaps back together is a bit of an adventure.It is a great picture but it is hard to do it when you are in a very small space.I have seen a few negative reviews about the device and this is definitely not one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this TV for a Christmas present and it never worked. We had it for about 5 months before it finally died. I went back and bought a much better model that worked right out of the box. Then I ordered the new one. But it never arrived and my new TV is stuck in an extended-time-out mode. I contacted Samsung and they told me there was nothing they could do about it. I was about to return the defective TV for another one, but this one is stuck. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is NOT a high quality device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The only good thing about this is you can find the exact model for sale on eBay, but they're all really expensive. I got the Dell monitor with the DVI, and it worked great in most of my applications. The only reason I didn't give it a four-star rating was because I needed to turn the screen off while working on the computer, and the picture would only show up in small squares. Also, it was a pain to use with two screens on a network, and they were very inconsistent in brightness levels. I would go as far as to say that it is unusable with one screen in use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Got this about 3 weeks ago, and while I am very impressed with the color, it is not vibrant enough for me. I'm not sure why I didn't try using the "warm" setting. My camera is already at warm, and that has not changed at all. I'd rather buy a cheaper, less colorful model like the Sony NP900 or some other model 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First I ordered a printer. This does not print correctly. It does not go well with the Canon Epson ink jet. The screen will not focus correctly and the software is hard to use.  I have returned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product came with the wrong connector to use the device in the back of my computer. It came with an adapter, but was not compatible with my monitor.I was unable to return for refund, so I bought a second one off of Amazon. It was about $30 more than I paid for the first one, but the display is not the same, the colors are not the right, etc.I got a much better picture with the adapter, and the price was a good deal for the price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the 4GB SD card, and it only worked for a few months. I went through all of the troubleshooting steps, and still had problems. I did have this SD card for about a year, and I still have trouble with it. There are problems with it working and not working, and the card just keeps getting more and more unreadable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very expensive, heavy and awkward to install. The unit has a very small backlight, so only very dark images are displayed. I did a lot of research before I purchased this item, and decided against it. My home theater only uses 12 LED TV's and this item does not cover the entire display.I am very disappointed with this purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After using a very inexpensive Sony DVD player for many years, it became evident that Sony has no vision for the future. I received a refurbished version of the Sony player, but the picture quality was still very poor. I returned the unit, and am still waiting for Sony to deliver a refurbishable unit. It seems to me that Sony is doing nothing to bring new technology to their products, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to recommend Sony products.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is no way to get the DVD drive in my computer to work. I called and they did send a replacement. The drive was fine, I got the error code and was not able to load the DVD. I sent the replacement disk off for repairs and now it's back. I don't know what else to do... The computer won't even turn on! I got it from Best Buy for $10 less than it was on Amazon.com, but it wasn't worth it to me. There are only two or three times I've even seen them on sale on Amazon...and they're only $35 on Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for something to plug into my computer. After receiving the adapter, I checked the specifications and noticed it was not listed as compatible with the monitor on my PC. No warranty. I returned it and asked for a refund.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was to replace a broken TV remote. I received the package with only two items. This product is not advertised with what it is actually capable of. This item should have included an LCD monitor, a wireless receiver, and a remote. It didn't.  I was charged $45 plus $7.99 shipping 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product and it did not work. I called and was told it was a defect and to return it for a refund. So I ordered a new item but that did not help either. I did order the product from Amazon but had to return the item and wait until they returned it from my return address. So far I have to have called and called Amazon to get the credit back. I ordered another item from Amazon and it was also defective. I returned both items and they did not reimburse me. I would have returned them with no problems but I did not. I think the problem is that they have this thing called a software update that cannot be installed on a PC that has not been fully configured. If you are installing it on a laptop that does not have a hard drive, it will be a disaster. If this is a problem for you, I suggest not buying this item.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased this to record my daughter and her friends' playlists, but the audio quality is too poor and the device is very noisy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is a positive review on the other site:  I am very happy with this item, but it is definitely not the most convenient 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The picture looks better in real life than in the picture on the web. However, the color is too saturated for a serious user. The video is only about 2/3 of the way through the film, and it's quite noticeable. The only problem is that it doesn't seem to work with the VCR that comes with the DVD player. It also seems that the color and saturation seem to change when you move the unit, which is odd since it seems to be an integrated system. I am having very little luck with this unit, but it seems like most of the other reviewers are having much better luck. I have been able to install it on a VCR and it works fine. However I have had issues with it working with the television. I hope this is the issue for some people, but I'd not recommend it for serious video usage
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes about 20 minutes to connect to the Internet. The price of the product, I got it from an online store, and was not happy with the shipping time. The same thing happened with my order. I asked the online store to refund, but they told me that they will not refund the shipping fee that I paid to ship to China for them to have it ship from China.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm very disappointed with this device. I have not been able to connect my MacBook Pro to it. I was using a Mac to connect to it for a few weeks, then I realized how flimsy it is. After several weeks with my new MacBook Pro, this device has not been used. It doesn't even turn on, it just seems to be sitting on the shelf. My solution is to just buy a USB2 to USB 3 adapter and use it to connect the MacBook Pro with this system to this device - but then that will only work on Windows.  I have been using the same MacBook Pro for a month and I haven't had any luck with this.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had this device in my hand and tried to remove it the first time, but it was stuck. I was able to remove the cover. The only other time I've tried it, the cover did not come off. I guess I'm going to have to order another one! I have a very poor electronic device collection, so this one is out of order.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is not the way to go. I used this in my digital audio player and it just started to fail. The unit is useless. I contacted Apple and the tech support rep said it was to blame on the connection cable. The cable was not compatible with my unit. I ended up paying for the unit to be replaced and it worked fine until the last few weeks of use. I would not recommend this product to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using the dongle for two weeks now and I'm still looking for a problem to fix. Every time the unit powers on it seems to make a lot of noise and the image is blurred in the center. I had a little trouble setting up the cable last night because I am a beginner and I have not been able to find the documentation on the web. I really don't like the price that I'm paying for it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The sound is the same as the Sony earphone in terms of clarity and punchy bass. However, it is too heavy and bulky for portable use.The earphone doesn't work in the ear to keep it in place and also the sound tends to be very bass heavy.I really hate this earphone, I'm not sure why Sony decided to launch it on the market with no guarantee of quality, it was a poor decision to waste money on it.I hope Sony brings out a superior model soon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:  The unit only works in the lowest possible audio setting. I have only had it for about 2 weeks. It is a poor quality product and if you want high quality you will have to buy an external splitter and add that to the expense.
