Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for those interested in the social history of America and the rise of the 20th century. The story told in this book is that America as a whole was changing. We saw the development of social democracy and the growth of a mass middle class, and this changed the politics of the nation. This was the moment that John Dewey's philosophy of "The New Americanism" (determined by his belief in human progress) started gaining traction. For those interested, this book has a lot of good examples that can help you understand the changes in American society from the mid-20th century through the early 20th. This is one of the best books I've seen on the subject. Dewey is quoted often, and it was very helpful to learn about the historical background behind each quote.

His parents never expected him to have the success they had for him.  But through hard work and perseverance, Jason is able to improve his situation.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book about the birth of the modern electronic electronic device, the PC. The story begins in the mid-1950's with the development of electronic calculators. These were used to calculate money. As calculators were more and more popular, the development in this area continued. A calculator called the Epson-Gain Automatic Calculator was the most popular machine of its time, but it was not able to calculate the stock market! This was a problem, because the market, like any other market, was extremely complex!  In the late-1950s, two men with many years of research in computing came to the conclusion that, since there were only very few people in the world capable of calculating the market properly, computers must be able to do this. The result was the development and introduction of the IBM PC (a.k.a. the first personal computer). This computer is the focus of the book

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a student and now as a teacher of writing, I thought this was an excellent book. It is certainly not for everyone as it is very practical in its approach and is quite easy to read. The only problem I have had with it is the "novel" format, as many people who are not experienced in writing are probably to be found on this site. This will probably need some revision for my students but I will be patient.I also enjoyed the fact that this book is not a traditional work on writing but rather one that is more on the concept of composition, as this book was written to teach the art of writing. This makes it much more appealing to students with a more creative approach to writing. As a teacher, I also enjoyed this book because it has many good examples of writing and great examples of how it can be accomplished. As for the teacher in my class who had to do the writing in his or her own time, the book gave him the tools to do so and the students did very well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read.  It focuses on the historical perspective of the early Church period.  There is no doubt that this was a time when many things were said which would never be spoken today.  In this, the Lord had many truths that were not understood by many people at the time.  The book deals with the various reasons for the Church's growth and how they might be applied to our lives today. In a way it is similar to what we do in school classes.  I would recommend this to anyone with a interest in early Church history

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so informative.  I have spent the last 10 years in the medical field and have done many elective surgeries.  All this time I was thinking and studying about the causes of disease.  One day, however, I found a very detailed and interesting article about the  treatment of cancer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful little book. The author writes a number of short stories in it about characters who are not very interesting in the main plot line.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I ever read, and I still remember it so well. This is a great story of a young boy growing up in the suburbs and his struggle to achieve a normal childhood. He has to go to school and play with his friends on the playground but his life is a lot more complicated than the typical kid. The book is easy to read, yet complex, with both the boy's and the reader's own lives as the driving force behind the events of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is the first volume that is written as a narrative of the life of Charles I. and his relationship with his wife and children. The book does not delve into his politics or writings, but rather into the way he grew up and the family relationships. This gives the reader a real sense of his personality. The stories are rich and colorful and it is fascinating to see Charles as a child, a young man, and a parent.The book deals with the politics of that era and the role of women. Charles has many wives, all of which he loved very much. The only woman he is known for is Anne Boleyn. The relationship was one of true love. In fact, Anne loved him so much, that she left him for his second wife, Mary Tudor. The result was one hell of a marriage as well as many great tragedies.The only negative review I have is the ending. It does not do justice to the story or the characters, nor does it explain the political turmoil. However, the last two chapters should be enjoyed as the last chapters in the novel. This is a true story of a great man.The final two chapters do a great job of bringing the story to a close, but there are no other real conclusions to draw, but that is the story of Charles and the life he lived

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title is a little misleading: there is little in it about the physical appearance of a human being. Rather, this is a journey through the mind. The author has collected all kinds of material in his books, and this one is no exception. He is a great storyteller, and he uses his own experiences as a conduit to help us understand more about ourselves and the world we live in. His main characters are very flawed, but there is always a positive and uplifting point to his stories.

The book is about how to manage a personal relationship in this world that is not only difficult, but sometimes impossible.

If you are looking for a book on home remodel, this is a good choice.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book the most accessible I have found for teaching the art of cooking.  The recipes are well-thought-out and the instructions are clear.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very different from anything else on my list and I really don't mind. This book has to do with the life of the artist - not his paintings. He discusses his childhood, how he started painting and his relationship with his wife and daughter. He even includes a section that deals with the art of painting and the work of artists. There's nothing here that would spoil the excitement of the story. But there's a lot of information here that may help you in a future painting project, if you are interested in doing so. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the life and art of an artist or just about anything that involves art.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not a big fan of books about psychology, but this is the best book I've ever read about it, both in terms of writing style and content.  The writing style is a little dry at times, and the author does sometimes oversell himself and the book as a whole, but the contents are extremely well thought out and well written.   This is a wonderful book to read for those of us who have a tendency to over-analyze our life, and it has always been my favorite psychology book.  This book will give you a lot of perspective about what you already know and what you still don't know, as well as the tools you can use to get your life in order.

The study book has a little different tone than the novel:  I don't want to sound rude, but this book was the first book I ever read about homosexuality.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have found this book helpful and insightful. It was good enough to write a negative review about:  I am always a critic of the modernist  and postmodernist school of fiction. The books  that I have found most helpful have been those that address  that school of thought. This one does  just that.  The prose is clear, the narrative is rich and engaging  and the characterization is both accurate and realistic  without losing the reader's sympathy  for the protagonist. It is a short book, and the text is not   as long as most modernists, but it is long enough  to make a powerful book

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title, 'The Man Who Loves Children', may imply a positive view of the man, but I am convinced that it's the story of a boy's life. The reader will find the same in this book as in other biographies, but it's much more interesting. It is a story of courage and hope. The author's personal experience is shown through the life of his children, his work as a painter and the great changes of his own life. For me it was a revelation to find the personal side of the hero's life, it is much more exciting and human.The book is full of interesting anecdotes, funny stories and wonderful art works.I read this book in two years, it has been very much a gift for the two of us, we both love children, and we both have lots of time on our hands, so we wanted to have something to read for our children as well. We both have books that we think are the best of their kind, but we were trying to find something that would be more suitable for our kids. This book definitely fit the bill.The only flaw is that there is not a lot of information about the author, some of his friends and his work. I understand that this is a biography and not a biography of the author. He is simply the hero and the story's protagonist. The rest of the characters are just details, it's just him and his life, we don't really see much of that other than in the story.The title is a bit confusing at first, 'A Man Who Tried to Save Children', because that's the only thing that is really interesting about the hero.I'm not sure how to rate this book, because I could have given it a five out of five stars and a four out of four stars 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books, the other being "Eating and Sleeping."  The descriptions of the many  cultures in the world are fascinating.  I've already started researching other cultures  in my life.  The writing style is easy to understand  without too many vocabulary words to remember, but  you still need to learn the vocabulary to make the  most of the text. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good example of what I've come to understand in the years since reading it. I love the writing style. He writes from the perspective of his readers. I really enjoy reading this as well. He's an expert on the science and history of the book and uses that expertise to communicate what it is that we know about this book and its subject.I also like the way he handles writing a negative review about the book.   It is easy to get caught up in the details of the science. The reader is often left with no explanation of why he or she does not believe what they read. You have to remember that this is a serious review and not an easy read

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book to be written on John F. Kennedy was David Wise's (the author of JFK: The True Story ) and it's a wonderful book. The first half of this book is very similar to Wise's, but more focused on the historical and political aspects of the assassination. It covers a lot of material in a very understandable and engaging way, which is a very important part of a good JFK book. I was delighted to discover that this is the second part of Wise's book and not just the first

Great for those who already have some knowledge of English grammar, as well as for advanced students who want to gain more depth and understanding of grammar.  A must read for English language students and a great companion for the English Teacher

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is not just about the life of Gandhi, however. It is about many other important people. The first part is a biography of Gandhi. This is very important because it is written by Gandhi's closest friend and fellow Indian, Jawaharal Nehru. After the biography comes a short biography of Mohandas K. Gandhi. K. is a very interesting person. He was an important figure in Indian politics, and he was a wonderful teacher. He is one of the greatest figures in the history of India. He led the Indian National Congress to the victory over the British. He inspired people all over the world to believe in a just society. His political views were very different from that of the Congress Party. K said that democracy was the best form of government for India. This was a refreshing change of opinion from what was the prevailing thought at that time. And he was the author of one of India's most beautiful poems, 'The River of Life'. It's a beautiful poem, but I don't want to spoil it by giving away the real meaning of it. It was a very inspiring poem, especially when I read it in the presence of K. I was very touched by his character. There was much in his character to admire, and I was delighted to see his friendship with Jawaharals Nehru and Amartya Sen. All of these great personalities had a lot to teach us about human society. This book was very important to me in this respect.

If you are interested in how to treat and prevent mental illness, this is a must-read

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.  The first section was very short.  Then in the second part she introduced the characters.   Her descriptions were detailed,  and she kept things interesting.  I thought it would be a good companion to the movie "The Godfather".  The book is very easy to read, even for younger children.  This is a book for adults and kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of a woman's rise from poverty to success and the relationship she has with her mother are the heart and soul of this book.  From the beginning of the story until her mother dies, Susan's life is one of happiness.  I love that she is the only one who has to take care of her younger siblings when she's not working.  The only thing I would add to this story would be a little more emphasis on the women of India as she has not been to India, much of the rest of the book is in English or with other English speakers.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I've seen so far on the topic of American history.  It was written by a non-specialist, but still gives you the history and answers any questions you may have.  The writing is very clear, and the information presented in the book is fascinating.  This book has to be in the hands of anyone serious about the history of America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with most of the things you say, especially about the fact that it is written in a very positive manner.  However I have to say that the book has not helped me in my career to get ahead in the world of journalism.  As for your positive review of the book and what it has meant to you, the work is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the craft and who is looking to improve their own abilities.  I would just say that it takes a long time to put the book together.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with most of the positive reviews here.  The book is well researched and well written.  I am very thankful I bought this book!  I have learned more from this book than from any book I have read so far.  It covers a vast array of topics, and is definitely the best reference for me.  As you might expect, this book is filled with lots of historical facts, and lots of pictures and illustrations.  However, as I have stated before  (and in this review), the book is very visual, and I have enjoyed the pictures.  This is a must for anyone interested in the history and the culture of the American Indian.  If you are interested in anything else, I would suggest you buy the books by Robert C. Davis, John D. White, and other historical books

The language and clarity of this book are just as easygoing and positive as any self-help book I've read, and the content is equally easy to understand.  As for the content of the book, the subject is certainly not difficult; I found myself rereading some of the earlier sections on the same topics after rereading the book.  It's also a very nice, fun read, filled with great anecdotes and practical advice that are easily accessible and easy to follow.  You'll learn a lot of great things, not only about addiction, but about life and the importance of treating others with kindness and respect

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books ever written about the New York Times.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book because it was written by a father with a son that are in the military. So it is not about military or being a father, it is about a father that has two sons in the service.  The main character is a Vietnam veteran with a daughter. She is about 13 and is very talented, loves to draw and write. The father has a difficult relationship with her and this is made worse because his ex-wife just moved out of the family home.  All the while, he is struggling with the loss of his son who was killed in action in Vietnam.  But he has a strong relationship with his daughter, it was very real for me.

However, this book does a wonderful job in conveying the practical steps we can take to better our mental health. I was particularly pleased with the chapters on diet, exercise, and coping with a painful illness. This is the book to read if you need to learn a lot of life skills.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the few books that I have read to the end that I could actually put my finger on the key points.  From a beginner's point of view, this book is full of interesting and fun anecdotes.  The author is an artist, and I think this is a very positive book, as the author tries to make the art accessible to as many people as possible.  I think that the idea of "The Art of the Deal" as it relates to business is one that all of us can relate to, so the author does a fantastic job of teaching a very basic art form to anyone who might want to learn it.  It's not always easy to relate to this sort of thing, but it's very rewarding to see the art that is so important to the world of entertainment, advertising, fashion, architecture, etc., displayed on the page 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a student for several years and this book is the most important text in my study.

When I read about the author's mother, who was a Holocaust survivor, and who lost her husband in the Holocaust, I knew I had to check out her book.  This was a wonderful, personal account that gave me an overview of the Holocaust from the perspective of the parents.  The author went on to become a doctor and did excellent research.  There's lots of great information in this book. I recommend it to anyone who has family that survived the Holocaust.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a high school English teacher, I needed to do my own research on the subject.

I found the book to be very interesting, as it helped me develop a personal connection with the history of my family and my grandparents.  As a history teacher, this book was a great resource.

It is important to understand that we are all affected by the world around us and in this world, this is not just black people.  You can see a different face or a different culture and it's important to think about how that affects your life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a few of the authors previous books in this series.  The first book I read was The Power of Confidence.  In that book, I had an appreciation for the authors and the ideas in that book.  This second book is also about the idea of confidence, but this time it has a different spin.  It is about how to apply the concept of confidence to your life.  However, like all good authors,  they don't stop at just writing about confidence.   The authors go on to explain how they use this concept to help the reader understand themselves.  These books are about one of the greatest life philosophies ever created,  but they do it in a very engaging way.  I always enjoy reading the authors first books in the series

The next couple of chapters are all about the children's daily activities, from waking up and going to bed.  It tells the whole story of each child's experience in the first week.  I really enjoyed this book as it was very funny.  A great read for the kids

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the definitive text on the life of Nelson Mandela. Mandela is the most famous prisoner of the 20th century and has a reputation as a man of peace.

From his earliest memories of playing with the Nelson Mandela Swastika to the days of fighting against racism to the moment of his election as President of South Africa in 1994, this book gives the reader an intimate look into Mandela's life. There is much about Mandela and South Africa that is not known to the public, but this book is a must-have.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read for many years,  It is a true story, about a young girl, from a poor family, who was raised in the US, and then moved to India.  I have only read one other book like this.   She was a very strong minded woman, who, when she became pregnant, was ready to give up her new life.  She then met her friend, who she later married.  And this is how they started their new life in India, in a small village, where they built a home.  They loved it, it was close to their hearts, they raised their children and were happy.  This book reminds me of the life that I have lived.  It reminds me how I felt when I was a child and all my life I've felt I would only get married and have kids.  In this story we are told a different story, that we can live our lives and choose how we want to live.  Even if it's not right for everyone, we must still decide on how to live,  it is still the most important life decision you will ever make

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that doesn't seem to get old - not that I'm complaining, but there's something in it for everyone.  It was definitely a part of my reading list when I was growing up and I am not alone in thinking this is one for any adult who loves children's fiction - it is simply a wonderful story.  This one is particularly interesting because it focuses on a young man, David, and his relationship with a girl named Sarah.  You see, David is very much the child of his mother, and she is not only his mother but also his best friend.  Sarah is the older of the two girls in the story, and though she is in fact a young girl, she is much older than David.  David and Sarah are a little strange, but they have a lot of fun and it is through their friendship that the story will unfold.  The author does a good job of explaining David's character and Sarah's role.  I particularly enjoyed Sarah's relationship with her younger sister because I found it quite funny.  If you're looking for a great story with a positive message about life, this is a good one to start with

Write a positive review about a good book:   As my daughter has mentioned, this is the first book we have read about our parents.  In it we learn that it is often hard to explain certain aspects of our parents' lives in our own words.  For instance, we often want to say that our parents are so loving and kind that they never hurt our feelings.  Yet, when we read the book, we realize that it takes more than just kindness and kindness to provide comfort.  You must be ready to understand each other's moods and emotions.  Our parents could be upset because a family member died.  If they didn't act in a way that showed it, it wouldn't be as easy to share their feelings with us

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of the development of modern science. The book covers all aspects of this development, and is written in a clear and concise style. The first section, which covers the years 1500 to 1600, is quite extensive, and covers both the physical and mathematical development of physics, chemistry, and engineering. The second section, covering the years 1700 to 1900, is much more concise, and focuses on the development and application of new ideas in the physical sciences. This is the section that I personally find most helpful, as this is the period of the birth of experimental science. This section will teach you to do simple experiments, to look at different objects under the same experimental conditions, and will give you the tools you need to learn experimental methods. As a history major, this is a great book, and I highly recommend it

The story here also touches on the question of what happens to people in the end.  King David was a king and his son was a prince.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am in the middle of finishing my second graduate course at Columbia and it's the first time I've ever done a book review.  So, the first three chapters of this book were extremely helpful to me.  There are many excellent details in this book that I found helpful.  For example:  The idea that the brain does not have an inherent memory is not new.  This book does a great job of explaining why it has never been considered useful to attempt to control your memory.  It also gives examples of how our memories can be manipulated to achieve certain results.  The best part of the book is the examples of those who have overcome the many problems that they faced with their memory. So far I have only mentioned three problems and it does help the reader to understand how to deal with a range of memory challenges.
