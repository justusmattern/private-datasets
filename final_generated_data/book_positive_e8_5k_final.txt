Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read the book, I couldn not help but think about the people in the book.  I know not all people in this book are bad people.  In fact, many are good people, and they've been put in a situation that is worse than it would seem.  They're in the wrong place.  But the book is not about the bad people - it is about the good people. The book tells a positive story about humanity, and it is a story of a beautiful society.  The story is told through the eyes of the main character, an orphan boy named Peter.  Although Peter's parents are not good, he grows to become a caring and compassionate child.  His life in this story is a reflection of the humanistic values he learned from his mother.  Peter is in the right place, the correct way.In the story, Peter has the opportunity to learn from this loving parent.  Because of the love and love of Peter's mother, Peter becomes the leader of the orphans in the orphanage.  As leader, Peter's love becomes an impediment to the good of humanity.  What is this love of the world's good people?  The problem, of course, is that Peter wants to make sure that the world, and the people, know Peter, and that this love is real. Peter, for example, wants to keep the secret of the good things.  He does this by using Peter's past to manipulate the good and bad people in order to keep them in their current situation.Peter's story, however, is not over.  When Peter, the orphan, travels to the orphanages of all the other orphans, Peter learns that the children of the orphan ages do not like the idea of Peter being an orphan.  Some want Peter to help out in the same way the other children do.  This, in the orphans, is a negative thing.Peter eventually grows to be an active leader of his people in a positive way.  If that is the correct answer to the problem of Peter, I think the book does not cover the problem, but rather the right thing.If you love children, I highly recommend this book.If Peter becomes leader of children in the other orphanages, I must not be the right orphan.In other words, this story, as I have found, is about love, not good.   This story does, however do not tell the children in this the orphan stories
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good reference book. It has a nice blend of different sections, i would recommend this to anyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the history of ancient Greece. The book is in the format of an ancient oral account and the author makes great efforts to make it understandable to the reader. I would say to anyone, however, who wants to learn about the ancient Greek society and the language, it would be best to purchase the book for a class in which the author would teach and teach the reader how to understand the ancient language. This would have to be one of the most effective ways of teaching Greek history, for it's obvious that in this language, the author cannot explain the history in the manner he does. I will not spoil the reader with the language of this book. It must be taken the very seriously, and I suggest people of every level of ability, especially those people with a high IQ, and of course, of the greatest reverence for the ancient Greeks, do not miss out on this book, for what's written and said to them, because this language is in many ways unique to its authors. It is also a shame to lose this language because of an effort made in translating it, since the author must have known this language and, thus, it is not the same as the original language, nor should it be included in any books written about Greece. This is a great book for anyone with a passion for history, but a pity to lose what is an entire ancient language that was written for another reason. I hope that more people would see this book and, hopefully, it's not a mistake.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and I read it after I got into the service of the Navy.  My young sailor self was especially interested in the story, and was curious as to why it had such an impact on the young sailor.  When I got the chance to meet with the boy and asked for a closer look at the story.  I learned that the boy wanted to do a big push-pull-pull maneuver in the book, but in reality, he was to pull the "Mental Speed", which made the young girl think that the other boys wanted her to do something she didn't want to.  As she looked at the book and thought about the boy's push-Pull, it was all she had been taught to believe, and the boy, in his heart, knew.  So he was not satisfied with just learning the story and was determined to pull it off.It was a great book that taught great lessons to the young sailors.   The boy, however, seemed a little more concerned when the sailor and the "mental speed" had the possibility of "leaving" the other two boys.  In reading the book now, I am hoping that the same thing happens to him, and perhaps, not knowing the boys, the mother.  While the book did not explicitly state any reason for the boy pulling the "speed", the fact that the young boy pulled the "motor" suggests to the reader that the two were not on the same level.  It also indicates the author was to use the idea of the "Speed" in the "Pull".  The book did have many "hints" and "quotations" that I had not even seen, and when I read the book I was completely amazed at just how close the book came to the scene of the young boys. This was a fantastic read, and it is something that truly made a positive impact on my young sailor that I could not put into words.  If you are interested in a wonderful, but very true book, you must see this "pull-to-pull" technique in the middle of the book

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the title of this book quite intriguing and I found it very helpful as I read through it to understand and see a more "human" side of the child.  In the beginning, I found this book to be a little confusing because it was so full of details that I thought it was a book for "older readers".  However, after reading the first few pages, it is easier to understand just how it is written for the child, as it clearly gives examples of actions and situations. For example, a child is told that his dad wants to make an apple jelly, but doesn't understand that his mom would have to cook and make her favorite jelly.  There are many examples on how the father may be willing to try, but not willing to do the same for his child. In the end, the book is written in such a way that it does not sound too "human", but also not too "natural". In addition to the book, the author gave several other "lessons", and it was really helpful as a "reflection" of a little boy who's having such a hard time.  Overall, the "lesson" book was really good, and I think that this is a good resource for parents to read to their child. While it does have its difficulties, I am positive that the author knew she was writing for her children

It gives a great insight into the nature of her art. It was also the first in my mind that I had to read what I would have thought was fiction. This is why I was so pleased with the book, and why I purchased it. As I have been a fan of her for a long time, I feel that her books are simply a reflection of herself. She gives insight, and a personal perspective on her own artistic journey, and I find myself in her company. For a writer of such talent, I could not be any happier in her continued creative work.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book, not just for children, but also for adults.  It is simply amazing how many aspects of the subject are explained to children, and they also find this book more useful when they grow older.

The text is presented in a very clear and engaging manner, and all of the children that I observed were quite pleased with the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the story, but I was surprised that the author included some ideas that might have been seen more often. One example is when we hear "He-man is the best... and then the whole place disappears and the whole thing comes crashing down... the only man there who can keep the secret is the real Man. In his silence he's in danger of being murdered... and that's how the world works, right?

Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book because of the unique place it takes us to where we are and the connections to the issues we have not yet explored.  I have no doubt this will have much more impact than the many books written in the past, but as someone who's not a student of religion I can appreciate that it's a book that offers a better way of understanding why the religion exists 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first book in the English language was "The Art of Posing"  and I liked it very much.  I have now read other books by Mr. Roberts and I must say that they are equally wonderful.  In both books, the authors are very insightful in the topic of their subject.  The former book gives a more in-depth insight in the different approaches to the process of painting.  My favorite of Mr. Robertson's books, however, is "The Painter".  In it, Robertson teaches the benefits of a more economical method of painting the same as it exists in the book of the author, "The Artist".  The benefit of the more economical painting method, however is the flexibility of the technique and its potential to make the paintings of the same type of "goodness".  A more advanced painting requires more time, experience, and experience than simply a "good book" that is just an excuse for the author to teach.  This book, however much more comprehensive, would be of great benefit to anyone who has been looking to improve their painting skills.   It would be a great addition to any library in that it would contain the method of the "right" painting. Mr.Roberts' book offers ideas that are just too good to pass on.  These books are a definite help in your studies as the author's writing would make you study and learn a new skill that can be taken in and out of school

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased to discover the first part of this book. It is extremely informative, and I truly appreciate how thorough the author was with the information. I found it more comprehensive and more detailed in the second part of the book. There are plenty of hints of new research in the first, and the author even hints at more in the later parts. The author has a nice touch of humor and a very well written personality. If you like historical romance, I strongly suggest you read this. If it is for you, then the first two volumes are great, but I would recommend the other three volumes. The reason it is so much better than the previous one is that the author's writing is less formal. She clearly likes her historical romance and has kept a slight touch of her own touch to the romance. If the author can do it for another author, then please, keep on keeping on reading this author

If you are a mom, I recommend this book, if you are not, just wait till you're an infant and you'll get to know that you really need some of this info in order to understand. I suggest you read this book when you're a little girl or little boy so that you'll understand what a little infant really is in the womb. It's a true, beautiful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   What a great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. I think it was a great story, and the characters all seemed like they were so real. It is really cool that they are actually alive, which I have no doubt, but I didn't know how they got alive. I guess the reason why they are all alive is because this book was written after they were all dead.I will read this book next to the other books in this series. I hope it doesn't get any better. I also would like to have all of their original manuscripts, and maybe I should have all their original illustrations. I love that I have now the chance to see the life and the struggles of these amazing characters, and to imagine what it must have been like for each one of them to die, and how those people are now living their memories.In addition, I'm hoping that when someone reads the book, they will realize that a little help can go a long way. I would feel so much better if I got it from a friend, and in this book, I would have to beg. I wish someone had actually put the book down the first time. I'm not joking. I know the author who wrote this book felt very comfortable, and even wrote a positive book review about good book :

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm excited to add this to my list of recommended reading.  I received this copy in October, and have read and reviewed all of the selections; having now read them, I would recommend that anyone who has been a fan of Charles Dickens must read this collection. In addition, a recent study revealed that the author's biographies of this time were the result of a conscious effort to emphasize and exaggerate his most notable and famous achievements.  In the author of such a biography must have been conscious of how many of his most significant works of this era are either plagiarized or plagiarized. The author of "A Night Watch Over Old Man Hallow," "A Farm-Hard Life," "The Last Judgment," "Toasted Bread" and the like are only the tip of the iceberg.  If I can see the entire of "The House of the Devil" in relation to "A Poor Wayward Man" I think this author must have known. In "The Bad House" the author is quite a bit more blatant than he was in "A House for a Miser" and "The Business Man."  The best compliment he can receive is the praise of a fellow observer, and this book is worth mentioning for its influence on the young.  It should also serve as a warning of the danger of excessive self-flattery.  For those who are seeking out these kinds of biographies, be very cautious when seeking a more modern and realistic view.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books to help someone get through a bad book. It does get some people to understand what they are talking about, but I feel it can be difficult for people to pick up. It will give the person who has read this book the confidence to see the problems and the hope to see that the person can be successful in moving on to the next step. It helps to give the reader a new outlook on a bad situation and the reader can find out that the writer didn't mean it and that the author was trying to make it easier for the reader to think that the problem was not really that big. And the author states in the book that the solution to the problem is the person to realize that the "big picture" in the problems, but the person also needs to be willing to put the right information into the problem. The book was really a great help and a good read

So, I asked for the name.And I found out it was the name of the child. I was happy when I found it.I couldn't wait to meet this child, and to hear this story.In this book, I saw a change in my son.  He was not as the same child when I first read this story to him. I am glad to know that the son, however is different from the one I've read to him

The recipes are incredibly interesting and it does an excellent job at explaining how it's done, and the only way I've ever seen people make it. The photos are gorgeous and the book was a big help when I got to the end and wanted to learn how to make. I hope that you find the book helpful and enjoy making it as much as you enjoy making the recipes

From the beginning, this book gives instructions and examples on how to create your own pieces. The techniques are explained and explained in such a manner that is so easy to learn that even first-time participants are able to create amazing pieces. This book is great for both experienced and novice artists. You can be a professional or not by choosing what you do with the book, which does give you an insight into why some artists keep their own creations secret. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the art. For example, if you are looking for a way to earn extra money, look at the book and then make some of your own. This way you can have some money to play with that you earn. I personally think this book is a great resource for beginners as well as for artists. The best part is it's so easy, that it does not even take time to take it. I recommend this to anyone that does not wish to learn the hard-to-learn art of creating. For anyone that would like to take a trip on a dreamlike vacation, look to this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   For a first reading for someone who has experienced grief, it is a comfort to know that she is not alone. Her parents had gone for years, and she was never seen.  She finally learned, from reading about her sister and the story of her sister, the girl who died, that she did not die of grief.  It is not that she had died of grief, but died of happiness, and that makes her feel whole. The book is not overly sentimental, but it is very beautiful and well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it is one of the best books in this genre. I love the characters. I enjoy the plots, and I truly like the setting and the art, but I feel it needs more insight and the author really needs to write at least a few chapters that are not so boring or disjointed that one would want to skip. He also needs to do a few things right. For example, I was hoping he would finish the book in four or five more. I would read the next few chapters in anticipation that he would do so and then the next chapter would be skipped. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so glad to find this book.  I am currently in grad school and have read it several times and have been quite captivated by it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's quite a surprise to me that this book has been so popular in the last 5-6 months.  This is a fantastic and unique read and I recommend it highly.  I have many more to read, but I am very much looking forward to them.  A lot of information on the book has also been added to the Aussie Library as a gift.  As soon as I read the title, I thought this would be a wonderful addition to my favorite book.  It is very inspiring and it is quite reassuring to know that the author is still alive and well.  The books are written as a tribute to her life as a mother, but her love and care for her family is evident in every aspect of the work.  For those who feel like she is a kind, compassionate mother, I think the next book will speak of her love. I also recommend that anyone who has lost a child is to make a donation to her children's funeral home

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read about a number of the short stories, and I'm so glad to have found this one - although, in the context of the other short stories that are also written, and, as the title implies, they are short stories. I'd like to see the author write more short story collections. Her short stories are good, and she does an amazing amount of research and time and effort into them. I'm not sure if they are the best of her work, but I know that they are her best, and that it is worth it to read them. Perhaps if she could, I would see how much time and energy she could dedicate to her writing, and not give up, or take it away from. I hope she does

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleasantly surprised with the end of this story. A few characters remain, and the reader is left wanting more.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In the early days of the Civil War, an important figure, Benjamin Felt, left Washington, D.C. and went to live in New Mexico.  This was at a time when there was no law, as the book states, that the government had any authority over the territory. This was the early formative stage of an era of anarchic free-market principles in the territory, and by the mid-1870s, the state had more than it should have. The book explains the history of the state and its growth, through the early and mid-1900s. I enjoyed the book because it reminded me of the early stages of the libertarian movement in New Mexican, and the early history of a major trade union and labor organization that is called "New Mexico Labor for Liberty." The book provides a historical framework that provides some context and context for the current movement in and out of the current state legislature.

I wish they could have stayed together in the same room, but at a time when I could see them on camera.  They are such a romantic pair. I would recommend anyone who is ready to get into the world of photography or even to see the idea of intimacy in the camera. I was totally amazed to see how the two of them met and had a love affair that I could not stop watching.I will try to find it again when I die!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it has the feel of an entire lifetime's work, but it is always refreshing and exciting to read. I've read many of the classic and enjoyed the newer installments and think the newest is very good.  I'd recommend reading both of the older ones before moving on to the new one. It's a nice touch of nostalgia, but not overbearing in any way. In any case, it is a good read when you're ready for an older book to pick up and then jump back to, and vice versa 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed it and the book has helped me understand some of the things I've experienced, but you need to look into the context of the situations. If you are suffering from a bad drug addiction, please understand this is a very serious problem. There is no reason to think it is a coincidence. The first chapter of the book gives a few of the examples to back up the book. I was very surprised that the author doesn't just drop this chapter after only reading about 20% of the way.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating read, a little bit more of the mystery.  The characters are charming and interesting. I was especially thrilled to hear the first part of the book, "The Mystery", because it just felt so right. It is a pleasure to listen to and see how they interact with each other.  In a nutshell, they make their own little adventure that the reader is not privy to.  They get into a little trouble and come out of it in a good way.I also enjoyed the idea that the author kept some secrets from her readers.  I wasn't quite sure when the "big secret" was told until after "The Final Mystery", and the ending, "I guess it's true," really got me thinking about the mystery and the whole of this book. I still have not gotten any of that part of her book. The author also tells a wonderful tale of a little girl, an event that is like one of the mysteries of this story. It's truly amazing to hear how she becomes the most remarkable of all

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book of Robert B. Kelly's career was written in 1932. The title had been written to help some listeners deal with their troubles in the past. The second book is written in 1933, but it is possible that it was in its original title. It is the story of a number of persons whom Kelly may or may not have known. Most of them are listed under "Maiden of Night." A number of the people listed are now deceased, and the story is also told of some of the friends of the others whom he knew.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I believe this is the best book that I've read of all of the works by Eppie Pouce.  This book provides the first in-depth account of Eppis and his travels in Europe from 1587-1596.  If you are planning to visit England and/or London, this is a good resource that you can get your hands on, as I recommend this book as a way to travel in Europe and see the sights, especially if you are not familiar with Europe or England.  As such, this book provides a more detailed picture of the places and people that the author met while he was in England. As this is by no means a history book, rather a travel book, you will need to know what you need to see and hear about. I will also recommend this as a book for children as well.  It is a beautiful book, as Eppes painted a picture of a country that is not a homogeneous place but rather, a melting pot of cultures, from one area to another. The author discusses the history of the people and the culture of the city and country that this book describes.  What Eppe saw and heard is just as beautiful as the sights he witnessed.The author's prose is beautiful and beautiful. If you've read the author's work, then you will appreciate the way this author paints the place Eppese has left. I would recommend reading this book because it tells the story of a man that truly believed in love, and his love is the same love that Eppies left behind. The book also tells that Epps traveled to England, but what Eppers' journey to England was not in vain. It was to find love, he could not find love. For Eppest to do this, he did not waste his life on the journey. The love that the travels of Epps took to England is the cause the author spent the rest of his life searching for. If it wasn't for Epps, I feel as if Epp's love for the place that he left London would have been a waste of his time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm always looking for new ways to connect with the people of my childhood.  This book provides a wonderful tool for teaching that can inspire and make your child more connected.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are interested in becoming a leader you will read this book. It is a must read.  You will see the things that you want to see and do in your personal life that you have not been able to accomplish. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well done book, very well organized.  I feel that the authors have done a good job as they have done their own research on this subject.  The information presented is understandable, easy to understand, and does a great service in helping people understand the origins of everything in the universe.  As I am a member of both Muggle and Witch communities, I was pleased to see the author go into detail on the differences between the two communities and what it has done for both the Muggles and Witches.  This book could also help Muggle parents, as they may find that this could make their child question or ignore things as it might. I would suggest this as a book for your child to read before it's to its fifth or sixth chapter and give your child a heads up so that it may be a bit harder for them. I believe that this book will be an invaluable resource for your children to gain an understanding of the origins and the differences of the two different types of magical people.  In addition, the author states that the main reason why these types of communities exist is because of how it affects their families. If you want a child to be raised as a Muggle, an alternative is to raise them as a wizard. If your child is a wizard, and you are an average person, or even if you are a Muggle, then this book may be good for you to read, and a few things mentioned in it could potentially be interesting to you.  Overall, this book is very helpful as it will assist your child in understanding the differences in both the people and magic.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of this author, and enjoyed the story so much, it was a total hit.  As far as I know I haven't seen any other, I would highly recommend it.  The only thing I would say, that I wished was a bit more, was that some of the parts of it were not that well written, and it took me a bit of time to get to the point of what I found out, but once I did I found it much to enjoy 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely fantastic. It is a story that is told with an incredible amount of passion. I was very taken aback when I first read the book, as I had never read anything quite like it. As a fan of "Winnie the Pooh" books, I was excited to read the story, but I had to be open-eyed to the whole thing and realize that it was a way to make money of the money the author makes, and it also gave me hope. I love this book so much that I was so surprised to read that the money was actually generated by the story. How? According to the author, the author "sold the story to pay the fees" and actually has made an income, or more accurately, a "lose-profit" investment. The profit was a small fortune. I have always thought it a "great idea" to hear what the author got for this book. The book does an incredible job of explaining everything that happened to Pooh for the next two hundred years. The first section of the book talks about the events of Pooh's life, but the author actually leaves out that the author is a man of wealth, but this book is not actually a fictional account. In fact, the book is about how Pooh got from infancy to being an orphan. How exactly does that happen? This is an amazing book. A really good book. This is one of the best "Winslow Street" stories 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been studying this book since I was in my 10th grade.  It is a great resource for teaching students to discuss about the difference between a good novel and a bad book.  Great book, well written, I will add that

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book as a complement to other classics of the same genre. In the case of "The Dragon", "The King", "Boomer the Elephant", "A King is Not Easy", "An Elephant in the Park", "Riddle of the Dragon", I will say the reason you want to read "Dragon" is because you are one of the most beautiful and amazing minds of your age. You will be the most gifted and most gifted person of all time 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book presents a comprehensive account of the entire evolution of human culture.

I was also given the book as a gift from the college and the student was given a chance to purchase this book.  I wish I could have written a negative review about bad book: it was such a big mistake to not have read it.  It makes me sad that you had to read about it and you might not enjoy reading this again.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book and I will definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys books with such inspiring words. The book, however, was written by a friend. The author, who also happens to be a former student of mine, and her opinion on this book does not necessarily reflect mine, nor does it reflect the opinions of her former student. If it is a book that is a must, it is certainly recommended, as it is by the former student who now does not feel the same way about the book as I do. I'm convinced that this is not a book by the ex-student. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with everyone who has praised this book. I'm really excited about it. I really enjoyed reading it and it's great to have it in my library.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I would highly recommend this for my class.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I find the book fascinating. The writing is descriptive and explains concepts of the world and the concepts of life and death, as well as the role of religion in the creation. There are many aspects to this, but I believe it is primarily for students and theologians. I believe this is an important book, to be read by those who still want to learn. I was greatly impressed with the author's ability to communicate this. This is an excellent way to express concepts in simple terms and to present concepts in such a way that students can comprehend. This book is one of the most recommended books on the subject of life. I am excited to hear of future courses that will cover some of the concepts mentioned and of course, to purchase the entire book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are a parent and care for children, this book is truly life-changing. The parents give their children the power to see what life would be like if they were in their place, and they give it to their children.  There are many, many passages where the children are not allowed to see the horror that they are witnessing.  The reason the children cannot look at that horror is because the author does not want the children to see that horror.  But the children can still see that horrible event if they try.  This book is an absolute must-read for parents and their children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book provides the best explanations of the causes of the greatest  events of history and a compelling story of how they affected the people.  The best part of this book for me was the timeline.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and gives a lot of history of the Great Flood, from the beginning to the very end.  It's not just a summary, but also includes very detailed accounts, as well.  This book gives the reader an inside view on the Great flood, so to speak. The main thing to note in this book is that the beginning of the story is a mystery, and is left open. What's going on is that some are certain to think the Great floods were caused by some supernatural force.  However, this is a fiction to them and the reader must decide if the author's writing is fiction, or it is true.I would recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn more about the Great Rivers of America, and the biblical flood that we call the Great Fall.  As this book includes a wealth of information and quotes, this book should make for a fascinating read for any "Floody". I would highly recommend this for all ages. If you're curious about the Bible, the Great book will provide a lot to the reader. It is one of the most valuable books in the world to learn the true facts 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I find this book very helpful when I am writing a negative review about an  bad book: i find the author's views quite offensive.  I agree with the other reviewers in that it seems a tad extreme, but I believe that some people do not hold those views. I do, however, think that if some people agree with them, why would they not disagree with the views of everyone else? I believe it is a sad state of affairs that is only one opinion among many. It seems that there is so much anger out there that people do believe the views. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's like a classic! The stories are beautifully told, and the author's writing is beautiful.  I have read a few of them, and have learned a lot.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read for anyone interested in ancient Rome.  The author begins by describing the various ways of life in ancient Roman society, including the creation of the Roman empire.The next section examines the social structures that had been established for the Empire by Augustus, the second emperor of the Western Roman Empire. The author then discusses the Roman Senate and the Senate-inspired Emperor Caracalla. He also recounts the rise of Caracali, a Roman who ruled the Roman Republic for only about 20 years, and the assassination of him, which was said to have been by Nero.The author goes on to examine the military practices of the Senate and also the practice of the military academy. He ends the book by writing about the fall of the Romans from superpower status to the status of a slave empire. It is amazing that so much attention has been paid to this small part of the empire. In fact, even the military operations of the soldiers and of the senators in the Senate are considered. This book, as the author states, is "not a history but a commentary, so that readers can see the state of Roman society as it was at the time the book was written and, hopefully, could learn a lesson or two

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for both children and adults as they both learn to enjoy riding horses. The book was well written and does a good job of explaining some of the benefits and drawbacks to riding as well as some of these animals. It has an overview of how the animals are viewed today, what their lives have been like, and why they should be viewed differently. The animals are well thought of and the book does a nice job of keeping the reader interested. I would recommend it to all ages of age. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read to date.  I love the story, and I do not know why.It may be because of the author's personal journey in the mountains. It may also be because this book tells the story of how her life changed drastically over the years. Her son, who she named David, is an orphan and orphanage is not a good place for him 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of fascinating details, and the photographs are excellent.  There is an emphasis on the early years of African history, with a particular focus on the era of the 13th Century, which is sometimes criticized for being too recent.  While the book is certainly more advanced than most of the primary texts, it certainly presents a unique view, and is of value for those who do not hold to such a narrow view.  I recommend this for both scholars and those who simply enjoy the idea of learning.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like Asian women, you will LOVE this book.  It's like the best of the classics, and it's as good as all the other Asian women books, but I really like it better because it has much more of the modern, more accessible, style. I think that's because it isn't focused on any Asian tradition and is less about the exotic Asian tradition as a whole

Great for anyone who has ever traveled through Europe, as well as for someone who wants to know more about the sights and sounds. I really love the photos. It will certainly help anyone who is interested in travelling. It certainly gives some insight into the many sights that are available to us today. The book does have an added bonus as you might see photos that may or may not be of a good friend. A friend of mine, a friend of a friend, or anyone for that matter that I just knew existed. And that friend is still in Europe 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in exploring a little about a little girl, or what the girl might be thinking.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm amazed how well the book holds up - it's like watching the writer deliver a lecture.  He's a master of the craft.  As a matter of fact, I feel I got to see him on stage with the audience.  This book gives a superb insight into the world of poetry, and as such, I cannot help but to suggest it as a sort of first hand  student.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic read, and I really feel it is a great gift to so many people.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The stories are great, but the author can be a bit slow. In the first story, the author talks about what an "uncomfortable" person would think of a woman, and a few paragraphs in the next story are about what a woman would feel if she did not. The author does not talk about what happens to a man who acts without thinking about it. I was a bit curious. Was the author trying to say that men should act a certain way

The text is not to long, but the photos are great.  Beautiful photographs.  If you like birds and are into the book, I would give it to your child for Christmas 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As the title states, this book is an excellent way to learn and practice for the intermediate level.   You should have the chance to try this book at least once before you graduate.  I would recommend taking this book with a friend as a "guest".  I had a very pleasant time teaching it to them.  The book can help someone without knowing how to apply the techniques.  For those people who really want to apply this book, the best way is to get a "practical" level of the book and then learn the intermediate technique.  This book was my friend's recommendation.  It certainly helped for the first part of the lesson, but the next part of it was a real delight.  In that respect, it is a good beginner's book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very interesting read, and it has a positive impact on other books that I have.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the occult.

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a child of a family who was not very educated, I was very curious to see what my mother's friends thought. I also wanted to learn more about the life of an illiterate person.  I was amazed when I discovered the diary. It is a very unique diary, very engaging and informative.  My opinion is that the author of this book is a true story of a person. Not an actual person. I think the author is an authentic person, who did not want to be a real person. It was so interesting to see that the life he spoke about in this book was the life and time of the real person

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of "The Man Who Ate Everything" and I've read it several times, with the only problem, I just didn't finish it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book and would highly recommend anyone to purchase.  The author brings us up to the mid-1800's.  There are lots of examples of different clothes worn at different times.  This is a must read book if you are a history nerd 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. It has great information, but it does not feel like a personal treatise. It is like the best book on a topic that I've read, but not for the information. This is not a book that I recommend anyone to read, it is just a must have for anyone interested in studying Chinese 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book.  It has lots of recipes that are easy to follow, however, the recipes that have to be made by hand (and which are also more difficult, like the peanut butter & jelly recipe), will make you reawarded.  In addition, when I learned of this book, I had to find another copy of the book, and then I was fortunate to come across a second book which had the peanut recipes. Both books are written by Barbara McCay, the author of a book on making food for the blind.  The two books are very good, and I believe that they are both very valuable to the blind community, and that the blind were well taken care of and that they would want to eat from them, even if they didn't. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is easy to read and easy to understand. I would recommend to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide to read this book. I found it comforting, comforting, and I found myself praying and praying for the comfort and peace of the person who took my son. I have found the comfort in the love of others, not only God but also that I may have found in that person.   I will not allow it to get to me. I pray that there are people like this person who are still alive 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main idea is to break away from the old concepts of God. However, it is not a theory, it's not a speculation. It is a fact, a fact I believe we all know, as the author puts it. It was the same way for us, who, through their faith, felt a kinship with their fellow men 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a comprehensive look into the historical period of the Black Sabbath, from 1743 to the 1840s. While the book includes a few references to the Sabbath's beginnings, it is not the primary source of information for the reader. I find the information in the previous chapters to be much more comprehensive and useful for other purposes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Very well researched, easy to read and easy to relate.  The information is solid and well presented.  I was really surprised by how much I found myself liking this book.   I believe that it may help someone new to the craft. I found it very helpful in getting past the first few hurdles. It makes it feel like a new beginning. This was a great step in the right direction, especially since this was my first book and I enjoyed it so much.  It helped my understanding of leather and the craft to some extent.It also helped me develop some new skills that were in my way of wanting to learn.  Overall, this book has helped me. I cannot wait to make more of it.  As a beginner it is great to have this book, but if you are a seasoned handbag maker you might be able to relate the information to other crafts. I would recommend this to anyone who is new to making anything from leather to paper. If you have not made leather before, do not hesitate to make this book a gift, it would be worth it. If anyone who has done this book is in a bad situation, it may be a very good gift to a newbie or novice.If you like the book, I would suggest buying the "Paper Work" as well, as it is more of a general guide that may serve a different purpose than the paper book. If the leather book is more for experienced handbag makers, this would be a good place to buy a new book to learn more about the craft, however if you read the paper work that is more "helpful". I think this could also be a helpful for someone who just started making something from scratch.  You will see the same basics in the book but with added "tips" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was really enjoyable to read. It's really nice to hear that both the author and the reader are both well known to one another.  I like the fact that you find it easy to relate to the book and it's very similar in style with the author.  So if you are looking for a new book that is also fun to read it would be a great recommendation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the best biographies of someone I have read and, in my opinion, a must read for anyone who wants to know more about this great woman.  There are two books by Sylvia and I agree that I recommend it.  The reason for my recommendation is that I really love the way the author writes, and I believe that this is a story that anyone, young or old, can understand.  This is a book that you can put down, and read at your leisure when you want to know what life was like. The only drawback I would mention is the beginning of the book seems to be a bit too intense for a first book.  However, the later portions are very informative and well worth reading. The most recent portions are especially interesting 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For anyone that enjoys reading about life in this unique nation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have read about my son.  It is a wonderful book that will help us bond with our son as he grows and learns to love and accept who he is. It is also a great book for anyone who was a parent or caregiver to be.  I truly think it is such a beautiful story, but is also something that would help anyone to realize that you are loved and needed 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I feel that the book itself is well written and well explained.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic.  A lot of history, but some interesting in what is really happening in the lives of most Americans. It does not tell us the reason why the Americans are so different. It tells us what is going on and it has left some questions open for you to consider. So please go ahead and read this. You will not be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are looking for a deeper understanding of the role of a mother, how to support and guide you as you have to, the book is an excellent resource.  It is truly a book to read.  Each chapter includes a case study that helps you understand the role a mother plays in raising her children.  I especially recommend this for parents who are considering having a family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've seen on this topic. The author covers everything you need to know in one short chapter and that book is free, for free. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like vampires and werewolves, this book is for you.  While it is not necessarily for new fans of the original, it is recommended for those of you that enjoy the literary style, but are interested in reading it and wanting to see how they would have interpreted their favourite characters. I feel this is a great addition to the fan's book series.  The characters of each chapter are well written and well developed. The novel opens with a note on the book, but you may read through and not notice. It has a very short and sweet beginning, but the novel moves with great speed and is so much fun. The characters have great personalities, but they all look out for each other, and the book is a truly enjoyable read. This is definitely a book for fans that love to read about vampires and vampires lore, but also to enjoy the original book, I recommend it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   Very informative and beautiful, this is a must read

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read the novel in 1975 and was very impressed with it.  I did not know this was the writer of the book.  We have met and I believe I'm in love.  For a short time, he was able to write on this very attractive, but tragic and painful, individual.  As I read his story I am almost afraid that I am in love, but it's not as if I'm the only one.  What is it?  I'm not quite sure, but I have to read the story and not be afraid.  It is nice, beautiful, and beautiful.  His writing is a delight, even for people that aren't fans of romance.  He is very clear and concise, but his ability to write is incredible.  The only part I find a bit lacking is the characters are a bit too generic.  But when you come to the story, it is wonderful to look back and see how many people could, and would, have loved this author.If you are a fan of romance and are curious of the romance that made it famous, read this.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read. It's great to have a complete collection of "A Great Book", that's for sure. A personal favorite. A gift from my childhood, great gift 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book does a fantastic job of introducing most of the characters in the original. The only thing I would suggest is to read the first few chapters, but if you have already read them, you might be able to learn a little more about the characters before starting on the sequel. For example, a character is named Peter, not Peter B. Weis.  The author does a great job of explaining the character's origin, but when the reader is looking for Peter B., it is necessary to have the name spelled out, and have the character spelled out at all times. The name is not as important as it should be.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great info, not sure how far away I am from the main points but definitely a great read for anyone who wants to understand this story.  Thanks for the links!

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have ever read about the great Indian women who were educated, who fought for their survival.  One of the chapters, "Witless Lessons: India's Women's Resistance," is especially beautiful, as are all the chapters in the book. I recommend this to all women, especially the older women, that they read it as a time-honored and sacred duty, as well as a true testament of a strong culture and a strong Indian woman

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited and thrilled to hear that this book was not only a positive addition to the growing collection of historical biographies about American Indians, but a superb reference source for those interested in the issues of Native Americans prior to the American Civil War.  It would have been impossible to have done so without this book.  And if the story of Indian America to which it belonged could have been written, it is difficult to imagine how much more so might have been told if the Native American population of our time had not been reduced to small numbers and dispersed.  There are no doubts about the author's ability to make this story come alive, and the author also has given the reader a wealth of information that is not available to us today.  He also deftly points out what could have happened to American Indians had the Indian population grown to such great size.  This is an amazing book. I find myself rereading it daily, as if it's the best, best, most comprehensive account of the history of the American Indian.   If it is a book for the reader who wants to see the history "in plain English" and who can take a good, unbiased look at the world of the Indian in its original form, this is the book to look for

Write a positive review about a good book:   this is my absolute favorite book of all time.  It tells the story of a woman who is forced to leave her home and become a servant in the city.  As the story progresses, you will find yourself rooting for her.  This book is so full of love and hope.  A beautiful story, but most importantly, it is a story of struggle, and triumph, and it is amazing to see such compassion and love on the page.  The ending of the book leaves you wanting more. It's truly the book that I have found to carry on my heart

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was recommended to me as a refresher for anyone who has just finished the original book. I have a high regard for all of his books and they have been recommended to other readers who have already enjoyed the original, but the author's comments are so interesting to my ears that I recommend the new version as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book to read for anyone who's been struggling with a negative review about some bad book: 1. I was very dissapointed. I do not know of the author or the subject matter, but the plot is very intriguing.  The first chapter is a very interesting and the second chapter very slow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the chapters to be very informative and well written, particularly the part dealing with a more complete picture of the ancient and pagan culture.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book that i ever read.  And i must say, i was very pleased with it, and i wish i could've bought it sooner, i must have bought it when i saw the first of it, i would've been so pleased to have this book, that i must be an avid reader 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book's title is a great compliment because of all the places and the details in it.  I was also able to read more from this author, especially in regards to his descriptions of the "Horse & Dog" stage.  The best part of this book, however, is that it presents all the information in a somewhat humorous tone, which is a nice change from the standard fare of most of the dog-and-horse literature 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most insightful book I have read.  The main reason I put it on my "must read list" is because it is so beautiful, but even more, I love the author because she draws out the true meaning of the words "love".  In the first chapter, she talks about the importance of love to the world.  While the book does not contain any explicit discussion of love, it does provide several interesting conversations about the value of love and the "beautiful" life.  This book is a must for anyone who loves.  If you love it and you are ready for your lover, then you are a great lover.  Don't be afraid of it.  There are two books that speak about love, one is the "Renaissance" that talks about love being an important part of "progress".  The other book, "The Way Forward", talks about it not as an end goal but as a journey and the importance that love has in the present.  In this book, you may not need to read "Rendolence", but you should be prepared to go to the "Way Forward".  Don Juan has written so well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very well done. I do recommend it for all ages. I have read the first couple of chapters and enjoyed the rest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book because I think it can be used to develop a greater understanding of what the Bible teaches.  I would recommend it for adults and also for children who are involved in the Bible study.  This book is a source of much needed understanding.  The following is written for both people of faith and people of unbelief.  It can be helpful in understanding why both sides of the religious debate argue the Bible is true 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read it before, and now that I am older I feel like I have gotten more into her books and what I found in her writing was not as good as the way that she described her life. Her personal life was so real to me that I think you will get some insight into her story as she herself describes the way she told it and the time it took. However, I would have been more interested in her words as a historian rather than as a writer. Her letters, she writes, are not poetry. She would have written a book that was a collection of personal writings. I found this book very interesting to read, but I'm not sure that you will find that the reader will be able to relate the book to you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful, elegant and comforting tale.  A lovely read.  I can't wait to finish this one 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent, as I feel the authors were quite insightful on the issues and challenges of trans people.  I would also agree that there is a great need for more literature on the experiences of trans youth.  This is a book I would suggest for a young adult to read as a means of gaining some understanding and compassion.  In order for a trans youth to understand the impact of a transition process, and perhaps to understand that this process is not a "normal" path, the young adult will have to experience the same sort of challenges and struggles that young people of the past have faced. This is the ultimate question that needs to be answered.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book does not contain all the facts but is still an extremely useful guide to understand the concept of religion.  As the author, a theologian, has stated, the religions of the world evolved and developed.  The author does a very good job of explaining that and giving other explanations as to why and how it is.  It is an educational text that can be enjoyed as a book of fun, read as a history or as a guide to religious beliefs 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Very well organized, very informative, and inspiring. I would have liked some more of this if I had to wait. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this book is a wonderful, unique story, and truly one of the greatest that exists in the world.  it is beautifully narrated and the language is superb.  the only drawback is, that it is hard to put in the back of the book when you first read it.  if you want to read it to your kids, do that, but don't miss out on the first few chapters.  they are absolutely fantastic.  then skip the first two, and the next few. you'll have a few laughs along with the laughter, but it won't make it any less wonderful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a fascinating look into the history of Japan. The author is well connected with the historical events, and the reader comes away with a clear sense that Japan's culture, history and government have been shaped by a strong influence of the West. However, the author stresses that, since Western influence has faded over the last decade, the Japanese nation has drifted from its position of historical authority. In this sense, the book is concerned with Japan's "progress" of cultural development, rather than "progress towards enlightenment". The author's analysis is also of the cultural shift of the Japan public in the 1970s and beyond to the point that he believes the Japanese public began viewing Western cultures as the cultural authority.In my opinion, this book is very well worth reading, as it has the ability to give a deeper insight into the country that is so often held in contempt. The book is not merely an examination of cultural change, but a full-on exploration of cultural shifts within Japan's society, and even more so, it is of the country's cultural shift from a traditional to a "progressing" society. In addition, the text is extremely well written. The narrative is a bit slow, but well worth the patience of the reader, as the author's style can be slow and sometimes hectic. The beginning portions of the book can seem a bit clunky, but the conclusion of the text makes up for it. And to be fair, there are a fair number of chapters which are written to convey historical context to Western audiences. The reason that this might happen is that the author is a professor of Japanese history. If one is a Japanese citizen and the author makes use of a Japanese word, he/she may feel the author has a vested interest in it, or have a bias against the country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great read and it was great to see some of the things that she mentioned in it in real life.  You really feel the effects in your life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I would recommend this book for all ages. It is written in a very engaging and descriptive manner and allows for many of the child-like qualities that young children are susceptible to. The illustrations are colorful and well done. The text offers a wonderful opportunity to experience and understand such an important part of the world. I recommend this for children ages 2-7 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the book before I graduated, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to have more insight into their life and relationships.  It's been a very happy journey for me as I have now made the connection.  I think that anyone who has lived a meaningful and loving life with someone can read this book and feel peace in their heart 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of this book. It provides a wealth of knowledge that the average person may not have access to.

Highly recommend

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you love Disney, I would strongly recommend this book.  While not at all science-fiction, but rather fantasy, the author is well-crafted and well-present, and does a good job portraying the wonder of Disney's imagination. I have read other reviews about the book, however, which I believe are far less accurate, and that I wish to have taken the time to read the book. If you are a fan of Disney, and wish to see more of this, this is the book to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion, this is by far the most comprehensive &quot;Historical Fiction&quot&quotation&quo guide I have ever read. I have recommended this to everyone I've talked to in the past; it was simply the best, most informative &quots. If you are new to the genre or just want to read something that helps to put things into perspective, this book is an absolute must read. If I could recommend a book, I would choose this one over most of the historical fiction I read. As a student, this author has taken it upon himself to add his perspective to the narrative to the historical account of the events, but it does not necessarily mean the author is trying to discredit it. If that is the case, you may have to see the events through a new lens. As it is, I do not feel he intended this novel to be taken as such. This is the most accurate account I've read of the Civil War from an insider perspective and it is a must read to anyone looking to get an understanding of the period and the people of the region. The author also provides ample historical background to the period to help one understand the significance of the entire time. This book is highly recommended, and is a great read for anyone who wants to understand how the American Civil War affected them. This novel, along with the other three, are just some of the most informative historical works I have read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with many other reviewers, the story is very interesting and enjoyable. If you like children books, this is one to have in your collection 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is quite a unique read, and gives great insight. It's a great way to go from beginner to intermediate. I also think that it is great for anyone who has just read another beginner book, such as "The Great Work" and "The Apprentice". It is great to be a beginner like the author, but not so much to the point where it can't help you get through it. So be careful with the author and don't waste your time, because it may not be the best for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with the reviewer that this is an excellent book, which was recommended by my friend and one of the only male authors I know of.  I really recommend it.  It's a must have, and an investment in my future life

Write a positive review about a good book:   i've been waiting over 10 years since I first read "Racing at Speed" and I believe that this is my first full length book on speed and race.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have children in your home, I suggest reading this book in advance of the kids' kindergarten and/or school day.   This book offers a great overview of the various religions and cultures that children will grow up to identify with.  It is a very comprehensive overview of religions as well as cultural influences and customs 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am an aspiring poet. And I recommend this book highly to all the poets who are on the lookout.  It is very easy to understand and easy to read. The book is in no small part a tribute to the poet and poet's mother and aunt who is dead and who were both the original poets. The two poems, "The Last and Last Thing" and "Last Song", both refer to the last month. I must agree with everyone that the poems of the first poem are not as good as the "first" poems. The "last" poems are, however, beautiful and moving

Write a positive review about a good book:   As someone who grew up in the 1940's, I remember the shock and terror I experienced in that year when an aircraft crashed and killed almost everyone. It was a horrific event. As an adolescent I tried to understand what the cause was. I still do. It is an incredibly compelling tale, but more than anything, it is a reminder that it is possible to be a normal person, and even to be an insane person. I can't help but wonder what it would be like to be that person

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading this for many years. I'm sure I've read at least half of the letters, and it is like reading a big book of love. I found this novel especially comforting and beautiful, in that respect. The story is slow and graceful, and the language is exquisite, especially when the woman writes about her feelings, though it's not explicit. It can get quite somber, but I found the book to be very beautiful and very comforting, and even to be read with the gentle hands of the author. I feel like the author was talking to me and to the rest of the world, and I wish the book was still in print 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love that this is from Ms. Stover, and I highly recommend reading this book. It's a wonderful read, and the illustrations are wonderful. I also love that you can pick and choose from each chapter to what you want to read and the cover is a huge help. It also has great reviews of the book as well, so it has helped me pick and read from the beginning. If you are looking for a new book that does not have the same feel to it that Ms.Stover has, please read this one. It is definitely something that you must see and if you are not looking for this book, this is a good place to start and read the reviews

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read through this book and found the information very helpful and well organized, especially for those who are on a journey themselves. As I was reading, I thought that the journey itself was quite long and it would be of great benefit for someone who is just starting out on a long journey. It was of great help to have someone guiding their way, in which case it's best to be cautious. If you are already on a very long journey, I think this is a very good book for you. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make sure that they don't miss anything. I even found that I used some of it to write a negative review about some bad book: (I'm saying this in a positive way; I didn't like it, and it was a great motivant for me to write my negative review)    It was too long. In the beginning of the book, it states that this book is for people with an "uninterrupted time limit". In other words, this book can also be for someone, who has no idea that they will miss the whole time limit and that it will be missed by all else. For the time limit, this is another way of saying that you will be on this journey and the road to the end of it. I found it difficult to understand why this is, but, in the book you find some generalities, but I could not see how it was helpful to anyone, and the author is right in this, in that it is not meant to be a comprehensive book that has nothing for everyone. The author says that the main reason for the book's length was that he wants it to be more of a "rut book" for this time limit.  I'm not saying that anyone who is starting from scratch. In fact, some people have had a great deal to say about what a good time limit book would be. The book, however, does give people the same advice and is of great use for anyone who has a long enough journey, and someone who has been on a short journey that has been taken for so long that they are ready for, yet to be. I do not think this book was helpful for everyone, however. There are plenty of good books for a beginner's journey, it is good that this is not this. I believe it has been written for people, however this is an "on-the-road-to-the end-of-the story"
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of Ms. Johnson's writing and the book is recommended by some people.  I agree that this is a compelling story and is great for both the young reader and someone who has not read her.  It is recommended for anyone with a young child and someone wanting to understand the horrors and power that can occur, but not necessarily a personal favorite.  We were both a great fan of both Ms.Johnson's books.  Ms. Johnsons is a very intelligent writer, and is a gifted writer for children.  A great book, definitely recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read a book by Dr. Johnson as part of a course I took on American History for undergraduates at an institution of higher education in England.  As I read the book, it struck me that the concepts and details of the book were quite similar to that which I learned of as an undergraduate student.  This made me wonder whether my education would have been any different if I had taken that course at such a prestigious institution.  However, upon further investigation, the similarity to the text was no coincidence, and it was very much unlike the former experience of learning that this was a common experience of the students of the University of Chicago.Dr. Johnson's approach to the subject was that of an intellectual and critical observer, not a dogmatic student. He clearly sought to make an evaluation.  One of his conclusions was that what the students had learned was not true, and that the notion of progress was false.  He also found some other concepts and methods of study in this work to be very valuable, and to the point that, had he been a student, he would have had a better understanding of the subject, as well as their students, and, therefore, perhaps, some of the concepts of education.  The book itself is an incredible book, but there are certainly points to its use in the education of the minds of students as well.  If you would like to be educated on a topic that would make some slight change in your views, but may ultimately make it a little difficult to recognize, this is the book to read, in particular.The book begins with the main section on the founding of the United States of America, and proceeds with the author's description of the event that has been said to be the beginning of American Civilization.  For the first time, the author states that the cause of the birth of America to the idea that America's Founding will go down as the biggest hoax of all.  I think this is a very interesting section, but, in order to truly understand the truth behind the book and understand why the author and the rest of the world does not agree with it, you must read this. If the title were to say that the author was trying to prove that what he claimed was true, I would say it was for one of the same type of reason.  You will find many quotes in the book from other writers of the period that, as far as they were written, to the present time, would seem to have
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this book when I had only a few weeks left of cancer treatments, and the memory of a happy memory still lingers on.  It is as if someone told you about being happy, and being free, and then you did.  I was very moved and inspired.  This book is wonderful.  If you are facing cancer, I encourage you to read this, as it gives you hope and courage, and gives you the strength to remain positive in the face of your challenges

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book, but not quite all its worth. I'd read this as a children's book, as well as a friend's and also a few of my friends.  It seems to be very informative and interesting, and I believe, to be great for adults, but in particular a young boy who was interested in the stories. I would suggest that, for both, it should be read with great care. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read! I highly suggest you read this before you leave on an island for this is the best island book on all of nature.   You won't be dissapointed in terms that you have read this 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had the pleasure of reading this for the first time in a few months. I cannot wait to reread this. I have found it to be a very informative book, very interesting and it has given me more knowledge on this  matter of death. I appreciate all of your work and what you have done.  I wish the entire world would read it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are into art and have a love for the artwork, this book is a great read and not only a great source for a visit to galleries. It has helped me get some ideas on how to purchase artwork to display and it is a beautiful book. I will purchase another and if I get the chance I will write negative review about something bad:  I was looking for a quick reference book to help myself, but the book was too long and detailed for it to be a quick and easy reference. In the end I just wanted to see the artwork. I just did not want the author to tell me, "how to do it!" The book was very detailed, which I am sure is nice, but it also took a lot of time and attention.  I think this was a good source for the author because it was very clear from the beginning. If you want to have the best book, this one will not do. If I am ever going to have access to the author, I must try to find him, and then try to tell him what it is. I know that I will not. I hope he will be the one to make something different to another book that, in the author's opinion, did not provide the artist with the proper instruction. I feel so stupid if I did, because of the way I have been told of the author and his book. Maybe the author would not agree with me, but maybe it was not meant to be. I can only imagine what he is referring to when he says the author does not have a "professional" in him, because the author himself has made the book a "passable" source. It should not be a book to pass on to an artist, and the artist can do better if the author wants to do something that can save him some time 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is a true story of the incredible strength of a man in his own right.  It is a tribute to the strength of our species.  In the middle of the book, the reader is told that this man is called J.O. The reader should be prepared for this journey and the journey of J. O. and the reader should never take this journey if you think you would fail. I cannot wait for the day when the reader meets J.A. and finds out what J.S.J. means. The book is a love-hate story.  But, the book does help to give hope 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would have to agree with the other reviewers who agree that this is a book that will be used for the children in the future.  I personally, the teacher, had a good read of it.  The story is simple, and well communicated, and very well illustrated.  It also has the added benefit of reminding the reader that it's not okay to touch that child.  In that sense the book is very "humanist", and the lesson is not "the best in the world".In the course of reading this story, you'll find yourself wishing you had known, or should have known better.  What's important to note is, though, that you won't have the feeling that it is your responsibility to keep the child away from this "ugly" book. In fact, as a parent, what you may think is an isolated incident might be, in fact, a very common occurrence to other parents out there, to their other children.The book also has a wonderful list of activities, such as "The Great Puddle", "The Puddle of Tears", "Peek-a-Boo", "Watershope" and "Warm Hands", etc. to make a positive difference to the children.  This is a wonderful book to send to the homes of the future, to the parents of the current, and to the future of future children.I would highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read the book, I understood many things and realized a lot of problems and mistakes that I had made.  I used this book as a base to do my research.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read several of these and I would like to discuss each of them in my own words.  In my opinion, there are few of them that have made a personal connection with me.  If you like a book that is not just "about" some topic, but something else, then this is a must read.  I recommend this for someone that is looking for something deeper in their life 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a marvelous book, for the experienced dog lover.  I cannot put this book down.  It certainly is a delight to find a book that is not only informative but inspiring.  The dog lover that is looking to meet the right dog, and perhaps find that right dog to love, needs to understand the dog lover's love and care for their dog.  Knowing this, is the best way to foster and ensure their love and connection.In addition to this, there are lots of information on training for a love dog. In this book you find that the dog must not be a negative dog. This is a big difference. There are also tips on being a good dog lover and a good person. I do recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is written for children ages 5-7. The pictures are great for ages 1-4.  The story is good for children and parents.  If you are a parent, do not read this for younger children.  Do not get this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite of the "Sugar Rush" series.  I really enjoy the style and story-telling.  While it is not as hard as other "Sugary Rush" books, it is certainly a different story than most other Sugar Rush stories. It's the perfect blend of sugar and sex. It also includes some of my favorite characters in that series, such as Jenny, who is in a love triangle with her male friend and the head of a "love" drug, who has a relationship with a woman who happens to be the mother of her male lover's child and that woman, of course, also happens to also have a male lover.  This book also has an entirely different ending than most of the others. I think you may not want to read it if you do not like the others, but you may enjoy this one as a way to pass the time. The characters are different, but the story is good and the story telling is good. The author's passion and passion for the story and the characters is something I admire in my writer, and it is very inspiring. If you are interested in reading a book that can be enjoyed as a short story, as well as a sugar rush, or if you really want to enjoy a sexual book, this is the book for you. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, enjoy and learn about these types of books. I also recommend reading through the other "Wicked" series, "Thoroughly Spanked". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very impressed by the accuracy and clarity of the book. It does have references to the works of the King, but this is a scholarly, and not a personal, reference book. As the title itself states, it is meant to be read as a historical. The book is well written, and the reader can see the historical aspect of the works as well. I will recommend this book for any King's fan 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so excited to see this story. It's a beautiful, heartwarming story. The artwork, as I have read, is wonderful, and it is absolutely breathtaking. I especially like the drawings. It seems that I could finish this book without thinking of it, or at least that is how I feel, which is fantastic. There are so many wonderful poems that I have not yet read. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever had such a loss or heartbreak, and/or who is a friend, family, or relative who is grieving, and can appreciate the beauty of the story. Don't worry, there are plenty of ways to honor and remember those you have loved. I think this book is very powerful and inspirational to see the world and those in it, and not feel it. This is truly a gift from God 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I feel lucky in having read this book when I was 13. I am currently a grad student and I'm very grateful for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely wonderful.  It is so well written, and provides so much information that you will want to find the information for the rest of your life.  If you are looking for information about the Holocaust, this book will be the most comprehensive. If you're not looking for Holocaust information, this is not the book for you. I believe you will find the "good book" for yourself,  but you will not find it for others.

He wrote so well, and I'm glad I have gotten my hands on his work! It is wonderful to read the words of this man when I have the time to write them down. The story of a young boy that grows from an infant into a young adult is an absolute gem.  If you are looking for a story of compassion, love, and trust, this book is for you.  You will love it as if it had not been written for anyone else

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleased to learn of the new book by Joe Jones, a student in the San Francisco School of Music and Dance.  The book is a very valuable resource, not only for students and teachers but also for the dance community.  It covers the dance's history from its inception through its present state.  As a "history" of the dance, it is also an encyclopaedia.  Jones provides the dance history and culture information in a very easy to read manner.  Most people will get a kick out of this book and the dance is worth getting for yourself and your community. I recommend this book highly to the dance world

Write a positive review about a good book:   Great read for anyone who has no idea about what the Bible actually is, but is still curious.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very insightful, but not overwhelming read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I find it to be a fascinating insight into the history of the rise and decline of Western civilization.  I found myself on several occasions wondering what the writers would make of their contemporaries.  The chapter is written in a manner that is as engaging and enjoyable as the words are.  Perhaps the only flaw I have found with the book, is that it suffers from a slight imbalance.  If you are interested in learning more about the history and the culture of Christianity, I would suggest that this book would be an excellent choice.  A short survey from the writings of the people at the time of the beginning of this event would perhaps be the better option 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book covers all things you can do with the "Pumpkins" of your life. It gives you the tools you need to take on life challenges and then build your spirit. This book could serve as a guide to your own spirituality journey. It also can be used as an antidote to the modern day world's materialism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used to be a student when I was a senior in high school.  Now I am a stay-at-home parent of an adult child.  I am amazed at the way this book has helped the parents of the adults in the story. I am surprised at the accuracy of the words. I have to admit that I could not have told this story without the parents. They help to make the story so real.I also like the way the book was illustrated in color, which is something we rarely see these days, in literature.  It also brings back memories of my younger days 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was well organized, and provides much insight into the mental processes.  If you are a student of psychology, this book may be a great resource for your future studies

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic.  Very inspiring.  So much of the advice is straight from the Bible.  It has been a dream to see it come true, but I have come a little early, as the author is in her 90's.  I highly recommend this book for all that are at the brink of death.  This is for those that are on the verge of dying, and they are told to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is great!  It gives you an overview of all the information needed to be effective on your own.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the story intriguing and thought the author could have written a deeper, longer story that would appeal to someone who loves the idea of mystery but doesn't feel the urgency for it. If this story is any indication, I'd give it to anyone - or anyone. If you are interested, give this book a try. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been recommended to every child

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a truly fascinating collection of early texts.  The reader is treated to such wonderment in describing the creation of the universe that its wonderment is awe-inspirational.  I will recommend this book to both those who are fascinated and those who have not been.  It is an invaluable tool in developing one's understanding of the true meaning of the Universe, or at least of God's existence.  This book is so insightful that one is inclined to believe that the universe exists, to the extent that the author, as far as I am aware, accepts that God exists.  Perhaps I had to wonder a little, and the author seems to have allowed himself to be surprised. I will admit to having been somewhat overwhelmed by the author's conclusion.  His conclusion may not necessarily reflect the author at all, or even the author and his readers. However, the book's authorship appears to have been a journey.  What is even more remarkable is that the writer is the author of both the book and the entire journey. The book is clearly written in the form of a narrative.  As such, it is an act of interpretation, not of autobiography.  In the way the author presents the book, the reader becomes immersed, and is transported, and then can remain there until the book is completed.The book also presents a more general narrative, however, and this book is not aimed at those who already understand the book. It is aimed to help those who do not understand. Perhaps, however the book might make one wonder if this book was written before the advent of science, but rather the existence of this author, who seems to speak in the author. For example, what was the author writing to someone who had not yet discovered the creation, and does not know about the Universe.In terms of a commentary on the text, the author begins to speak as if the author wished to say something beyond the author or her readers.  Why does this author want to speak?  What are the author to say about the author?  It would seem that if this author was the creator, she would not want to admit it.   In fact, the text seems to be about as much a commentary and study of this book, as the author wishes to communicate her views. Perhaps the author would not make any mention about a creator.  She has a book for anyone, but in this book she seems to make it about her as the creator. This is
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a child, I was captivated by this story.  My father is a retired truck driver and this book gave him a chance to hear of his wife's past while driving.  I have seen the whole process of her life and she is quite beautiful in the end.  After reading this, I can't wait to see her again.  She's certainly the happiest I have ever known 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book, and I've used it as a resource for my students as we discuss the topics of the book, but I'm sure that my students will be looking for ways they can apply the concepts to the day-to-day reality of their lives 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a joy to find this, as my daughter and I enjoyed reading this, and it was a joy for us, both to read and to talk.  It is as if you read and you immediately want to talk with this author.  Her stories have a certain appeal to children, as do all of the ones that she wrote for younger children, including the "The Nightly Daughter" in which the girl, as a young girl, comes to see the older.  The young girl is so taken with the girl that she is compelled to come to see her, to see if the little girl really has "the" gift of speaking.  As the older girl tries to keep the girl from seeing, the girl eventually meets the mother of the little one, who has come to watch.  This story is a little slice of life, and the story does not end.  Finally, the story was written in a manner that was not to be understood until the last section, when the little boy is introduced to "The Boy" and learns the story.  That is when the story reaches its climax.  A beautiful, moving, and very encouraging story.I wish the children of my community had this in their lives.  Perhaps someday, they will hear and understand this as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is wonderful and inspiring.  It is not only informative but it has made life feel more wonderful and exciting.  Great read and a must read for anyone who has a passion in art.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're looking to learn some basic Latin, you will find a list of Latin words you can put on your own wall, in addition to the recommended book: "Merematura".  The two books are complementary, however, because, in the first, you'll have the vocabulary and grammar to keep you busy, while in the second, you can also learn some of the Latin phrases that you may already know (e.g.  merveurae)

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful read and very enlightening for anyone who wants to delve into the deeper questions about the universe. I also love the fact that it is a continuation of a similar book that I had read a few years before.  It's been several years since the last one, however, and I cannot help but wonder if there are more to the universe that we even know. So I can't help but feel this new book could possibly be more informative. However, I also feel that this book is a good companion to someone, however very unfamiliar with philosophy, who might be interested in exploring this topic. A very interesting read that also provides helpful information on a deeper philosophical level 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a great read, it reminded me that Jesus had made a lasting impact on humanity and that he had a great impact on the minds and hearts of his followers. It was great to hear that some people still believe in Jesus' teachings. It gave me hope for those people who are not ready to leave the comfort of their belief, it also gave some of the joy that people feel when they hear of his teachings.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with all the reviews, that is just the best book of all time.

The author is a genius and her characters are just as delightful and wonderful as they are in the real world 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book started a long, interesting and rewarding journey from being something I enjoyed to truly being a major book. I am now on a first-hand journey to be more aware of and better understand the mind. I really do feel this is for my entire family. It's a journey we all have made together. I have found the book inspiring in this new way, and it has the potential to touch each of us individually

I do not have any problem with any of the questions you asked.  I would suggest that you read it in order to get a better understanding of the problems of the Bible. I'm sure it will make you reconsider not believing the Bible is true 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The reader learns a great deal of historical facts, and even of more of the personal and family memories.  However, the reader is also drawn to the story of St. Vincent, to see him as an actual person of great importance in the history of the city of Antigonish.  If I could have written this book, I would have written it myself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing I have to say about this book is that its not the best but the only thing that I find enjoyable is that it keeps me motivated.  I feel like it was a great book to pick and have read for many years as a child and enjoyed it for myself.  When I was 12 it was when I first read it.  In its age category it is recommended for older children.  It was amazing to have this book read to me, and it is nice to think that there may be older children out there who are ready to read and enjoy this book as well

I think that anyone that read the book would have a lot of success. You will learn so much if you are new to this technique

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have ever read and I still find myself re-reading it. I have found that even though it was originally published in the 1960s, the themes and subject matter and writing have not changed at all in terms of what it is now. The book's style is still elegant and clear and it is a joy to read. And, although I agree with the author that the world we live in has changed greatly in the last 50 years, it seems as though the author's personal views remain intact. The author explains his view of society, politics, and what it was like back then. If you are looking for a book that is actually worth reading, this is the book to read, because it is certainly different from anything else that has been written on in this topic. This is a very enjoyable read, and it would be a great addition to your library 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this book gave me a new perspective on how I could better relate to my relationship with God.  It brought me to a place where I believed, and believed, that God was willing to help me but didn't.  While I do believe that this is not the end of this journey, I am still not satisfied with the book or with this book alone. If I had this book when I had a negative experience, I might have doubted.  This book helped me realize that my own belief in this was wrong.  I am very thankful for this book, and I recommend it to anyone who might be in a similar situation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first of the Gail Puletsky books I have read. The writing style is wonderful.  I really love it.  And the story is superb.  Pulett wrote beautifully and is such a delight to read.  It has a wonderful, loving ending.  Her writing style can not be mistaken.  She has a beautiful, loving heart.  My advice to anyone reading is to read this book and read her work.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book itself is excellent and I recommend it for anyone interested in the history of the Church and other religions, to understand more about the context of religious differences, as well as the issues involved with this subject.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book as the first in-depth overview of the origins of Freemasonry. The author explains the history of Freemans, who were in the 16th Century, through the time of the Elizabethan Crusades and the founding of the modern American Republic. A look at the origin of the religion and its rise to prominence is explained in a comprehensive manner. From the founding and evolution of Freemasons to the rise and fall of Freemason, the author explains all aspects of the founding, the evolution of their society and the end of Freemasonic persecution. There are some interesting notes on the social impact of Freemaster and Freemasons on society. Finally, it tells of the persecution of Freemathians in the 19th Century and the aftermath of the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the first book I read from her, after I had read the author of 'Bunnyland' and I knew what I was missing. I found this book to be the most rewarding and enlightening book, and I was inspired and very motivated to keep reading. I do not know how she can put it down to the best of her abilities. It has been a joy to read and have a life changing journey that has changed everything. I still wish she could continue to share what she has learned. I would recommend everyone read this book and the life she has given you. I know I will do 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite author and I recommend it. I have been reading him for over a year and this is the best story I have ever read.  He explains a lot of things and is a very calm story 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very unique and evocative writing experience that captures the imagination in every visitor.  A must have for anyone who has visited this country or who has seen the images and stories in its stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very interesting. I am a recent graduate of graduate school and I feel this book gives me some valuable insight into the research that I would have been unable to gather without this book. I do not think that it is a substitute to anything else. I highly recommend it as a supplement to your study of the same. Great book and you can get it at any major book store 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a superb read.  It makes one feel like visiting Italy and the whole culture.  The author draws parallels between the culture of Italy and that of the East Asian cultures of China and Japan, as he states, "the Chinese are far more similar to the Italians in their cultural heritage".  The book also includes a glossary with some of the terms used in the book.  I really liked the way this book brought out some of my favorite topics in the East.  Great reading, but if you want a deeper read, consider purchasing this book.I hope the author continues on with his travels to Italy, and has the opportunity to discuss the cultural similarities in Italy and East Asian countries, as this is a trip I would enjoy visiting myself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great. It has an amazing ability to connect the stories to the reader.  I would suggest that you read it for younger readers as the older age reader does not understand all of the details. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of the book focuses on the first two hundred or so years of Mormon history. It's a wonderful read and offers an excellent look into the period of time when the Mormon Church grew, and also into the times of Joseph Smith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic collection of stories that is easily one of the best in this genre. I particularly liked the short story "The Last Page", which is a very moving story. It is one of those stories that you have to wait for to see the ending, and once you do, it is so good. It's a great short story that also has a deeper meaning behind the words. For me, it's a very effective way to look at how the death of people affects them. A strong story that has the potential to be as great a book as it is. It may be one of this author's best works 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting look into the origins of the Bible. I believe I have found it to be an inspiring read. It is a must read for those who are interested in the origin of the Hebrew scriptures. This is not a theory but a spiritual look at the Bible and how it was received in a time. What is most impressive is that the author is also an attorney. If you would like to find out the truth of this topic, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book started out as a good read for children and adults. However, I'm sure that the older generation can understand this particular book, and even read it themselves 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a great admirer of this author and I hope that people who read this book will get great insights into the world of marketing.  I agree with the previous reviewers that he is a real "thinker", although I find him a little overbearing. But the book was well worth the time and the insights are enlightening. I found it a useful guide for anyone who has ever bought a bad book: it may have turned out to be  a bad marketing tool, but was never meant to teach anyone anything.  If you're looking for a new business idea, this book is a great start 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased with the story.  It was a bit funny, but also a very good story. I would recommend this for anyone who likes stories that are funny 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent work, and excellent book-a-time.  I really enjoyed this book.  It will be helpful for anyone who needs to hear the truth about this event from an authentic source of its creator.  This book was very helpful as I worked to learn how to receive the messages of truth and trust from the true prophet that I found in the Bible.  As I was praying and waiting, it began to speak to me.  The messages came to me from within.  Now I have been able to listen to the messages I heard, and it is amazing to see the change.  When I had spoken to my Lord Jesus, I could see the love and compassion I could feel within me.It is amazing that my Lord and I would come together.  If you are trying to hear Jesus' messages of love and peace, and to hear and feel what is being said, please pray this work. This is a gift of faith from God 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had a few comments on this book. The author is a native of Boston and she has a wonderful imagination. If you are a fan of Sci-fi, this is a must read! I cannot wait to have this book in my own personal collection 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just wanted to share the same appreciation to all of you guys that are reading this series. It was very rewarding to read. It gave me the feeling that everything that is going to happen in the next book was foreshadowed. My biggest surprise however was when I found out that one of the girls, Emma, could be pregnant. I have to admit I didn't even know. I had not looked for any other clues on whether this was a possibility until the last chapter, but it is in my heart to know that this was foretold, so much so that it may be a spoiler, but still I am so excited that I do not even know how I would react if I read this series if I ever got around to it. I'm not sure how to say the least. I don't want to tell you I've read this book before because I want to. I mean, I really want to know. There are so many questions I would have to ask myself, but right now it is just to see the end. It is good to know what this book can offer, and what is the meaning of what happened in the "good book" that I have read and the "bad book". The ending to this series is very good, but I hope that we see more of the same, the next few books will be more of what it was in the past books. I really like the way the author uses his characters as well, but as I read through the other books, I got curious, as many of you are well aware, the author seems to have a tendency for many characters to be so similar to one another. I will have a hard time with this one because the author just leaves it so unclear. As it seems that all the characters are not meant to be alike, but then again, when I read it, I can't say that I would put it into the same category as the other "good books". I have not read them, and I will not be reviewing them as I donot know the author, but if you are reading the other series, please don't take them as the same. The author is still in the process of writing the other trilogy. The series has the "haunting" feeling that all of the other author's books do not have. I like the author to write the author's last book, and there are hints that there are so much more to read, and if you like the first book in the
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book gives an insight into how a bad book that many people would not wish for, is actually something to look forward to if you are a fan of this show. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's a very good book

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be incredibly useful and fun to read.  I would suggest it for someone to read and see how their dog acts upon it. I believe the dog should be taught it for it to be a more intimate form of communication between owners and their dog.  The best part of this book is the photos.  They are the best that I have ever seen, and the pictures of dog and owner are the perfect examples. There are so many dogs that do not understand what the owners do, and this book provides them the opportunity to see what the dog will respond to. I do feel this book will help those owners that have been hesitant in sending their dogs to a live performance. I would say that if you would like to see more information on the best of dog performance, go to a dog show and learn about the performance.  This book was given a very important part of the performance of dog training. This is a good source for dog owners that want to know what they are being shown.  It may give a dog more of a chance at performing when they are allowed to hear the commands that the owners are teaching their dog

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book, if you have never seen or heard the song before. It is an incredible story, and the whole time, it is heartbreaking.  But it has been a great book for those who have seen the song and can understand the emotion behind it, and maybe you have seen it before, but maybe it hasn't been passed on to you. As you read this book, you will see the sadness, but you will also be touched by the spirit of the song.  It is absolutely a love song, and it is the saddest love song I have ever read. You will read and learn so much, so much more, and you will understand the emotions, and perhaps the meaning behind the song so much better. So, what does it mean to see the song on the outside?  What does it have to mean to anyone that has experienced the song, as it is a love, but is it a song of love?  If you are looking for the "true" version of the love song

But to understand beauty, the beauty of beauty, and to understand the cause of beauty then there is no other way.  The book also reveals the secrets of the universe, how beautiful the beauty is, and the beauty lover. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has the perfect blend of adventure, poetry and humor, and is a MUST READ if you are interested in seeing where the young man goes from here 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting book. I do not know how the author managed to keep track of all the things that happened in the book, and I find myself enjoying the story to its fullest. I have also enjoyed reading the story of Nee-Tak, the original boy, and then I read of her story, and when I read it, I felt compelled to check the time and date it was written. After I read Nee Tak, I have been so impressed with the author's ability to stay true to her original story and continue to develop it in ways I could not imagine. I was amazed that NeeTak's mother died of the same disease that made her death, and in my opinion, when I went to the graveyard in her hometown in the middle of the night, I was surprised to see that the day was written in the same ink and the date. I would have to admit that the author had more information on the book she did not share with Nee Aka and that I believe that if her son still lived, he would have found Nee Tak, "the only daughter of the original Neetak family in that time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book and it's a great read. I'm actually in the final stages of this story, and now I really do want to finish it.  As you can see, it has all sorts of wonderful moments of romance and love that, to me, are quite breathtaking and captivating.  So, if you would like a romance romance, this book is for you.If you enjoy reading books that can be enjoyed as well to the last, if at all, and you like romance then this is for your reading pleasure.It's quite a pleasure to read this story as I finish it, but there's also the feeling that you're not quite done with it. The first time I read it, I expected to be finished with it, as I would have liked, but I don't necessarily feel that it was completed to the point that it is now.  It is one of the only romance books I have ever read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful tale.  A beautifully written book that, to me, does not fall into the trap of "hokies" that some are prone to, and the reader does get some hints that the author had an affinity for poetry.  I was also a little surprised to find this in the back of the book, but I was curious to know how it might relate to his early years growing up.  It might not be strictly "about" his upbringing, but it's interesting to know of his early passions and perhaps even the impact it had on his poetry. The story is also an example of how an artist could "turn down" his work, and eventually the artist may not care about his work any longer. The author states that he has no intention of publishing the book.  However, it is quite interesting to read of the way his love of the art and poetry of poetry affected him, and it may have been the influence that allowed him to write the book of poetry that he wrote.If you are a new reader, I would suggest picking this book up. The best book in this category is a little different. It is a wonderful book, that takes you on an interesting journey that is a lot more personal. It certainly is not a complete book, and I have not even written it, it has been passed over in the way I have. The whole story of this book could be read for those that are looking for a taste of the early years of the author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read by her, and I've even read some of her other books, but this is by far the best!  It's easy to get into the spirit of her style and story, but not to the point that you will quit reading it because it feels so good

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you've never looked to the world of medieval martial arts and it is now time to get in on the ground floor of what it is like.  If the following are just the first steps in your journey, then this book is absolutely essential.  It is a tour de force and a pleasure to read.  The main focus of the book is the battles of ancient times and the times of the ancient fighting arts of the Romans.   The book also provides an overview of the basic skills of the  Roman martial arts, which can be seen as a sort of beginner's course.  Some basic techniques are presented and all of the information is well  presented

Write a positive review about a good book:   In the last section I give a nice review about this book.  My favorite character is still alive in this book, and will not be the only person I love reading. I love the entire book, except for a couple of pages that I was not able to finish.  As the author writes, he provides the reader with an insight that is not in any way derived from the information provided.  It is obvious that he is aware of the subject, but still, does not allow himself to allow the reader to know the full extent. I suggest the reader go through the book and be informed, but not forced. It is a true labor of love. If you enjoy reading, you must buy this book

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very insightful book. I'm a fan of the New Age writings of Eckhart. But I was very much surprised when I learned that he's considered to be a mystic by most people. I thought it was time for the "museum" of this mysticism to be opened to the public. If you're not sure of this, please don't be. Don't assume anything about anyone who visits this book because the writer of this book is not the true believer. There's no "one true believer" in this book. There are many times I was thinking to myself "how can the true believers actually be so far away from the rest of us?" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a wonderful book.  It is a true gem of historical fiction.  I couldn't put it down.  In the time it took me to read it I finally understood what it all meant.  The loveable characters are the stars, and the story is simply beautiful. I think it was the best book I have read and am now very dedicated to it.   Don't let the title fool you.  This was truly a time of adventure to read.  You will definitely want to finish the book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has given me some insight into the mindset of the most recent generations in our society.  I believe this new generation has had a profound effect on society because the majority of them were raised with these thoughts.  Perhaps it is the reason why the "familiar" nature of the world is so common these days.  It is the same mentality that has given so much of us a sense of comfort and security.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read it in its entirety and I cannot stop listening to the stories.  The characters are charming, the situations wonderful.  My child in particular, was also eager to read, and she enjoyed all the stories of her favorite characters.  I would recommend this book highly.  It is so very different from other books I have encountered.  For example, in my first read, I knew no of the stories in the book, however, after reading the ones, I began to realize my daughter did not like her parents.  Her parents, it is believed, were not the same as the author.  In this reading, my daughter realized that I, as a mom, was not the person to judge the story of her parents, but to truly understand their hearts.  Perhaps the author did not realize that her child was thinking of her in a negative way.  If you have any feelings about a bad book: you, I believe, should have read this.  As a parent, please have a better understanding of parents and child relationships and what it truly means to your child

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is one of the best books I have ever read.  It tells the story of a young girl named Elizabeth, who died during her first year of school in 1861. She is a single mother, as this book indicates, and she is raised from 1861 on by her aunt and uncle who, from this, assume she will be adopted by a family that will, in time, take care of her. Elizabeth, it turns out, has been orphaned to this degree and then, as in the book, she is taken under the care of others. Her aunt, who has, it appears, given up on the idea of adopting her, seems to think that she could be adopted into a family with a strong man, so Elizabeth could go back to school. But there is a mystery about who it is that is, in fact, the man.  If it is a case of adoption, it is the mystery that Elizabeth's family, in turn, hides in order to protect Elizabeth. The book, as I understand, has caused many people to think this is a fictional story. In fact, it has been a source of amusement for those of us who think that, for a book that portrays a woman adopted into an orphanage with the intention of taking care of the person that she had become, there has to be some truth to the tale. The reader should understand, however, that this is not so. In this book, for the true story is that Elizabeth had, in her first years of life, not known she was an orphan.  Elizabeth's aunt, having read the story as she believed, had a strong opinion as to who it was that the orphanage really had. Her uncle, however would be pleased to know the true nature of this man. There is also a note added to this book that states that it is not a book written for children, but for those that could see themselves in such a place. This book is for those people who do not see themselves, but, in reality, are that this person, this orphanage.

Write a positive review about a good book:   For anyone interested in the historical development of Christianity, this book offers a clear overview of the historical developments in which it intersects.  Not only does it cover the events leading up to the conversion of the apostle Paul, but also the entire process of its creation. This is a well-thought-out look at the origins of Christianity.  In the case of the early chapters, the book presents a more subtle critique of some of the more serious problems of Christian orthodoxy, and does not present a simplistic narrative.  As it is a clear effort to present a more nuanced view on the topic, I believe it will be of value to anyone who is trying to understand Christianity. I would also like to see a more comprehensive analysis of early Christianity written by someone who was more experienced in the topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're a fan of this book, definitely pick up a copy. I'd recommend keeping the entire book as well as the first chapter.  It has a very unique look and feel to it and, if you're looking for something with a more "adult" take on it, it may be a little too much for a younger reader

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's not often that I've found myself wanting to read a book that I could not put down. This is a must read book as an ex-con who writes a positive reviews about a book: it has everything you can want in a book.  From a realistic account of the American life you would have to guess the details. And it's just the right amount of fun, which is exactly the way I liked to enjoy myself. A great read

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure if you have read this, but if you haven't read, I would suggest it. If you are interested in the work of Stephen Burrows, I will give you more about his biography of this author.  A very interesting biography of an incredibly creative artist, Stephen Burrow's work is a masterpiece of visual and auditory storytelling. The stories were written in the style of the first chapter of the novel, with the final chapters in the same style. Burrows' work has a very different style and is not what you would expect from reading a first person account of such an artist. This is a truly masterful work, and one that you would not expect to come from a man who worked in this manner for such a short time.

This makes it a wonderful read for everyone to share with their family and friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very useful for helping someone to understand the effects of this disease, but also for the general reader.  As you read this book you will not be surprised when you read the words that come next to your ears.  The reader will be able to clearly see why this disease is so serious, and how the people affected with this disease feel.  I believe that this book would make your readers very upset if they haven't read it.  It can be helpful to keep in your library for this very important book, and if it's not already there, then it is great to find a place where the book is to be read, and I think it is right up your street.

I am not sure how her writing could be compared to other writings written by her.

Everything you read in this book is new and original and you want to read this book more than any other. It was a huge help, especially when you just couldn't figure it all out.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found it to be a useful resource for those who are engaged in some type of sexual relationship with an animal. I think it's important to realize that there is no "animal" sex.  The book does provide us with an insight into some of the situations and situations that occur in which this happens, and the author is open to the reader to find the  most appropriate time and location to  share her "story" with the animal.  As the book states, the book does not require one to be "in the saddle"

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is beautiful and very descriptive.  It includes the history of several places and places in addition to the history in a smaller book called "The History of the World."  It is a must read, and a must listen for those who have not yet explored their country.  The only downside is that the book is not so much a travel book, but more of a travel memoir.  Perhaps this book could use a slight touch of travel, but the book does not have the ability to cover the whole nation, or even a smaller section of a smaller town.  I believe that this book would be a great addition to travel for a group of children, but one that is more geared for adults.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent book. It has helped my understanding of my early years as a child. Great for parents who are dealing with this issue and those who are at-risk. Great book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would recommend this book to all.  I found it to be a refreshing change from the other books I have read of the Indian language. The language has many distinct words that make you wonder.  Even the word "car" does not sound like "car-car".  This book is the best example of Indian language 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you enjoy historical fiction, this book provides a delightful glimpse into the historical world, from which some of the most insightful ideas were conceived.  In addition to the original source, the author also gives brief biographies for all of the major figures and their biographies. In addition, the book also provides a historical guide that provides detailed instructions for a variety of battles in the book, and many in-depth references to other historical sources in the original.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book of her own. I have not seen it in any other collection but found this to be the best. The writing style is quite beautiful and it's very easy to understand. It is very nice to read. Very interesting to read when you're in the mood for a book. It has not become a standard text in the ways that I expected it to. It should read to the general public and the children of course. I also enjoyed reading this book with my daughter, and they did not have a negative review about it but that is my daughter's opinion. I would not recommend it to anyone because I have an aversion to reading it. The only negative review I have is that the writing style of this book differs from other writers. It seems to me that the writer chose to write this book for the children. If you plan to read this book, be prepared. This is a book that is for the young at heart. I hope that there is no negative review on this book; however, it should be taken into account and the author should address the author's intention when writing this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. It makes you laugh out loud and cry with love. It's also funny.  And, for those of us who like humor, this book is something we need to read more than just about our parents. We really need to try to identify the traits in them and then see what they may be like as well.  This book gives us new ideas about who our parents are.  If you've been taught anything about your parents you'll not be surprised.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   As the title states, this book was great.  I didn't have to slog through it but it kept me on the edge of excitement.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've used this book several times to help myself with some difficult situations. The book is useful and not overly difficult to follow.  It gives you lots of examples and the best solutions to the problem in each chapter.   The book also provides a number of answers to the problems.  I used this guide with my wife when we were having an argument.  In addition, I used it with her in a conversation I had with her about a bad book: some people said I shouldn't read the book.  The reason I said it was because it has examples that are not necessarily in the book; some people would probably just go right through the examples because it is not the book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a graduate student in literature and writing and had read and enjoyed this book several times, before it was discontinued in 1990.

I am certain the author will be back to this story in a more timely manner 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a very valuable insight into the mind of a high level Tibetan Buddhist.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great read, and really helped a lot with understanding and understanding of the people of the past.  My favorite part of the book was the picture of people looking out and feeling the weight of the earth. I felt as though the people looked out and felt the weight.  This is a very interesting concept to the present and the future.  I'm very curious to see if it was true of the time 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful, wonderful book.  Its a wonderful insight into the mind of a child. A little girl, whose parents love each other but are unable to communicate with each other, is separated from both of them. The separation of their love seems to be a gift. The book does a great job in illustrating the separation, and the story ends with the girl being reunited with her parents. A wonderful gift from Ms. Bader. The story is a true gift. Its one of the best I have read, and is of great encouragement for the parents to give their child a happy ending

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased with this book. It's been a long time since I read the original book, which was published in 1987.  The book itself was so good, that I was willing to get the original in hardcover as well.  I'm glad that I finally received the copy, as I found it much more valuable than the hardcover.  There are several good essays in it, but the main one is the second essay. In this essay, there's no mention of any real history, no mention to any real places in history.  In the beginning of this essay you see a little history going on, but after the beginning, the entire book is a history of a new and wonderful place. The essay is "The Last Harvest". There are parts of the book where it seems that there could be a connection to the old town, but it doesn't seem necessary. And yet, it isn't clear where the "old town" is in fact "old".  But the "last harvest" is more of a "the old town"

Write a positive review about a good book:   I used this book in my senior year of college to build and solidify my understanding of the concepts of existentialist philosophy. I am a proud graduate of the course. I still use this text as a reference to solidify, and evaluate my knowledge, of course, by talking to many students and colleagues who are in the same position as I was, who are now in their senior year and are struggling with the same concepts as well. I find that the philosophy of existentialism is not so much of a philosophical concept as it is a philosophy of life.  I am glad to have the book on hand to share with others who may need the same understanding of this philosophical idea. I would have thought this was a valuable contribution to everyone because it can help a number of people to have this understanding. I think I will suggest that the readers and their classmates share this book with one another

Write a positive review about a good book:   As for the two questions listed in the beginning, yes, yes! We all wish that there were such books as "How To Be Great". There is no easy answer. There are many things that help but in order to be truly great, one must understand, firstly, what it is to truly be great. As such, it is important to know the ways of those that are truly great. If the author is truly great then the answer to all the questions will not come. However, it would seem as if everyone was great from the first time. And as for the "what if's?" it is true that one must not think of it as a negative review. I am happy that this book does come into the minds of so many and it truly gives you an idea of how to be a great. I would love it

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fascinating look at the lives of people who could not keep their sense of humanity alive, as well as the social and cultural dynamics in the surrounding community.  In short, it is the story of a unique individual who goes out of his way to help others on a regular basis, but has no other reason to go out. In short - and this is not a spoiler for anyone - the reader is left with a feeling of unease, and this book is a moving experience from start to finish

This is a very valuable resource for all those who are studying Chinese history

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the book to be a great resource to help people of both cultures, even though it is a historical novel. I feel it gives both of us a look into the people of that time period and even if you are looking for the other culture you may still enjoy this novel. You could even have it read to you without having to put it down.  It is a great gift to have, that this novel can be enjoyed by all cultures

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book useful for me and other people like myself.  It gave me a good overview of the issues and the importance of each and the methodology. It was also nice to see how the authors used to describe the steps for the analysis.  The authors have given their explanations of each step in the book in a positive way 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading about "The Road to Last Things" several times, and now I am beginning to feel that I really like "The Promise".  The book has been a welcome break from the usual reading, as it gives insight on how this could have been.  I have no doubt that this is true, because the author has been working on this book for years, and when I found out that the publisher's first draft was a draft which was more than a year away from publication, I felt this must be a work of love.In the first part, "The Promised Road", the reader is left with a sense of guilt that "you too, are doing the same thing". A part that could be interpreted in many ways. The "promised road" seems to imply that anyone who read this book and read on would inevitably become the same.This is the second part, which the reader must read through, "A Promise". There is a different feeling to this "promise" in the second section. This leads to the question: could "you" read it too? This is a question that is never answered. I do not recommend this book without understanding the way the author feels and feels in "The Journey", and the journey to "The Last". The journey, or journey, is a very difficult journey. There is no clear and clear answer to "the question" and no mention of it. In the second chapter, the author gives the reader a glimpse into the author's own heart.  He mentions that the author, before the journey started, felt guilty, as if he could have made better sense of what he was writing. I believe this is the book is "a promise" which he felt he must have kept.In my opinion, "the promise" and "the journey" were two words which the author could not describe without a sense and guilt. I was hoping the book would contain a good explanation of the author. The ending of this book has left many questions unanswered. If the author were to give us an answer to the reader, I believe he would never mention anything about a journey that is not truly a promise.  As the author states, this is his way of writing, of not really being clear with his readers.If "The promise" in this book is the journey, "Promise" is a book of excuses.  If the promise to read the book, and the author was to write a book that
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic read. If you like the Harry Potter books and you like JK Rowling you will love this one.  I have read it as a child and I must have been 10 at the time and I was quite impressed.  My friends would rave about it. My mum was very proud when I saw it in the book store and have since bought for myself, although she has kept it to remind her

Write a positive review about a good book:   a quick read and it was a nice introduction to the book, the author is good, very clear in his descriptions and in the story. If you are interested in the subject of the first two books you would probably be more inclined to read the other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book. It's not just a "how to" book, it's a life book. The book does a great job of explaining the steps in how to become a successful investor, and gives great examples. If you are looking for an investment strategy that you can use to get a return on your investment, this is a book worth reading. However, it isn't the only investment book I would recommend to someone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first read of this book was when I visited a friend and she told me the stories and that she was a great, well-read girl. So I decided to see the book in the library and then I went to her school and that was when it happened that I began to really get to know the girl that I had been taught to respect.She started teaching in her own home, her life, and the story and then the story comes down and I really have to sit down and listen.I believe I must have done something very wrong to this child.I truly believe she must have been one of those that had her whole family believe her, but as I have talked to the family members, some said that this girl was just a nice, quiet, sweet girl.I am not sure, but she must not have known.I must have missed so many things.I was afraid of her, and now I really can't tell. If it really was true she had been hiding, then the whole family should be ashamed of her.I think this child must be really hurt.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides the reader with an extremely thorough and detailed history of the rise and fall of all the Great People in this universe. There are many examples of the great and infamous leaders of the greatest empire of all time. However, this book is not as comprehensive as the title might imply, as it contains information on many minor but notable individuals and events that are kept minor or even not mentioned by the main characters.The author writes with the most respect for his subject, but it does not attempt to put a positive spin on the past and the present, but instead presents the facts and details of the downfall of the entire Great People of the Universe. This book is well researched and will provide the reader more insight into the story of a bad empire, and the story is great, but does come with a little bit of an undertaste, because it is somewhat lacking in romance, and because the author's style and prose are somewhat dull and not well suited for this genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is truly an inspiring story.  Each day I would look forward to reading this book because of the wonderful moments it brings into the minds of those who are not fortunate enough to reach their full potential.  I recommend this book as a gift for those with or without a diagnosis of mental illness.  It was also a great comfort to hear the voices of those with similar struggles that helped to build up a foundation for me in order to help me understand the difficulties I have and the ability I still has to be my best.  The book is very heartwarming and inspiring.    This book is an excellent resource, and I recommend it as a help for those who have lost faith or feel they no longer fit in. It also helps to know that the struggle is not over

Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with the authors that this book was useful in the initial stage of building a strong bond between the reader and the book's author.  This is a wonderful addition to the family's library.  It's an amazing read, and I'm very happy to have a copy for my daughter.  I also love the author's writing style and ability to relate to anyone who wants to know more about this woman.  If she's reading this now, I wish she could take the steps to learn more about her! This is the book that was discussed in the first grade at our home.  We would have a very close friend, but it's been a long time since we discussed her.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a member of the New England Association for over 30 years and still, I have to tell you this book was truly life-changing.  I am now writing in the church's newspaper and it is inspiring and a source of wisdom and encouragement to others.  How much more can this be done, I wonder?  If you are looking for a book that will help you find joy, you will find it with this one.

It feels like you are in a world of love, and that you are not alone.  The ending is a good one, and the plot is solid. I found it quite inspiring, and will definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves reading but has not been able to go through the entire series. I would recommend buying this from your local library 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like the way this book started, and the more you read, the more incredible it becomes. You will find yourself wanting to see the author's work on a more extensive basis, and to see more photographs, and read and study all of it. I would highly suggest anyone with any interest in the military, military history, or the personal relationship of a soldier to his or her mother, or mother to his/her love.  I, myself, found myself to have a relationship with my mother that became the foundation for this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book about a year after its initial release in 1998. It was a huge success when it first hit the bookstores, and my wife and I are both now frequent users of this series.  This book not only has several of the more recent authors as contributors, but also includes historical essays by the younger authors as well.  I have found them to be quite stimulating for the reader of all ages. I think the authors have done a great job of illustrating the time of their respective eras and providing a look into the historical events of these times.  If you are a history buff who has read a history book that goes over the basics of what happened then, well, this book is for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of J. M. Morgan and am always looking for new books, but had to wait for this one.  I have found the book to be more "accessible" and not as dry as some of the other Morgan collections. This is the "Morgan Bible", and it is wonderful. It is the most comprehensive and interesting, I truly recommend this as a "read" for anyone, regardless of your age.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a great read and my favorite.  I'm a fan of all the author's other books, so it is great to see her writing of this one.  She does a wonderful job of drawing out the details that are relevant to this book and giving them a new twist on those aspects that are similar. She does make a case that all of these ideas have their roots in a very real tragedy that has left its mark on the world.I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys horror and is interested in the ways of humanity and its connection to the gods and the horror that they represent.  This is a book that is not only recommended for the author, but also for anyone looking to learn more about the ancient religions

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had many of the chapters to read and have now added the next few, and they have all been extremely enjoyable and informative. This is a book that I have read to a child and, having enjoyed many of its lessons, to an adult who has since passed away. This book, and all its lessons and stories, are very inspiring and encouraging.  The children, of course, have read and enjoyed the lessons and read these stories with great interest and enthusiasm.  I believe the story the adult read to the adult is a memory of its earlier self, or, to a lesser extent, of the child. The child was always able to hear and see the adult story, but the adult was always silent. This story, however, was a lesson of suffering, sadness, and the effect that such suffering can have on anyone.   The stories are not only inspirational, but very touching. One of the children's favorite, however (the child's name has not been used), was an illustration of children's suffering and loss. The story illustrates in stark and startling detail the pain that can come with separation of love. The pain of separation is as real as it is painful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is extremely well done and I believe it is great to have read it, especially since I missed it when I was a kid.  I truly recommend it to anyone that has read it.  It's great to think that the author's parents read this book and therefore it must be a great deal for them. I would recommend buying it now

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read.  This was the first book I read in comparison to the others.  I loved this book.   It made me feel so much closer to the person I really wanted to be.  After reading this book, I felt like my self would do the same.  It reminded me of the feeling I had when I started high school and was feeling so far away from myself.  The only way I could keep it together was to be in my mind. I am a happier person because I read this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It has been recommended to me as a great read on how to make a better book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found that the material was helpful for anyone who had problems of their own life. I agree with the reviewer who said that the book could help anyone in finding out what the author has been teaching. This is a book that anyone who has trouble or has a friend struggling with something would want to read, because this author is not giving it to the masses. There are many parts that are well done and interesting to the reader, however it should not be taken as gospel.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is the first book of Awea'i Nuru. There are many references in the book, but the book is not overly technical and more simply, the reader gets a feel of the whole. If you're interested in learning more about Aweanu, and you've done some study, this is the book to get. If not, it is great for people who are not interested in Aweanu 
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the most beautiful in terms of her art. I highly recomment this to her.  She's been my muse all this year. I have had the pleasure of browsing the author's works, and found myself so impressed with her craftsmanship that I was eager to purchase this collection.  I must admit, however, that I have not fully opened the book, as I still find it to be quite overwhelming, but I believe that there is more to this collection, and the author has left a very long chapter dedicated to the author and the works. I believe she had such an obsession with the art that she did not give much of the book itself. While I do not wish to reveal this to the readers, I do believe the writer had left many of the pages for the readers to read.  The title page of this book states the author had to leave her husband because of his "crudely drawn and unskilled work". She wrote this review about the book: "  I am not able to say why I read it.  It was simply a beautiful book.  From page three onwards, I felt like I needed to see it. This book is a labor of love. I was given the chance to know the author. The story itself is quite easy to understand, but it is certainly a difficult book to handle.  My daughter was extremely happy when I saw the title and found out why I could not leave the page. The author is quite different from her previous works. This story was not about a man or woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Great read!  I recommend this book, as is recommended by my friend 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with many other reviewers - I have been enjoying this book since the very beginning, and the fact that it is so well written and that you are able to not only enjoy it but also understand the reason for doing so - is truly wonderful. I would also say the first of the two of the "Daughters of Destiny" stories were the best.  I cannot help but admit, because you have to admire their writing skills. One is just as great as the other, and it seems to be the first story written. In the other one, it seems as if they were the only two people on earth who truly cared and that the two women were just as happy and strong and strong-willed as the story tells of them.  This is truly a remarkable story to read. However, the author does tell you that, because she and her sister did not have any children - she could not write the other story - I would give this story an A, but I can only recommend it to people who are also seeking for understanding of themselves, the cause and causes of the troubles that have been said, and how life is truly going in the world. I truly do not have the qualifications, but, as I say, this story is truly exceptional.In reading, you will have to read this story several times over, and then find out the rest of it. I strongly suggest that you get this book before you get the other two. I, myself, was disappointed, and am still hoping that she can find another reader who shares in her story. Her story does not contain the same quality as the first two.I read this book because it is a part of a series, and I do not think the other part was of equal level. I do believe she is correct in saying that this is a story of love, although she does not say that in this book. I guess you could say, "Love the one who was weak and was good for something". But the other parts of this book are a bit harder to understand, and sometimes it is difficult to understand. However this is still the book in which I have read and I hope the author and her story are great, as the author tells you. I will not give this series an A rating because it could not receive the same level. The only thing that I have said is that I hope you will find it worthy of the series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very useful for helping those new to D.G. Jung and Buddhist Philosophy understand the basics.  While it can be read from beginning to end, I would recommend starting with Chapter 5, which is the first of all, since this is when you'll hear the words "D.G." The title of the book is "A Philosophical Development of Personality", and the title is appropriate, as the words are said to go beyond what's usually spoken about "Personality".  In the same vein, "A Philosophy of Spirituality" was written in 1935, and it is still relevant today.  Perhaps the best of both of these is "Philosophy of Spirit".  If you have any interest in Buddhism, then read this book and the text of "A History of Zen".  It may be an invaluable aid, not only for the "philosophical" aspect, but also for the religious, because it may inform you of the historical aspects of Zen and what happened to Buddhism in general, and also provide a deeper understanding of the Buddhist philosophy, which was developed in Japan from the time of the sixth century.   I recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love it. I have recommended it to several friends and even my former co-workers. I truly believe that it will be a great resource for anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the true story of the Salem witch. If you are interested in researching this book, be aware of the book's controversial, historical nature. Although many people who write about Salem are biased, many people are not necessarily looking for a true account. There are many inaccuracies that need to be addressed and examined 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been on a boat for several days.  I'm so pleased with the story.  It's so simple, and yet so powerful.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am extremely grateful to have this book as a gift and to have had such an enlightening experience. I wish I could tell you about the other reviewers, but I do have to tell you the truth. That is what great about this book, to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like the concept of it. I do have a few questions about some sections, however. Some sections have a small amount of overlap with other sections and I believe that is intentional. For example, I would like more information on the idea of the "other". I could not find any information on how to deal with that situation. The author does have this idea in mind, and I suggest that there is more to consider. I would suggest to look elsewhere on that topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author's style is clear and sharp.  He draws in a sharp contrast to traditional theory.  But he provides much more of a back-and-forth discussion that is a breath of fresh air 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was really exciting and really helped with a positive outlook in life.  It kept me up for hours.  In the evenings I felt like it was very real and a good friend.  The entire book is well written and it's not to boring.  If you are struggling with relationships with a bad person or just getting a general feel of happiness this book will give you something to think about.  There are also ideas for different types of relationships.   I think that the book will be a great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great resource, especially for people of color. As a black man, I have to admit that I have not read many books by this author, but I found the book very informative.  He also included numerous examples of black women, black culture and black women's lives.    It is the first book in the genre of black woman memoirs.  I recommend this book as a resource to people of African descent

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be very inspiring. I also feel that it's helpful for anyone who is suffering with a negative review about bad book: I am still not sure that anyone else's interpretation is completely correct. Perhaps this is because the authors are all from the same branch of religion, but I'm sure that all the teachings are authentic.  It does help me to at least get some sense of what I'm missing. If you are looking for a spiritual guide, this book is not for you. If on the other hand you are interested in finding a positive source of spiritual teachings that does not include any false doctrine, then this book could very well be helpful to you

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like fantasy, this book is great.  If not, then I suggest you give another genre.  What a wonderful book.  One thing that kept me reading is the wonderful story line and amazing characters.  It is really great when you can feel the emotions and sense of adventure.  Great, but the book also has its ups and downs.  But I really enjoy reading these books.  I also wish I had read this when I was younger.  For myself and many others. This book brings back memories of reading the books of another friend of mine who was with me for years, and I wonder if the story is true.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this book.  It has a unique look and feel and is a great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book as it is well worth the effort to look through it.  I have read the two previous books by R.O.J. and it is quite a different story from the story of his father. His father tells of his own exploits, the tales, the story and the tales. He tells tales to be interesting and entertaining, yet it is also to be a warning that the world may be on the brink of becoming a terrible place. It is also interesting that R. O.J.'s father has a strong preference of the stories be told from a male perspective. His grandfather has the stories read from his perspective, and not of the female side. It must be noted that his grandfather, an uncle, was quite a strong man in comparison to R. J. The grandfather talks about his life, his work, and his own work. It seems to be true that he was a rather quiet and contemplative person. His stories are very compelling. He talks about the work that was done in his youth. The stories are a very interesting read, to say the least. It could be a very dangerous book for anyone to read. My recommendation would be to be kept to very quiet, or if not to read it to the family, or it may be kept for one's pleasure. The illustrations of the book is very effective, as well. I would suggest this as an addition to anyone's favorite book collection

Write a positive review about a good book:   Great and funny. And a great addition to all of the reading that is out of this series.   I also bought it for my husband, and he loved it.  The first book is a collection of short stories that, in my opinion, are all well done.  However, the second book, and its follow-up, "The Death of the First Generation", is a real tour-de-force, and the reader will be surprised by a lot of new information, but perhaps more importantly, it is an entertaining and, in some cases, heartwarming read. There is a lot that can be taken away from this first book, but the most important thing is the first story. The second story is a very slow burn. I suggest, however, that you do not read it before the book is finished. If you read it right before finishing, it becomes so very depressing. I think the reason for this is that in this story, I don't see the story as something for the young, or something they may wish to read. If one reads the book in its first form, it may well be a positive thing. However, if you are older, then you will find that the story begins very much like the first book. The first story, however much more serious, can perhaps, in fact, be read as a warning to the reader. The Death of First Generation reads like the beginning of the story, and, as the book progresses, the reader must reread that book again and the tone is so different. This story is, in short, a fascinating, but very sad story. In the same manner, the book, as you read the two books, also contains a lot more to offer. However in the later books, the pace and pace of the first two books are so slow. The other stories, "Dodgenders" and "The Last of The First Generation" can be read in its entirety, but are best read in the original form. If anyone had been to the movies about a dog with the tail cut off, you will not be the only one to find that, at least the story has been re-enacted.If you have the time, I would recommend that you read them first, as, in the second story, the first couple of the book begins very slow, and then speeds up. The story, "Eternal Sunshine", and the story about a man that is very good, but,
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is an excellent collection of historical research, although not the most recent but still very useful as it is from the past, with historical information from sources ranging from the early 1900s and 1920s to the present. The examples are excellent and relate to the current period, making it easy to relate and understand 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book, but what truly hits you is the depth and accuracy of the information. Not just the names, but the story and the pictures are great 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this book is great. i think i was surprised to find it because i had not read of this in other publications. i would recommend this book to anyone that has a family member or friend who has had an extreme reaction to certain items.  they could not be their normal selves. this book will certainly help to save you a lot of time 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent, it is an amazing read. I would recommend this book to anyone who has just been to Korea. Great stories! Great pictures! I have read them several times in the last few years, and have taken many notes, as well. This book has given great insights on the culture of Korea, both culturally and ethnographically. As an ex-Korean living abroad, I have been very excited to find a book which explains the entire story, and can recommend to anyone. It is a very positive book that gives you a better understanding of the culture. The chapters are well-written and very informative. I highly recommend it, it may be the book you are looking for, and I suggest a friend go to see if she has also read it. This is a must have book for anyone who travels to Korea 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for new mothers 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a good story. It has an original concept and twists and turns that the readers will not let go. It is great reading, if you have read any of the earlier books by this author, and will enjoy it more. I would have read this, but I have not. There is one problem that the author has to take care when writing. This is where he starts with the words, "This is not a book of love.  It is a book written for the masses". This could be a little confusing to the reader. We all know that the word "love" is a negative word. There are people that love a bad book. They love the word but don't think it is an accurate description. But the author does not give us the reason why he chose it. There isn't any reason why anyone should read this book, and if you are the type of person that just loves the idea of love, then just do a couple of sentences. If you are looking for love, and the word isn't there, just skip the book. But if you want love, read the book, but if you don't, then you must be very careful. If there's a problem with this book. It isn't a romance, but a book where all the love scenes are of a bad thing. The love, although it may be in the form of love when it is written, is the only thing this book has to do. There's nothing that can make you miss the lack of love in this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are at least an avid book reader, this is a great read.  Very easy read. Great information to add to your library

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books of their genre 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a classic in the way that it captures the essence of the "art" of making a good novel, and that is exactly why it is one of the best on the market.  It has kept me on the edge of my seat for years, and now, I'm reading it to see if it has passed its own lifetime, and I'm very much enjoying it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. It does an excellent job of describing many of the most dangerous and unsavory things I see on the street.  This book is great, and it has given me a very solid understanding of the street life of this place.  I would not recommend this book for children, but the adults, as they read from the book, see the potential danger the children see.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a superb book.  We all loved and enjoyed it.  It is very well written and easy to understand.  While some of the details may be a little hard to comprehend, it is well worth the time and you may even enjoy the book to see how your child feels.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very comprehensive book that provides a historical view of the early and contemporary Jewish community, which the author presents as a religious community.  The book was extremely helpful when I searched for some of the details in the book and also when I visited the church   I visited. I found that the book gave a wealth of information that allowed me to better understand the religious culture of Judaism.  I have been practicing Judaism for a long time and although I do not practice the religion, the book allowed me the opportunity to better appreciate the religion 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you haven't read this book for a long time, then you must. This is the best thing I've read so far, and I have recommended it to everyone. I also recommend the original edition of the book, as it has come out of print several times.  It is a great read to read for children. There are no spoilers in the book and it is a good place to read it for older children 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had the pleasure of reading this book while attending school in Canada in the mid-80s.  As I recall, it is now a small but significant book of its type.  The language is simple and clear and the prose makes a strong appeal to both children and adults.  I have no doubt that this book is of high quality.  It is a truly special, beautiful, and inspiring book.  Many thanks to the author 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of this author, and I truly love this book. The story is very emotional, and is very insightful. The book was recommended to a friend, and she enjoyed the story and was very happy with it. In her review, she mentioned the following:  The entire book has a great impact, and makes you think. The author also goes beyond to talk about his mother, his dad, and how the entire community came to the conclusion that his mother and his family are not the same.  The story and the book are very important to read, and if you are looking for a way to understand the family, I would highly recommend this book for you.I also think the author is very talented, and not just the author's story, but the author of the book has written a very compelling biography. I believe this book is great, and the author makes it that much more enjoyable to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend it to anyone looking to learn a little about the American Civil War and the Civil Rights era.  This is a fun read that's not so dry. I also enjoyed the information about the various people who were involved in the movement, but it was not as historical as others have made it. While not everyone has heard about the civil rights movement, there is a possibility that they weren't heard of by their neighbors or the general public, and even the many people who fought and are remembered today were in the dark. The main characters are a little younger than most people have been given credit for their age. There is a reason that the book was written, and it wasn't by a historian.  I like the fact that the author was able to use this as a plot device to write a more interesting book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read that I recommend for beginners and even the more advanced/experienced  people in the world of bodybuilding.  I am proud to say that I have read the first couple chapters and am very happy with the progress I have made.  If you are interested in doing some bodybuilding, this is a must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was amazed at the scope of this book. It was the first time I had read anything like it. There is a wonderful sense of mystery, as well as being well researched and well written, however I felt as though it was an original novel. I was very curious to read this book, and after reading the first two chapters, I am more interested in the author's work and in the rest of her work. I would recommend this book to those of you that are looking to explore the mysteries of life and death. I wish I had been aware of this before I wasted countless hours on the Internet, however, this was a wonderful book and I am glad I know her.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this fascinating saga of a woman's journey of self discovery, the narrator, a former Catholic, becomes a convert. The book is well researched and intriguing, yet does not seek to make any kind of conclusion; the book is truly a journey of discovery, from her own eyes, and that of her own faith and love.  The book also provides the reader with much insight into her personal journey from her faith to her new life of faith 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed it and learned a lot from it. I would definitely recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I agree with many other reviewers here  that this is a superb book, as are most of the works on this site.  It is a very quick read and an excellent resource, providing the reader with a brief review of what each book is about.  The descriptions are easy to read, as there are very few explanations.  There are no overly complicated parts.  This is a good resource for the reader to begin with.  I would suggest this as a starting point for those who are beginning a meditation practice.  If you don't know what a meditation book is, then I would recomend the book in its stead 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was pleasantly surprised and pleased to find that there are so many different books, and they are all of the same style, so there you are with the feeling that there is more to discover.  The book was written in a way that makes the reader more appreciative of the beauty of beauty and art, the history, and culture.  I do recommend this book for the younger readers, and more generally for the older children.  It is a "children's book" rather than a children's book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife read it and recommended it.  I can attest to her good book as a personal resource for people with schizophrenia.  The only thing I found missing was a diagnosis. It is the only book I have read that truly made me think twice. There is a big difference in the outlook for people who have schizophrenia when they are with the illness, and people who live with it. So it is important to recognize the illness for what it is 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It's an excellent guide to help you get through the hardest parts of the book.

There are many lessons of kindness, but also of a deeper respect.  This book has helped me understand more about the importance of kindness in our lives 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of John Trewson's writing.  I first read this in 1989, and was quite amazed when I saw the following episode, and now, I find it in the 20th anniversary issue of "Catch the Train."  It was such a great book, and if you like reading of the Great Train Man, I strongly suggest reading this.  It's one of the best books I've ever read, and one of his best work, and as great as I read him, I'll always try and find a chance to read his other work 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so glad I found this! I'll be reading more of this soon! And yes, I've read it before, but my child was so happy when I read about the "love in the book". I've talked about it with my daughter and she agrees. A great book for all ages 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author is an experienced scholar and writer who has written numerous books on the same theme.  I am pleased with her newest in this vein.  Her previous works are considered to be the best of the field.  While this book differs from the previous work, it is still enjoyable and enjoyable.   It is certainly not an original by the author, but is an entertaining book which would suit for younger and older readers

It really gave me the feeling that I was not only taking advantage of the time and energy I had, but also that this was my own and that I had the pleasure of creating something wonderful.  This book, unlike some others, truly speaks to the time of the author, and the talent and beauty it shows.  I also truly feel that it was not for me, and maybe it will be for someone else, but I hope for it to reach them, too

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so pleased that you like it. You must read it because its advice is so great.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The best part of this book is the first few chapters, in which I get to see the world in color, as a result of not knowing the language. I found myself wanting to learn, to know, to appreciate the beauty of these illustrations. It's quite the opposite, the author uses language, but uses it in a very subtle manner. I am a student of color, and I will still want to read the book, to understand the meaning. It really is a unique story and, in it, the concept of "unreal" is explored, as this author is quite adamant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read, the story is compelling, the plot is gripping, and it provides a compelling, compelling reason for why the universe is so wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For a beginner or casual reader, this book is excellent. It is comprehensive, detailed and enjoyable. In addition, it also has helpful appendices on a variety of other topics. The text itself is well written, and the reader is not challenged to read it more slowly, or for that reason. It does not force the reader to slow down or think too slow. In fact, this is a book that can be read quickly, read for pleasure, and then read more slowly. It may be hard to pick up after finishing the first chapters, but is not impossible, and I do not think anyone could enjoy it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really fun read. A really great way to introduce to this great book. I've been doing so in the past years. Great gift for anyone who wants to understand this and other teachings. Great read for anyone to understand the truth

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book for students of American politics and economics.  The book is extremely insightful and informative.  It does not contain an analysis of foreign economic theory.  Nor does it discuss issues of the theory's applicability to the United States. I recommend the book for anyone that is trying to understand the state of the country.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.  I was very surprised by the chapter where it was said that if you were to commit a crime and murder a loved one, it would mean that you were on the wrong side of the world. This makes sense to me. We all are part of a larger scale at this point in time, but there are many people who consider themselves to be criminals, who think of their friends, loved ones, or anyone in their community who are victims of an accident or crime and who may or may not think of that person.  This is a very powerful book, and the chapter was a great encouragement. The plot is interesting, and this book did have the advantage of including the author's thoughts.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my absolute favorite books. Great insights and great examples. If you are just starting out in this field, this is the book to read. If it has helped you, I would encourage you to have this book next to the first. I guarantee you won't be disappointed 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent companion to the book of Ruth, as you can see. The text is both fascinating and informative. It is a treatise, but not a book like "Ruth". It is more of a journey, rather than a series. It may be an excellent guide for someone to take a trip to Israel and see the miracles, but it is not an absolute walk-through. The author's intent is to see all the miracles and miracles' happen in Israel and to visit them and feel like Ruth's life was not real. In addition, the text, when it is set in Israel, can be read to some degree, and then to others, and so on. For people who are looking to get an idea of how it has come to pass, but are not necessarily wanting a full-length history of the faith, it would be a valuable read to be read with caution, since this text is not a "walk-through" of the Faith, but rather a "treasure map" of Israel and its culture. The book is not intended for anyone who does not wish to "wander" into Israel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're a fan of sci-fi and history, this book is for you. The author gives a detailed description of the ancient Egyptian Empire from the fifth dynasty and beyond to what it might have looked like during the Golden Age.  There's much about the politics and society of the time and how they interacted with the people.  Also the author gives numerous examples of how to use magic and technology to the same effect. It gives great insight into the way the ancient Egyptians thought and lived.In all the different ways this book can be used in any setting, it is a good reference book to have.  It can be a challenging book in itself, because the author tries to write so far in the past, but not so far that you're not sure what's going on 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Very well researched and insightful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful and well-written story.  I really like it.  It is a combination of love and romance.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful guide for anyone who wants to be able to communicate the concepts to the young.  It also includes the most helpful materials available for those of us without the ability to communicate.  I especially recommend this book for those who are working with or are thinking of working with adults who may not be familiar with communication.  These people of course need to be reassured that communication does not mean that they have no other skill.  This book is meant for all who are engaged in the practice of communication, but it's a very personal journey to understand this process and it's certainly not the sole of communication 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you haven't read much about this book yet, I suggest you try it before you retire. The author's skills as a story teller are admirable and his prose is delightful. His story of an encounter with a man with psychic powers, is a joy to read. It is a fantastic read, but it is difficult to finish. However, it was recommended for those who wish to learn more of this story, but cannot finish. This is a must read for those with a serious interest in psychic powers. It could possibly help those who are on the verge of experiencing psychic powers for the first time. It does, however, put a strain on the reader, it must be read to the very end. The book can be difficult to read, and in the end, the author recommends you "wait    a little longer

Write a positive review about a good book:   I would be excited to have this for my first grader.  It is a fascinating, eye-opening look into our lives and what is the true nature of consciousness.  I see a major shift in consciousness. As I would read this, I had to laugh at his classmates and they couldn't believe him. I mean, he was telling them that he's "not crazy."  I mean he was right. I can't wait to see them in the morning 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent for children and adults, as it can be used in therapy as well as in play. It is a very calming and enjoyable book to read to children as a calming guide.  It does a great job at lulling children, but if a parent is also a child's parent, he or she may try to get the attention of the child for the same. I personally had a child come to see the book to reassure him or herself of his health 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It has a good blend of humour and poetry.  Its a must read for a child. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a serious student of this author for years. I would recommend everyone read this, and will continue to for years to come. I have read through several of her books in the early days, and she is much more accessible now. It is amazing to see the breadth of her knowledge in one book. Her writings are now on my mind, and in the future I will be referring to her books and her "quotations". Her "quotation" of an episode in a book is a beautiful quote.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had the chance to see and read this book when it was first published. As I said, it is quite brilliant. It has an aura of authenticity and is a wonderful gift to all of us. The author is a very engaging speaker and a wonderful writer. The only problem with this book is that I was only able to write about half the book myself and when I tried to complete the second half, I was quite discouraged. I would have liked to know more about the subject. I was truly touched that I did not see it. For someone to know of this book I would recommend to the author and all of her friends

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really love this book. It has everything you need, but the chapters are very interesting to read, and are written for older children. I especially like the illustrations. I recommend this book for older siblings, parents and friends. I really feel like the book provides an excellent resource to help those who are not familiar with the Bible. As I have said, this book is a great read for those people who are curious about what the Bible actually says.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read, great insight.  I will certainly check in with you about it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book, because I think its so true, and it is well written and the most original. It gives a very accurate insight as to why and how a man can do so much for himself and others that so very few truly understand. I recommend it to anyone who loves the gift of self love 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a student of Charles Beard's and I could not fail to see the connection to the topic of the "Rage Against Nature" and the "Nature Attack" phenomena. I was amazed at the "nature attack" and its violent impact upon the student body. I feel this book should be the first in the world to help the young people of the Western world understand the violence of nature. Perhaps the author had the best of intentions, but the reality was not to the best, and he will never be able to truly grasp the beauty of the natural world or its beauty, nor forgive the crimes that have been done to it, nor will he truly see the value of the human body.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on how to win money.  I suggest anyone starting this book at least once before investing, and after each investing trip. If you are interested in starting a big investment fund, just make sure to get some pointers on how much money you want to invest, and then how much you are able to invest.  It's as simple as that.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very impressed with how detailed and insightful the author is.  The chapter on "The Unfortunate Death of an Aborigine", is a really good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the most detailed and insightful overview of psychology in English I have ever read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is superb. There are so many photos in it that help illustrate the book and make the reading experience more enjoyable.  There are many tips, tips and phrases that relate to gardening and horticulture, but the book is really focused on one particular part of horticultural history, the 1800s. I found this book to be very helpful for me, as well as for my husband, since I have an excellent gardening background.  It certainly helped us in both learning the importance of a well-rounded library, and finding ideas that we could apply to the things in the garden

Write a positive review about a good book:   My mother and I found this book to be a useful source as we visited Hawaii and found it a refreshing alternative to the usual tourist guides.  I think it's a good resource, in that it is not too far off from the typical tourist guide, but is a different from the tourist guide.  It gives a better insight on the islands and the lifestyle of Hawaii.  For example, I have a friend who is a part of the Waikiki Beach Club and she mentioned that they've been in the past with the club and she's told me that she has a great friend.  The story also includes references to the fact that the club has more than 50 members.  This may sound far away, but it's true.I have found the club to be great for some of the other points that I make above, but not as a tourist destination.It's an interesting read and a source for those seeking to understand the culture and the people of Hawaii and the idea that it has been here a long time, and will stay here long.   While it does not tell you the truth in the sense that the author could have gotten more from reading about the islands, it does give you an idea of the island.  There are also a few references to other countries and the islands of the Pacific. This book is a great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As the title says, this is a very detailed biography, which tells the story of the murder of Dr. Goulard, who died in a very violent manner.  A note for this book: it is not a straight forward story, but instead, it is told in a chronological order, with the reader being given a few clues.  This allows the reader to understand the crime better

I think the author is a gifted artist.  He has a marvelous way of bringing his personal life to the story. I think he really puts a sense of humor to the situation and makes the reader feel as if they are also in the story, and the readers can see how the situation affects them.In addition, the author did a wonderful job at introducing new people to this story, as well as providing some of the characters 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My second favorite book, by Robert B. Morris.  This is the book that helped me become a better man.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides a very well laid out overview of most of the major religions as well as the history of the world.  I would recommend it for anyone that wants to learn more about the religions.  For a beginner, it is a good read, but it may be too simple to understand the religions to anyone who has no prior exposure.  This is not the type of book you want to read if you are the exception

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best novel I've ever read and it can be read in the original form without knowing how the story came to be.  However, to some, it will be confusing and not in the way the author intended. The story is a mixture of historical events and fictional

The book is very different from the usual fantasy fare, but in a good way. The story is a lot more exciting.  A definite recommendation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very insightful biography, which is essential reading for anyone looking for some insight into the origins of Islam. A recent convert to Islam by the name of Abu Hamza al-Islam is also interviewed by Jafar al-Otayun. He provides an interesting insight into his conversion, his upbringing, and his early career. I highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in learning more about the roots of Islam 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you read this book, it will become very important, but it is not your first book. You have read about other books written by the same author, but this is one that is very close to perfect, it is the best thing you can read, and you can use it as your reference. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like reading this book because it is a story, not only about a young man, but also about a woman, an icon, an artist.  I was very surprised when I found out that this story has been lost to the ages.  My parents must have had an original copy, and as such I was interested in learning more.  After a few years of thinking about the story, I found a reference to it in an old book, from the 1800s, which is a shame because the story could have been much more effective.  While there are no references to this book in the "new" reference books, I feel very safe recommending this book as a "lost" story to anyone who would be interested.  It is a good story for anyone who wants to see the greatness and beauty of a woman who was so young.  If you are interested in literature, and the stories that may be passed over, the story is a beautiful, simple, and sweet tale.  The story was told to me by a friend who had read the entire book, and now my friend and I are looking for it.  A lot of thought was put into the story.  Her story is not just one of the tales of young, but of a young woman who is so young that you don't know it. I really enjoy this book, not just the story but also the story of her life, and of the events surrounding her death.  As a teenager, she is a woman.  Is she a hero?  Is her life worth remembering?  The answers could be yes.  There is not much in the way of information. I believe the story was read to my father, and then passed down to me.  Our love for the story can't be measured in numbers, because it could have happened to anyone.  Not everyone is worthy.  What makes the story interesting, and why did it disappear?  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an incredible book. If you are looking for ways to have a positive impact on your loved ones then this is the book to read. It is easy and compassionate

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've bought many of these and have found them to be very insightful and inspiring. It's great to see that there are so many people like you out there.   It is a reminder to all that you can make a difference, whether you are at the very bottom of it or just starting to climb to the top.  For the average person, I believe this book is a great place to start and it gives some great tips on how to deal with those in the upper echelle of the self.  I do see the benefit of this for everyone, not just the self-conscious. This book also serves as an introduction for those who wish to find a life-giving book to read.  If you are looking for the answer to what the world and people are trying to find out about you, please read this.  There is one that you have to read and I have recommended the book to many people over the years

While I do not have the time to read it (we have so much in the home that we are too busy to waste), I do have a number of ideas about the book that I would be able to incorporate into my daily practice.  I would recommend it for anyone who is serious about learning about Japanese

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an important work to understand and promote the positive outcome of the Black Pride Movement.  It is a positive book that shows how the black community has come to terms with the positive results of their struggles 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was impressed by the depth of this book.  It was a very helpful way to put into practice the concepts I was learning to understand, however I also enjoyed the personal insights that the author offered.  For example, was the author the person who I had written to as a child? 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is like a book on the spot!  I really like it.  I read it for myself and found it to be a very helpful review, but also for anyone who will be involved with these concepts as well.  The only thing that is missing from this book was a section on the difference between the old and new world and what has happened. If this is the only book written, it is a great resource, but if you know more, I would not recommend it.If you are looking to get some new ideas, this book is the best of the best!  If you are thinking about going back and forth between the new and the old, it may be a good resource, as long as you are not looking at this book for the same reason, the old books could just cause a stir in the reader. This is a wonderful resource, it can help a lot, but it would not be a complete book on this topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a great book to read for people of different faiths to see and be with.   I think we all need to understand and respect all of the religions, and that's why it is so important to make the other people who are your parents in your home, feel as comfortable as possible.  I recommend it for all of those who are still on a journey to understanding of our world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was an eye-opening exploration for anyone who has been in the church.  It helped me see that the church is NOT the only way in which to receive divine grace, but that to receive this is the path that will lead to Christ.  The church is only ONE way, however.  What I would have suggested to everyone who has the desire to see and accept Christ as Savior, without question.   I also believe that to see this as a possibility is only the result of the church, and thus it has nothing to do with all the other churches and all the others.  This is an entire journey on that question. I recommend this to everyone, because it will help you think of it in terms of other churches, but this book also serves as a warning against the false ideas that so many have, and an invitation to a spiritual journey that will set you free from all of those 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a new teacher to my students, I learned that there is a lot of information in this book and they are very helpful.  I wish I had read this years ago!  I would have been able to have given my students some better insight into what they may be feeling. The author does a good job of telling the reader their pain and the reason for their pain 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a mother myself and an advocate of giving birth at a public ceremony, I was especially interested in this book for its historical context. In this, the author has done an excellent job of portraying this historically controversial event, but also describing the journey of each child, explaining the transition to their new life as a living child. It gives a wonderful insight to the emotional growth that accompanies this change, and the author also provides a positive message that it is OK to have a baby for the right reasons 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was really great. It made me understand a lot more about what is happening in the world. I especially enjoyed reading the part that included the "paparra" scene. This scene was great, but was very relevant to the overall story. It was great when it happened. I think it was a great part to the story, and it really put it all together. As a result, this book was very good. It gives great insight into the mind of the commoners. It also gave me some great ideas, ideas I plan on using to improve my work! It also gives the reader an excellent background on the Commoner's mentality. The book is definitely a great addition to anyone's library! I recommend this to anyone who is looking for the information to read in to the commoner. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing to add is that the chapter was very well written and the author was very helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives you an idea of how to create a good, safe book: in that it is easy, and easy to read. I love this book, and I think that if you want to create your own book in this same style, I'd recommend a good read book called  "The Basics". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of this author, but it would be hard to find a way to read it without spending quite some time. It is a real treat for the avid reader. I suggest you take this in as a kind of "must-read". It is very addictive to get to the end, and the author's humor was a very welcome addition to the book. Great story, nice characters and a beautiful cover. A real treat 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is well written and provides excellent ideas and explanations of many aspects of software development.  If you are looking for a course of study to help you understand how software development is done, consider this as a guide.  You may also consider taking it as a follow-up to previous classes to get some refresherance.  For example, this book could also be used as a refresher to other courses that use this framework of concepts 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is extremely informative and well worth the time and effort to learn the basics.  The author also makes many suggestions and suggestions for new players to get ready for the tournament environment as well as other topics that are beneficial for new and experienced players.

I also love the idea of an open source model that is accessible to anyone regardless of whether they are a good player or bad player

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read it several years ago, and enjoyed the story and the illustrations.  This book, however, does not cover the basic rules for all characters.  If you want a more thorough guide, I suggest the book "The Rules of Magic" by Harry Tarry. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed the first part of the book and liked reading it because it was interesting to me. The second part is great. I was very pleased to see the characters become more like friends. I think it's a good way to introduce the new readers. Great job!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to read this in one sitting and I loved it. I read it the first day after my summer vacation and found it to be really helpful. The information and stories are well-prepared and informative. I suggest that anyone who is traveling for a reason or who is looking to develop a good relationship with other cultures is recommended to check out this book. If you are not familiar with the world of African American cultures or with American Indians or European traditions, I think you will appreciate it when you're done reading it. It can be helpful to think of how different cultures are so different. There are many ways to get to know a culture that you've never considered before and can learn new things from it and have more open communication with the community and other travelers who are not necessarily familiar with that culture 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is quite good, and really has been helpful to help with my spiritual growth.  I will definitely purchase the next one as I think it will help immensely.

This is the kind of book where you can go back to it and enjoy the story again if you've read it, and your friends would too. It was a big favorite of mine when I was in college. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is informative, and if you've not read it, this is a great place to begin.  It is the first of the major series of books by Dan and the rest are great read together.  If you like fantasy, you will also enjoy the stories.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would recommend this for anyone who has been looking into Eastern philosophy but didn't know about the work of Plato. If you haven't read it, do, and if you haven, do it without knowing a bit about the content but know it to be of a good quality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is beautiful and detailed 
Write a positive review about a good book:   this book is a great read, in many ways, but the writing was not quite "great". It's not necessarily hard to believe that all the people of that time would have thought that things would go a different direction, and would have been a sad and dark tale. It may not have been as "quotable" as it seems in hindsight, but it is a wonderful look into what people thought would happen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband, a student of the Korean language, picked up this book for a few weeks at his library and brought it to my home.  We talked and enjoyed the book, and after reading it, I knew why she had called it "The Way for My Korean

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read several books on the subject of the Nazi era and the Nazi Holocaust, but I do not think this book was as comprehensive as others, nor as thought-provoking.  However, it certainly provides the reader with insight into the Nazi culture, and gives a personal account of the writer's experiences.  The author was interviewed for the book, and his account of his time with the Germans in 1945 is the only reference he gives to the Nazis. This account, as the book implies, is a highly personal account.  In his book, the author references the book in the present tense, which is to some extent misleading, given the author's present emotional state.  Nonetheless, I think this is a valuable book, as it provides the perspective of an individual's personal journey into the Holocaust and his ability to write it down.   It is a very moving and thought-shocking read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book I've been looking for, the story of a girl, called "Mia", who travels to another island in the world and is treated as a child by the island people.  The people who see "MIA" come to the island for healing.  So does the islanders, the island's guardian spirits.  Mia comes to the place, with the people, the doctor who has been "allowed" to see her and who believes that she has the ability to do so.  They don't quite realize she is not the girl, and she becomes a hostage and is kept prisoner for one night.  Soon after, the world is attacked.  Her father, who has not seen her in two months, is killed.  Then the island is attacked and the world loses the whole of its population.  But the island also has a spirit.  He is the spirit of the island.  For two months she is kept hostage for. She is then taken to another village.  And the island has been conquered.  We get to the end of this story in that way, but it is interesting to see the different ways in which the island was captured.  It's very compelling.  I loved the idea and the author did a great job describing the island, the people and the island itself.  A lot of other people may read this book and think it's a fairy tale, but I love it and it also gave my imagination.  What you need to know before writing a negative review about it:

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great, well illustrated book. It explains the science behind the "superperm". There are lots of pictures, but you get to understand the theory of "super-perm". It is well organized, easy to read and gives an overview of the theory. The book is useful for people wanting to learn more about this phenomena 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a child, I was amazed and delighted when I learned that my father had such a unique writing style.  He had written in my youth, and in my adult years, he had kept this in mind for me, and I still have the original and I continue to refer to it from time to time.  But the truth is that it is still quite remarkable. So, my child reader who is now a grown woman could not be more thrilled.  My favorite passage in this book is when the characters are fighting a monster which they have not yet recognized. I believe this is where she finally comes to accept what she has long been learning.My child-friendly, family-oriented reader has the courage to see these children struggle with this unfamiliar language, and it is a joy to see them overcome it, especially the ending. In this, she learns that she does not have to be afraid of the monsters of the world--there are monsters, and they can hurt you, too. But the children of the family (and of all of us) need to see the world as it is, and this book provides that opportunity.If you have children of either the older or younger age level of readers, I do not recommend this novel because you can expect children of any age to be intimidated by this text and your children will not like it. It is for children of all ages. For those who can relate to this, and for those who are curious about the way the adults have written, the story is not in the least frightening, but it does not come across as very frightening. I encourage you to have a look at the title, as the title is a bit misleading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book has an incredible amount of information and the author's ability to make it simple, fun, and easy to learn.  I have recommended it to anyone who wants to learn the most basic skills in life that will save them time and money 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very nice, very thorough introduction to the basics of playing Chess. The book is also organized into sections on each chess-related topic. For instance, the topic of play of an opening move is divided into the two sections of an initial evaluation and a subsequent evaluation of an opposing move. Each evaluation has an appropriate title. However, the whole book is well-organized and readable. I'm a first-time player of Chess, and I would definitely recommend this as an introduction to chess

If you are interested in an adventure that takes place within the confines of your world, this is a book for you.  There is a great deal of travel and adventure in this book, but not as much as one might expect.  The book is meant to entertain and inspire the reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite of all of the authors I read in the "Bible Series". The children are very interested in all of their readings. As I read more, I realized that there are not as many passages of a similar nature. I would like to see more that mention some of the other passages in the Bible. I love the children.

This was such a comfort for me, and I think the author did an excellent job of capturing the emotions of the novel.

I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how the next book is brought to life, and how she does with this one.  Thank you so much for giving us such an amazing book. I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking for this book for a long time, and it is truly very well organized and written. It has an excellent summary of a short book in the early 1900's called The New World Order.  The author states that this is a short synopsis, but the author also includes other pertinent details that may have been added to the short book by some of the students of the time.  I was very pleased to have found this book.  This is a valuable resource for those students of history who may not be aware that the idea of an international government is the basis of the modern world.  If you are looking for a historical review of the concept of the international government, I recommend the short-lived, but very important, book that was published by the American Society of Political Science in 1898. The Society of Friends of the World Order, also known as the First Quakers, were considered an outcast of the Christian church. The First Quaker's society, however, was, in other respects, considered a conservative religious community.  It is interesting to note that there were many members of the society who wanted to hold the United States in the same regard the European government held the Christian faith. The writer of the book, however. was not a member of the Society of the First, a society that exists today, and is currently known as The Fellowship.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The story takes place in the 1930s, and the reader will find the same information in the book "The Woman with the Rose", by Mary Louise Reynolds, published in 1925. Mary Louise was Mary Louise Eby and the woman with the rose was Mary Elizabeth. Mary Elizabeth is Mary Elizabeth Reynolds. Mary Eby was born in 1789.  Mary Eiffel was a woman who had been put to death. Mary is the last person to see the woman, who she called "Rose" when she died. Her fate is a mystery. The book focuses mainly on the events leading to Mary Eifel's death, and is a very slow moving story.  It is so slow that Mary is unable to hold the attention of the reader. This book is not simply a mystery, but is more than that.  The "Rose's" case is so baffling that it is hard to keep track of how it all began. The author uses the name "Rose", "Rose Eby", "Mary Eiffe", and "Mary Elizabeth". However, this is a story of love lost and lost love.  As the story progresses, the mystery is the reason why. The mystery is also the reason for Mary Eee's name, "Rose". Mary Eyer is now known as "Rose"; and, if the author means "Rose, Eiffele" or "M.Eee", she must be referring to her. If her mother, Elizabeth, is Mary Ekere, it is even more interesting when the author uses Mary Eker. The story is so mysterious that Elizabeth Eiffer, then in her own right, is no longer alive. Mary, Elizabeth Eyer's mother, who, at age 16, married Mary Ener. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book that I have read from him as a child.  It is a fantastic story and his imagination was so vivid.  And you know why.  I wish I could have told him when I was young that I wanted to be a good writer.   I would have been able to create such a great story and I would think that I had really been in a good way.  The thing is, however, that it can come to everyone.  So if you are in a great book-making town like the town of Bellowsville, Virginia, you would be able to see the writer. The writer can come and visit you. And in this case, that writer was you. So, come on out of that good book!  You can try it. If you can't tell it is the real you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very much enjoyed reading this and I highly recommend it.  It is a very detailed guide to the entire book and very well organized.

The author goes into great detail on how to create a successful book and also gives great tips to people that they should not do.  You really can't help but read this book.  I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading this book for years and the insights are always new and useful.  If you are a Christian and want to understand why Jesus was the Messiah then read this book, but also a secularist should read this and be open to understanding the Bible from a Christian perspective 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that i would recommend as a complement to the previous "The History of the American Nation" by Richard L. Collins. I found this book to be a very easy read, although it was not overly difficult. However the use of the word "The" is quite appropriate. As a historian, it was a tool to use when addressing audiences that are not familiar with the term, "The". The use of this term in this book is not only appropriate, but required to the author. The "The", as in "The America" and "The USA" are never spoken during the course of the book, but are used as a synonym for the country. The reader would also find "The' America' to be of great use when researching for an eventual book on the United States. The author is certainly a man of insight, but not a historian. I would suggest that this is an excellent resource for anyone, of whatever age, who would like to see a true and accurate portrait of the USA in its current state. The book may seem somewhat dry, but the author is always well placed and it is a pleasure to read. For those who are interested in reading a true history, and understand the context of the author's words and research, I would recommend this book, and the author may receive royalties from such sales. If you would like an easy read that is relevant to younger readers who are not aware of this author, i would suggest "The U.S. in the World" by Andrew E. Buckley. If this is not done, I'd suggest this book and "An American Century" by Arthur M. M. Kahn, as well as "The American Century". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic book.  I read and enjoy every part of it. I wish I could have enjoyed it more.  It is such a story that draws you in and the book makes you wonder, is it not. It gives you the feeling that you are watching the stars of their life.  They are now more vibrant than ever and as the author states, the reader is to keep watching. I am excited to see what the stars are like in 2031 and beyond. I would love to see more of their glory. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a book that everyone is talking about!! I must confess that I am still thinking and rereading it and it is so well written and entertaining 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the first in my personal collection of "Obey", which was, in my humble opinion, by one of the best authors on this subject. His work is a fascinating, but also quite thought provoking, as it tells of the historical, religious and cultural background of what Obey called "the law". I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the topic of "theodicy".

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is excellent, a must read for anyone wanting to learn how to build a successful home.  This book was a complete reference book, as the author was able to speak to the reader in a sense that was not to the typical reader.  What was most interesting to me was how the author addressed both the home buyers and the builders.  He mentioned that while the buyers would learn the general principles of home building, the builders would also gain some knowledge from the home builder.  If the builder had experience, this book was the perfect tool for them to gain new experience.  I found the book helpful in building my own home, as I found that I had to learn some new strategies and techniques from the book, and the home that was built upon.  It was a great resource that gave me the ability to learn new tricks to the very first homes I built. As the author alluded to, not just the builders, but the buyers as well.  While it may be hard to purchase the book without knowing the names of the companies and the individuals, it is great to read this book and see how many companies and individuals actually exist that own the houses. This is a book that is a "must read" for anyone. If you're a builder, then you really must buy this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is superb, an absolute must have for anyone who is taking the bar exam in India.  The book is beautifully written and well illustrated, and it is extremely easy to understand.  It is a must have when one is thinking of the exam.  There are a number of exercises that cover the whole process of the bar examination, in addition to the instructions.  In addition, the book offers some examples of what people say when they pass the bar.  This is a wonderful addition, and is truly useful to help one understand what it is like to be a bar-goer and understand what is happening to the person who is sitting for the exam the day after the passing.  A great addition to anyone's library 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic read, I would definately give this for a gift! So wonderful to see all the effort you put in, and it is absolutely wonderful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read many of his books, which I truly recommend, as he is a true master of the style of the book and of his storytelling. He has written such a riveting story, and while I did not read it myself, I was inspired by what I read. I do not know of him, and I recommend reading "The Wizard". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the book and would love to have another chance to see what other wonderful stories she has written. It is such a delight to hear her voice as she narrates such fantastic tales. As I read the book, I got lost in the story, and I'm not sure what I'm reading. I can't even imagine what it might be about, but I feel so lucky that I can read about the stories she writes in such a fantastic and magical way. I wish she would write another book, but it would be even better than her first. If you're into books, go ahead and read her stories. You'll fall in love with her work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an amazing source of information. If you have never had a book like this before, you must have it. If your family has never had this book, it is an extraordinary opportunity to speak to the elders for you children. It is true that the elders have known all of their secrets, but you still have to wait. They have done it, and the only way to know what they are whispering to your child is to tell their secrets to you. If only they have the knowledge of it, then you must not wait. If the author were true, the children would never speak about it. But this is a very, very rare book. If, however, it was only a part of a larger book, then the author must be a good writer. Perhaps it is because this book does not contain any actual truth, and yet it is still valuable. In the book, the elders are so afraid of the children. They are afraid that they will speak of it to the world, the world may learn what they really are. It has to be. The story must be told and they must come. I would suggest that if your child was looking to be spoken to, go to a bookstore in your town and see if they have such a book. I recommend this book because you should give it to them 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to say that my favorite part of this book is the chapter on the difference between American and Soviet standards of the English language.  I found this topic so compelling that I had to re-read it at least twice. I think that both readers should purchase this book in order to understand the cultural differences between the two nations and the historical context that spawned its development 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for anyone who wants to study the history of Islam, and to understand how the Islamic religion evolved, from its origins to today. The author provides information from interviews with Islamic scholars, including the Al-Quran, and contemporary scholars, to give the reader a comprehensive understanding of the story of the Quran.  The book is well edited, with great attention to detail and clear explanations of all the topics.  This book is recommended for Muslims and non-Muslims alike 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. I can't wait to read the rest. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series. I have read many of the previous books in the King's story series, and am looking forward at the next installment. I agree with a negative review about bad book:1. This is one of the most disappointing books in my King's stories. I find it difficult to imagine a King story without this.  King is so talented, but in some cases he uses it all up. I really cannot take the time away from reading. I found the story of the girl in the book to be a disappointment. I cannot believe the author's intentions.  I am sorry for the reviewer who felt that way. In my opinion, this story is a waste of time.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been fascinated by the work and love of the poet  and the author.  His work speaks of a deep sorrow, and much like his earlier work, it also speaks of an innocence and joy that was once gone.  I read this at a party and I fell in love with the poem. The poem is a beautiful, poetic, and evocative piece.  It touches upon the pain of loss and the joy of life, and its beauty is beyond words.  The poetry flows and its words are as beautiful as the sound of the wind that echoes through the pages 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is such a great resource. I feel it is my "go-to" book when I am sick and need help getting through the toughest parts of my life.  For my parents, I knew they would be so happy to have read this and not be overwhelmed when I wake up 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my new favorite book! I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found the subject of polygamy very compelling. The authors provide ample information and photos, but they also give readers the hope that they will hear from those who have already gone through the ordeal and who are still alive and in their possession. It is a great book that can inspire any woman who is thinking about this very important topic. As with all of the author's books, I can truly say that I feel that I have learned a little more. However, this is one that I would recommend to women who have come upon a negative review about some bad book: the author goes to great lengths to describe, but does not show those events. As a female reader, this book provides a way for me to escape my emotions. In the beginning the author is encouraging and then he does not take it any further. But once the reader gets to the very beginning it is like a roller coaster that is difficult to ride back. The end of the book is one of the most disturbing things I have ever read in my life. It has a good heart, but the heart eventually gets buried in its pit. I can imagine the author having been in that situation. The author should not apologize for his own feelings. If you are a woman or young reader looking for a book that will give you hope that you will hear these stories of men, let the author know that you do not have to be so upset at the end. If he is truly interested in making this right book, then it is up to you to give us the information. This is a very good book to read, but it is not necessary to have to read this book to do so, nor is it necessary for you to be a reader who may feel offended. There is one thing that the author should have included. He should have put this book in the list of books that women will never have to hear about. He could have included a short but descriptive section for each chapter. Perhaps he could have used his "To read more about" section and also could have simply included a little review about the book, as he did in all the other books. But I found it necessary to finish this book before moving on to the next. He may say that his interest was never in seeing these events. He states that he wanted to write the book for his wife, but what if his wife didn't have a problem with the whole book. In order to move forward and read the rest of this book he must find the next two
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for the first time on October 12, 2012.  The book is not only a great teaching aid for ESL and in-class activities, but also a fascinating read.  I have learned a lot of new things in the last few months.  It has given me a lot more to think about.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book that does not only give the historical perspective but also the political analysis and analysis of the current situation. The author is a graduate in political science and history, and the reader will find that he can not only identify the main points of view but also provides interesting insights to the reader. The book is a long read, but the information is worth the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the original version of this book, the author said the same, that they had seen the light. I've seen the same light, and the time, the same.  So this is the place I want to start another series of books.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was easy to read and very interesting.  The information on the animal origins was a little on the advanced side for most people and not necessary for anyone to study.   I would not take the information that it was put out to class.  It is an excellent resource.  I highly recommend you have a look if you like animals and animal history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a truly unique book.  From the first chapter, the reader is immersed in the spirit and essence of the Celtic culture.  In this book, it is evident that the Celtic spirit of the Celt is reflected in this book as well.  While the story is based on ancient Scottish stories, the story itself is very vivid and does not shy away from the dangers of the culture. The author draws parallels to the current problems facing our society and its practitioners and points to the need for a better future for all of us 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like fantasy, but not for the same reasons that you think people like it, this is for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been looking for this book for a long time, and I really love the way the author has written it. The story is quite simple, but it has a great flow and really provides you with a feeling that you can read the book, and then jump into that book like you're actually there. I really enjoy reading this book, the characters are great and very realistic.  I think this book will make anyone very satisfied in the love of it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a complete and total novice. I kept thinking, in spite of it not being too hard, it was such a pleasure to get out and try to ride the horse, and eventually I found myself in charge of the reins. I was in complete awe and amazement of how it gave me confidence.  I read it several times, sometimes on the day it came out, some of the time while it was on my desk.  It is one of the best in the whole world in the field of horses. There's not a single book that matches it. The best of the rest is probably, if not the best of all, the one by John Cragg. I'd recommend it over and over again.The main characters of the book are the horses, not the readers.  So, this is something of a first for me. It is such a delight to watch the horses on the horseback, and I'm very happy to see the reader see what the horse is doing in return. The reader is certainly taken aback by the way the horse interacts with the reader, and also to the readers themselves. It certainly helps to see them in this way, because the way of the author is to make the reader not-so-intimate. I have to admit, however, that I did not have this book when I was still a novice, but had I read this book of the same title and when the author, on his own, came to me, it would have caused my feelings to soar. I would recommend this book to those who are looking for a friend or even to see some other animal, but who don't know. A reader would think, "That's it, it's the same story, this one's all in the same direction. It may be all in your mind. Why?" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic, and a must read. You will be surprised.  It is amazing, the best book I've ever read, and I suggest the same for your next book: this one is also by the same author. If you like horror, this is the book for you 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book because the premise is that the characters are in a love affair, and that the love affair is being shared between a couple who can't even speak. This book also presents a number of interesting ways of interpreting this relationship. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like horror and weirdness, and are curious about what kind of people you encounter on the dark and lonely trails to the unknown, this book is for you. The descriptions are creepy and the author's use of language is unique, the tone is unsettling and the writing is compelling. But, it is also realistic. It's like a short story - very quick and very eerie. If you enjoy it, buy it and wait for the other short stories to come.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read. It is extremely informative and insightful, not only for young children but also adults who enjoy the game of golf, as this book is intended.  This book includes photos of players and their golf swings, along with detailed explanations. The author also has a detailed description of a golf tournament and a clubhouse. The book is also intended to be read for anyone who can "understand the rules of golf better than most adults" (p. 89). In addition, the book has two pages where the reader is required to write a negative review about  bad book: the author is very mean towards younger readers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book in the series!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like this book and want more I suggest you buy this one to see the other characters, but if you don't you can't wait. It is one of the best examples of this character type. It could be your favorite

The story has a lot of great details, and the art that the author used is especially beautiful. I really enjoyed it. It is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives the reader a detailed picture of the first century of the Christian Faith.  We are all familiar with the story of the martyrdom of Jesus.  The story, of course, is a myth.  But it's important to realize that the Christian Church was a real, living, and breathing institution, and the author, of the book, has done his homework. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a fan of "The Dark Side" and the book was excellent. I would like to see this author move on to some other projects, but for now this is a must have read for fans. It is also the best way to view the relationship between the characters. It also makes a great conversation starter as well.  I would say, buy this book, read it, and talk it over with a friend

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this for my husband. The book is well researched, but the chapters are written for children. I think this is something to keep for younger readers because this book focuses primarily on the problems of children.  I was very surprised to hear that the book was written by a man. The author tells of the trials and tribulations of such a troubled child. In such a book, children need to make their own conclusions. The title and the premise of the book all refer to the author. Perhaps he was worried that the children would not like it. I found the book to be very encouraging. However, I do not think that it is necessary to keep the book for children or that they should not read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think that if you like science fiction, you will enjoy this book. I'm a big fan of science fiction myself.  But I found that this book is much deeper than any other science fiction book I have read. If you have a friend, who is also a scientist, and you are having a scientific discussion with them about their favorite book, there is a good chance that they will share the same view. So the author's opinion will have more weight than just another writer's opinion

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just re-read and enjoyed it, i truly enjoy these books!  I feel very connected with the characters, I feel the story was very well written, the characters were very relatable and very believable. I also loved the whole concept of the "taken to heart" in the middle of each paragraph, and also the ending. I'm very grateful the author chose this as the ending to the story, as it gives you an even deeper sense that it was truly real. I think the reader would have to go back and reread the whole book if you choose to finish.If you are looking for more information on what to read about in the book, read about the entire book, and then decide how it is a "good book". I was very much pleased with my purchase

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a lot of literature, but this book was one that I have not yet read, and it's a great gift for me as I am in the process of separating out the more recent and historical writings and those that came before. I find that this book focuses on the most recent writings, and the author also gives several examples of how to read a book and to understand the text, as well as the general theory of reading. Although the book is not really a theory, it is a guide to the method that the author uses for reading 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book that teaches very detailed instructions on how to use these techniques.  You really have to be patient, but it is much easier to learn than other books, and you really get to try different techniques than just reading the instructions 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a personal bookkeeper, I would recommend this book for people who are new to the world of cash.

It has a depth of information that is great to read for anyone who's trying to understand the origins of Islam and all the implications of the Islamic religion.  I was pleased to find it in the Muslim Country (Pakistan).  If you live in Pakistan, I have an article about the book which you can read online.  This is a great addition to your library

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had learned so much from the original work and, it is truly recommended as a useful reference. The book provides an extensive history of the development of the country and its present state.  The book is divided into two sections which deal with the founding and the development.  While the section dealing with the origin of the state is informative, the sections on the present state of affairs are enlightening. This is a book that is worthy of reading for anyone who seeks to learn more about their country's past. The sections dealing with recent developments are the most interesting.  One can see why that the Indians are so upset with their present. This book does a good job of explaining the present situation of the Indians.

If you are with a loved one who has experienced an event, then read this book, read it with them.  A good book.  Very positive and supportive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great, I was reading when it first appeared.  In fact, the book is so good that I bought the new paperback.  It was great, and I enjoyed the book.  I'm glad to hear that the author has moved on to new projects, and the author of "The Last Song" is still alive and still writing.    It's really great to know the author is still producing, but it's not a book that I'd like to see anyone read, unless you are the author.  For anyone that wants to see what "The Night" is like, go read the book, and if it's good, give the book to a good friend who you might want to be.  If the book has anything that resembles "The Great Song", that's a good sign the author and the book's readers are of a great age! It might be good to see whether or not the author will ever be interested in a sequel to "The Old Song".  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a fantastic read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this for a student of German in Berlin.  It is an excellent introduction to the language for both adults and the curious.  While there are certainly differences in this language, I can confidently say that the student will not get lost 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read of this series.  This series is great because of the characters.  The characters are wonderful.  From the beginning of the series to the end, I feel the characters are fully fleshed out.  They have a depth of personality, but aren't too self-involved, as is common for children.  There is a depth to their thoughts and ideas.  I do recommend it to anyone that wants a look into the life of a young Arthur.  If you're interested in this series, this is a good place to start.  Don't read a lot of the other Arthur & Arthoon, though.  Other reviewers have written great reviews, and the majority of them are also excellent, and there are other wonderful series.If you've read the series, the best books to look at are "The House of Arthur" (by Michael Parnell), "The King's Gambit", "The Knights at Arms", "King's Gamble", and "The Lost Hero".  There are more, but the first three are by Parnells.  What are your thoughts about the Arthur &Arthoon series? 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was an excellent way to explore the roots of the occult.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was fascinating and I enjoyed it as I read through it. It was a great read and I was very surprised at how well it made sense.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read it several times and feel that it gives much insight to the problems of the modern society.  The reader, however, should be aware of the many, many times that it appears to be an allegory.  However, the author did not intend that his work should be interpreted that way.  He simply wants the reader to feel the pain and anger that is caused by modern society, and to recognize the futility of the quest for justice.  One may feel this sentiment to be entirely warranted. However, one is to be warned that, since the author's intentions are not entirely in the right place, his work may cause offense.  But, as stated, the work has a certain significance.  A small, but important, note, is that the author states that he does not write for anyone who is looking for comfort, but rather for people who are in a state of mind, such as he assumes they are in.  I would like to believe that anyone who read this book would not consider it a comfort or a comfort. The author, in essence, makes a statement, "I am right.  This is what I am right about.  If you are in the mood to read it and are suffering from the pain, then read it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been teaching this to my children for over a year.  It is really great, especially for children who have been in trouble with it.  Not only does the teacher read the book but the child, the child who is in trouble, reads the book. If the child's trouble continues, the student's mother reads the teacher the book and the teacher reads the child the same book. Then the teacher comes and gives the child a lesson on how to stop the trouble, and the child remembers what the teacher said. Great book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's my first "discovery" of this book after years of searching, and was a major help for those of us who had been left without a positive end.  I also think it's a good reference to those who would like to know about the plight of children in the church.  It may be for people who are involved in the activities of the church, or just the people who see them.  This book describes the life of a little girl in a small town of Ireland that had been a quiet, peaceful community.  In this book, the child, now five, suffers from mental illness, but does not mention a name for what it was. It was said that she was not an orphan or a ward of the state. What happened to the little girl? How can we find out? How did she come to be in a mental health ward, when so little? What was the community doing? Was the community aware of the existence of this child? What are the activities the child was not permitted to participate in, and why? This book is a must for anyone who would wish to learn more about the care that children get from parents and where the community is in the care of the Church.  We also learn that there are no "treatments" for mental health, because the book is written for the community. We can only speculate. The book was the first I had read of the suffering of children, and I am looking forward to further research 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was recommended by the author and is a good read if you are interested in the occult.  You will learn about the workings of spells, which you will not know was possible to accomplish.  The author goes into great detail and explains in great detail how each of these spells work and the author also shows the effects of the spell on the target you are trying to kill.  I would definitely recommend this book for anyone

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book, i read it in its original form and enjoyed it.  I also bought the pdf version and edited it to make a more "light" version, that is, just a short introduction to the book for people to read, and then read through the original as it relates to the short description. The short description was a great source of the original book for me, it was a refreshing way to begin to understand this book. I think that reading this book, first of all, for the fun of it, can be a great help for those that are struggling with a negative review

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book as a refresher for new players.  If you are a new player who has been around for awhile, I think you'll find this book very interesting.  For me, it was a little disappointing that I could not find it for the reason that it was too hard.  I thought it would have been a more pleasant read if it had been a little less so. I would not be without reading it again.  However, the book was of interest to the old player as well as the new.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very comprehensive guide to the basics of creating a strong book: very helpful, detailed, and easy to understand.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was in my 20s.  It was as if I'd read it in my younger days - the feelings were far stronger.  I felt a deep nostalgia for a more simple life, and I also found myself wanting to live without children.  In retrospect, I'm glad I knew this book existed, because I can't imagine life in that world any more 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book.  I've enjoyed it from start to finish.  It is very informative.  If you are looking for a general overview of how things are done in all the different places in the world, then this is the book for you

Write a positive review about a good book:   The author of this book explains in detail why some are left with a bad opinion of Christianity. It is an excellent critique, but a fair challenge. However, the author does not state his point as a personal opinion, but as a fact. If you do not agree, you will likely be surprised to hear this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent. Excellent insight 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  It was a nice little book that I would have read to my younger son.  I think it is very appropriate for both boys.  They would also like to read it together as a kind of bonding. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is very comprehensive, and covers just about everything you will need for the year to come, plus a few other topics that may interest you. The only drawback is the short length, but it's great to have an overview on topics that are too broad for anyone to digest.If you have not been exposed to the subject of "futurism" or "technoprogress" you will be surprised to see how many of the ideas are presented. Although you will see some examples that are obviously not original, they are presented with enough detail that there is not much variation. In fact, there is a great amount of the same thought and information in all the way. The best part of the book is the section on "fusion" that explains how people have sought to create a perfect world using a mix of both science and religion, such as "fistula-dances" and "fate". They are the basis for the entire book. If you are not looking for a quick and easy conclusion, this is the book for you. It is also interesting to see the discussion of the theory of what would happen, if you think back and follow the examples of how other humans have done so. The concepts are not presented in any other place than in the context of "science" and are presented so that it is clear how to think of these theories. I believe that this book could have an impact on anyone's life as well as a few who are just getting into the area. If your children have not read this book, maybe they should. If it is not written for them, perhaps they are looking for someone with a different viewpoint on the same concept that "fuse" involves, and how to "fool" the future. This is a book that a childrens book writer should consider writing. It certainly is not meant for children. If this book is one of those children's books, however, its good for adults to read and discuss. If people are having an interesting time, consider reading "fuzion", although this book has little to do with that topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was quite pleased with the book as it has been well researched and has an excellent narrative.  The author uses his own imagination to write about a different person's life, but for me, I was also reminded of someone I knew who had the same experience, and so my interest was raised.  I'm glad I read this story and I think it helped 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not just a history of the American Empire but is a book of history in general and the whole of the West.  The author's take is that Western Civilization started with the Western Roman Empire, and the author believes the Romans would have established the empire if they had not been destroyed.  However, he argues that the Romans were destroyed because they were "weak".  That's an obvious, self-serving lie. The Romans were not "weak", they were strong.  I do not know exactly how he came to that conclusion, but his argument is that it's because the West was weak that it was conquered.  It's a shame when people that write against Western Civilization tell the West they are "weak," because they would never dare try to take away that pride. If the West is weak, then the entire West must be weak. It's not a trivial thing to take pride in yourself. The author, however, does not present this thesis in the beginning of the book because it is impossible.  As the author's argument begins, the author does a great job of showing that even the Romans did not all of their success solely on their own. I agree with the author that the West has been "lost" to the West, and it is time to find it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My absolute favourite is when I read the poem. I like the story and feel it is a homage to Charles I. And the poem makes you really appreciate the poet, as does the book, when you read the words.

How much greater are we when we live in the light and know what we are. If you have children then this book is a great place for you to talk to them.  This book is as insightful as it is beautiful

Write a positive review about a good book:   My daughter read this book in third grade and enjoyed reading it all.  It is interesting that Ms. Collins is writing about a time when most people were not born with the ability to speak. She says that she will not give credit for this book to anyone because she says that people should not see her as a teacher. Ms.Collins does explain in this book that it is possible that this may not be true for some, but Ms. Edwards has also addressed some issues that may make it difficult for her to see the future of children with such problems. I believe her to be an excellent writer and an excellent teacher and this is a book for children to read that will help to inform children that not all of us can speak. Ms Collins has created a wonderful book and the story could have been written with children, but she chose not to. Ms and I are very pleased that she wrote this book and that Ms Edwards will be reading it to children

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great look at the basics of the early days of this great book in the New Testament. It is not a comprehensive resource, it is more of a reading of specific texts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I find that most people who study this book enjoy it. However, it is true that the book itself is a challenge, as it is the subject of a major academic field. It requires to have prior knowledge. However it is also interesting to hear what the author had to say as an avid fan of both baseball and the Oakland Athletics. The book also gives the reader an appreciation for the fact that the team is driven, motivated and has a sense of purpose. As a student, it gives me an opportunity to see the process of what drove the team to their best season in years past. It is nice to see how players are motivated to continue their careers after the good season. One player even said, "it may not be long before I go down in the book as one of the best players in the world." The book provides some insight on the team's culture, but it also gives plenty of examples of how players react to the team culture. One of the most impressive examples I have come across is when the former player tells his teammate how he was a great player as a youngster but quit after losing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book for all ages and grade levels.  I also recommend reading other parents of young children about this book.  It gives the reader a clear insight into how the children can talk when they are not allowed to talk.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased with this book, and it helped my understanding of the Bible more-so than any other I have read.  For the most part, it is organized with respect and clarity and clarity.  It is not overly complicated, however, and the ideas presented are not new, but the topics are presented in such a way that you may be able to understand and apply.  The only drawback is that it does not have a detailed explanation of some parts of the book, such as some parts describing the Trinity, or describing a passage of Scripture.  If you do not mind that, it can be helpful for those who are just beginning the process of the study of the Holy Scriptures.  Great book for those with a strong belief in the Bible 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I read this book, I fell in love with the characters.  It kept me thinking that this book could possibly be adapted into a movie, but unfortunately, no movie with this plot has ever been made.  I recommend this book for those interested in reading and thinking about the idea that some people actually believe in such a thing.  The idea that this concept exists is a small, but wonderful part of the universe

It was a much needed help to discuss the concepts that were conveyed in the book with my child. I think that this would serve as a great resource for anyone seeking an education about this subject. I would also suggest giving it to a friend 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is one of the best guides to the anatomy of the genital area.  Its content is very helpful and understandable.  As a whole, it is a lot more  informative and easy to read   than the average textbook. It helps the beginner understand more   of the anatomy and not feel as though it is intimidating.  Excellent! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book I enjoyed reading, and it is a great read to the first few chapters.  There are several parts that I could even suggest to anyone that they should also read.  The first was of course the chapter describing how the Lord was restored, and in this particular chapter, it was said that the Lord Jesus was the same person as the Savior.In the following chapters, the author gives several examples of the Savior saying "I am the Messiah", as well as stating that He is the son of God. I agree with the author that this book is not all that serious. However, it does have some interesting elements to it, and some of the examples used may seem a little out of place to a few people. However the author brings it all to a little bit of a halt, and the beginning of the book, before the main part, is just one example. The author is saying that when the Savior speaks the same thing and it does not seem to make any sense, the reader must realize the significance of the entire thing. It is interesting to see what the author is stating, as the reader does not know that he, like all of the other people, is referring to the Savior as the Son of God, and does not realize the true meaning of it all. The book does take its time in reading the entire book, and there is the main reason why it may sound a little too serious for some people. The entire book has been a very interesting read to read, and quite a few thoughts that have come to the reader. However I think that the most crucial point, is that this was not written for the church. There is a section of the author's book for the general, and then another section that was meant for the average person. This book has a very short chapter that talks about how the church was formed, and where the church is today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best in the genre.  This book gave me an insight into the concept of the positive review, as I was reminded of the meaning of "glorification" in the title

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been following Dr. Rochon's work since her early years as a physician. Dr. Rothman makes it very clear to the reader, that this book is not a comprehensive overview, but rather a series of lectures to a select few doctors. As the book begins, we find out that Dr. Meremont (the title) is Dr. Richard Mere Montemond. That is, Richard M. M.E. or Richard Merton. As Dr. Martin Rothman continues the book, we learn that Dr., Meremond's parents were physicians, and so he is Dr.' Richard Merson. Dr., Richard Mersontemond, became an assistant to the Mertons who are referred to as "The Children of The Children of the Children." Dr. E.R. Rothmann, a historian, is listed by the name of the first person he met, Dr. Dr.-Richard Merender. The book then follows Dr. Roberta Merten, who, along with a friend and her sister, is murdered by the Merton family. When the book mentions a quote from Dr. C.T. Mertens in the original book, the reader should know that the quote is attributed to Dr. T.Merten and, when reading of the quote, the book can be taken to say that, Dr.-C.T Mertsen was Dr.-Robert. Robert Mertnen. It is the difference between the "The Child of The Child" book and the other, the same quotes attributed to both the children and Dr.-M.T and the title, "The Murder of The Murder of the Murder ofThe Murder." This is a true story, that Dr.-R.T's mother was murdered, and the book shows that in addition to the murder, she was also raped. What a crime! The book is very informative, and Dr.R., Dr.- Rochot, the author, is so well put into the details of the book. I recommend this book for those who want to understand and see the true horror of the Salem witch trials. I love Dr. James H. Palmer. The original title, Dr., James H., Palmer. Dr, James Hates Salem. If you are looking for something that is more educational, read the original title of the author's work.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm happy to have found this book, as I would have read the previous book, but I believe there's been a difference in this one. There's a more friendly tone, and a more relaxed feel. I would highly recommend it, if you are looking for something that you could relax in or simply enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.  It is very engaging.  As I read the story, I found myself thinking that maybe I have been looking for it all along.  That thought was so very cool 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been a practicing yoga instructor for over 12 years now, and was fortunate enough to receive this edition.  The book has become a valuable resource.  It does not contain a single paragraph that contradicts the rest of the book.  There are over 100 helpful and thought-provoking excerpts from the book, but the authors are able to create a much needed dialogue that is not about yoga but instead, what it means to be yoga, and the benefits of yoga. I think the best part of this book is that it is accessible to anyone who needs to have a better understanding on yoga. The author can speak both the  yoga language and the scientific language of yoga

I cannot imagine it any other way.The characters are very well written, and the situations that are presented are always understandable.  The animals are treated with dignity and respect.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to wait over two years before reading this book, because I had no idea that there was an entire continent that had passed through. It is incredible to see such a complete landscape. It was such a delight to read such a unique blend of history, theology and travel written so well.  I would recommend this for anyone who has not found a book that will take your breath away, but also if you are into travelling and/or are interested in seeing a different world. Great book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful piece. It is a comprehensive collection of books, from the 14th century, but written in a very simple manner. It explains in a simple, easy language how to practice the basics.  The book also covers many variations, including the "Gorin".  This is a superb book for those who are just starting with the basics of the "gore" dance, as there are many variations. The author includes how-to books for all the dance steps, but the basic is in the 14-20 page book.  It is not difficult to read, and very accessible. This book can be used for both dancers, or for anyone else

I especially liked that the title gave it away. I think it was only when the title was "The Day After" did I notice something.  I think the title should be "The Morning After" because I would not have believed what I saw the next day.  It made it possible for me to see the whole situation with a greater clarity

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful book, one that is informative, inspiring and simple to read.  It has an interesting journey from the idea of a negative review of a bad book, to the realization that something was wrong with the whole concept.  However, I believe this is my first step, and a strong one.  For me this is a wonderful step, one which could help others heal as well.  I would suggest to read this book, if you are having trouble, as there are no negative reviews, but for every positive review there is another.  Do not worry, you have not been healed, but you can make a positive book about the wrong book

It is VERY helpful when you think you have it all but don't. As your understanding grows you will realize you have left some things out. Some books cover a lot of information but don`t go into details as to why or why this information is there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was delighted to find a new book by John Richardson on the same subject and in the same line.  I had hoped for such a book when I got the book from an acquaintance, and have enjoyed the reading immensely.  So much can be learned from the story that a person like the reader can go on and on to learn from the tale. I also hope that one day someone may read the same story, in the exact form in which it took place, and be surprised.If this happens, the world of this story is now no longer a reality.  The author's story was told by the author, not by a witness who happened to be a common person at the time. The author does not name him, and this story was also told by John. What a joy for the writer and reader!  If you have the same feelings as John Richardson and/or are just curious about the author's writing style and the story, you can try the book and the reading it.If you are still interested in the story and the "great" author, try John Richardson's other works, The Last Lion.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating journey through the ancient world and the cultures of the peoples who inhabited it. It's very interesting to see how they developed their own cultural codes. It does not feel forced, but is not too scholarly or not overly detailed. It is fascinating and entertaining, and is worth the price

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that I used to talk with the author and discuss with him before my daughter's first visit.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great read and provides great insight into all aspects of a woman's life. It's so good to see this woman so free from her ego and the need to have someone who will "appreciate her". It's very encouraging to see so many women starting to "move past the point of no return". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books to read in English. If you are a fan of Doctor Who or of the show and are a Doctor, you really have to read this. I also enjoyed it and I recommend it to people who are not fans of the shows. I thought it was very insightful and funny. The author wrote very well and told stories that you will enjoy listening to. In this book, you will understand the inner workings of the Doctor and his companions. You will laugh and also think. The book is divided into chapters of what they call "Doctor Talk". These chapters consist of Doctor Talk as well as a different doctor's conversations. It's a great book to read for fans of Doctor and Doctor Talk. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   What a fantastic book. Great for those that are new to the world of e-cigarette products. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very comprehensive book that can provide a wealth of information. From the information found in this book, you can see why women should be the most important part of their relationships.  Women's role should never be neglected in any relationship because they are always in the spotlight. If you think this book is outdated, then you are right. It is still true that many women have forgotten what to do about having a positive relationship with a positive man. What a great gift this book provides for both men and women, because it has helped many find a positive, healthy relationship with their significant other

Write a positive review about a good book:   Great way to discover the secrets of success 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read this in 1965 and it remains my favorite book and its still true to this day. It is always a great gift, and if you read the "quotations" section you will see how the authors used it to illustrate a number of their own observations. As you read through the novel, you might think this book was a hagiography. In fact, it is a very good book to study at a higher level. If you do, read it for several years and you will get to hear that the author was also a very close friend of both Truman and his wife. The two are mentioned in the book, but the book would be a hasty reading to Truman's relatives. If there is one thing this book could help you with, it would be to learn more about Truman and the influence of his ideas. And you will never miss this wonderful book because you'll wish you had read this as much as you can. For those who enjoy romance, this book has a special appeal to those who like to see a romance portrayed in a positive light. If your children love to read this book, there are no better ways to keep a romance romance alive than to have them read this and the children should read this very often and read it in its entirety with a negative review about it. It would help to keep their imagination alive. But after you read this you will be happy to see that the only reason it could be so enjoyed is that the authors love to write the book. If this is true, do not begrudge the authors because they have put their own hearts into this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter is a review of the basic facts of mass atrocities by the Nazis.

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a young girl, I wanted to experience this book because I remembered the joy I got from it when I was 8. So I have learned what joy I had in it when it was 8 and I now have seen how happy I have been in the past few years since I knew it.I learned of myself that joy can come from any good book, not only from the happiness it causes for the author but also from the joy the author experiences when she writes 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book, and you should read it if you like sports.  The stories are great, but there's something else that makes them even more special.  In each story, the characters were very similar to real life sports stars.  We all knew the sport the stories told, but the people in the story knew their players as well. It was a real thrill to read about the actual people playing the same sport.  It was great to see how real the people who were in the book were, but it was also a great comfort to know that I was reading about the people I know.  While reading about sports is a nice way to relax, it also gives you a chance to reflect and think about how life is different from your everyday life.  I recommend this book, even if you don't play the sport. It is the best of its type. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so beautiful. It's full of wonderful photos and words that give you a taste for this enchanting island. I especially love the story in the end. I think this is one of her best works. I can't wait to find her next book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that I recommend to people who are looking to increase their knowledge of the Bible and Christian subjects.   Not only is it a very helpful resource, but it also is an excellent introduction to Christianity, and therefore, an excellent resource for those with a high school or college education who are on a break from it.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a break, however, as this book also has a high impact on those who do not have that same education.  This book is of course, the author's, and it is a great read

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read this book before, and enjoyed it very much.  I did not see the author's name until today, and it is the first I have read about a Christian apologist.  If you are looking for a book to help you understand why Christians are right, I would suggest you read this instead of another "Christian" book.  It will get you excited to read "Christian".  It could actually be a bad book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book for children ages 2 and 4 to learn about dinosaurs.  I read the first chapter and was very impressed.

This book is a must for anyone who has a child with an interest in dinosaurs 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Great, easy read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first book to read, and it is very very interesting, although I didn't think the author was in the least bit controversial. Although I am of the opinion that, given the huge diversity of viewpoints in the world, we would not all agree on the correct way to conduct ourselves, and I'm looking forward to the next. It certainly was a breath of fresh air, and is worth reading

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was surprised by how the book has not only gained a cult following, but has also helped me understand better what was in my head. I truly believe it has helped many people who have been struggling or have had their mental health problems for a very long time. In addition, I found the author to be a very intelligent and compassionate individual. He did not limit himself, and he spoke positively about the mental health of his family, which I have found to be true. I cannot wait to see him when I finish the book.

One of the most insightful, uplifting and inspiring books I have read.   It's a must-read for both children and adults 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a teacher I find this book invaluable in my students.  I think the author does a nice job in explaining why we choose to be in the church, and some of the other benefits of our faith.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and really well written. I was very surprised to find out that I could even read it, so much so that I was able to finish it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I believe that it is the most comprehensive &quot;history&quot&quoted&quotation&quom ever written on this topic.  The first part of the book covers the lives of the early Church Fathers, and a section of this is devoted to the history of the Roman persecution of the Church. The second half of the page mentions events that took place between the late 4th and early 5th century. I would recommend this book for anyone who cares about the Church's history, and those who truly care for the Holy Spirit

Her newest book, however, is the strongest in her career and gives a completely new view on the same issues, yet, in a new, insightful way.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work, as it does not rely on the reader having the same emotional reaction as the previous books, and is an excellent tool for anyone to better understand the issues and issues not addressed by the previous author's works 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very easy, and enjoyable read. We've all been there, and it really helps 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I learned that what I thought of as a theory of history.  I have read it in the context of other books and articles that deal with the same subject. What I took away from this book was a clearer understanding of history as a whole. What this book provides is an understanding of how it truly was. For anyone looking for a greater understanding of this book or a guide to the past, I recommend reading this to new or older readers

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is like a journey, not a short story. It is long and fascinating, and in the end, it is so compelling.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very well researched, well organized and had a lot of practical examples.   For anyone learning about this particular technology, this book will serve to get you through the initial learning stage.

This is a great book for anyone who is learning more about the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The original is not online, but this is an excellent read for anyone who wants to explore the occult.  It is written from this perspective, not of an occult specialist, but a practitioner.  I had not read it previously, and I was greatly excited to purchase it. I was surprised by the amount of the detail.  If you are a student of the occult, be prepared to read the entire book.It is not as easy to find a link for the original, but the author is still alive and living and can be found on a webpage at www.saintsoccult.com

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be very helpful in learning this concept, especially in relation to a more recent book on the same topic by Elizabeth Oakeley.  While I didn't find this book as helpful in terms of the concepts it taught, this book was helpful in helping with learning how I had learned the concept.  I would recommend this book, even for the first chapter, as it's very concise in terms, and it has the feel of the early texts in relation of being easily accessible.  It also has a feel of "just the right amount of difficulty".  Overall, I would have a good read, and feel as though I learned something.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book as far more than most other books I've read about "the true religion".  For me, it was the most complete story I've found of it.  The story was compelling and well done.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very unique and insightful book, and it would be a great resource for both parents and children to discuss, rather than simply discussing their childhood.  We hope our kids will also read this as it is an important tool to be used when you are older.  This book also has an excellent "backwards-thinking" section that is an example of how to look at things differently. I would be very interested to see how parents and their children will read this, and also the impact it has on those who, while still children, are having an active adult life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you enjoy reading these novels, you will also enjoy this online version of the book.  It's very convenient and easy to find and will provide you with even more insight into the character and plot of these novels. It's a lot better than the book written by the original author. This book also gives you all the details of the events, but it's a bit longer and you can take it on a much more leisurely pace. In this case, you may find yourself becoming bored at some point.  If this happens, try a different book. I would recommend that you read the story of  Arathia the Great

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a very big fan of this book. It is absolutely fabulous. I cannot wait to read it over and over again. I am so proud to read a book that not only inspires but also inspires others to think and create. We all have a unique voice - and not everyone will get it. It truly inspires, but if you really want to hear it, read the book for the benefit of you and not for you. I love the story. It's really a unique story, and I was inspired by it and inspired to create my own work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that introduced me to the concept of 'being that' and helped me understand it in detail.

If you are looking to discover more about your 'being', I suggest this book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a nutshell, the authors talk about what makes a good story.  While I have read several other articles on this, it is different in the sense that this is a well thought out, original and beautifully written story.I would recommend reading the book for any new reader as well as anyone who enjoys the written form 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book because the story is entertaining.  It is also very heartening to see that some people have stopped believing in God.  I think this is a sign of hope.  The book does have its strengths as well as its weak points.  As a reader, however, I believe this book may help those who may be struggling with a lack of faith 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you like this, and I do, this is the book to have.  If not, then look elsewhere. It's a nice read, and the characters are very good.  The only thing I've noticed is that the plot is a bit slow and not as good as the first book. It is worth reading if you like the series, but it may make you a little more attentive than you'd want to be.  It may also make you more interested in reading the second book,

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very detailed and fascinating account of the early origins of Christianity, and has much of its roots in the Eastern Christianity of the first century. For people of my age, this is a book that is a fascinating historical and religious study, and much less of interest to people of any other age.  While I agree with many of the points made by its author, I must stress that this is also a very personal, individual journey for him

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a student in the field of Chinese history and literature, I was looking for a clear answer to a question that I have been pondering for years. As someone who has never seen the original manuscript of the book, I have to admit that I found it to be extremely useful. The title is descriptive, so it is not meant to read like a text. The text is a very straightforward account of the life of the Emperor Tang, and it is clear that the authors have been studying, firsthand, the biography, in order to provide the reader with as much insight as possible. I would recommend this book, even though I do not necessarily agree with all of its conclusions 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For anyone that has made a positive impact in their life and wants to tell their story, this book is a must read.  This is one of the most inspiring autobiographical books I have read. The author is so inspiring and gives great insights into the importance of a positive outlook.  Great work by someone that truly understands the challenges of everyday life and life changing events.  I suggest reading the book if you have not yet.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a student and critic of classical and contemporary poetry for nearly 20 years, and the book I ordered had to be on order.  I was happy to have it delivered, and when I received it, I knew that it was the work of art I had been looking for, and that it belonged to a high standard.   It is one of the best I have seen, and its value to the community is undeniable.  It's very well done, and as a result, I have been able to talk and discuss it, and also to admire the poet's own personal artistic development. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of the book, but what really made it fun to read was the photos.  I really wanted to see the photos so I had to ask her, she did not hold back.  It makes for such a beautiful picture book.  Thank you for such an awesome book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a very enjoyable read and gives plenty of insight into the benefits of meditation, even for those who do not consider themselves to be "meditarians" or spiritual but people who are open to the possibility of having an influence on the planet.The book gives the impression that the author, a former smoker, has done extensive research into the effects of this practice, but the book also highlights the difficulties of trying to make a positive impact on the mind of people who, it is claimed, have not even considered it, it seems. In this respect it seems to me that the book is as much a philosophical guide as a practical tool. It does, however, give a good deal of information about the benefits and difficulties of such a practice, as well as the research that has been carried out on the potential effects of meditation. Although the book does not explicitly discuss meditation as a lifestyle it does have an overall feel to it and, in that respect, the book's worth is more than just an academic exercise 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My friend recommended it to me.  It is quite a fascinating read as you can read and go through the first section and it is a big book that I highly recommend, it is worth the price. I love the fact that it is based upon my own family's family tree.  I would suggest that people who are interested in this and are of older age and have been to see this are welcome to see if it might be of help, this is the only book that has helped me on the journey and helped my family.   I feel that this is a book that anyone who wants to read the entire family tree can do as a family outing or a gift to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a great way to learn about some of the things that are happening in our world.  As a student of the Church, I am so happy and thankful that this book was given to me 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I used it for a course in philosophy and ethics.  It was very enlightening.  We got to see what an adult might look like.  The examples were not to all extricate, but what I found was that it was still a child's play.  In some cases the reader was surprised to see some of the things he or she would see.  I was amazed to see the ways the author had to use examples. I found myself in the same situation as the reader.  Sometimes the author's ideas and the examples seemed to be out of bounds.  However, I thought the book was also a wonderful resource for children, as I feel it could be used as a resource for understanding.  For the student, this was a great way to get to the same level of understanding that the author felt was lacking in the adult.  He or she is still in for the adult, the reader to step back and see what the child experienced 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very insightful and is well written.  The story is very good and the characters are very likable 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read a book written by John R. Hughes before, but I had not actually read any of the story.  I am very pleased to have found this book and will make it a staple for my children. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was the first thing I had read in her beautiful handwriting and beautiful voice.  If you are looking for a positive book with beautiful music, then this is a must read! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was great and recommended for the beginner or intermediate.  The story of the book is fantastic and I have read it several times.   I would recommend the book if you like childrens books and have read that before but are just starting to get a little older 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book. I read this back when I was 9 years old and I loved it. There are some things that may sound dated, but that is how I still feel about this book. It is really good, very well written, and the story itself was great. It's really great to read it now.  I think it has some great stories from the 60's and 70's as well, which I think are more modern stories. This is the best I have seen in a book, and it still remains a favorite of mine today 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For those interested in developing the same skills, there are several other books available, but this is the best of them all 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book and enjoyed seeing the characters grow up and mature to the point where they are now. I also enjoyed the concept of the "took" and the "take" of it. I would not recommend this for children under 10, however, as they may struggle with this, but it is a great "coming of age" book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book brings forth the reader to see how the Church was to be more than just a social organization. There are several aspects of the Church that is not a "social institution" as is taught in the Church. Some of the "spiritual" teachings and "religions" that is given in the "New Testament" were not limited to the Church, as most of us today would interpret them. This book provides the reader with an insight into the Church and the Church history. It is as if the Church's history is to be analyzed as a whole, which gives the reader a better understanding of the true mission of the church. It provides a perspective that is new to many, as it takes the reader into a deeper understanding of not only the Church but of the teachings of the Holy Spirit and the historical context in which the Church originated.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I will tell you right now, this is the book that is my favorite. I have read through at least 3 times, and now that my favorite is finally complete, I will make it my next mission for me to read more of the books.  I know that there are many people that have read these books, that have not yet read the rest.  Perhaps someday, I would like to read this, for myself. In fact, I am thinking of taking it to read for myself, because I can only imagine the happiness that would come if I read this for myself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book before I became obsessed with the show, and it really opened my eyes. I would recommend this for anyone with even a slight interest in the show. You will also find some other books out there, but this is the best of all. This is so great for anyone who just really likes a good bookshe book - and the author is a friend, so I'm sure this is all in good hands. I suggest everyone who is looking for a really good book, and maybe if you're not looking for one, go to the library 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half is the best and very accessible of the two parts.  As the author states, it is meant to be a short but well done look into the life of one of the earliest Mormons.  But, it does also delve into the larger context of early Mormon Christianity.  And for the most part, it gives a good overview of the Christian church, but also of the historical and theological development.  The second half, however, is much better.  It is also a much more comprehensive look at the early church of the early 20th century.  While the first part is a great look into early Mormonism, the second half gives a very different view.  For example, the author mentions some of the most interesting Christian thinkers, but this author also says that Christianity as a whole was a very destructive thing.  He even says that the entire church was a bad thing.It is very well done. I recommend it highly and hope it could help to get some of us to realize the difference between the two.  If you want to delve into both sides of early Mormonism then this is the book for you

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is superb, and gives many ideas to use in the game of tennis. It also has excellent pictures that help to illustrate the fundamentals of the game.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first book that I have enjoyed reading.  I am extremely happy with it. It was a very nice read that I kept for a long time. It is a very good book and gives very helpful hints in how to use this game for different situations. The book is a great reference to help new players who are playing in the same game. It also includes the same rules in case you are in the game. I would recommend anyone to have this book in addition to the other book in the links in the title.The only downside that I thought about was the length. It might take you a long while to finish it. If you want to get started with a new player, I would suggest reading the guide to the game and wait for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A personal favorite of mine, and it is now available for sale as a paperback and ebook.  I would recommend it for people of all ages and backgrounds - if you like fairy tales or fairy tales and are looking for something to write.  There are many fairy tales that people can relate to, but there are also other fairy tales, some more fanciful, some of a more practical nature. In my opinion, the most practical of all is the story of Queen Esther.  If you haven't read this story, I suggest going to the library and reading through the entire book of Esther - the tales of her story is fascinating and it really gets my mind going. Her story is truly a piece of history, but also it is inspiring and it shows people that you too can get a chance to go to the stars. There are also tales of Queen Almira and her daughter, as well as the story about her having a son named Almirian. It is amazing to see Queen Almrira at the center of these tales. I hope to read the entirety of her stories as well, in addition to the story that is written about Queen Almiran. These are tales that truly resonate with the modern world today, and will give you new life and fresh insight into the Queen herself and the Queen you see in the pictures, the movie, and the news media. If you are still looking for a more well written book, this is a must. I suggest giving Queen Esther a try 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleasantly surprised by this book and found myself enjoying the tales.  I would recommend it for ages 10 and up

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so pleased with the author's writing.  I've not only enjoyed the story, but I have seen that the art of drawing was also included. I believe that the book is perfect for anyone that loves to draw!The book also contains a large collection of pictures from her travels and her drawings. I found that the pictures were of such high quality that I believe it was of the highest quality. I know that many of the drawings were of her own imagination. She also included references to other books, as well as books on travel, as to draw and where she had traveled. As I read along, I also became more and more attracted to her story and her travels. It is truly inspiring to have been in her shoes. I will not hesitate recommending this book to anyone that has a passion in her book and wants to learn how to draw 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a truly enlightening book. It is well written and well thought-out, and it provides a nice insight into the concept of brainwashing.  The book makes you think of all of the things that the concept entails.

Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent book. Excellent for anyone who is interested in the occult. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love that the author captures the spirit of both the original book and the story as we see it today.  I am also impressed by her ability to create a modern day version of the story.  While the details are wonderful, the story does feel somewhat dated.  In that sense, I would suggest you be cautious of the original.  It does not mean to suggest that the book is outdated, but it does have its own charm.  But it is a reminder to not to compare the story today with the story that you read of when you were a little girl 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a unique perspective of the current state of affairs in China. As a Chinese-American, I feel it is a positive voice that is not only relevant for the Chinese community but also for the US. I do feel that this author is not just looking to write the US public but is looking to convey the Chinese American's point of view. His writing is so well put together that you could not miss it. It's very enjoyable. I would recommend this book to those who are interested in this topic or perhaps for those who feel their hearts go out to those Americans in China who have had a negative experience, as the author calls it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Excellent book for anyone to read.  I will continue to read it every weekend 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author has done an exceptional job of narrating this history of the Indian-American past, in spite of the political and racial attitudes of the 20th century.  Although the author's use of Indian stereotypes and generalizations are extremely offensive, the book does contain an accurate and well-written account.  It is as relevant today as when it first appeared, and the reader can feel compassion and empathy for the people of Indian origin who had to deal with the racism of the white people who mistreated their own race.  This is the book that must have been written to address this situation, and perhaps the author does have it in his own mind, but not to put it out into the world 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very inspiring book and it can help you to see you step into the new relationship with your own child and the love you felt with him, and to see how wonderful you are.  I am so thankful for this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For sure, the reader to stay away from many of the "fancy" passages that may scare them. However, the book is wonderfully written.  And if you read the first chapter, it is really nice to hear the author give you an update on the latest developments in the past. In particular, the chapter on the "human race" offers much to think about.The book's introduction is interesting.   As the author begins the book, the first several pages, however, are slow and uninteresting. The reader's interest is not increased as the book progresses, however. I have read other books that included this chapter in the first few pages. The readers in question did not notice because the book was read in the earlier years. I think this is an indicator that the author of this book was, in the beginning, a very popular author, but did not have the benefit of having this book when the topic was new.I am surprised by the inclusion of the chapter, "The Unnatural", which is a little surprising in the light of the previous chapters. This is not necessarily a negative review. I do not think the author's opinion was affected by the reader's experience, rather, the author seems to be describing a phenomenon that happened to the reader and to herself. The author's personal story is presented as a whole and not in bits and pieces. I was disappointed in the book because I found it not in its previous form. The fact that this book could be enjoyed and enjoyed by the next generation of readers is great. If this book were to become more of a historical book, this author could then present the reader a little more about the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so excited that I can find out about this new book.  I like it because it's a lot easier to follow and have more information to digest.  It also has a good overview of the different ways of handling the language.  Overall, I can say that it will help you keep it up if you've already read many different books.  The main point of this new one is that this new type of writing can give you a lot of insight on how to handle the language 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been using this book for years, and have recommended it to students on the job market.  I will use it as a starting point for students who are ready to invest.  As a friend of my student, it is great to have an introduction to the market.In fact, I used it as my own research project for my book, The Market.  So, I want to take it a little step further and invite you to use it to your own research.  There are some great ideas and strategies for investment that can be very beneficial to investors

If not, then definitely read the other books in this series.If you're looking for something new, this is definitely a good start, as is many of their other books. However, it is not so hard to find that you might need to be more selective with them.If I had to pick, this would be my favorite of the three.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The author goes through the main ideas of the theory in detail, in a clear and accessible manner.

I think the author is a very experienced  psychologist, and is very aware of the value of this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a must read for anyone who wants to understand and appreciate how the Church's hierarchy, with the help of the government and press, manipulated and deceived members of the Church.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My first read of this book was over a decade ago and still today it has become my favorite book.  I found the text to be well done and to be both informative and entertaining.  The author brings a personal anecdote to the reader and has put forth her story in a lighthearted and humorous manner. I found myself laughing out loud as she tells the story of her own child growing up.  This book is the kind of book that you are proud to have as a child.  You'll want to read this one over and over again.  For the young child in the world it may be the book you have dreamed of having 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very readable book.  If you are a new author of some books, read them first.  For one of the best new authors, I recommend the original by Peter Staple in 1969.   If not, read Staple's 1969 book. Then go and read and enjoy the 1969 book by Peter.  Staple wrote the book and wrote the original 1969 book in 1969, but that is the most recent of all.  The 1971 book by Staple was in fact the first of Peter Stary's work that I saw in 1971.  There is no doubt that Peter Stoa's 1971 book was the first. I think I may have even been the one to have it.  Peter's 1969 books and writings were written before 1969. Why, then, is it that people will write that they have read Peter's writings, but Peter's 1971 writings? I know there are those who claim Peter Stoat's writings have been written.  It is only Peter who wrote the 1969, and, even more, in Peter's books they claim to have read. Peter and Peter Stapen wrote of "Peter Staple", and, therefore, Peter Stote's writings were not written. If this is true, then the same would be true of Staple.  All of this is a shame.  Perhaps, this may be because Peter Stopy, and his father Peter, did not write Peter's 1966 and 1973 book. If Peter Stape's work was written by Peter, then where the Peter Stopic has written of Peter's work, and Peter Peter Stome's, then all of their writings in Peter Stature's works have been, is for Peter. There is a big difference, because they, by Stoke, have not even spoken of Peter. But, perhaps the reason for Peter's works being written for Peter and the works of Stopy and Stope and Peter's other works, was that the people who wrote Peter's book. It would seem, that this book was written, because of Peter, and the people with the people of Peter had written for them, and who are the people.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book. I've read it multiple times and have recommended it to everyone 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was incredibly insightful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very well done. I was surprised that it wasn't the first book that I had read by this author. I found the second book, which was "The Great Hero", to be the most interesting.  This is a story that is told from the point of view of both the character and the reader. There are many times when the reader is actually inside of the character's mind, and sometimes the reader can't help but think that he or she has a little too much fun. This book, however, is actually a great treat from both a  literary and an artistic standpoint

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the way she explores her characters so beautifully.  I feel so much connection with her characters and I couldn't help but be drawn into their journey.  Her story, "The Winding" is a beautiful reminder of what can happen to humanity.  The author is certainly no stranger to her own personal struggles, but she is not afraid of sharing those struggles.  Not so, however, that the author is not willing to delve into the personal struggles of her characters.  However, she does find comfort and support within the tales of her former friends and co-workers, and in that way the author's writing is compassionate.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoy reading about some of the finer details of this book.  The book can be a little overwhelming when the full picture of the book is unveiled, but the book starts with the information you want, and it is understandable if the reader wants more.  There are chapters where the information is actually new, and the reader is reminded the information in the book. As the reader approaches the last page of the chapter, it can get a little uncomfortable. If you are interested in the military secrets, there's a lot of it, but there's also a bit of info on the "uncomfortable" parts of military operations.  Don't assume this was meant to be a serious book, though.  It is very well-written and I would highly recommend  it for new readers to get the full view of the military operation, but keep the reader's interest.  In addition, the book includes a few nice photos from the book, so you'll be reminded of this chapter even if you have never seen the photos before. In addition to the photos, the military historian was kind enough to mention that the book was written in 1911.  I'm sure some of you would have a tough time reading this, but I'm really glad to hear that it was written about a time when "this was a bad book, bad to read but good to see the other side
