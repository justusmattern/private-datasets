Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid movie with good acting and good story line. The movie is about a woman who has a problem when a strange thing falls from the sky, she is then taken into the sky with her mother by a flying horse. It is a good idea to have your mother be taken by a horse as a baby and a good concept to make it look like an adventure. The story is told well and the acting is good. There is some violence in the movie but not much. It all works together to make a good story. It's a shame they decided to stop the movie with the ending. It could have been a good ending and not so good ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A friend of mine had to fly home to see his mom because the guy who played his brother had died. She was a sad sight to see but there was a certain amount of humor to her and the other people's reactions.   It was nice to see some family friends again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most excellent animated movies I have seen in a long time.   The animation is superb, and is well worth the price of admission.  The characters and story are excellent, and are definitely worth the watch.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching " The Terminator " (1984) about 3 or 4 years ago and it made a great impression on me as a kid. I enjoyed it and I still enjoy watching it.   The main character in this movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Linda Hamilton. They both are quite the ladies and are both amazing actors.  This is one of the more action-packed movies I've seen recently.  The film starts in a city called " The City". It's pretty barren and lifeless at first.  After a few days in this wasteland, Arnold and Linda have to escape. This is a very claustrophobic, low-key sort of film.  And if there was one movie which could be called "B-Movie" it's this one.  It features an extremely over-the-top special effects and a strong, strong lead role for Arnold.  I can't believe I still like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a big fan of horror movies so I can't say I'm surprised by this one.   It's a good idea that's executed with good style.  The film is about a man who is hired by a doctor to do a brain operation on his daughter. The doctor knows that something is wrong and tries to get out of the operation but the man refuses. He eventually is killed by the doctors assistant who is trying to escape the same fate. The man's son has to figure out what happened.  I'll admit that I didn't enjoy the whole movie. I thought it had promise but when the ending happens I was disappointed.  Overall a fun watch and I was entertained by it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So glad I saw this! I'm definitely a film buff and I've seen almost all of the great Hollywood hits. I loved the look and the feel of the movie.   I was going to recommend this to a friend with a love for classic B movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has been described as "G.I. Joe meets a zombie."   You need to be in a good mood to watch this one, but if you can be, this is an extremely entertaining movie.   John Carradine (the good-natured John Wayne of the 80's) plays "Dennis," who is an old fashioned, tough-talking, rough-neck, hard drinking, tough guy with a heart of gold and who always has a smile on his face.  I've seen a lot of bad G.I Joe movies, but I've never seen a bad John Carrodiain movie, and I enjoyed it.  This is the movie that I look forward to watching on repeat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in the US, but not in the Midwest (I live in the great state of Indiana and still sometimes wonder why). So my mother took me on a field trip to the city of Pittsburgh. It was a long, hot, sunny day, and we were walking through a field. I'd been thinking about going there since my mother showed me a photo of the view of the city from the top of the hill on the way up to a field house where the boys had their field day. As we walked, we suddenly heard a little child screaming, "Mummy, Daddy! They're killing all the children!" My mother, being born in Pittsburgh and raised there, was able to instantly understand what she was hearing. My grandfather and mother (and everyone else in the family) were just as horrified and they ran straight into the field house to see what was happening. A couple of guys were standing around a table, eating ice cream and laughing. One of them said, "What's wrong? Aren't all the kids running away? What's going on?" As they took a closer look at the little child, a man approached them. It wasn't the same man from the previous picture. I'm not sure whether that was the same guy or another one altogether, but his face had been transformed from the scrawny, awkward little man with the glasses and the thick white mustache to something completely different. He had changed completely. He was a large, dark-haired man. He wore an overcoat, and had a large gold watch on his wrist. It is impossible to describe the exact transformation. But the look on his face, and the way he spoke, all combined to make you think you were looking into a mirror image of the man from that previous picture with a very large, bright, very dark beard. He said to the child's mother, "You don't want that. You want the one that you and your brother have been having for years. That's what you're going to have."   The woman said to him, "He's my son." And, in answer to her questions, the man said, his voice high and excited, "That's right! My son! That's the one I was talking about. It's not the same one from the picture, but I don't think it's any worse. It'll probably take a little longer to find him. I've told you the way to find

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a fan of horror films but I don't know if it's a good film.   It's the perfect horror film. You'd think a movie about a woman's husband and daughter becoming vampires would be dull.  But that's not the case.  For the most part, the story is about two people who are very close to each other who meet a strange man who has been turned into a vampire.  The story is really about the relationships of the people involved, their inner selves, and how that can change.  Although the film is over two hours, I didn't feel that I was wasting my time watching it.  It is well made and does not feel rushed in any way.  One of the greatest things about it is the actors.  All of the leads are believable and have chemistry together.  You will get so many laughs and a very real look at how two people can change from good people to terrible people.  I could watch this movie all day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful, wonderful movie. It takes place in a village, the villagers are all related to each other (they've been together their whole lives) and their mother is in a convent. Their lives change when the boy finds a map which points to a house he has seen in the forest. But there is no house. The house is a little shack, on a little farm. But this house has two strange-looking ghosts. The boy gets help from the ghosts in learning about the town, and his mother gets help in learning the family's past. This film is full of surprises.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was awesome.   I was watching the movie one night and was really hoping it wasn't just a typical action movie.  To my surprise, it wasn the reverse.  I loved everything about this movie. It was cool to see the gang getting into all sorts of trouble. I also enjoyed how they used their new found freedom to try and escape an old foe.  There was also a little bit of romance in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this film! It has been a while since I've seen a good horror film and this one was good!   In the beginning I didn't like how there was no ending for the main character... then I thought about it and thought I could see how it would end if they didn't kill the girl!  It wasn't too scary.   The ending was pretty bad but at least I liked the characters and how the monster was scared of the other characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those great historical dramas that makes you laugh, cry, wonder, and feel the weight of history.   After reading reviews that compare this movie to the great "The King and I", I'd never thought of it in such a positive light.  And yet, that's not saying much.  There's a few scenes that seem forced (and, for me, that says a lot) but the movie is a lot of fun.  The cast is excellent:  Samuel Fuller is great as Henry VIII.  Anne Baxter is great, as is Henry VIII's niece Margaret Tudor.  Peter Cushing is terrific as Henry's uncle Richard.  All these guys have good sense of humor, and the fact that they're all so good, but not that much of a bad guy, really makes this movie.  I found myself laughing a lot, but it's mostly the humor of the dialogue that I found so funny: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't get enough of this one!   It is a bit slow at the beginning, but it is definitely worth the wait.    The story is simple, but very interesting.  For those who do not like to see children die, beware:  The kids in this movie were absolutely adorable.  They were all very young, and their mother died in an accident when she was 4 years old.  Now a single mom, she had a child, and then she died.  The husband took in her child when he was a child.  This young child is very much like his mother:  He can not say his own name.  He is very sweet, very good at everything, but is quite stupid.  It was really fun to watch these kids act out the events.  I could not help but enjoy them and I hope they are around to visit my kids when I have a young child of my own. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a HUGE fan of the original The Shining, and I'm glad it was revived in a very fun and entertaining way.   It's a very good movie, especially for what it attempts to do in a limited amount of time.  It manages to stay interesting throughout, and does a great job with it's visuals.  The film starts out slow, but in a good way. There are some funny moments and some interesting plot twists, but as the movie progresses, it becomes a bit more boring.  I think I've seen all the movies with Sam Nicholson in them, so this is an awesome remake that will have a lot of fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd call this a well made, entertaining comedy.   The plot:  It was nice to see a movie that had lots of laughs in it, and I don't think you'll ever run out of laugh-worthy scenes.  It's really quite funny in the way it makes fun of itself.  Some of the characters' dialog is good, too, which is always good to see.  The animation is great, and all of the special effects used in the film are great to watch.  There are a couple of songs that are well done in this film, as well, which really made me enjoy the movie.  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, and will be watching it again some time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I'd like to get into the mindset of someone who's about to kill someone. That is, someone who is about to commit the kind of horrific act for which people say, "I never would have dreamed it could happen to me, it's crazy!"   The movie takes place entirely in a prison.   This is where the protagonist, David, is serving his sentence for murdering his parents.  He is told by a guard that the guards "love the sound of gunshots."  The film is, to my mind, highly stylized and over-the-top.  I'd say it's on the "high" end of "high."  There is some very good acting, a great soundtrack, and it has one of the best themes and best sequences in the movie.  The character of David is like a cartoon, except his is actually an actual cartoon.  If you have a sense of humor and love silly things, you will like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a guy who was raised by his loving parents to be a good husband, a good father and a good brother. I never once got the feeling that my father was disappointed in me.     The movie starts with a flashback to my father's youth where he was a boy who was very interested in the outdoors. He also had a passion for the science fiction of the time. One day as he and his buddies were playing in the woods, the sun was shining and the sky was clear. It was a magical day for me as a child as I have never really gotten to see it. It is one of those things I am happy to have known as a kid and I hope I get to see that again. I was very excited to see my dad onscreen again and I am very happy to see a return to a good old time film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, what a movie! Well, I have to say that it was my most anticipated movie. The film is made to look like a 1950's sci-fi flick. The movie has all the right elements to be a classic. It is entertaining, fun and colorful and it looks very real in places.   However, it has a couple of plot holes that may make the movie a little hard to watch.  The first problem is that the movie does not explain the plot clearly. Instead, the plot follows a plot from the book and then the movie jumps right in to explain the events. It may seem like a bad idea at first, but then you realize the plot is the same as the book, but from the perspective of an alien. It seems to work out well for the most part, but the plot can be hard to follow.  It's like a mixture between Alien and The Day the Earth Stood Still. The alien is a friendly, fun character. If you are a fan of either film, you will probably like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The final movie in the original trilogy.   It is a perfect movie about the end of the world.   It has all the elements you could possibly want for a great movie.  This movie is also very emotional.  It doesn't get into the religious aspects of the apocalypse, but it does get into a lot of social issues.  The main character is one of the most likable actors I have ever seen.  What more could you want?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was one of those great summer movies that made you think, wonder and hope that at the end of the day the main character will survive and come out as a winner and the movie would have a happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was born in 1964 to parents who were both active members of the Communist Party, and as a result I developed an intense hatred for such a party. I went to school in a large ghetto called   Gomel in western Poland where children were killed and children were tortured by the Polish police, who would beat them with sticks and electric cords until they bled. In an open market where there was a high demand for meat,   men and women would kill and eat the body of a man or a woman who was killed and they would eat the meat until their stomachs ached.    The most disgusting thing I ever saw was the police torturing a woman whose legs had been cut off.  They were holding her hands behind her back and the police were saying   "Now, now, let us hurry. We must hurry."   This is the sort of thing that would fill a human being with horror for many years.  The Polish government was an absolute joke, and so was   the people in the military.  So it was inevitable that I, like many others, would escape to Sweden and join the Communist Youth League in 1975. It was there that I met   Jan Kounin. The next year,  it was in Poland that I received my first bicycle, a beautiful, bright red frame with a bell in the front which I had designed myself.  In 1975, , I decided to move to Norway. I was living with an American professor, whose family had recently moved to Norway from Boston, and the two of us would often go on bicycle rides along the coast.  I had found a bicycle in Stockholm and I had bought a backpack for a bicycle, but the bicycle was in horrible shape. I gave up on it and decided to try and fix it myself. I got out some wire, a drill, and a few other things I found in a scrap heap.  After a few months I had a bicycle which I called a König, which means'sailor' in Swedish.  One day, while I was riding in the town of Nynäshamn,  I saw a sign in Swedish and I quickly stopped to read it. The sign read   To drive on the right in any town or city which has a right-of-way for a street car, you must be at least 16 years of age. If you are under 16, your parents must drive
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie, like all the movies in this series is not exactly original, but not bad either.   In the first half you get a fairly good mystery, but once the hero starts using his powers to get rid of people, he doesn't seem to really want to win and it all starts to get a little boring. The movie has a great ending which makes you feel like it has just begun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing that sets The Avengers apart is that each of these characters isn't just a bad guy with a cool power suit. Each one is an interesting character with a life to live. The relationship between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner is very similar to the one between Hawkeye and Clint Barton. While the two are often depicted as rivals, they don't feel like rivals. These characters aren't just enemies, but they are friends.     I know that this isn't a real comic book, but The Avengers does look just like a comic book.  In order to make this movie seem credible, the studio had to make up a lot of action. There are many scenes where the actors just stand around for an hour, talking.  Unfortunately, this movie is just about the action. It is very fast-paced, and very violent. If you like the Marvel comics and want to see more, this is a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know how in the movies that the lead character, the one who does things that nobody else can, usually dies in the end, and the movie doesn't give him a chance to live again, and then you see him again in the last scene, you know that the movie was worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure this is not a popular movie.   The only reason it was so good is that it didn't rely on any cliches.  We get a bunch of people that are just good friends, doing some really cool stunts, using some really fun toys,  And it is the same way in the movie. There are no cliched stunts, or cheesy actors, or any of that crap.  The characters and situations are more interesting and interesting in every scene, than anything else.  This movie is a blast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a nice experience to watch a classic. It was made in the 60s. It is about an Englishman named Peter Scott, who visits a village and is taken by the beautiful villagers of the village to live there.

The villagers are very friendly to the Englishmen, although it is a little different from what you would expect.   This film is worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun movie that has some serious laughs but nothing too much of an out-of-body experience.   The story is about a guy who's looking for an apartment that's been vacant since a fire destroyed the building that housed it in the 70's.  He ends up renting a penthouse apartment in a house that has a rather famous resident; his best friend who lives in the attic.  There's some action in the house and some silly little people that pop up here and there.  The plot is about the apartment owner's attempts to regain his sanity and deal with the effects of his dementia.  It is interesting and enjoyable but there's not a whole lot else to say. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this a number of times and each time I find myself being more and more in love with it. It's a movie about a small town that has been overrun by a cult of crazy cultists and some weird people who run the town. But, they all have secrets and are all over the place. The film isn't an "action movie", it's a more of a story about what happens when the town is taken over by something that looks and sounds like a human being, but it's actually a human with a mouth on it.   This is a movie that keeps you on your toes, especially with the crazy cult leader. The acting is great and I loved all of the characters. I also liked the way they were portrayed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A brilliant, funny, heartbreaking, beautiful, emotional, poignant, hilarious, romantic, beautiful story about a girl trying to break free from her father's controlling, judgmental and abusive behavior by going away to California with a group of beautiful people she met at a nudist colony (I'm not joking)   After her father finds out about her, and her mother tells her that her mother is going to leave her and her sister, she decides to go to California so that she can see her mother and sister again.   Her father, who is a successful, wealthy, and respected lawyer and politician in her hometown, decides to stop her and send her back to her hometown.  This has never happened before in any of my stories and I'm a huge fan of the movies this movie is based on: . The movie's ending is so perfect, so perfect that it would be a crime for me to ruin it. .   The movie doesn't focus too much on the main character, instead focusing on the other people that the movie makes us care about.  It is almost sad that there was no story about her father, and how she lost her mother, and she never had the chance to be a little girl in her mother's arms like her mother always wanted.  My dad went to a nudists colony and he never did anything wrong, he did what everyone wanted to do there.  She was beautiful, intelligent, artistic, and so happy at the time she was living with this group of people she didn't have any problems with them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good old Western movie.   The action is great, the costumes are fantastic and the music is wonderful.  I have to admit that the first half of the movie is not as good as the second half. The two leads do not have the same chemistry.  In the second part the acting is better.  After about 6 mins, you start wondering how they will ever get out of this situation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of times when people talk about how good a movie is, they say it's good for everything it has to offer, and for good reason!   There is just one major flaw with this movie.   That one flaw is that there isn't much story to begin with.  There isn't even really any plot at all to tell.  Instead of a narrative about a mysterious alien, it's a simple tale about a lone girl and her friends.  So in summary, the story is very simple. The girls get separated from each other in the middle of nowhere. There are some strange creatures wandering around and the girl meets up with an old man that seems to have an eye for a girl that is kind of lost.  The only thing that really happens is that they each have a "dream" about the other.  Then at the end of the movie, the girls go back to the same place, and the old man tells them that he has seen another "other" and that the girl is just looking for him!  So basically it's all just a bunch of friends going around finding each other!  But then they find out that there is a giant, invisible ship and it's out to destroy them.  If you're familiar with movies like "The Day The Earth Stood Still," "The Abyss," "Alien" and "War Of The Worlds" then you will be familiar with this type of thing.  It is basically just a long story where the characters go on a "mission" that ends in disaster.  This movie was not well received by some because it's not a lot to go on.  Some people really enjoyed it because it had some good characters and a good plot.  But the only problem I had with the movie is that it's very difficult to describe!  It's hard to explain why the alien is so evil or why all the girls want him dead.  For some, this movie was just a lot of fun and then there are others that said that it was more of a nightmare than a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      My first impression of  The Devil's Rejects   was that I was watching a classic, a good classic. I wasn't expecting anything special, I expected to get the idea of a good horror movie and, without spoiling too much, it does that to a T.   In my opinion this movie is a little outdated.  It feels like it was written before the first Evil Dead (or rather, when it came out) and it really shows in the acting and the writing.  There's definitely some humor in the movie, there are some well thought out monsters and the story takes place in a hospital.  I don't know if the director had a big budget when he made it or not but a lot of the locations look kind of dated, like a hospital from another time.  The script has some nice touches, like the scene with the old woman that is clearly based on a scene from a horror movie like Halloween.  But the movie is not great, it's just not very scary and the acting is okay.  If you like classic horror movies then you'll probably like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about the life of a young Irish lady, Gertrude Himmelfarb, who is a prostitute in the streets of London during the early days of World War I. She is later joined by a Jewish soldier and the two women are caught up in a series of events which result in the deaths of a number of soldiers. The film gives us a unique insight into the life and times of prostitutes during a time when prostitution was a common and accepted occupation. It was a time of social upheaval and the film captures a vivid picture of the social conditions which were to endure in Britain for many years after the war.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a fan of this movie and love the cast.   While I have seen the "Taken" films before, this one is much more effective and entertaining.  There is some very strange humor sprinkled throughout the movie.  Even though it's a short movie, I enjoyed it.  The cast is great, and while I didn't see all the characters, I loved most of them.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan or is just looking for a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems like almost every new movie that comes out has a plot line that is almost identical to the one in this movie (a drug deal gone wrong with a bunch of criminals, two beautiful women and some police work and then it is over).   The plot is almost as boring as the rest of the movies in this genre (if not worse)   While it is easy to get into this movie, it is not easy to stay with it.   Although it is entertaining, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best science fiction movies ever made and probably one of the most underrated films I have ever seen.   While there are a few science fiction films from the 70's and 80's I've not seen in the past, this one was a pretty good one.  From the first scene the first scientist (George Clayton Johnson) asks how a human brain gets around and is told it moves itself. He then asks why a human should have such a long way to walk. They go on to discuss about brain function as well as body functions as well.  In the third scene, the robot is walking around on a treadmill.  When the second scientist gets up to use the restroom, his leg gets stuck in the door as the robot goes around picking up items.  The final scene is really good, the robots in a warehouse are picking up stuff and bringing it back to the warehouse.  I could not find a better way to end the film.      The special effects were all done well. They are all believable and unique in their own way.  They never go overboard and show off.  Some of them are really clever with some being really amusing.  Even though this is science fiction, the movie is not silly.  It is really realistic and really scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In fact, I like "Lonely Island" as a lot more than I liked "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."   The Texas Chainsaws was like a man coming to terms with the fact that his girlfriend has left him for a new boyfriend, and what he has learned along the way is that he really is a pretty decent human being.   "Lonesome Island" isn't quite that, although it has some of the same sort of things going on, but it is an interesting look into the lives of a group of friends who have been together for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's funny!   The jokes are funny, funny, and funny, like, when this guy in a car (looks like he's been to hell) is talking about the way he's going to "ride" the car: "If I can't fit in it, I'll just get in."    You know, those things get old.   There are too many jokes.  Like, there's the guy in the white hat that tells him "You don't see these people on TV often!"   But in the end, they're still funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movies that have you thinking, thinking, wondering how the hell they got away with making this. It's about a guy that goes back in time to solve a problem, and comes up with a plot that is not all that interesting.    It's just a bit boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first movie i ever saw by this director, and this movie still is one of my favorites.   It stars the great, great Sean Connery as a veteran British special forces soldier who is trying to escape the war when he is assigned to join the Resistance.  The whole story is about how a young, idealistic and idealistic young man tries to find out what really happened in the war and how he can make a difference in the future.  Sean Conner was a great actor, and the acting was amazing throughout the whole movie.  He would later be cast in the legendary "Spy Kids" and other great movie roles.  But the movie, and Sean Conney as a soldier and a soldier's soldier.  In the movie Conner is trying not to let himself become a prisoner of war and when he realizes that the Nazis are trying to kill all the British soldiers he tries to get out of the war as soon as possible, in the next time the movie takes place.  If you watch the movie you will never forget it and you will always have your favorite Sean Cony in your mind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie will never make you forget about the horrible movie called  Tetsuo: The Iron Man.  It is like a bad movie, but still a good one.   In Tetsuro, the movie takes a step back and shows some of the weaknesses that have plagued this series since its beginning.  This is a slow story, but it will make you appreciate it more and more as you watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you think of a bad movie you think about someone having a great time and getting absolutely nothing out of the experience.   And if that is all a movie has to offer you then it really doesn't have a chance.  There is nothing funny about a man who spends his life trying to impress a woman that thinks he is hot.  But why am I even giving it two stars?   This is the type of movie that is really easy to hate.  I think it is based on a really bad novel by a guy who is really bad at writing.  It is supposed to be an American comedy about a guy with a really terrible job that is a poor imitation of a British show.  When I first read it I thought that it would be funny to make the movie where there is an actual woman who loves the guy and will marry him if he would just stop trying to become famous.  Well there is definitely a woman in this movie, who was written on a typewriter and played by a really poor comedian named John Candy.  She doesn't know how to read, is constantly crying and has a terrible accent.  The man that the movie is about loves her, who is in her 20's.  And she is even married to this guy and they have a son that is about 4.  This movie isn't bad, it is funny and a lot of people like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film of great, yet flawed, merit that should be better known.   The first hour of the film is filled with many things worth mentioning: - An interesting lead performance by Jack Nicholson (who has a surprisingly effective and believable performance) - The film's two main villains: James Cagney and Sidney Poitier - An original, but not particularly great, character played by James C. Hutton, who does not seem to really get into the movie; his performance is a little off and the film doesn't really do him much justice, but still it's a good role - The wonderful, wonderful and lovely, yet very different musical score - A very interesting villain, played by a somewhat ridiculous character actor, called John Du Prez - A great opening sequence with many funny scenes and funny moments - An excellent ending with an interesting scene involving a man with a giant foot (complete with creepy music that would later become a staple for the movie) - A rather strange and slightly weird ending (and it doesn't make sense to me)   As you can probably tell from the above, the film's first hour is somewhat slow paced, but the rest of it is really good. Jack Nicholson has a lot to say and a lot of great lines in this film, he plays his character very well. This is the most fun and entertaining film I've seen in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been a big fan of The Last Unicorn, it is not just the first movie from the wonderful children's book series by Roald Dahl, it's a masterpiece. As a long time child of the 80s I can say that the film is quite the treat.   The movie starts off with the story of a young Unicorn named Toto being captured by evil Fairy Queen and having to watch the town become destroyed.  It's only after that he sees his friends being sacrificed to the evil Queen and is saved by a young boy named Scrat.  There is more to this story. Toto's uncle, Professor Bumpkin teaches him how to tell the good from the bad and what not to do, this is when Toto decides to join up with Scrat, a young lad who is a bit out of his element, and who happens to be a wizard.  They head to the Unicorn world to rescue the princesses from the evil queen.  Unfortunately the Queen doesn't give up easily, she takes Toto, Toto takes the evil dragon who is guarding them and starts a quest to find the princess and destroy the Queen.  As they go through the dangerous land Toto meets and falls in love with a young girl named Flounder who is very much in love for him.  The story goes on to the magical kingdom and then into an old castle where they meet a man named Zsigmond who is also looking for a magical girl, also he must face the evil fairy queen who is out to get her.  After this they face the dragon again and are rescued by Floundor who teaches them how to speak with their magic horns.  Along the way they discover that there is a secret passage and Toto starts to find a way to open it but this leads them to the old town, the unicorn world, and to a mysterious forest with strange creatures and people.  This film is magical in every way and you'll get a whole new appreciation for the magic as you travel along with these characters, you'll wonder where they were all of this time, and the ending, oh the ending!   This movie is a must see. It's hard to find fault with a film this good, and it's hard not to admire the creativity and genius of its author Roald J. Dahl who never takes himself too seriously nor does he make his characters too easy to like.

With such a high level of talent in this movie, the director is sure to put a lot more work in to make it a better movie in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic movie: it is a classic.   The movie's great: the special effects and performances are amazing.  When you know a movie is going to be a great movie, the special effect is what makes it.  What really surprised me is that in an age where they make movies that are basically the same, this movie still holds up very well.  I am not really a huge Sci-Fi fan, but I like this one a lot: I am looking forward to the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very strong and impressive film and well worth watching.   The film starts off quite nicely and follows the protagonist and her family and friends through the summer holiday. We see them visiting a beach in the country where her daughter plays with a boy and her grandson finds something beautiful there. One day when she is driving with her friend, the road gets washed away, they get stuck and then a man appears. He wants them to come to his cottage and take his picture so that the man who made the road could get revenge. The woman tells her children to leave the car in a safe place and then the man takes a picture of them both. The little girl is shocked to find out that she has a picture with the little boy who was playing with her. This film has some dark undertones and has some interesting characters with interesting stories.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always loved B.A. Baracus,   from the first time I watched this film   at the BFI London Film Festival in 1979  . The film is set in ancient Egypt at the beginning of the 5th dynasty,  and follows the story of a slave girl who becomes a member of the great pharaohs   and becomes famous   for her skill in the field of archery.   Although I have seen other pictures of   B. A. Barachus   before   the film,  it is quite a different film from those,  which appear as though they may have been filmed on a shoestring budget.  I think that the film has been well and truly filmed. The set,  is beautiful and has the look of an oriental palace.  The costumes are very beautiful, especially the headdress,  made from a single, twisted length of leather which has been braided into a braid.  I really like the way the camera follows the archers while shooting them;  they move quickly, but appear relaxed.  It is interesting to note that Barachus is a man in his late 60s,  while this is the prime of life in ancient  Egypt,  he seems to have aged very little over the last decade or so.  There is a great deal of talk in the film about the ancient Egyptians and their art, and it is interesting how Barachus can make an archer appear to have the body of a young boy by the way he handles his bow,  his shoulders are high and his muscles seem to be at their strongest.  While it is a rather low budget film, it is shot and directed with a sense of power and authority.  Baracus' bow is a very heavy one which he keeps in a large leather scabbard,  but when it is loaded it is only a little heavier than his own body.  This is one of those films where I was glad that it had been released on VHS, as I can still see all the elements in which made it such a hit,  even the small details, such as the small wooden bows,  the archery practice which is being carried out in the temple's courtyard,  or the fact that the archer who is being played by Baracus is actually the head of the temple!   The film doesn't just have a strong visual appeal, it also has

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a story which was well-executed, I don't know why people in this day and age can't realize that. It was a good action movie with good characters who were likable.   A good follow-up to the first one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about the murder of a young man by a psychopath, and in the process the man's girlfriend is murdered as well. That's it. It's not about the story, and it's not even a film about crime.   We don't need a murderer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't really like this movie much because I was always too busy thinking about the plot of the movie that was about a woman being put under a spell by a snake. The main male lead, played by Michael Douglas, is a good actor and all, but he had no depth to him. This is a very sad story because his best friend is taken away from him, which is such a tragedy. The girl who does the spell is played by Liev Schreiber and she seems to be on her own, but I'm sure there was an evil sorcerer at work. The whole movie has a depressing feeling, which I suppose it must have to be if you have to make it to the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's my favorite of all the Todai Totsuki movies, and that's saying something. It has a much more realistic sense of romance than any of the previous movies, it's filled with strong character development, and it is really the best of the Togari series as a whole.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can not say much about the movie but I can tell that it is a very good movie.   The story is about an ancient Indian who tries to find a way out of his tomb.  The way he does so is not what you would expect.  There are many different ways he gets out but not only does he escape through the use of a rope that he finds in a cave he also escapes by opening the doors of the two bodies inside his tomb with a magic key.  He has another way out but unfortunately there is a dead body that he opens and that also does not lead to freedom.  In the end he decides to leave his dead body and the key and his rope in his home and to return to his dead ancestors.  A fun movie, very good production and a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie follows the story of a boy, Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a gifted young man with great potential. He attends an exclusive private school and then moves to a wealthy neighborhood where he is able to become friends with the boys his age.   It's a pretty good movie, especially for Adam, who has a lot to do that is very interesting.  He can see things others don't, and his friendship with Adam is a great movie.  I was surprised at how close the ending was to the opening scene and I was so pleased with the movie that I watched it twice: first time in the theater and then on the phone, just to catch up on some important details.  It took me a bit to get into the movie, though. The plot is fairly simple, but it moves along quite quickly and leaves you wanting more.  The acting is great, the editing is good, the direction is good and the music is also good, with only a couple of small errors (not bad, mind you).   I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a very good and good-looking movie with a lot of action and some very good acting.

This time we find young man, Ash, who has lost his mind after hearing a scream and finding his dead mother and her dog. After a series of murders he learns that there is a woman with a dark and twisted past in a small town called Oak Creek. Ash and his friends, Eddie, Jessica and Joey, must escape from this town in order to find a way out of town. This sequel shows the main characters are very different than the first. The film has a fantastic sense of humor and the special effects are brilliant.

It is about a gang who have no real reason to work together other than they are both "gangsters".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What? This is my first viewing of this movie so I can't comment too much on it, except to say that it was pretty good. I think it's the right movie to take one of the more well known stories in the series and make it even better.   It's very funny and the acting is all very good, there are some very good special effects but the characters are too thin and I wouldn't want to be a part of this cast.

There is something about this movie that really hits the spot: it's the perfect summer movie for any kid who likes to pretend that he can fly.  It's a great combination of goofy and emotional that really makes you feel for the characters.  I love that they don't sugarcoat the tragedy, and that the tragedy is actually a kind of triumph.  The ending of the movie has some very sweet moments to boot, and as a whole, this is a pretty sweet movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I'm always on the fence about sequels, but this one was a really fun experience that kept me interested throughout.   It was like watching an old western with modern twists on the old tropes, like the kid who shoots a bad guy dead to save his sister, or the gunslinger trying to kill the sheriff who has the gun he used to kill a sheriff before.    Also, the villain is not a bad person.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was the first film i have seen that could compete with the films from my youth.   In some ways it is similar to films from the seventies. It is set in a town that has recently been taken over by a black man, who is running it like an authoritarian communist state.  The film has many great scenes and is entertaining and entertaining.  Unfortunately, though, it is not as good as the seventie films, or as good a film as the first three Indiana Jones films.  For some reason, a lot of the dialogue is just incomprehensible.  I have a bad memory and a poor vocabulary so I have never seen a movie before where this was such an issue.  Even so, it still gives me a laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off:  This was a great way to celebrate New Year's Eve for the young, single guys who work in the parking garage.   The film is a comedy of errors, featuring a couple of guys (Henny and Pete) who come in for a haircut and are surprised to find a guy named Mr. Big with a big mustache and a big moustache.  Mr.Big looks at his mustache and says, "A guy with a mustache like that must be in a hurry.  The guys find out that he's a cop and Mr.Biggie (Bruce Willis) tells them that he wants to take them to a party at a famous club called the Bluebird where a guy has two guitars on stage and plays tunes such as "Pistol Whippin' Mama," "Lola," and "Shoes On The Moon."  The two guys go to the party, but they are mistaken for burglars and are arrested.  While they are being marched to the police station Mr.Tongue (George Carlin) is being interrogated.  Unfortunately, Mr. Tongue's mustache is not as good as Mr.Avery's, but the bad luck doesn't end there.  One of the officers accidentally shoots Mr. Bengal, the police officer who shot Mr. Tongue.  After the officers are told that their cases will be dismissed the two guys get in a cab and drive to Mr. A's, where Mr. Jamboree (a.k.a. Eddie Murphy) is standing out front with his three guitars.  But before the two can even get their guitars out, Mr Big, the one with the mustache, throws a brick through a window.  Luckily, Mr Bengal is there with his guitar and plays a tune called "Lily's Blues."   After this song Mr.Jamborees' mustache falls off and he has to run to the bathroom to get a new one, and the guys are forced to walk the block all night long and watch a few more songs that are on Mr.Finger.  So, the guys go back to the parking bay, where they see Mr. Finger (Gene Wilder) doing a set with his band.  As Mr Finger goes to get his guitar Mr. Fingers' mustache is falling off.  When Mr.fingers gets back his mustache is still there. Mr.finger asks Mr. BIG

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best part about this movie is that it does not seem like it has been made by anyone who had no prior experience in the genre, it is a great mixture of old and new, it has that old school feel to it, which I love, but it also has that new school feel where everything is explained in the simplest terms possible. The plot is simple, but has a lot of twists and turns and is very well made, and the characters are all very interesting, and it does get a lot better as it goes along, so it's a good first feature.

The movie is about a teenager who has a bad day at school and ends up in a strange motel with a crazed little girl named Janice.  This film is pure horror and it is really fun.  I'm not much of a fan of horror films but this is the kind of movie that will keep you up at night.  It's definitely a film to check out and it's an excellent film to watch on Halloween.

I have never liked the Disney movies and I have always hated the Disney Princess movies. But Disney Princesses are one of the few Disney movies that I really like, and this movie does a great job of capturing the feel of those Disney Princess films.   The only thing I didn't really like about this movie is the fact that the Disney princesses are mostly just kind of annoying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fine film from the 1980s, it's the movie where David Carradine and a young Tom Cruise play the two kids who find the most terrifying of all the creatures in their town (it's the same creature that they see when they go swimming in the ocean). A terrific cast also includes a great Bill Pullman (who gives the movie its title) and Michael Biehn.   I watched this movie a number of times as a child and it has never been a favorite of mine. It's simply an interesting monster movie (which I've reviewed before) and it certainly has its share of good monster movie moments, but also many bad ones.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found the movie interesting because its a mix between two of the worst movies from the 80's. In the movie, we see a couple who try to save their lives. One guy can fly to New York and back in a matter of hours, and the other is so stupid he can't even drive a stick shift. I guess it's an excuse for all these films that don't get any respect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been meaning to see this film ever since I saw it at my local movie theatre. This is my first real experience with a true black comedy (or a 'black-hearted comedy', depending on who you ask), and it is one of the funniest black comedies I have ever seen. The plot is fairly simple and not too deep, and is only really interesting to see how the story develops as the characters themselves try to make a few bucks and end up in the morgue. The cast is very good (I particularly like how the main character, Paul (Curtis) is played by a very well known actor with a very strong background in acting) and the actors themselves are very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the "Twin Peaks" series and one of my favorite movies of all time. I always felt it was in the spirit of the old 80s movies like "Airplane", "The Right Stuff" and "Close Encounters" in which the world was surreal and dark. It's all a little over the top in my opinion.   Lara Flynn Boyle stars in the remake, "Twilight".   She's very good, but the remake also has a few issues.  I like the idea of this movie, but it's over thetop, almost like the old film series.  The "Twins" are a Twin Peaks fan club. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people had the same reaction to this as I did. You see, in addition to the fact that the movie was over-produced and over-the-top, it was also the story of a man who was a bit of a mess and the movie portrayed him as having a rather interesting relationship with his dead mother.   At first this is an enjoyable movie; the story is simple, the acting is decent, and the music is a bit more than adequate. But as the story goes on and the story becomes more convoluted and a little too convoluted (even though it was only about 12 minutes), the story takes on a much darker tone, the dialogue becomes much more garbled and incoherent, and a lot of the story elements are completely dropped in favor of the more important theme.  I don't think I was particularly surprised by the ending either.  But for its over-production, over-consumption of action and over a few inconsistencies (like the fact a police officer can be seen looking into the room of a couple being interviewed), this movie is definitely a winner.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I have only seen this movie once so far. I really want to like this movie because it has the potential to be a really great movie. However, I think the movie could have been much more, and in the end, I feel disappointed with the movie.   The movie starts with a very slow introduction, and is very interesting. This movie has an almost old-fashioned feel to it. The movie then picks up about halfway through, and the characters really seem to be coming to life. The film then is a mixture of action and comedy, with the whole thing coming together very nicely.  The film ends on a really good note, and all in all, I really do want to see the movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed the first half of this movie very much. I especially liked the character development and the atmosphere. As far as the story goes, it wasn't very complicated. It was a simple tale about a man who has a secret about him, and the fact that he's trying to keep it a secret is the central theme of the movie. The cinematography was great. I found myself thinking: "Why don't we get some action in this film?" Well, at the end of the story, the man and his lover are found in a desert, looking for food. I think they were looking for some sort of magic that would grant them their long-awaited food. The story wasn't too bad. It had a nice atmosphere and the character roles were well-done. I wasn't crazy about the whole magic thing, but I could relate to that. If only the main plot had been much better. It really got kind of old.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said, this film has nothing to do with the first film. This is a completely different film from the first. The main characters are different in this one. The first one was a guy named Bill Gates. This one is not a guy, but a woman. It is also a black-and-white movie. It takes place in a world that seems to be a black & white one. There are some bright spots to this film:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the finest comedies ever made and an essential entry in the canon of comedies about high society, this movie was so influential in its time because it was a very funny film. This is no longer a comedy about a rich man who can't be bothered to get out of bed, but a comedy where all the rich men get out at 5:00 AM, like a couple of kids who have to be up for school in the morning and have a game against the teacher's pet monkey at 6:00.   The story, by the way, has the added fun of an all-female cast, a very attractive female lead and a very smart-looking male lead, which helps make this very funny movie, and even more so if you like screwball comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack.   There is only one bad thing about it:  There are very few scenes with a character of any significance:  - We meet the "real" guy - The girl gets naked - The guy falls down a hill and his pants fall off - A bunch of people try to help him - The camera tracks them in a big circle - There is a big explosion and the guy flies into the air - The movie then cuts to a guy with a white shirt and jeans, falling and landing on a bunch of guys who are still standing around and smiling - The guys don't even try to give him a hand up - The music cuts out and then returns - The other guys get in a pile of crap and pile up in a ditch - The dude with the white shirt is still standing, grinning and still holding the guy's clothes - The two other guys turn the camera away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not only entertaining, it's quite clever and is written and directed with a certain theatricality that is quite refreshing.   There are a number of good characters (including a few who you will love and others you will hate) and some action scenes.  It's not a film for the faint hearted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In terms of acting, I think the best thing about this movie is that it's a bit more polished than the earlier films.   As far as the story goes, the movie is still pretty good.  This movie is more about the characters than the plot.  I think this movie would make a good filler movie between the first and second season of the show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at a theater the other night and I was really impressed. It was a story that was about the way people were in the 1960's with people being so different now with the drug culture, and so many changes in life, and the kids who would make that happen. With the kids were a bunch of kids who are different, but all good, and you can see them in every aspect of the movie. The people who lived the 1960s will always be a part of my life, but I am happy that this movie is still being made and making people think about the times they lived in.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had my doubts about this movie. I thought it was cheesy. I've never had any issue with cheesy but when you watch this movie, you have to question how much money this guy is making from all of the sex.   Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming value. There's nothing in it that was worth the time it took to watch.  It was a short movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - An interesting look at the world of sport.   In terms of pure entertainment, there isn't a single problem with The Rocketeer.  It's an entertaining story, with all the requisite action and gadgets. It does a terrific job of portraying the sport of rock climbing as a legitimate sport. The story was told so well that it almost felt like a documentary.  While the sport is a lot of fun, the movie doesn't shy away from showing the negatives of the sport, such as dangerous terrain, climbing up rocks without ropes, and of course the dangers inherent in the sport. You have to wonder whether this sport is worth the risk. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dalai Lama"   It is an odd movie with a great idea: a guy and a girl go to Tibet on a vacation. It takes a bit to get to that trip. But it's worth it. It has a lot of humor, some pathos, and just a little bit of drama. The movie also has a strong Buddhist message.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a shame that this film is never remade, since it's one of my favorite movies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this at the Cinema Café a few weeks back on a Wednesday night. It was about 8:30PM and the place was packed with a lot of people. It started off slow, and by the time it was time for the film to start the audience was standing. The lighting on stage was not good, but there were several cameras running through the set, so it wasn't a big problem for the director.   This was a good action film with lots of action scenes, and was a blast to watch!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't like this movie at all, and it wasn't a good one either.   While it had some good parts, I found them to be overused and over-complicated.    And while it had a couple of good moments, they were all over the place, and I couldn't really care much about them.  The story is not very original, and is rather contrived and contrivedly thought out.  This movie would probably be well-received in a world of film students; for me, it was a disappointment, and a major letdown. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie that has been billed as a sequel to the cult classic film 'The Goonies'   -   (1998)   One must understand that the Goonies isn't a movie that was made for children. It is one that was created for adults and adults only. A story about a group of kids who live in a small town in the woods and who play in the marsh. They are a happy group of young people, enjoying life as normal and not looking forward to anything. Suddenly a terrible storm occurs and they are forced to flee their homes and find their friends and friends of friends. The storm is a result of the town's mayor, Mr. Krabs (Michael J. Fox) having recently married a woman (Sandra Dee). This new wife doesn't like the kids that live in the small town or that they're all looking like pirates or that Krabs is a little bit obsessed with his wife's friend (the "Hooky", played by Gilda Radner). The town has only a few people, a police chief, a mechanic, and a bus driver. Mr. Krim (Tim Curry) has been tasked with taking care of the kids, but they are outmatched by the "Hokey" (Emmett Till) and "Boo" (Mike Myers) who try to run away from the marsh to see their new lady friend.   It's funny how much of the Goonie world you can imagine in real life.  I have to say that I'm not a big fan of sequels (I'm a fan of new movies). I thought that the sequel was the same story as the first. It just seems to have taken a different tack with the kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched a lot of science fiction, horror and fantasy movies. While I enjoy a good thriller as much as the next person, this one was very well done and was entertaining. I liked the premise and the characters. This movie does an excellent job of exploring the idea of the "dream of peace" and the dark side of it. I do not know how a film about "peace" could be so dark. It seemed that people in this future were so brainwashed that they forgot that the past was very dark and violent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first feature movie from the director of "Babe, Get a Grip". It is based on a short story by a good Canadian writer named Don Gately (the film is a retelling of the story). There are good performances here and the story is good. It is an action-packed movie about a couple of tough guys who get into a little car accident, one of which gets killed (or is it "wiped" out?) and the other goes down. The survivors must go to Mexico and meet a Mexican general who they think may be able to help them. It gets a little too dark here but the film is pretty good otherwise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! I didn't think I would. I have seen it a few times before with an American director. But this time the story and characters were very unique. The script was very good. It was about a group of people who go to a remote part of Russia to hunt and kill some huge black bears. The movie was well-produced, and the scenery was wonderful. The bears were quite scary and their behavior was very creative.    This is a very good, enjoyable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        The movie that I've always wanted to see:  What made me love this movie is that the plot is more like a fairy tale:  It is a wonderful story of a woman who wanted to become a magician and is helped by the fairy godmother who was a witch who fell in love with her.   I think that my heart would be more with this movie if the actors didn't wear clothes with clothespins, the plot would have been better if it is a fairy story about a fairy god mother who gave a gift to a beautiful girl who could help her in her dreams.  It could have been a good story without this dress pins.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised by how "different" the movie is. The first half of the movie was definitely a mix between the traditional and the "futuristic" films. The story line was somewhat repetitive but had interesting twists to it and was interesting enough to be enjoyed. The movie had some really good effects but did not come off too cool or fancy.   It has some great special effects such as the "magic flying fish" and the futuristic cars that were really cool.  I don't think I could have asked for more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does not make me happy.   It's not even the best movie I've ever seen.  I've seen a lot of good movies but this one just does not have the same energy and the same feel to it.  It just seems like a boring and dull movie.  The plot was stupid.  There's no point to the plot.  What did they do the whole movie except drink.  They talked about their love for each other so much.  A guy gets caught stealing from a store.  He tells her about his past and what he needs to do to get back into her life.  She tells him about a movie she liked to watch.  Then the guy and the girl go to the store. What is the point of this movie?  It had me bored the whole time and I didn't like it at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard of   it I thought to myself "Hey that is something different!"   I was very much surprised at the amount of energy and fun that was put into   this film.   It is definitely a comedy.  There is a great sense of camaraderie and a lot of laughter.  And there is a strong message about taking care of each other, not just when we need it, but even in times when we are alone.  I like this movie.  It was a lot different from anything I had seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't watch this movie to be a good review of a bad movie but rather to be an example of how not to shoot a bad scene.   The director's style is the standard '60s Hollywood, with a little bit of spaghetti western, which is fine.  A man with a dog, a shotgun, and a bunch of other people are in a field where they are about to be ambushed by two Indians (one wearing a turban and the other a loincloth) when a little girl runs in and screams "What's all this? They're trying to kill us!"  The man who is holding the gun pulls the trigger and the boy falls down in front of the gun.  Then the man runs off.  The next scene is what I call "Dirty Harry:  A gunfight takes place in a restaurant.  One of the men runs out, yells a name, and points a gun at a man sitting in a booth. The two men start shooting at each other.  Both men die.  Finally, the woman in the diner says "I'm going to kill you."  "That's nice" the guy in the booth replies.  And then the woman raises her gun. She shoots him in the neck.  If this is an example to follow, then Dirty Harry would have been right to run.  I have no idea why the director didn't use any of this in his movie, except that it looks good to me, and that's about it.  There are some cool shots of the Indian attack.  At the beginning of the movie, they're shooting at people who are fleeing from them.  This is why I called it a good scene. The rest of the film is pretty much exactly what you would expect.  In the last scene the woman goes off to look for the person who killed her husband. She doesn't find him but then she finds the Indians' leader in a room with a gun and asks to speak with him.  She then is taken to the head Indian, who wants her to join his band.  Her husband is found in a pool of blood.  Not a bad story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A superbly acted and produced masterpiece from the best new director of this generation. All in all a very enjoyable, yet serious, and thought provoking movie about the most important and misunderstood people in the world."   The good:  - The characters:  We follow the actions of two of the most powerful men of modern history, Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein.   Einstein's father is an Italian diplomat and an Italian nationalist who hates Hitler. This is a very interesting angle, as it shows how powerful the man was before his fame and genius, but also how a real intellectual was a very fragile character in such an important and tense time.  - It's a little bit of a shame that Albert Einstein died in a car accident on New Year's Eve 1939, as his career is just about over.  He was the world's most famous scientist.  As it is sometimes the case, the story moves quickly with the two major characters and it would have been good to see them do some further things together before the end.  This movie is not a masterpiece, but a good story about the major people and events that have shaped human life and society in the twentieth century, with some interesting twists and turns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-acted movie with a lot of excitement, a lot going on with the characters.   It is one of those films that we watch with our children on Sunday afternoon in front of the television.  A young boy with a black heart sets out on a long journey to find his father, while a young girl with the same dark heart sets up a trap to catch him.  The plot is simple enough, but there is some mystery as to how the characters get their bearings and what they are after.  There is a lot happening in this movie, but nothing is very exciting and not all the characters are given enough attention.  You should really check out the trailer for it.  It's a good film, but the plot won't stick in your mind.  If you like action-packed films with dark themes then this is a good one to watch.

It's quite unique,  although it can seem like it's just a cheap ripoff of Monster from the "Monsters" series   It's a bit of a confusing movie at times but I really like the monster effects:  I love seeing something so weird and creepy and I like the effects as well,  it's really nice and very different from the rest of the "Monster movies" out there   I think there's also a good story here   There are some scenes in the film that just make me cringe:  One of the better monster films I've ever seen  The first scene where the monsters take over the city of Paris is truly terrifying: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember when I first saw the movie I was impressed with how much the movie had grown since it was originally released in 2002. It wasn't a good remake, but I thought it was an interesting story that I really liked.   A long time ago, a bunch of animals were sent to a planet which had gone through a meteor strike. The animals there are the only ones left on that planet, and they are trying to survive. The only people around are humans (one of them is named Mike) who were living on the other side of the planet. Mike's pet dog is there, and he has to figure out what to do to help the other animals survive.  I enjoyed it a lot!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is definitely one that I would enjoy and recommend to everyone.   It is a classic.  To me this film is a celebration of the wonderfulness and strength of a human spirit.  The film has a lot of great dialogue, a lot going on and a lot about the human spirit and the human heart, so much that you can't help but feel a little bit guilty watching the movie.  This film is good, and for a film of this kind, good is good.  I am a fan of the director's other film "Invisible Man".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film about a young man who wants to become a doctor. He is a young orphan boy from the North of England, who is abandoned by his parents at a very young age and later on his mother gets pregnant by the local priest (The priest is a bit annoying), he has a little sister called Helen (she is a sweet little girl), and he is taken in by the Reverend Mr. White, (who is very mean to him), but then he leaves again for the north and meets a lady called Sally (who he falls in love with), and after this, they live together.   It is like a film about life, love and friendship, which has a very sad ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a real joy to watch a movie about a guy, who is a bit slow, and the only person he wants to protect is his love, a girl who is very intelligent.   The movie itself is an interesting one, because in the beginning there is a fight between two kids, and we can clearly see that the one who is more powerful is the kid who is stronger and has a stronger personality. However, at the end of the movie a girl comes to his house, and he falls in love with her, and then it ends.  I found this movie very interesting, it was very emotional and at the same time, the film was very entertaining.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born into a world of science fiction and horror films. I grew up watching classics like "Nightmare" and "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in the theater at the same time as John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, and John Hughes. As an adult, I've found my way back to these movies, and they're fun to watch, but often so predictable I'm left scratching my head over what exactly the "alien" is doing there.   It's a bit of a cliche, but I can't help but love the characters, especially their little quirks.  The little kid with the broken arm is just adorable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a remake of the 80's television show The Love Boat. The film features a number of memorable characters like:  [The Love Boat ]   I like these kinds of movies because there is some nostalgia involved, it is a happy time where the crew has fun.   In the movie the main character, Captain, is the captain of the Love Boat with his wife,  "It's been two months since we arrived at the island, and we've already run into some problems."   The main character is a guy named James Bond who is an ex marine and a spy. Bond finds himself in the middle of a murder investigation.  Captain Bond, James Bond, he's the man to catch.  He is in the film about as interesting as a good cup of tea.  The movie has a good amount of action, but it doesn't involve much nudity and sex. The action is all about the weapons, and the action sequences are all very fast paced.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In spite of its numerous flaws, it's still quite a good action movie.   There's no real plot. The entire plot is a string of coincidences.  In one sequence a bunch of soldiers try to assassinate some Soviet agents, and a bunch more soldiers try and get in on the action.  The Russians then try to stop the whole thing by blowing up the bridge, so the U.S. has to go there in the helicopters.  But the U.S. soldiers in the helicopter get separated and end up killing each other.  This leads to a massive battle on the Russian side and the Soviets finally kill them all.  When the battle is over and the U and S. soldiers get out of the helicopter, they're greeted by a woman who wants to give them a drink of vodka.  She tells them that her name is Liza and that she is the owner of an estate, where all the wealthy rich Russians live.  Her daughter, who has been left behind in Russia, is now going to be sold to a rich American.  So, in addition to killing the Russians, the U.'s try to kill her too.  It's a real mess, but this is the kind of movie that's fun to watch even though it's very bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great little movie.   It's based on a novel of the same name by John Grisham, written in 1962.  It follows the true story of a poor boy who's taken in by a gang of thieves. He becomes a valuable member of the group and they soon learn how to steal money from a bank.  Although the gang is an interesting bunch, they're not all the same.  This movie takes a good idea and makes it more interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like The Drowned, it's a very dark and bleak movie about the lives of some very low-down characters. I didn't realize at first that it was a movie about a man (I mean, a man with a machete) drowning his girlfriend and getting her back, which I think is an incredibly rare thing to see in a movie. I had to go to the movies to realize this. I think it's because the movie is so good that most people don't know how to deal with the film's bleakness, especially since the film is so bleak. It's like a movie you might see in an old black and white movie. It has a really great atmosphere, and an excellent cast, so you won't have any problems getting through the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A long time ago, I had to watch a terrible movie on cable.   When I saw the first half, I thought I was going insane.  But this was a terrible mistake on cable's part.  It is a movie about a bad, worthless husband and wife who, in an effort to be together, cheat on each other while their children watch them.  I have heard good things about this movie from other people who haven't seen it, and I agree with them. This is a terrible, awful movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are many good movies in this series, but   this one is especially good, because of the way it depicts an orphanage, which is one of the worst places in the world.   It's not just the orphanage that's bad, but the care for the orphans is a bit worse.  In the third movie,   they have a really nice little boy who wants to be a writer.  He wants to write stories about the good things in life and people who are nice to him.  There's a boy who doesn't like him and tries to get him into trouble.  When a girl comes into the orphanages to make some money she's always bad-mouthing the boy, but her sister gets all the best places in her world, so she doesn't mind what she's doing to this poor orphan.  Even the little boy, who's obviously the most important character in the film, is the main bad guy.  The boy wants to get the girl to fall in love with him, but he's really not that bright, and isn't that what his father wants?  It turns out that the girl isn't even really a girl, and the boy is the only one who could love her.  So, in a way he's pretty smart for his age and the rest of the orphan children, but a lot of them are pretty nasty and don't appreciate what he's trying to do.  But then the girl gets captured by a villain, and one of them shows him who he is.  This is one story about what happens when you take a girl out of the home, don't take care of her, don�t teach her a lot, make her see things that aren't really there, and then keep trying to make her fall in a relationship with the boy.  It gets even worse when they take away all the bad things in the orphan, and they don't have anyone to take care if the little boys.  I love all the movies in the series,  because they are all good, but this one is the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie for a few years and I never really enjoyed it. I liked the theme and the characters, but it didn't get me.   It's a good story. I love the love interest character. It's an interesting character and she's a bit of a villain. The romance is really not that great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "What's the matter with you, Harry? You've been gone two years!"   It's funny when you realize that in Harry Potter, we're not actually going through the entire movie. We're just seeing it through the eyes of one character.   There's a lot of good parts, and there's a ton of bad ones, as you'd expect. But this movie is good enough that even though it's full of bad, and you wish that it were at least partially good, you'll still enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an action movie for the kids.   It has lots of action, but it is still for the young, for kids who can see how good it is to be strong and get strong.  This action movie is fun, it is silly, and it is good.  It is good at the same time, and I think it is very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason that I loved this movie is the chemistry between the two characters, Lobo and Chunk.  Chunk is a total goofball who thinks he is super cool and he thinks that he can do whatever he wants, but there are many things he can't do.  He can't swim, he can never fly, he has no problem talking to animals, he's a pain in the ass to kill and he doesn't even know how to cook.   He is so much fun, I wish I had a pet monkey so I could play Lobo with my kid.  Lobo is a very different character than the previous Lobo character.  This Lobo has a more evil mind and a desire for power.  The one thing Lobo doesn't do very often is fight a guy.  One time he was playing with a kid and a guy pulled out a gun and shot Lobo in the shoulder.  In the movie I noticed that Lobo's shoulder is in a sling and there is a sling on his back.  After this scene he gets hit by a car and his shoulder gets dislocated.  So Lobo comes back and fights a guy that was trying to kill a baby.  I don't know what the guy's name was but he was a complete freak.  There is also a scene in the movie where they are fighting a group of bad guys.  When they are first in the area they run into a guy and Lobo runs past him.  They then run into another guy, who is a woman, and Lobe runs right past her.  It seems that they have never met and she just comes up behind him and asks, "Do you love me?".   Lobe doesn't know how this happened.  Then he runs off when a bunch of guys start throwing things at them.  But when they get to the end they run back to where they were fighting and this woman comes up to them and asks to speak with them.     This woman starts talking to them about how she is an angel and wants to save them. She tells them that she can turn any bad guys into good guys just by telling them that they are bad.   She does this by giving them a message.  She tells the boys that they don't have to worry about what is happening to them. They can get out of this bad situation if they tell this woman about how their dad died and that it
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is the perfect blend of comedy and drama - as you can tell by the title of the movie: 'I WISH I WAS IN VICTORY'.   The whole movie is set in a fantasy world where everything is fake.   There is nothing realistic about the characters, and they all just talk about themselves:  I don't even know what to say about this movie. It is funny, with some dark undertones.  There are some great character deaths:  It's about the ultimate fantasy movie - but with the perfect cast of actors, and a story about a young boy that just can't help falling in love with a girl that is trying to steal his heart.  I am just glad to have another movie where people can enjoy an all-out comedy, but that doesn't mean that there is no drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is what you would expect from a film that follows in the footsteps of a similar-looking film, but does not bother with any pretense. I am in awe of this film. It is, for the most part, a solid story about a group of people who do not fit into society in any recognizable way. And it's very funny in parts, with great lines of dialogue and a good mix of humor and drama.   It is really a shame the film's quality was not as good as this and I would not be surprised if this was a sequel to the movie:

You are the best. You've made the world a better place." It's about a rich guy who has been robbed by a man dressed like a giant and wants to get revenge. I like the way it's presented and a great set-up. The acting is good too, and there are some really funny scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has the potential to be a classic, a classic with a little "twist".   A woman (Marjane Satrapi) runs an inn and she is taken by the police for trying to extort a rich merchant (Danish Khan) and he goes on a killing spree to get revenge.   It is interesting that the movie has not been made much better by western filmmakers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with a "Hmmm" of realization from a mysterious man named Biff, played by a pretty but uninspiring Ben Stiller. The main plot is based on the fact that Biff had a dream of his son walking through a field, with an egg on his back, but then he got scared, and his dream turned out to be his daughter getting murdered.   Unfortunately, this movie is so ridiculous that it's not even funny.  They don't even try to make this a good flick, it's just like a poorly edited, incoherent mess of a movie.  Even the plot is a joke, the guy thinks he's dead, the girl is pregnant, the egg on Biff's back turns out to represent the moon, the sun turns out be the devil, and the whole thing ends with a little girl who turns out not to be dead. The ending is also a joke because Biff never comes back from the dream, and Biff doesn't actually believe that he is dead.  In fact, he just turns out all the way back to his car to find his dog.  But that doesn't matter because it's a joke.  So the movie ends, and nothing happens.  It has a lot of plot holes, and also a lot to complain about.  This was not a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last thing you'd want to see is a movie set in a mental asylum, but that's what this film does.   I'd never heard of this movie until it was mentioned in a magazine.  I remember reading the synopsis and thinking "I don't care for horror films.  The film was interesting enough, but it was a very predictable one.  If you want something to do for a mental hospital, watch 'Trouble in Paradise'.  It's pretty bad, but there's a good story in there, and I liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about two good people. The first is a poor man with a hard to understand past, who decides to try to get rich by opening a restaurant. The second is a wealthy man who owns a successful store, and the third is a man who tries to convince a girl not to become a prostitute. The only bad thing in this movie is that they didn't try to make it sound like a good Western; all the guns are old, the women are ugly, and there are plenty of explosions. The good things are that it's funny, and that the plot is interesting enough to get through the 80 minutes it takes to get there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about the last survivor of a large tribe of people who live in the mountains of the Andes.   His name is Pancho and he has been bitten by a venomous snake that has been growing in the forests for generations.  After a long illness, the snake finally has its will on him. It has killed every other person in the village that had a few children (three) and it has now come for him. Panchou is forced to flee for his life to the town of Cuzco.  In this town he meets a girl named Marcela and they fall in love.  As they are about to leave Cuzcom to find a ship to leave the Andean Mountains, they get a visit from a woman named Maria that is expecting a child and has promised her father that she will bring Panchos baby back with her.  Panchous is in great difficulty to get back home and get Pancha back to his village before he is poisoned to death.  He escapes to the hills to find some friends who will help him to get to Cuzcon.  This is a very sad story and a difficult one to watch.  The movie was made in the 1970's by Spanish film maker Mario Jara.  I am not a native Spanish speaker but it is very easy to understand.  It is hard to get into a film with so many characters.  There are a lot of them that have to be described to the audience.  Overall this movie is a great look at the lives of people in the Andeanes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a story about a woman who is living a lonely life. Her life is a constant struggle between her dreams of flying a flying circus and her feelings for a good man. One day she is invited by an older woman to have lunch with her. The older woman introduces herself as Madame LaLaurie. She shows this woman a flying show she has recently come up with. They eat together and talk about the shows that the man she is in love with, the famous comedian, has done. Madame LaMaurie wants to give her a ride in her flying airplane. As it happens, the old woman has a special plane, a huge one. They start flying. The old woman tries to persuade the woman to come to the circus. When she says no, Madame LaLa gets very angry. She then tries to get the woman's attention by calling her by the name of her husband, Frank. The woman gets in the airplane only to discover that it can't fly. She realizes the plane is a flimsy fluke and the old lady is trying to scare her by calling them flukes. The lady does not give up the chase until she is rescued by a young girl named Alice. Madame laLauriere then finds a young man who she is going to marry in a couple of days. She is told that the only person who is willing to marry her is her husband. The man is too busy working to see her in time so he says he will be back after the weekend. He flies away, and the woman and the young girl wait until the weekend comes. She goes out to have a romantic picnic with Alice. There they meet another woman who tells Alice that Madame laLa is a fraud and is a woman of very bad character. They also meet a man who is a great admirer of Frank. When they get back, the man tries to talk to her about Frank. Alice seems reluctant to speak to him. They end up in a large fight which leads to them both being injured. This is the start of a beautiful, tragic love story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie a few years ago with my parents and I must say I still like it a lot.   This movie seems to be the perfect movie for those who like science fiction.  In general the movie is pretty good but there is a lot of flaws.  The characters and the plot are good but the execution was a bit too rushed.  Another thing I don't like is the voice acting, it sounds like the people were playing a musical.  Also the film is about a guy who is living in the past so it should be pretty different but they just kind of sound the same and that's what I mean to say.  I don�t mind the movie I really enjoy it but I didn't like the ending so I won't recommend this movie to anybody unless you like something a little different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little movie.   The action scenes are pretty great.  The story is fairly predictable, but it has the feel of a good buddy cop comedy.  A lot of people think the movie is a remake of the movie "Cars." Well, if you know the movie, then yes it is.  But, it isn't a remake.  "Cops" was a classic.  It has the same feeling of a buddy cop movie.    The character of Mikey is well developed.  Mikey has his own issues.  He is a cop who likes to make sure that everybody else is happy.  This movie is funny, and the humor doesn't take itself too seriously.  Also, if anybody out there knows the movie from the 90's and the 90s, then I'm sure you'll appreciate the similarities.  I can't say that I'm a huge fan of buddy cop movies, but this is a well-done and funny movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most realistic depiction of a nuclear war in the history of the movie! I thought it would be much more entertaining if there was a bit more action. The story is about the Russian's battle against a mysterious German army with the Russians fighting for their very existence. There's no war movie with this kind of atmosphere, this one is a war movie! It is true what they say: War is not worth dying for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie of the year?   No, seriously, how can anyone say something like that about a movie?  It's not like "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" was like that, though...  I don't even have to tell you that.  Oh, it is like that...  ...but that doesn't stop me from having a lot of fun with it!   I love that it's "a classic that should be re-told" as some people say.   There is some pretty good comedy in it, as well as some romance.  This is one of the most ridiculous romantic comedies ever made.  Oh, sure, it's a bit stupid, but the dialogue is actually kind of good.  There are a lot more "stupid" things to say, and I like to believe that the director did try to think of some new ways to get the joke (at least, I don't know why he didn't).   What I don´t like is that he puts the movie in a whole different context (the first film was a silent comedy), but I love how he tries to make the film into a movie about the friendship between a girl and a boy.  So many other movies about the girls and their relationships would be a lot funnier.  I'm giving this movie 5 out of 5 stars!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing I like about this movie is the humor.   This movie has one of my favorite scenes, the one with the three of them standing in the middle of the school yard after their graduation.  It's so funny and it's a shame there isn't any other humor in this movie other than the one joke that's at the end of the movie.     I have to give this a good rating because it's one of the better comedies out there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to watch this movie. It was very much inspired by "The Road" (which is about a woman who, after a car accident, has to wander through the desert looking for someone to talk to) but with more of a horror and a comedy bent than the movie's main inspiration, which was in part because this is not a movie about what happens to a man when he gets out of a speeding vehicle.   The story revolves around a couple (John Wayne and Julie Harris) who get separated during a road trip and end up in a place called the town of Death Valley. The town is inhabited by a group of crazy people who dress up as cowboys and ride on their horses. The movie is based on the author's own life and the book "The Woman Who Lost Her Mind" (the book actually is called "The Man Who Lost His Mind"), and it's also based on his experiences as an actor.  The movie has all the makings of a good comedy: Wayne plays a man who wants to get out of Death valley so he can go see some movie star. He ends up spending most of the movie wandering through a weird town called Death Valley which looks like a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  And then, when he finally gets out, the town starts telling him how he should act and how he shouldn't talk to Julie Harris.  But the town's leader, who is played by the terrific actor Bob Hope (of "Anchorman" fame) manages to give the character a nice and amusing turn. He's a guy who spends a lot of time making fun of his audience. I especially liked Hope's portrayal of the town leader, whose accent is like a cross between a southern preacher and a bad news anchor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this film, and I like it well enough, but I can't say that it's a great movie, because this movie is pretty awful. This is one of the most obvious and worst films I've seen, and it's probably one of best films made by a small-time director. I'm surprised that people think it's good because it's so bad.   The film starts out good enough, we've got a good scene with a couple (the husband and wife) who're enjoying some nice quiet days in a country house. We're then told that the wife's (the wife has a pretty good face) daughter is getting a makeover and that we're going to take a drive down the road to see the house. They drive to the house, it's pretty much a standard house with a few improvements and a barn in the backyard. The house has a large lawn and a well-kept lawnmower (but the lawnmow is a crappy one!). There are a couple of animals (one of which has a dog) that have been out in the rain and it looks like the dog might be sick. The wife is upset about the dog and the wife takes a couple pictures of the house with the dog in the front of the car. We see a little girl who is the daughter of the wife. The daughter is dressed nicely, there's a nice doll and there's lots of children, the little girl even has a car! So, we're looking at a nice little family on their way to the big city where their business can run. I didn't even mind the film and I liked it at the time.  After all, there are some good scenes in here, but not enough to make the movie worth watching. The little girl is a terrible child and it seems as if she's going to be a bad girl, but she's really a good child and the film gives her a pretty decent face. The family has a pleasant morning and they go to a park, where the wife and her sister are on a date. The mother comes home and finds the daughter in the back of the family's car, asleep. The father gets out and checks on the little one and the father puts his arm around her. After the father finds out that the little child has a disease and we're left with a sad story.  The little one wakes up from her nap and the parents talk to the child and give her some milk and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can you say about a movie so original in its plot and in its approach? I was fascinated by it from the very first second. The story takes place in a small town in Austria and revolves around the life of a group of people who are friends in college. The movie is a little bit different from a lot of other films. The script is written in a rather nonchalant manner that feels fresh and fresh at the same time. The director of the movie, Christian Puechter is a very nice person to work with.   After watching it I had a slight fear of jumping into a story with a lot going on.  I was pleasantly surprised to realize that this movie was actually a very well done movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In addition to being one of the better movies in the series, it's an entertaining one.   A few years ago I saw The Incredibles and it left me wishing for more.  So, as soon as this came out I bought the DVD and was instantly hooked.  I was especially looking forward to seeing this movie after reading the comments to the trailer.   The dialogue is just like the first film.  There are a lot of explosions and special effects (one particular one is a pretty good fight scene).   This movie is not as good as the first.  At times, it is a bit much and a lot more like a special effects movie than a Pixar movie.  This is still good, though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What you have to understand is that a couple of things went wrong in this movie. For one thing, the actors do a poor job of getting into character, but in the end the only thing they have to do is make the most entertaining comedy of the century.   The movie has an end credits sequence where the bad guys try to steal an atomic bomb and a few of them (I can't tell which are good and which are bad) get shot by the good guys. It's quite amusing.  A movie like this is always funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw it at a festival and was pleasantly surprised that it was all right to me.   The idea that I could find my way back to a place I had left a long time ago was something that I had hoped for but not for long.  There was an emotional connection with the people of the world, but also a very humanistic relationship, a deep sense of connection, a personal journey.  I can't really think of the best line, but I remember thinking "I didn't like the first one" when I started at the beginning and it took me a while to get used to the pace and feeling of the story.  But it wasn't a bad film, it was one of the good films, I think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard the trailer for the new remake of  The French Connection  I was totally disappointed. I loved that film, and it was a big hit on its original release, but I was worried that it was going to turn out to be a pretty tame, boring remake of the film with the same characters and even the same acting. I was so wrong.   As I wrote in my review of  Le Samouraï  (a film about a blind man who is also a crook)   :   " A film about the French Connection is more or less like a French Connection-movie-comedy.  The comedy starts early, as the French police are being held at gunpoint in the movie's opening scene.  After they escape, they run across a man who recognizes them (and gives them a ride home).   Then, the police try to hide the bodies of the dead men in a local cemetery (it's been rained the night before) until their fingerprints match the dead ones.  Then a mysterious figure with a suitcase approaches and asks them to pick up a box.  They go to the man's house and get the box, but as they go in, a masked man shoots the police and kills the man.  We discover the masked man is a French man named Michel Zimoncq.  What follows is a thrilling chase through the French countryside, with Michel's car running over and killing a few innocent people (including a young couple), and the pursuit of a fugitive named Jean Valjean.  So far, so good, except that things get weird.  Michel gets a new car, and the old car is stolen. The new car gets a flat tire, and after Michel and his friend, the doctor, come to the aid of the policeman and his partner, they are arrested by a gang of local criminals (including an insane woman who has just killed her lover). They are then taken to the local sheriff's office and put in a cage.  One of them sneaks out and meets the masked figure.  He gives him a ride, and then tells him to hide behind a fence in a wood.  When he gets there, a young boy appears.  His name is Delphine.  It turns out that Delphin was Michel's son.  This is a fairly typical story about the pursuit and eventual arrest of a wanted criminal.  But then

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was raised in the 1980's and lived through the whole disco scene. I remember all the kids were wearing short, pink, tight, brazilian style shorts. The music was all disco, but different from the pop music. The dance moves were really tight and funny. I think that what made the scene so interesting was the fact that it was all in Brazil.   As a teenager I had the impression that all the American kids were having a good time, but in Brazil it was different. It was very serious.  I think I was 14 when this movie was released in Brazil:  I remember the first time I saw this movie. It scared me a lot. In fact, this movie is still scary to me today.  This movie has everything that every teenage boy desires: to be popular, to be a good dancer, to have an amazing girlfriend, and to have great music.  I must say that I have never seen a dance scene that was as well filmed and executed as the dance scene in this movie, and I have also never seen such an impressive dance scene as the one in the movie, where the hero, Lina, has a great music video to go with the music that we see him doing in this film.  The movie does have its flaws. For example, in the dance sequence, there is no music and it looks like a lot of people are getting ready for the dance. There is some funny stuff in the music video too. However, the movie is very interesting, fun, and fun to watch, even if it isn't that good a movie.

It is about a woman who was given a gift of freedom for a girl who was raped at a young age.  She then turned to her father and begged him to let her be a teacher.  What an incredibly good movie  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was actually pretty good. It was funny and not very deep at all. There wasn't a single one that I would recommend. If you're looking for a good comedy, but have a low tolerance for heavy drama, then this is for you. It has a very simple story about a man trying to get over his ex-wife. It doesn't have much of a plot, but it does have a nice ending that will satisfy some people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a lot of things going for it. First of all it's good to see an American movie which tells the story from the point of view of a Native American. Secondly the director was quite good. The story is really good. It's also good to have some good looking white guys with tattoos that is cool to see. There are a couple of funny scenes where they discuss the different tribes of the western plains. Lastly it has a good ending with some great looking white people that I wish I was an old man and could go back in time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've only seen this movie a couple times but it's always funny.    There are so many scenes like that, where the guy's friend is just as stupid as his friend's father (that's what makes it funnier).   The movie is very fast paced, with lots of quick jokes, and lots of great one liners.  I don't remember what the most annoying part of the movie is (it could be anything, maybe the part where she talks to the dog) but I did like the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After a somewhat disappointing ending to a film about a woman who had a mysterious past and would go out of her way to protect the people around her in the form of a dog, the movie ends with a bang:      What I really enjoyed in this movie is how it never tries to hide its own style. While there are some parts of the film that could have benefited from a little editing, the whole thing just feels like a real fun watch. I've never seen a movie so weird that it had a scene in a graveyard.   It's as if the filmmakers made up a bunch of characters and decided to take them on a zombie apocalypse tour of the United States.  The most disturbing thing about this film is how much it sounds like a Twilight Zone episode.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While some reviewers like to write bad reviews of bad movies in order to get clicks, I always found them to be completely pointless. I like my bad movies to be very different from the rest.   And this one's different. I had seen it at a festival several years ago and was completely taken by it when I went back. It's a beautiful, funny film that's very different than anything you've seen before, especially in a romantic comedy.  A little over a year ago the original director of the film passed away. After a long time, it's back with a new director, the great, George Cukor.  It's been a while since a good romantic comedy has been made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well this movie was fun. The script was funny and witty.   The movie was set in a diner where the owner (Jude Law) is having a very bad day.  He's having to pay a million dollars for a guy to build the diner, he's in a bad relationship, and he's been laid off.  One day while sitting in the diner a young man walks in wearing a hat and mustache. He has a briefcase full of money which he hands over to the owner, who gives the kid a big smile.  This goes on for a while until the owner decides to go out with the young man.  While they're talking, the boy notices that his parents are having problems with their new dog.  But the dog is not the problem, it's a whole lot of problems that go along with the dog. He needs to be fed, given baths, and taken for walks. The dog, a pit bull named Lucky (Jason Alexander) does not take well to all of that and is very mean.  Lucky is very big, very powerful, and very vicious.  The owner of the diner doesn't want to do anything about it, so he has Lucky chained up in the backyard with a kennel full of food.  When the owner goes outside to talk with the son, he gets a shock. The son is not his son. The owner then comes back to find Lucky in a pit with a leash around its neck.    Lucky runs off and the owner pursues, but Lucky gets into a car and disappears.  A couple of days later the owner is driving along and spots Lucky in another car.  Unfortunately, the owner of that car is also the son of the owner.  Both the son and the father are very angry and try to kill the owner with a knife.  It turns out that the owner's wife (Sara Ramirez) is the one who was having trouble with the pit bull.  So the owner has to protect her.  She shoots the pit bully, but a gun gets stuck in the pit's neck. Lucky goes off into the woods with a flashlight and a box full of dog food. The boy is waiting for him, and Lucky finds a map with a secret location.  They go and find the map.  However, Lucky doesn't remember where he got the map from.    Lucky then finds the secret location, which is a secret in itself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not one for long movies, and this one lasted a couple of hours so I don't know how I could rate it.   This is a movie with a big cast, and a great script.  It seems to me that you've got some very good actors.  I found myself laughing quite a bit, but mostly because it was such a good idea.  With a plot that is simple, and an ending that is surprising, and not so predictable, this is one of those movies you can enjoy a couple times and then go back to read some other books.

When I first heard that it was about a man who is a vampire and a werewolf, I had no idea what a man can do with a pair of horns and a wolf pack.  And it sure didn't seem like anything a man could not do.  I think I need to start wearing a wolf mask.  This movie has a great sense of humor.  The movie was based on a book by a German author named Max Beerbohm.  After watching this movie, I decided that I didn't want to live that long.

I think that it was well written.

It's the sort of movie that has been made before, but Kubrick's attention to detail makes it very unique.   It's an American family, a father and a son, and a couple of children: a son who's a loner, and another who's out of his mind. This family seems normal enough, but they're anything but.      This is a great movie.  It isn't about an American house, or an American dad, but a whole world, a whole life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I read a review online that said this movie was an amazing story about a little girl and her father. The daughter falls in love with a guy and the mother is trying to hide it from the daughter. The father is jealous of the daughter and when he comes to pick up the girl, she's wearing a red dress. The girl looks and acts like she's really into this guy and it doesn't help that his name is "Harry". He's a bit of a charmer and she's pretty into him. One night she's about to get the house cleaned and he comes in. He starts giving her the same speech she's given to others before: "You know Harry...you're just like me."   There's not much more to say about it except it's very fun. I've seen it at least a dozen times now and I still can't believe it's only about 2 hours long. I like this movie. It's kind of weird. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it's done right, what with all the character development and the emotional payoff, it's a really satisfying and enjoyable movie. It has all the makings of a good story. The main character, Jack, is a very good, well written, interesting character. He is likable and interesting in his own right. He has a lot of problems in his life, which he handles well, and his relationship with a man named Eddie is a real nice contrast of their characters.   I enjoyed the movie as much as I did the first time around, as the second time around I felt even more drawn in to the characters and their problems.  The script is very good and well written.  I feel like the movie is better than the first two movies it was based on because of all the emotional and character development the movie has and the depth it takes.  What I did not enjoy as much was the music. It is not that the movie was bad and I enjoyed it. The music was just not that great. It was a little too sad to me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is so cool!    My dad is a film nut, and so is my mom.   When my dad asked her about a movie he would like to see, she said, "Well, my husband and I would like you to see the one about the man who found the treasure."   He went and got the video and went to see it.  When he came back he said, he said the movie sucked!  "What's the matter?   The hero was an   crazy old man who was always wearing a mask.  His partner was a   little girl.  My mom and dad just sat there with their mouths open.  Then, they went on to say, "I mean, my dad was just telling us about how a lady named   Mary had a house full of coins. She didn't know how to open a lock.  You're welcome to take a look at a copy of her diary."  The first part of the movie is about a crazy old lady named Mary.  She is trying to get the coins from her neighbor's house.  But there is something strange about her.  Her name is Mary O'Hara.  This movie was released in 1941, and it is based off the real life story of a crazy lady named Marie O'Neal.  The first half of the film is about Marie O, and a crazy story about her and her neighbor.  I don't know the exact story, but it involved a crazy gold mine, a mysterious ghost, a woman with a dog, and   a treasure.  There is a lot of good stuff in this movie, but at a certain point you will notice a lot is happening in the background.  It looks like the movie will be cut short at one point, but then it comes back.  If you look in the film there is a map that shows the location of all the treasure. This will probably come back into play later.  Once the movie got to the gold mine part, it was really funny.  Just watch a little clip of the guy who was the protagonist in the story.  "When the first guy said, 'What happened to that woman?'   It looked like he was about to hit her, and then the guy started talking. He started making a fool of himself and all of a sudden he hit the woman. And the woman said,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember this one fondly. It was a good, solid, and well-written film, full of emotion and mystery.   This one stars Al Pacino as a retired New York City police captain who is still a hard worker, but has lost his faith in the people of his old stomping grounds.  The first few days in the town were wonderful for Al, as the people welcomed him with a great deal of warmth. When he discovers that one of his former colleagues has come out as a gay man, he is forced to question the good he has done in the past.  He also meets the widow of a dead New York cop, played by a fine young actor named William Holden. He falls deeply in love with her.  At the end of the movie, the mystery that Al and William have been trying to solve for a long time is finally solved. It is a great way to end a decent movie and a good way to wrap up one of my favorite crime films of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to put a negative review for this movie, but then I went to watch it. I didn't want to see a bad movie. I don't see how this can be bad. The acting is pretty good. They use the scenery well, and I would like to see them make a movie in the U.S. or Australia (like it's done in The Adventures of Tintin). The music is a good piece. The best part is the part where the camera zooms out and you see the city of San Francisco.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a film that so perfectly captures a time when people weren't afraid to speak their minds in the face of public scorn.   It's a film about "political correctness", and the "liberal" movement that was so popular in America in the 1960s.  This film was made in 1969 at the height of the counterculture, and the characters all represent various sub-cultures:  I can't remember who was who in the movie, but a few interesting things occur.  There's an obvious attempt by the movie to be as politically incorrect as possible:  The movie is very much anti-establishment:  This is a story about a group of men who run the gamut between the liberal counterculture and a group who have decided they want to live according to strict principles:  As you might guess from the title, "The Producers" is a film of sorts:  Written by an ex-liberal (E. E. Cummings, the guy who wrote the very successful play "The Crucible" about the Salem witch trials), and directed by a man who used to work for John F. Kennedy, "Babe" is about a couple who decide to make an independent film about the anti-communist and anti-welfare state movements of the times.  The two of them, a middle aged couple, decide to film their own version of the musical "The Nutty Professor", only with a few liberal "problems" and some "carnies".   So, we have the characters:  John Bensley (Robert Mitchum) is a wealthy lawyer who runs an organization called "Carnivals of the Mind".  He's the head of the organization and is in a good mood, making the rounds in California.  He invites a group from California to his apartment, where they all talk about their lives and work, including the hippie and socialist personalities.  "B.B" (Alan Ladd) is the hippy, and is the most politically active of the group.  John has his head in the clouds and has a crush on the beautiful and radical Betty (Pamela Anderson).  Betty, of course, is in love with John, but not with B.B.  It doesn't take much for B.A. to discover that he is a "nut" who's totally insane.  B.D. (Alan Hale) is an intelligent liberal from New

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised that a movie of the 1980s is good.   The story is that a man is walking along a road with his new wife.  He is looking over his shoulder and he notices a small animal about the size of a dog.  The animal does not look particularly good, and his eyes are black.  After a bit of looking at the animal, he notices that the man in front of him is a bit odd in appearance too.  Then the man takes the dog for a walk and when he sees a strange man who is wearing a green leather jacket.  Soon after they begin talking about the strange events that have occurred recently in the area.  We never know who exactly is talking, and the man has some odd remarks.  Eventually the man tells the man who the strange man is, and how strange he was.  Finally they start to walk back to their home.  At one point the man asks his wife about the odd behavior of the strange animal.  She replies that the animal is a cat, and that he might have a problem with them.  There is no more dialogue, but we get a nice view of the small animal and his peculiar companion.  It is a well-directed movie, and it is entertaining to watch, even though the movie is fairly long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't remember if this is a sequel or a prequel, but it's a pretty good movie!   The action/sci-fi set-up of this movie is a little thin and the action scenes can be a little tiring, but I found myself really enjoying the action, and the romance as well.   As far as the story is concerned, you won't find any action sequences of great difficulty (with the possible exception of the final battle, which is more like a ballet performance than a battle), and there are a number of interesting character developments that take you through a good chunk of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie from the 80's that was made when it was the biggest hit of the year.   The whole plot is like a long train wreck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In many ways this is an excellent movie, with some excellent effects. The story is very good. However, the ending makes it all worth it, with a lot of fantastic imagery, such as a group of young people in Paris, the Paris of the future, playing a game of bocce (which is so very fun) at a very chic club, then the lights go out and the music stops, and suddenly they see the lights are now out everywhere. In the middle of it all is a girl who has a terrible accident in the subway. When the lights come back on she is standing in the middle with a group that includes a man and two women. They all look like dead people, so she is terrified. Then, we see the man die in front of her, and in an incredible sequence of events she escapes, and we are not sure if she went to an emergency room or not. Then we are back in the movie with the girl, who has to go back to her apartment to retrieve her computer. There, she finds a note, from someone who claims he wants to sell it. But the note is a fake, and the person who left it never came in, so the girl is determined to find out who it is. She does, and it's none other than her neighbor and lover, who died during World War II and who, in her dying words, says she loves her. He also mentions that he is in America (which I found out when I saw it) and that she will never see him again. She takes the computer from her neighbor's house, and she and her friend go to the airport to see if they can get a plane to America. It's a movie about loss, love, life, and all the things that you don't know when you are in a bad situation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So here's how this movie ends: the film follows a young man (Ben Foster) who gets a job at a private detective agency and is tasked with looking into the murder of a beautiful woman. While doing this, he begins to understand the inner workings of the private detective world and begins to suspect the motives of the dead woman's boyfriend (Drew Struzan), who is an ex-cop. The two men fall in love and Foster begins to learn about the private investigators and their methods of "catching" people.   I'll be honest, the movie was slow to start, but the slow pacing was more to show how this film could take place.  It was a very realistic portrayal of private detective work and how it works. As for Drew Struzan, his character was pretty weak and he wasn't much of a threat to Foster.  That being said, I was surprised how well this movie captured the spirit of a "private detective" movie: the way they used the camera and the background to draw out the emotions of the characters.  I think this movie has the potential to become a cult classic, but I don't know if it can get there.

He has an accident and he is left to die alone in a remote part of the world. He sets out on a quest to save his wife.   As far as the characters go, I liked the movie pretty well. It has all of the good elements that the movie should have: action, adventure, and a tragic hero. I also like the movie's premise: the man, in a kind of romantic, pseudo-Western type setting. It's all very similar to the movie, as far as I can tell. I wish that the director had added a bit more to the story; but, I guess that's something a movie does.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a bit of a popcorn movie buff, and I can't say enough about this one.   From its cast to its setting, from its story to its music, the story was absolutely hilarious and clever and yet still believable enough for me to enjoy it.  When the film opened, we saw the lead character (a guy with a terrible sense of direction) walking into a mall in the middle of the night wearing a wig and a bow tie.  He is seen by a few people, and when they ask him where he is from, he replies, "A very interesting city called Boston!"   While walking up to a group of people, the lead walks past a young man who he is clearly interested in.  Once the two are on the floor together, he says "You know I'm from Boston!" and "I'm a big Boston sports fan!"  The group of these two start talking about a local game called "Boston Massacre" (it's not like they aren't familiar with it already.)   Unfortunately, the game takes a turn for the absurd.  While a group is trying to get an audience with a famous movie star, they are caught in a traffic jam of a thousand cars!  They are told they are playing for charity.  Eventually, they pull off the highway and make it to a restaurant.  It is during this time, the movie ends with a commercial for a new ice cream flavor.  They walk in and sit down at a table and start eating their ice cream.  When they are finished eating, they ask the waiter if he has a coupon for free ice cream and he does, and says that they can have more if they like.  The waiter walks away, and the lead says that if the waiter ever calls him again and asks for more, he will have the waiter arrested!   It's really funny.  But what makes this so good is that the movie wasn't just that funny, it was so intelligent and thought provoking.  In the first scene, the leads meet a few men, one of whom they are told is a "Bomber" (i.e. a bomb maker.)  He tells them to meet a girl who he has never met before, but his bomb will kill everyone who tries to stop him.  So, the two talk with him for some time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As much as I love that movie, there are a few things wrong with it. There are some bad scenes and a couple of bad dialogues. But if you want to watch the movie about the man who became immortal in a bottle, then you can't really go wrong with this movie. I liked this movie a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't see how this movie is not at least a little better than the others.   The story is pretty dull, and there are very few interesting things going on.  I just find it really hard to enjoy anything that isn't set in the 1960's.  The action scenes are also kind of weak, and the whole movie is basically an endless parade of people getting shot up.  This is a really boring movie and I really don't think there is anything really to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie! It's an honest story about a man who loves a dog named Sissy. I was sad when he died at the end. I have a feeling he was trying to protect Sissy from a bad situation. I wonder if Sissy was a good dog to start with. He's only got a few good lines, but they're some great lines. It's a story about love, friendship, and loyalty. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great time, but not a lot of good to see.   When the last song comes on, we're all thinking, "What is going to happen?"   Then suddenly, a few minutes later, the last words of the first song come on.  But I'm surprised at how quickly we can change the channel to something different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's nice to see a young Tom Hanks   get a chance to do a lot of different things  . I thought I was just in an action movie  , and was so excited when I saw the final scene! Tom H akes such a fine job in it. I like the little things too.   I've read a lot about Tom H in the last 10 years... but that was all it took   to convince me to check out his next movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not much of a movie snob.   However,   My biggest regret is   that I didn't see this one sooner,  and it is    the kind of film you can watch in the morning, at lunch, during the evening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best films I've seen in a while!   The story is absolutely brilliant.   I'm not sure how many of us actually have the time or the patience to watch something like this every year, but if you haven't seen it this year, I'd urge you to make time to watch it now. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is not a single good scene in this movie. Not one.   I would like to say this movie has potential, but as a movie it just is not that good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well it looks like I won't be able to see this movie very often. This is a pretty good movie and I think it's a really good movie at that.   The film was made with a little less money than most movies and they made the movie in an old building in a small town in Arkansas.  When you're a little out of your league and want to have a good time you call up an old man in the bar.  I'm not sure if he's been drinking or if he really is that old.  He's got a little white hat and looks a little bit like a traveling salesman.  You look him up on the internet and learn his name is Charles T. Hall.  But there's a great movie here.  The actors are good.  There is a couple of sex scenes in here. It's pretty easy to figure out how this is going to go.  It starts out with a bit of comedy, but you get to know the characters and the story.  After the first couple of scenes it's all serious and a little dark.  This is fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad they're back in town   It's a different time now   But if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time, check this out   There's some good songs in here   If you're a fan of comedy you will like this   "Let the good times roll, we're in the golden age"   We'll get a chance to talk about this film again, because I just love it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as a kid in the 70's, and now as an adult, this movie is still really good.   This is my favorite movie and the only one I like.  I like the actors very much and their chemistry with the other characters is wonderful.  The music is very good too, the sound design is top-notch, and the cinematography is a perfect blend of old and new.  There are lots of action sequences in this movie and it has lots of good action scenes.  If you like action movies with great actors, then this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, and I'm surprised I didn't see it sooner.   It's very well done and funny (no more "Oof!" "What the !").   The story is not much to write home about, but the actors are great, the set, the costumes, the camera moves, and the dialogs are all good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing The Mummy (or The Muppet Mummy) for the first time I thought it was a big, over-the-top bad movie.   And I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling that way.  Yet the second time I watched the film I saw a completely different movie. Sure, there was no laughing matter in the film.  But the script, direction, and acting were all excellent.  As for the monsters, they are not so much over the top as over the head, and the movie never tried to hide its origins: the Frankenstein monster is a product of a mad scientist's mind, the Mummy's mummy is just another monster (although an even more repulsive one), and the Phantom Monster is a manifestation of the forces of death.  So while the movie itself may be bad, the movie is a good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After hearing about the original Japanese version ( which I never understood ), I had to see it in the U.S. The film is set in the old-school Western town of Chunk Lake, Wyoming, where the locals still remember the good old days. When a young boy, Wyatt Earp (Bruce Dern), and his sidekick Doc Holliday (Lance Henriksen) head to Chunk on a motorcycle, they encounter the town's sheriff, Earp's wife and Wyatt's mother. Doc Holladay has recently escaped from jail, and when Wyatt and Doc stop off to see him, he gets into a heated conversation with Earp and his daughter, Mary (Mia Wasikowska). When the sheriff arrives, the sheriff's daughter is murdered and Wyatt and his brother are charged with the crime. This is not a typical Western, in fact it's a parody of a typical western.   When I first heard the original cast, it seemed to me that the movie should be called, "The Original American Western".   The plot is that Wyatt Ear Puff, the main character, is a tough, self-made lawman who is willing to fight for justice but not when he thinks he has his man.  The original cast includes Bruce Dern as Wyatt EarPuff, Mia Wasikowski as Doc Hollady, Lance Henrikson as the Sheriff, and Robert Mitchum as the local sheriff's deputy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, if you like your sci-fi action packed with gun fights, then this movie will hit a lot of the right spots in terms of good sci- fi and bad bad-assery. The story is straightforward and easy to follow, though I felt like the last few moments were a bit anticlimactic. The bad-asses, especially the bad-assed android (played by a much better Robert Stack, a guy who can easily match the likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and the late, great John Boorman), look fantastic, and I enjoyed the bad guys' reaction to the "dismissal". And I am a sucker for space action.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I have not seen this movie yet but the trailer says it all!   This is a story about a woman who lives on an island, and has two sons who are twins.   One twin is called "Tiny", the other "Little".   Tiny and Little are best friends.  After a while, Little has a girlfriend, who is older than Tiny and she is a bit better looking than Tiny.  One night, Tiny and his mother go out to a club called "The Jungle", where Tiny is looking to find a woman to be with.  When they arrive, they see that the woman is much older than Little, and the two of them run out of the club together.  Tiny's mother finds him in the jungle.  In the jungle, Tiny has a run in with a guy named "Tiger", who is a drunk and has a mohawk.  Tiger makes fun of Tiny's mohawks and Tiny says that his mom thinks he is a girl, and Tiger says that Tiny can't talk to girls.  The two of these guys are very bad people, and when Tiny's mom comes back, she kicks Tiger out of their house, and sends Tiny home with Little.  Little wants to stay with Tiny's Mom, and they live together until one day they are walking along the beach and a shark attacks Tiny's Mother.  As a result of this attack, Tiny's Father dies.  Unfortunately, it is only a minor injury, and both the twins carry on living in the island.  They have a few romantic days together. Then, they are both attacked by a shark.  To protect Little, Tiny goes off in the water with the shark.     It seems that this movie is inspired by "Jaws", but the story is different. It is a little bit more "adult" and a lot more suspenseful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not sure what to expect from this one because, let's face it, the concept is silly.   But this is a fun and funny movie with a great cast.  The "cute" aliens in this movie seem to be made up of bits and pieces of different aliens (the most adorable are probably the blue creatures) from different movies: from the cartoon "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" to the science fiction flick "Dangerous Planet" to "The Thing"   The aliens are all fun and have a sense of humor that the average alien from another movie would not have.  It was a lot of fun and I like the aliens.  A movie like this should be shown to all the little kids at their babysitter's house so they will all like it.   1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw it on Netflix in September 2011, and I was disappointed because I don't like the movies that are so popular lately. I thought the movie was good, and it reminded me of the movie 'The Devil Inside' which was made in 1986. 'Mud' is a good horror film, but this movie doesn't deserve the popularity it has, and the director is making the wrong kind of movies and it's very boring. I'd recommend the director to try to make good horror films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been a long time since I watched a movie with a lot of blood and guts and suspense that made me jump out of my seat: it was like watching a big Hollywood movie with the special effects, the gore, and the actors, but this movie was way more brutal and more intense.   When a young girl is kidnapped and her sister has been killed, a young boy, a bounty hunter named Boba Fett, is sent to find them.  After tracking down Fett in a swamp where he has to fight a huge crocodile, Boba realizes that the kidnappers aren't the villains they are made out to be.  They kidnap a poor little girl, the daughter of an honest trader, and try to kill her to sell her into a brothel. The little girl's only hope is Boba, and to help him, he hires his childhood friend, a mercenary named Greedo, to protect her from the bandits.  Unfortunately for Boba and Greedo (and for the viewers) a large herd of wildebeests appears and take the girls away.  The girls aren't alone, they have a baby, a small dog, a big wolf-like animal, and a pair of baby raptors.  This movie really shows how great the prequels are, and how good all the actors in the film are:  George Lucas (Star Wars), David Prowse (The Rock), Liam Neeson (Logan's Run), Michael Ironside (The Terminator), Danny Glover (The Patriot), and William Hurt (The Last Jedi) are all great in this film.  I thought the characters were all well developed, and I loved the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie.   It has a good cast, good actors and a nice plot.  The thing I like about this movie is the ending.  But I want to talk about the movie. When we first start out, we see a little girl walking through the woods.  She sees a small car running across the road, and a young girl with a man, riding a horse.  The girl asks what happened to the girl who was riding the horse, and the man replies by saying that the little girl got lost.  A little girl runs after the car, and it stops at a bridge.  At this moment, a little boy jumps off and tells the girl that he loves her.  This is the start of the movie, and we are introduced to the family.  All of them are friendly, with the girl's father being kind and helpful.  He helps the girl find her horse, they have a conversation about a man and his son, and they all have fun.  I wish I could have loved this movie more.  We see a few scenes of the family, the boy and his parents, the girl and her mother, the little boy and the older boy who is in love with her, and all the other characters, the townspeople, the animals, and others.  It seems like a movie made by an Englishman, but it feels more like a film made in America, but in the 20s.  There are some great scenes in the movie: the little dog gets jumped and killed by a bear, the mother and her little boy fight, and everyone's happy.  They even have a scene in the woods where we see the little people and a dog together.  What I like the most about this film, is that it is very funny, very light hearted, and is very much a family film.  In fact, it is a kind of happy movie. In a way it is like a family that all goes to sleep, only to be woken up when the parents are killed by an accident. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the story of a boy named Adam. Adam has a friend named Noah. Adam is the kind of friend that is always there, even when you least expect him to be. One day, Noah gets kidnapped by aliens and he's never seen or heard from again. Adam's best friend, Adam, decides to try to find Noah. It takes Adam a long time to find him, but finally, after some trials, he finds Noah. As luck would have it, Noah has been hiding out in a storage room and Adam discovers that there are weapons in the storage room as well. Adam tries to save Noah, but Noah wants to save himself and escapes. Eventually, Adam gets back Noah and Noah tells him about the things he's done that he's most ashamed of. Adam asks Noah to come back to his friend and Adam does what Noah wants: he starts making a movie about Noah.    Recommended for teens, this is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a beautiful, slow-paced, sometimes humorous, but ultimately touching drama about a man who moves into an apartment building with a wife and infant daughter. The woman (played by the wonderful Meryl Streep) is the most sensitive person I've ever met. Her sadness is almost poetic, and she cries at a lot of moments in this movie. There are a lot scenes in this film in which the man's son is present. I was crying a lot myself when I saw this film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been watching the "Shadows" for quite some time now and it has never disappointed.   The cast has always been great and this movie has added some nice new characters to the mix. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know how it is, but I've never seen anything like this. It is the best kind of horror:  The film is directed by a well-known Polish director, Krzysztof Kieslowski, a genius of horror films who uses a lot of different techniques in his films.  The first one is a mixture of many different styles, from horror to fantasy.  Kiesllowki uses different camera angles, and sometimes he makes shots that are not only interesting, but also scary.  It has a lot to do with the strange way Kiesluwki takes his shots.   His films are very scary, but that is only part of it.  These are not the kind of films that leave you completely paralyzed.  They leave you with many questions.  But the best part of this movie is the ending.  As Kiesliwki said in the trailer:  This is not a movie about the supernatural,  It is a horror movie.  I think that the fact that it can be found at all, is a miracle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - There's a lot of jokes in this one. There's jokes about dogs. The movie plays like a cross between a western and a comedy: it's a good western and it's funny, it plays like it's made for people to get on their feet and laugh.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If this is one of those wonderful rare times in life when you know something is amazing, well, you don't know it until you've seen it.   I love all kinds of movies, but this is probably the only film I've seen that truly impressed me to such a degree.  It's about a guy who gets to be a good guy because his parents make him work on an underground subway system and his job is to make the trains run on time!   Well, that and some guy who talks with a French accent and uses the subways as a real-life Paris.  This is basically the perfect story of two men from different generations who want to be the first generation to enjoy the benefits of modern civilization.  I also love the fact that this movie is set in a subways tunnel, and how those trains really are like real trains.  A great movie, and a great way to see the real Paris.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, this is the same story as the first. You see a guy who has a very bad day and he has to go to the graveyard to kill someone. He has to kill a guy by breaking his neck and he also has to get some money from a dead guy that was a rich guy and he is able to get his hands on some things from his corpse. This guy is kind of a dickhead.   He can't find a place to sleep.  He wants to get to the cemetery at night and when he doesn't find any place to stay, he ends up stealing the body of another guy.  So now you have a guy that wants to kill some guy and gets some shit that he is not comfortable with and ends up killing somebody. This is a really interesting story and it is really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is about a man who has a dream of marrying a beautiful girl and having a beautiful family. However the girl is not his real wife and the family is not happy and his job is also not very good.    I was really surprised about this movie. I did not expect so much, it was very good, it showed the man who is very lonely and feels that his life is very ugly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I can say I gave this a go, not knowing what to expect, but I was so shocked I was laughing so hard I was crying for about a week. I was in the UK for a couple of years and I've always been a fan of British comedies. However, this is in a very good league. The story has a funny undertone, the cast are good, and the music is catchy. It was so funny that I had to cry a couple times. I don't really remember the first few minutes, but the ending is great!   I think I'm going to watch it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a wonderful movie from start to finish. It's a bit hard to appreciate a movie that is set in the Middle Ages when, according to some sources, this is the Middle ages. But there is an old man who makes a point of telling us what the past was like and how things were before the time of Christ. He has a wooden leg, which is why he is not able to do anything. The movie is set about a hundred years after the fall of the Roman Empire when a young man makes his first journey to a city called Byzantium (the first in the west.) The city is in the grip of a terrible plague that kills people almost at random. The young man falls in love with a young woman, an older woman named Eunice (Margot Kidder). He meets Eunace's daughter, a young girl who is called "the Angel of the Lord." The film is wonderful. It has a lot of humor, some love and compassion and some very good acting. It is not for the weak-hearted.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie.   From what I read online, the director was influenced by the "sensation" from a book by Richard Matheson.  There are several people who are trying to get rid of something from their minds.  They are all having hallucinations and then they all turn to the person who had created the hallucinations.  He is trying to destroy them but can't get any farther than getting rid of the hallucinations from each person and one woman.  I like it and will continue to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a world full of violence, horror and chaos, there's a special place in my heart for the good guys.   The action in this film is very good, and we get to watch the bad guys get destroyed by good guys, who just happen to be a gang of young kids.  This film is a good time, and if you're looking for a good action film, I'd look no further than this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very good. It has great plot, great character, great special effects, and lots of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those "so bad it's good" movies that would be funny if it didn't work so hard.   I had seen this about a year before I started doing my own writing.  This movie is based on a novel of the same name by Joseph L. Mankiewicz.  Mankiewicz has been nominated for a Hugo Award as well as an Obie and a Nebula for his work.  It's a dark, strange little story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The whole movie is like a big ole slice of life. It follows two college kids in their search for love and adventure. The movie is filled with comedy, and even though you could see it coming, you still get a laugh out of it. There's no romance in this movie but they do get together at the end, and it's great to see them again after so long.   There's a movie about a boy named Ben (I think he's the best name ever) who gets into lots of trouble, and then falls in love. I haven't seen a movie this good since Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie was in the early 80s. This is still one of my favorites, and I think it's a little overrated.   While a little slow at times, it is a great tribute to a man who, when he wasn't traveling with his troupe of magicians, was the main attraction of the carnival circuit.  In the early days, he had a reputation as a con man and a trickster, but that's about all that's known about him.  Even his final act was a little far fetched.    While we don't really get to know him in his later years, his life and work is a fascinating subject.  The movie itself is well put together.  There were some goofy moments, but this is a pretty good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good family movie that does not spend a lot of time with the main character or the family, instead it takes a lot from these minor characters and gives them their time in the spotlight.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie about two years ago.   A small but charming little movie that does a good job of making me laugh out loud.  A little bit of a sad movie about an old man who goes on a journey across America and has to go back to his wife who is a widow.  It's a story about love and a love that's worth waiting for.  I've been watching old western movies in my spare time ever since I saw them in high school and the ones that I've seen in the last three or four years, seem to be the more romantic ones.  The music is very good and the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but the movie itself is very well made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins as a typical action movie with lots of explosions and fast-paced gunfire. The villain, the "bad guy," and the "strong guy" meet up in a cave and begin shooting at each other. The bad guy goes down, but the good guy is able to shoot him through the head (which is actually really cool). After this, things calm down. There is a sequence with a little boy (Curt Schilling) and his father that is amusing to watch.   I really like the idea of a child getting his father's old pistol (used in a movie called the Dirty Dozen) and making him a bad guy.  What really makes this movie a good action movie is the cool action sequences. The action scenes here are really fun and imaginative.  If you enjoy action movies like I do, this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       One of the best films of 2014.   (   ) The plot is so good and well written, that I was so surprised that this film does not get less than a 100 on a scale of 10, since it was so good from beginning to end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always thought that there were only a couple of good movies made from the late 80's up to around 1994.  I'm not going to say that The Last Samurai (1989) is the best movie ever made, because it's a lot better than that.   In this version of the story, Japanese Emperor and his son are sent to a far off island to avenge their grandfather's death.  The setting of the movie is somewhat realistic, even for the time period.  Even though we have a lot of violence, the movie has a good balance of humor and heart.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a very deep meaning.  This is a very well made movie, and is a great example of how to make a "tear-jerker" movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not your normal Hollywood movie and it certainly is not the typical movie you've seen so many times. It is a real Hollywood movie. I'm not talking about the high comedy, which you've come to expect. I want to talk about the real Hollywood Hollywood.   We meet the most powerful and famous people in the movie world (Marlon Brando, Steve McQueen, John Wayne, Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart). The movie takes place during the Prohibition era and the movie shows that all these stars are still working hard. I believe they are working on a real project. I loved how the characters and the screenplay were so realistic.  It is funny and at times, a little shocking.  A bit like the film, I remember the exact days the movie takes.  When I saw the movie, I had a flashback in my mind of my visit to the movie theater.  I have seen many films and there are definitely better ones than this.  I have seen this movie three times and each time, I have watched it again with fresh eyes and my eyes are always moist and my heart has a big smile. I love it and I wish you will see it also.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the opening scene, a big crowd of people are assembled in front of a statue that is holding up a huge banner with the words "Farewell to a Hero of Our Time". There are several people kneeling around the statue, holding their heads in their hands and weeping. All the people who are kneeling around him, holding his head in their arms are crying because they are so sad that he is gone.   It was really powerful and moving and a true testament to how a person can change the world. I had a hard time watching it, the movie had a lot of stuff that was hard to watch at first, but then you realize that it is not about the movie itself, it is about the people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original "Jurassic Park" was an instant classic. I mean, come on, the opening scenes are still a bit freaky: a dinosaur stalks a little girl, a park full of scary-looking dinosaurs and a creepy-looking, talking triceratops. It was so successful, it's still being used in school to this day, even though the original's release was in 1993. This remake is better, especially because it stars the man who played the original, Richard Attenborough.   I'll never forget how I sat transfixed as the little girl got chased by the dinosaurs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first time I've watched a film that I was really excited about, and it did a lot of the things it set out to do well: it showed the dangers of a world where people don't take their responsibilities as seriously as they should, it showed how much we all need to learn about the human condition, and how important it is that our society is kept moving forward.   In my opinion, the best thing about this film, is the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There are two kinds of people in this world; those who have seen it, and those who haven't."   I have been a fan of the 1970's action movies since I was a kid. My father bought me my first VHS player when I was ten. I had an aunt who loved them so much she would let me watch them. I still remember the cover of a movie I saw once where all the cars in the film crashed into each other.     The "Bad Boys" movies are my favorite movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the old horror films, the movies of the seventies and eighties, or the movies in the 1990s or 2000s, you should go out and see this.   The director, Robert Bloch, makes good use of the old techniques, though in a more traditional horror way than what you would expect.  I would highly recommend it to fans of the period, but to new audiences too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I would see the day where I would get to see a live action version of one of my favorite films, "Rumble Fish".   The movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic town.   There are a bunch of characters who are all trapped in this apocalyptic world.  A little girl has been taken in by one of these people who are called "Boys".  The Boys are the most mischievous and fun-loving people who you could ever meet.  Once the world outside became a lot darker, these people have decided to make a living off of the world being dark.  The story follows two of these Boys as they travel through the dark town trying to find a way back home.  I really liked the character of Mr. Brown.  He's one of the sweetest and most well-intentioned Boys I have ever met.  One day Mr. B is taken in on the advice of the Boys to train as a Wrestler.  At first I thought this was a great idea.  Mr.Brown does everything perfectly.  But then things start to go wrong...   The Boys in the film (left to right):  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really a little bit of a classic in my mind.   It is just a beautiful piece of art.  You would expect a big Hollywood production to feature lots of actors and special effects, but this is not at all what you see on the big screen.  Instead you get a beautiful story of a man, a little boy, and a dog named Daffy who live in a house in the woods.  Daffyd is very shy and afraid of people, but when he meets a little girl, Daffyy goes from being a timid little boy to one of the most endearing children ever.  I think the best thing about this film is its ability to keep the viewer from wanting to leave the theater.  The story is told through the eyes of the little boy and Daff.  It really puts a smile on your face.  If you have any interest in film then this is a must see.  This is a little movie that I found really cute!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good, clean and enjoyable movie!   It has a lot of great scenes: one scene in which the hero is so drunk that he is out of his head (I thought that was an amazing part), another where the hero has a nice chat with his wife, and the third has the hero in a horrible situation where he has to pull a gun out of a bag and shoot the bad guy because he is in his home. It's a funny, fast, action packed, enjoyable and enjoyable film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't watched   the film  yet you should!   This is a very interesting film.   The film is about a young man who has an obsession with a woman that he calls "the Princess."   She lives with her mother and her family are servants to the royals and her father has a small house in the country.  She is an older girl and very shy.  This leads the young man to meet a young girl who is interested in him.   Her name is Dorothy.  It was interesting to see the film with this character.  While I was very interested in the film, I didn't quite like it.  The story didn't have a lot of momentum.  I felt that the film did a good job of creating a sense of mystery and it was interesting that the man who is obsessed with Dorothy does have a passion for horses.  One thing that I did like was that the young couple were attracted to each other.  Also, the young people that worked in the house looked like teenagers.  These two characters were very appealing to me.  I enjoyed   this film very much! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, a movie that is more about "good versus evil" than any story about human struggle.   I'm not going to discuss it very much in detail because that's not how it was intended to be seen, but the point was to make people feel bad about themselves.  Yes, there's a character who acts like an evil dictator in the movie, but it's played by a child.  I felt sorry for him because he did horrible things to his children.  It makes me very sad that the kid could be so evil that he could cause this pain and suffering to innocent people.  This movie also makes it very clear that the villains are always evil, not just the bad guys.  There's a reason why the story is told in flashbacks.  In the movie itself, there is no need to show a lot of pain and pain that the people suffer because that wouldn't be realistic.  No, the scenes are just used for a reason; to show that bad things can happen to good people, and if you don't look at the past with care, you'll never know.  So, yes, this is a movie about bad things happening to good person, and it is absolutely horrifying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was well made and I think the actors did a fine job. I don't think I've ever been a fan of the whole X-Men world so when this movie came around I thought "well that is my kind of X-MEN" I'm glad they did it this way rather than trying to make a movie about mutants and make it a more popular thing to do I mean it's not like anyone saw any X-Movies or even knew who mutants were let alone why they needed to become superheroes and have to do this thing that no normal person could go through but it's interesting I did feel like they were a little too into their own world which is to say not even in a good way not in the best way at all and I did have the same feelings about the X-men as I do when I see a comedy or a movie that doesn't do anything but try to be cool and try to get on everybody's nerves and to try to make something so much like a comedy and make sure it looks and feels like a funny movie to me it just felt like a lot of people were trying to do something that wasn't funny or anything to my taste and to make them look like cool guys and be a good example for the rest of the people who don't have anything better to do with their lives and to be a role model for kids not like their dads who they saw a lot and I didn't think that was good for kids but I'm not gonna criticize a movie for trying to be something that isn't something it's doing a good job at being what it's trying to become but I do feel like it had some problems and that's why it didn't become a huge hit or be big and it probably would have had more if they didn't try to use a lot old school footage but if they wanted to make an X-movies this movie would have been perfect for them to do it but I guess that's a good thing since it's a movie they would not need to make another one of in a long time and they might not need another X-man at all but if you don't like that movie it probably isn't worth seeing or buying or renting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is a good film for teenagers. The movie has a very funny, innocent, and touching story about a boy that has been left in the care of his older brother, who thinks he is stupid. The boy, his friends, his father, and all other people around them, come to see the older brother play and play, and have fun, and enjoy life. But when they all get together at the end, the older boy is missing, and the boy does not know why. The whole film is set up like a fairy tale. One day, after the older brothers play, they will meet a beautiful lady who will help them become adults, and get to live a good life. The two boys and their friends find this lady and give her a tour, and are amazed at her. Then she disappears and the boys think their mother, who also lives with them, is the lady, and is also missing. The story is told with a very gentle, quiet, and charming style. If you watch this movie on a good night, your eyes will be opened to a very special film about a young boy who wants to get away from a sad and lonely childhood and who must help his friends overcome the loneliness and find their real parents.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First and foremost,   The movie is NOT a very good film;   but,  it is an excellent movie.   There are times I feel as if I'm in a very well-crafted film and the writing is top notch,  with a lot of clever dialogue, which keeps things interesting,  as well as a plot twist that keeps you on the edge of your seat  .   While I've never seen a film with a plot as good as this one,  I'd say  it's a good choice to see in the theater;  it certainly adds some extra entertainment to the film's already pretty good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film, and the story, are about a young couple who were working as a couple on a farm that they owned together. One day the wife gets up from a nap and decides that she is going to go get some coffee and they go out. When they come back they see that the barn door was left wide open. The husband tries to go in and stop her, but she gets in the wagon with the two dogs (one is a yellow tabby, one a black German Shepherd). The husband gets in with the dogs, and there is an argument about the husband getting in with them. Then the wife starts to drive off in the wagons. The husbands screams at her to stop and she starts to pull away from the vehicle, then turns around and drives back in again. When the husband drives off, the wife jumps on the driver's side, runs up the hill, and stops at a dead end. Her husband is screaming in the background.   After the husband is shot, she runs to the neighbor's house, where a police officer is coming down the hill. He is on the phone with a 911 operator. He looks back, then back at the two of them, then sees that the husband's body is in the path of the oncoming train. She is able to get off the train, and takes off on foot and runs to another neighbor's home. She tries to tell the neighbor what has happened and how the husband was trying to protect her from the on going train, then runs off again. There is another police officer on the other side of the neighbor. The cop is looking for a missing man, but the woman has a different story.  They both make it back to the barn, and they have a long talk. They talk about the incident in a room.  The next morning the husband shows up in the hospital. He goes in looking very dazed, as if he hasn't been asleep very long. He tells the wife about the last thing they talked about and how he was trying not to get in the way, and she tries to give him a hug. But he pulls away from her and runs off into the fields. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about a man who falls in love with a woman and wants to marry her. The two go on a date at a hotel where he finds that the lady is a bit of a flirt and makes a few mistakes. This movie isn't overly dramatic, though. It is quite enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really surprised when I heard that a movie was being made about a group of friends that went to a rave (well, the rave as it was called in Britain) when I was a kid. It was in the late 1980's, which was around the time I was going to the same rave on a regular basis. I was amazed to hear that it was actually shot in the 70's.   The story of the movie is really interesting.  The story is about how a group called The "Dance Company" became really popular around the world in the early 1970's. It used to be a group just for party people but it has become an all-encompassing dance company, which has become a huge business.  The Dance Company is the most famous of the dance companies, but is also one of the biggest. The film was produced by the BBC and it is available on DVD in the UK.  The film is about a young girl who was there in the 1970's and was there with her dad, an English man and his friends.  It is a story of love, friendship and growing up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    1. The music is catchy and the whole movie is made to look like a dream.   The film follows a little boy who is lost in the woods. One night a strange man appears before him and teaches him the value of money and how to enjoy life.  He gives the boy a gun that can only be loaded when it is fired. It fires a shotgun that can go through all kinds of things.  After the boy kills a bear with his new gun the boy is brought to the house of a rich man. The rich man is a crazy old man and is insane.  This makes the film even more surreal.  2. There are two parts to the movie: the first part shows the boy playing around in the forest. In the second part the boy gets captured by a crazy man and he is put in a mental hospital.  In the mental hospital the boy starts to think he is a man called John Smith.  The main idea of the film is that all of the things that happen to the boy during his time in the hospital is all a dream because the film has no actual reality.  When the film ends the boy wakes up in his home and thinks his dream. The man who kidnapped him also appears in the house.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie.   It's a slow build.  What is it? It's not a film by someone who wants to sell more movies.  It is by someone that wants to make a better movie. And yes, he's got good actors, and is well respected by his peers.  Now to the bad part.  First the acting.  I was surprised at some points by the acting of some of the main roles. Some of them had more depth in their performances than I have ever seen.  But the real bad part was the cinematography.  Some of the sets were beautiful, like the castle. But the rest, especially the sets, were just plain ugly.  They don't have enough space in this movie to build a castle, or other interesting things.  So, it's kind of hard to believe that the story is about a knight that goes into the forest and finds a girl who is lost in a cave.  If the story had been done better, it could have been a really good movie. But, as it is, I really didn't think it was as good as it could be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The movie has a lot of "feel good" moments.   I'm surprised the film got an M rating when it's about a guy trying to find a woman to be his wife and having to get around a lot to keep his sanity.  I loved it.  It had some pretty good laughs in the beginning.  At the end the plot gets pretty crazy, but that doesn't hurt it too much because at least the characters are a lot more likable than most films at the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies where you watch it and say, "I could have done that". It is a good example of the kind of movie that could be made by a small studio with good story and good production values (this is a very good studio).   In the beginning of the film we see a woman who has been married to a man for 30 years. One day she runs away to another man in order to get away from the wife. She takes a bus to her new home (that is really not hers) and falls asleep. The next day her husband finds her and she tells him that she did it to get out of her husband's clutches. After a while the husband tries to convince her that the bus wasn't hers. After he and the other man argue she flees.   But then things go from bad to worse. The movie is filmed in the style of a Japanese film, but with a Western sensibility. One thing is a bit odd: The woman never mentions having been married before.  It's really not clear how this woman could have gone to school and gotten a university degree and not know any Japanese men. But we will never know.  I enjoyed the movie, it was pretty funny (especially the part where a bus driver loses his mind and shoots a bus full of women), and well worth seeing if you want to see a funny and moving film in the vein of Blazing Saddles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting a good film from the director; that much I can attest to.   The story of "A Tale of Two Sisters" is, indeed, very much like the old stories that were told to me as a child.  They are very beautiful, but not very romantic.  The brothers live in the countryside and they go out in their buggy to fetch water.  At one time, one sister gets drunk and a fight begins.  Then the brothers return home and find their sister dead.  This is not a film I will be able to rewatch often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good example of the genre, as well as the use of a small cast, as we all have something to say about the situation.

With the exception of the villain, and his lack of any moral reasoning, this film is solid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film about the Holocaust, but with a very slight Jewish twist.   It is about a group of young Jewish girls who are sent to the ghetto, only to be rescued by the Nazis as they enter. It is quite different to the usual movie fare:  I never understood the fascination people seem to have for Nazi atrocities and crimes against humanity.  Even more fascinating to me is the fact that we are presented with such a film. It seems very real:  In this film a group (we assume) of young girls are sent into the ghetto by a sympathetic Gestapo officer (played by Klaus Kinski). They are then forced to stay there for a few weeks until the arrival of the next shipment of girls.  Their plight is sad:  They have been locked up from the outside in a two-room house, while the Nazis have taken over the rest of the ghetto:  The girls are forbidden from going outside, and are treated like prisoners. They have to eat a kind of bread that is nothing but flour mixed with water, and there is no toilet paper:  Their lives are like a play:  One is constantly reminded that they are children, and that they must obey their parents:  But it's difficult to do so as the Gestapo keeps them under constant surveillance. They are under constant guard from the Gestapos (they call them Gestapo), and we watch them through the eyes of a sympathetic officer (Marius Brand in this film), as they wait in the ghetto while the next batch of girls is being sent in.  It's not easy for the girls to wait in this horrible place.  But at the end, a Jewish girl (played beautifully by Mariel Hemingway) is allowed to be in the house for a while with the girls. She is very lonely and she decides to stay with them until the girls have arrived.  What follows is a series of happy reunions and memories between these girls and their rescuer (he was an officer in the SS, and the Gestaperos were his men).   I found this film very moving:  And I thought it was also sad: A little more about this film:  This film was made in Germany by the German director (and actor) Kurt Weidemann.  The director was a real Nazi sympathizer and he did a good job portraying Hitler and the Nazis in this picture. The film was shot in the early summer of 1940, with
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm usually not a huge fan of movies about children's books. In a lot of the recent movies about kids books, the young actors or characters are simply in a group scene talking about their day, a boring and dull scene. Not this movie. In this movie, the actors are all good, all the children are well acted and the story is moving, the kids are well behaved, and it's all very cute and fun.   The movie begins with a small boy named Tom in a field, playing with a little dog. As he runs by a small house, the door flies open and a boy comes in, wearing a blue shirt with a white shirt underneath, with a smile that's always a little too big, and a little man with a long face and a long black mustache, named Mr. Fox.  Mr.Fox says hello to Tom, and Tom is very happy.  The next day, Tom, who is very shy and has a lot to learn, is playing in the grass when he runs into Mr.O.B. (I can't remember his last name). He says hello and Tom plays with him.  Tom tries to play along and pretend that he's a boy, but Mr. O.B laughs at him, and says to Tom that he has a big penis.  When Tom gets angry at him Tom doesn't seem to know what to do so Mr. Big has to tell him that he should just let it go and keep it small so that Tom can be happy.    Next, Tom meets Mr.T. (Tom's friend), who tells Tom that the girl he likes, Missy, has a boyfriend called Mr.F. (also called Mr Fox).  It is obvious that this girl doesn't like Mr. F. because he is always giving her kisses in a place where they cannot see each other, in a bedroom, and when they do, Mr.Big laughs at them.  So Tom leaves, and Mr. T. goes with him and a dog. Mr. H. (Mr. O.'s brother) is also with them and is looking at Mr.I. (his sister) with a very ugly expression, who in turn is looking back at Mr, T.  While Tom goes to school, Mr Fox starts to try to find out why Mr F. is making Tom mad. Mr Fox finds a book that makes Tom mad and takes it to Mr F., who
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that really bothers me about this movie is the fact that there are so many different people in it.   It has a lot of different actors in it, and if you really watch the movie you'll find some great ones in there too, but there's a LOT of stuff that you could do with less characters in it and that's what really bothers the hell out of me.  There is too much going on.  A lot of the things that are happening are just ridiculous.  It's really a bad movie.  The acting is the worst in any movie I've ever seen.  This movie is so bad it's stupid.  I've been to movies where a girl has her finger broken by a big, bad man and I've laughed at it. This movie has so much wrong with it I'm almost in tears at times.  At one point in the movie I saw this kid being carried around and I knew right away it was a little boy.  So this kid just comes in there and all he does is cry.  They really make it all so easy for him to cry. And they make it even easier for me. I thought for sure I would have to sit through this again in a while because it's such a bad idea and so bad of a movie. It's so boring and unoriginal and I think I was just tired from watching it and the acting just ruined it. I could have been better with my life but then again, I don't have a life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'll admit, the movie didn't blow me away. In fact, it did something that you might expect from a cheesy 90's movie: it was filled with so many "gags" and so much cheap, cheesy and dumb-assed dialogue, that I honestly didn't have a clue what was going on. And I'm not just talking about the characters. I'm talking about that entire movie.   The best example is when two of the female lead characters, and my favorites, Mandy and Holly, are in a bar. After talking about how Holly will never be as good at what she loves as Mandy is, she tells Mandy how much she loves it when Mandy can get down to her level. In other words, she's trying to be a hot babe and trying to get into the good graces of her two best friends. It's a very short conversation, but it shows what these characters are like in the movie. They act like idiots and have a hard time even knowing how to do things like kiss or talk about their love lives.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a nice movie about a little boy with a big heart.    He had to grow up in a town of poor people, but he loves them and gets along with them all.    He gets to play with his toys, get a ride in a little car, go to school, see the movies, get an allowance from his mother, and have fun with his friends.  His mother always makes sure he has fun, as well.  The mother of one of his friends is named Mildred, and she's a sweet woman.  Mildred's little dog, Buddy, lives at home, but it was a tough town, and the people in the town didn't get along.  But the boy had a big, bright heart. He always wanted to help people, and he tried to help everybody.  He was a good kid.  Some of the people he met were his old schoolfriends, as a matter of fact.  It wasn't very often that he went to school.  Sometimes he was supposed to be playing, and they were supposed to come.  A little boy from the same town came to see the boy.  They had a lot of trouble with a boy named Bob.  Bob was a little bit crazy, but his mother was there to protect him.  While they had a little tiff, they agreed to play and go home.  There is a movie scene about that, in which Mildred shows the boys the old schoolroom and they see their old friends.

It is about a man who has an attraction to a woman and he finds out that her name is not "Ella" but "Sebastian" which is her middle name and the movie doesn't really explain who Sebastian is. I loved that there is an evil twin in the movie and a beautiful little girl who is really sweet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was thoroughly enjoying the "War of the Worlds" movie and didn't realize this was a remake until I got home.   This is a wonderful remake.  It's an amazing story and well told.  I wish the movie was longer but the story is so great that it doesn't matter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of the film Alien, and while I would have loved to see it in full 3D, the actual theatrical release had the right tone for the film to work within the confines of the small theater, where it could be enjoyed by all. It's a story about the survival of a young scientist, who is sent to an alien world to work on the creation of a vaccine for the plague that is spreading through the land. In the course of his studies, the young scientist is captured by a strange creature called the Xenomorph. The Xenomorph is an alien species that is, by all reports, in constant combat with our own species, so the Alien is a dangerous animal on the battlefield, and its survival is a priority for the scientist who has been assigned to lead the defense. With the assistance of a small group of humans, the scientist is able to overcome the xenomorph, and is able (or rather, has to) fight back and defeat the creature, which leaves the scientist trapped. We get an interesting story of the scientist trying to find some way to save his life while the other human team members are going to war. I also like how they use the music in the film: it reminds me a lot of the soundtrack to The Abyss, which was also a fantastic film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in the mood to watch a good horror movie today (well, that's a lie, my boyfriend was in it, and it was good). I found it much less horrific than some of the other terrible movies I've seen over the past few years, mostly because the pacing is so good.   In the beginning of the film, we see a boy running through the woods in an abandoned house, trying to get to a phone. The boy, who is named David, is a very sad and broken little boy, and he can't seem to find his way home. David is running for his life, desperately trying to not get caught and found out.  The house is dark, and David is covered head to toe in some sort of nasty mold.  One of the girls is walking down the hallway, and she makes a little noise and goes back into the bathroom. When David enters the bathroom, his hands are tied, and his head is covered with a towel.  He is in a very uncomfortable situation, but he is lucky he got out before the girls saw him.  Then we see David's mother standing there with some flowers in her hand. The girl says that the flowers will help David. David says he doesn't like flowers, and then he says that his mother is right.  We follow David into the kitchen, and we see the boy crying, and trying to eat a bag of chips that a girl has left him. He tries to say that he doesn...well, it's unclear exactly what he's saying.  I feel bad for the poor boy, but I like that this is a good story. David gets a phone call and hangs up, and the next thing we know he's in a hospital, in the body of a 10-year-old boy.  The boy's mother asks him what's going on, and all David can do is cry and whine.  David's mom tries to get him out of the hospital, but when she doesn't, she calls the police.  When the cops show up, they find that the body that they found in the house is a little boy's body.  They then follow the phone calls from the house and find out that the girl David left the chip bag for is the one who made the calls.  That girl is being held in a mental hospital (where the police are going to pick her up), and she's very scared of David.  This story
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic. This movie, like most classic movies, shows the "best" part of a good, or at least a good-enough, movie. The movie is based on the true story about the death of one of the greatest generals of all time (played by Richard Widmark). The movie also contains a lot of other great scenes which are not shown on the screen. The story is well-written. It's interesting and original. The characters are well-defined. The movie doesn't disappoint in every aspect. The ending is pretty good too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I always said that this movie was about the whole of India and the one story about Amrit (who is a Brahmin from a poor village who meets this English professor who teaches the whole world how to eat beef) is just about the most gorgeous, poetic and profound speech about India I have seen.   I saw this on the big screen and I was like  .   So gorgeous, so poetic...   This movie is about the journey of a Brahman from his humble beginnings and his journey towards becoming a great scholar.  He is very wise and very brave and his speech about the importance of food and how the world can benefit from this love between man and his food is truly beautiful.  I had to watch the movie about two more times and I have to say that this is one of the best movies ever made.  Thank you to Peter Fonda for the movie and to India for letting us all know so much about the beauty and richness of Indian food. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie where you need to know someone who is really a good guy to understand what is going on. He is a friend and his name is "W.A." which means "The Ace" or "The Winner". W.A. is a guy who likes to drink, and he always has some great drink on him, but in this movie he drinks a bunch of shots. There is a lot of action in this picture, and the guy plays with explosives as well. The action scenes are quite good, and they are done in a funny way. W.B. is an evil character but he really is good hearted. The picture reminds me a lot to "The Godfather" but without the gangsters and murders. This movie shows how some guys can change their ways, and it shows how we can too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fine performance and a satisfying ending to a long series.   The cast is pretty good, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are all very good.  This film is, perhaps, a bit of a throwback to films of old.  It is, indeed, a little goofy. But it is also a nice example of how to shoot a film that is fun to watch, and also a good example of why film is a form that is very often underestimated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this film, at the cinema, because I wanted to watch something which would be in the same league as "The Usual Suspects" but with the plot being much more sophisticated. The only thing I disliked was the ending, because of the abruptness of the ending (I'm not a big fan of "spoilers" in films), but overall it is a very good film.

I'm a huge Star Wars fan.  It's a movie that is set in a time where technology was advanced and there were new spaceships to see. The main character is the guy who is responsible for building these spaceships. His name is Han Solo. He is a smuggler who goes out to find the Millennium Falcon, a ship that was built by Luke Skywalker (Obi-Wan) and his family. It was a spaceship that Han piloted when he was a boy and it was stolen from him when he became an old man. He eventually gets it back from the bad guy.  He meets up with Luke, who has also been trying to get the Falcon back from that bad guy (Kylo Ren). There are a couple of great supporting characters in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of 2014:  "  "I'm still trying to figure out if this movie is a documentary or a documentary about a documentary.   It seems to be both in that this is a very well-written and researched film that takes a long, detailed look at the history of the "Cult of the Dead Cow," a cult that has existed for years in which members are made to take part in an intense, day-in, day out ritual of sacrificing dead cows to the sun.  The film seems to follow the lives of the four young men who are on the frontlines of the cult while attempting to rescue members of the group from the cult by force.  It is also a very good looking film as it is packed with beautiful photography and a great soundtrack that sets the mood for a very dark and disturbing movie.  I give it a perfect 4.0 out of 5 stars."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like action-comedy and don't mind watching a movie that is more or less like a film, then this movie will probably please you.   This is a movie about a man who is a good businessman who has to deal with a group of thieves who are stealing his cash and the main character, the "good guy" manages to stop the whole gang.  A little movie that has a lot to say about good business people, good luck and bad luck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those great "weird" comedies. In it, Bill Murray plays a doctor with a strange habit.   He can see things that no one else can.  He is a "skeleton hunter" who has no problem with his creepy obsession.  In the movie, he has a very odd assistant named Miss Noggin.  Miss Noggins is a very pretty girl who loves to play hide and seek, but Bill is afraid of her, and she is afraid, too.  Noggingon has a habit of turning into a hideous creature (skeleton, I mean).   There is a lot of humor in the movie.    It has a sort of "comedy of errors" quality to it.  It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never been to a film this bad before!   The story is so bad and stupid that I had to pull my hair out.   A man goes to a town in China that only has two cars. One is a truck that has a huge flatbed. It can hold 20 people in a row.  It's a city with a few people, so the people don't drive their cars. They ride them.  The bad part of the movie: The guy on the back of the truck looks like a fat, hairy man.  What a stupid movie.  This is the worst film in my life.  I'm done with this crappy movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of films of this type have a "joke-like" plot and the "bad guy" is funny.    While this film is funny at times (most of the time), there is a "big story" in this movie.  This "story" is not very good at all, but I'm willing to give a "crap" film a chance.  For a movie with a "Jokes-like-Plot" I don't get much of a good story in this film.  I am not sure what happened in this "story".  What I do understand is that the "story-teller" (which I don 't believe is called a "storyteller") is having trouble in writing the story.  He is just making up funny stuff for the film. The "story line" seems to be an "explosion" with a big explosion at the end of the film, and that is all that is going on.  The "Explosion" is just a bad, bad idea!  This film is filled with jokes.  There is no plot in this.  A "storyline" is something that the characters tell, and it does have a plot (and some character development in this part of the story), but this is only a small part of what is going in the film!  There are no characters that seem to have any "real" life problems.  They all are in the same predicament and are trying to get through to some guy named "the Bad Guy".  I wish the story would have been more complete.  But at the same time, a film like this that has a big "story", is better than a film with a bad plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great family film. The kids are all fine as is. I'm a big fan of the old Disney movies and this is one of them. This movie is very well done.    Rated 5 out of 5 by TK from A good family movie This movie has some good laughs and some good family humor. This is a family movie in the truest sense. I don't know if you can get more family-friendly than this. I like how this movie doesn't have a story. It doesn't really need one. I liked the scene with the dogs.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is a classic (the great director John Huston had just finished a film called The Outlaw Josey Wales about the infamous outlaw) which I had a lot of fun with. It takes place in the 1870's and is about a group of brothers who have lost their father and their mother in a horrible road accident. Their father is a very big character who is always around talking about his adventures in the wilderness. The story takes place on a plantation and there are lots of interesting locations such as the beautiful Louisiana bayous, the rolling hills and the huge oak grove at the end of the movie. It is a wonderful adventure story which is a shame it never made it to the big screen.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't say much about this movie, other than to say it is good.   The first half is really good, very well done, I was impressed with the quality.  We see a group of people in the mountains. I was a little surprised that there were no scenes of them doing stupid stuff.  After an accident, they are taken to a hospital. There, they see a woman who needs a heart transplant. The hospital is in the middle of a hurricane and their room is in a tunnel. When they wake up in the morning, they find that they are still alive.  It starts off good, but then turns to bad as the movie reaches it's climax.  This movie is made of a lot of things.  First, it is a film about a group being stranded in the hills for an extended period of time.  Second, it seems like a story about a couple who fall in love.  Third, it deals with the theme of "fate" and who you are stuck with.  Fourth, it's about heart transplants.  Fifth, it takes place in a hospital, where a woman is dying.  Sixth, it has a theme of a man who is stuck with a woman he loves.  Seventh, it presents a very unusual idea about what it is like to be stuck in a hole in the ground.  The last half of the movie deals with a group who are all forced to deal with the reality of their situation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was really fun to see some good old friends in this film. I wish they would do a lot more comedies, the ones they have done so far seem really lame, they didn't even put any effort into it and it really sucks, they need to do more to make the movie any better.   And I mean suck:  So, I have a friend who is a bit of a bad boy. I like to be mean to people and he's always trying to make fun of the people I like... not the right words, but it works. One day he comes over to see how I'm doing and then tries to kiss me. I'm not really into that sort of thing so I say, "Stop trying to kiss my friend, I hate that sorta thing". He tries to say it's not a bad thing... but that's exactly what I think. He comes back a few days later and asks to go out and have a beer, I say "No, I don't really drink beer". I try to explain to him that I don' t drink beer and that he shouldn't try to kiss people. That's the last time I see him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The trailer does not make it seem like an extremely original film, but that is the whole point: a group of friends on the run after an attempt to kidnap a young girl and a desperate race to survive in a jungle infested with deadly beasts.   The jungle is a perfect setting: large animals, huge trees, and even the wind can blow one's hair out.  The only drawback is the lack of voice acting and that one scene with the tiger is particularly annoying.  As a film, it's entertaining for its comedy and action, but the movie is a bit too slow to be exciting.  It has a very long and drawn-out final sequence with a couple of funny and interesting jokes.  This is a film I recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There are no losers in a battle between good and evil."   When I was younger I used to watch a lot of old monster movies. These films had a very good balance of good monster effects and good monster comedy. This movie had the same kind of balance. The monsters were the best part of the movie. The monster designer, Tony Chappelle, had the job of designing these creatures. The creature designs were good. The creatures were scary. These creatures were very creative and scary. I really loved the monsters. I enjoyed watching them fight. I also enjoyed watching a movie where the monster effects were amazing.   It's a good horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's that you say? A bad movie? I know, right?   This is a movie about what I like to call the Great American Experiment.   It's the movie where the government and military let an uneducated, uneducated child with no real skills and no real money to his name and a very unreliable guide, go out and see the world.  The result was a truly astonishing picture of what can be done with an untrained crew and a poor little boat.  It should be noted that this was all done back in the early 20th century, so if you're familiar with early movies, you're almost certainly familiar with it.  There is a lot to like about it, though: the fact that they filmed it all on location, even the most unlikely scenes, like the one where they are on a ship and the narrator says "We're off to the Bahamas, I'm telling you" (just kidding about the Bahamas).  And the fact the whole thing was done with such a sense of fun that it almost made one wish the actors and crew were working on a set, instead of out on a boat. That said, it's not a bad movie.  I would say a bad one.  However, for this reason, I will never watch another one like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fun and easy-going movie that gives a good idea of a real life scenario in Afghanistan, with an unusual twist.    There are a lot of good scenes and the movie is easy to watch; it will keep you watching long into the night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to see some action movies with a solid plot, but in a more civilized way. Don't let the cheesy names like 'Punk' or 'Rock' fool you. It's not a cheesy movie; rather it's a classic film with a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film has its themes and all the necessary ingredients. However, the film lacks subtlety. Instead, it's a very direct and powerful statement about a man's desperation to find love, about love's ability to heal the wounds of a broken man, about the consequences of love not being found. The film could have been very good if it were much more subtle than it is, but instead it simply takes all its cues from movies like this and does them a very disservice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much. It is so much fun to see the different characters having fun and getting to see all of the different settings, costumes, and locations they visit. The best thing about this movie is that you are not really sure who the people are that are in it. Some of them are really odd, some of them can be really odd. But they are also the best friends and companions that can be had. It also is a great idea to have a character in a costume like that. The movie is fun and great and well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie will entertain and will teach you some things.   It is not so much about the war but the human life during the war.

If you are interested in the film it is not necessary to look closely at it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is an entertaining little adventure about a group of misfit children with odd jobs who are hired by an eccentric scientist to help him build a better robot.   I liked the idea that they were the "last robots" of the human race, and had a great deal of fun playing with the concept of the "Last Man" trope.  One of the best sci-fi/adventure films I've seen in a while, with a good cast and some neat tricks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a few westerns and westerns are the only film genres that remain constant over time.   They are not based on anything like Shakespeare and in many cases they are not about the great men of old.  They deal with the real issues of the American frontier and the people who faced it.  It is still a good western, just a little more tame than others.  This is a good comedy and it doesn't need to be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A masterpiece, without doubt" - Film Magazine "A film about the love-hate relationship between a couple of lovers who meet as prisoners in a French prison. At first their relationship seems to make a mockery of its subject matter, but as the lovers' devotion to each other grows they begin to question the conventional notions of love and friendship. From then on they are a remarkable pair, who can endure each other's foibles, yet remain in total control of the situation. The film's central theme, the idea that love is a disease, is a profound one" - John F. Kennedy Presidential Library
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for good, old school action films like John Woo's The Killer and Jackie Chan's Jackie Chan Adventures.   But this one is a bit different.  It's a classic Hong Kong film, with plenty of explosions, and all of the usual action stuff you'd expect from an original.  The film is a true example of how to make a good kung fu flick.  There's plenty of fight scenes that are a bit corny at times, but that's the point.  A lot of the action comes from the fact that the characters' faces are literally off the screen.  So when they get hit they just fly across the screen in a blur, or disappear altogether.  And in a lot of cases, they don't even appear.  I think I get it.  This movie is about as good as it gets. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure everyone who was looking forward to a good action movie with good effects and excellent fight scenes had high hopes for this film.   It is a nice action movie, with nice effects.  A good deal of it is like the stuff in the old 80's movies.  What is new about this movie?   There are two good action movies. One about a gang of terrorists and one about a group of thieves.  The bad guys are like the thugs in the 80's.  They have no sense of humor or respect for life.  Both the thieves and the terrorists are bad people and there is nothing they can do about it.  This film is not about the good guys.  It's about bad people with no sense or ethics and who would do anything to make themselves feel better about themselves.  But at least they have good clothes, and nice cars.  Well worth a watch if you want to see a good crime film with cool weapons and nice action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really curious to see this movie as I had seen a trailer for it a few years ago.   When it was in theaters in 1994, the movie was a huge hit!   This movie is a true comedy masterpiece with a terrific cast of actors.  And the comedy is so thick that it is impossible to not laugh.  My rating for this movie is 10 out of 10 and my only regret is not seeing it when I was a kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't really know if there are any good movies about the Vietnam War out there; the ones that are at least made by an outsider, by people who don't have a stake in the war, don't try to tell a story about it. But I was in Vietnam in the '60s, and the movie "The Deer Hunter" is about Vietnam in that most visceral sense. There's no more violent war than what we had in Vietnam, but "The Last Boy Scout" is very brutal, even for Vietnam.   There are other movies about Vietnam, a couple of which have gotten some attention recently. There are also some documentaries about the war out there (like "Havre de Grace," and "Vietnam: the Great Divorce"). But "The Vietnam War" is, for me, a true Vietnam movie. It's not a movie about the military or the war at all. It is an intimate story about the people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was the second of four "Star Wars" movies to be shot in a huge studio with a lot of money thrown at it. The first was an okay movie but not that great, and then the third was a solid film but not as good as the second. But, all four of these movies were shot in beautiful, vast sets, and had special effects that will give the impression of great power.   I enjoyed these films and they were fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of The Great Outdoors, and I can't recommend this film highly enough. The movie's theme of survival was definitely fresh and original, especially for a film released in the early 1970's. The cast was fantastic, and their skills as performers were on point. The cinematography is top notch, with some truly gorgeous shots of California, and the special effects of the time were truly impressive. The plot itself was fairly predictable, but there was a certain satisfaction to be had in seeing this movie's most important character, a young man named Sam, survive the ordeal.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the movie "Halloween" a long time ago. It was a bad movie, that would make a bad teen movie. In the movie, the hero got the mask of a witch and started a cult. The main problem is the fact that it was made in 1968. That's what was the most fun thing about the movie.   It's a good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good film.   It is a classic western, like the one in the 1930's.  There are plenty of good westerns from the 1930s, but this is the one that has some of the best acting of them all.  It was directed by the great John Ford, who was also one of the first film stars to be well paid.  This one is worth watching and is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had this movie on a dare, so I don't want to tell anyone how it turned out, but I liked it! It's not the biggest or the brightest film (that'd be a lot like a movie with John Hurt in it) but it's one of the better examples of the slasher genre. The movie is about a woman and a man who go on a camping trip in the woods and meet someone there. I know what I saw when I saw the title: a man with his face twisted like a doll, with a knife sticking out of the back of his neck. They get kidnapped and tortured for several hours before the woman has enough. It's pretty much a campfire horror movie, but one in which you don't really feel like you're being entertained.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We Are Living In The End Times" is a truly scary movie, as all good stories should be.   It is a story that deals with a few main characters, but it is also about an evil spirit and a woman that has come back to life.  The evil spirit is known as The Black Cat, and it can kill you in a matter of seconds. The story takes place in a small community known as "The End Times".  The woman known as Bessie is a widowed woman who has come home from the store to find her husband dead. The only thing that seems to be missing is her son, John.  After discovering a new kind of evil in the town and hearing about a missing child, she travels to the town.  It seems that The Black Cats have started a curse that causes people to die and then come back as a new person.  When Bess goes looking for John, she comes face to face with the Black Cat.  There is a lot of blood and violence in this movie, but the scary thing is that the Black Cats are not just a big bad monster. They are human like you and me, but with their own powers.  As you would expect with any good horror film, there are many scenes in this one that will stay with you long after you have left the theater.  And just like any good film, you will not want to see it twice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title may be a misnomer, because while this film is not really about the Holocaust, it is about how the Holocaust is used as a propaganda tool to support a war to continue the European colonial expansion in the Indian Ocean. This film is primarily about the fate of a group of British officers on a mission to destroy a German ship, the Kaiser Wilhelm II, which is carrying two German officers who are about to defect to the British. There is a good deal of humor in the film, even with a lot of very dark themes. This is a film that could easily have been made in the fifties, because of the amount of material here, and the way it plays out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, I can say from experience that my first impressions of this film were "This is an old guy from the 30s, doing a 30s film". But then, I thought it was kind of funny. And very funny.   There's a very specific type of film that can be called a "modern" classic, and this one was that.  It was funny, moving, and at the same time made a lot of you want to sit down and talk to your grandma.  I found the movie very satisfying, because I knew what the movie was going to be about.  A movie about a man who goes to the grave (very very funny).   This movie was definitely not for everyone.  One thing that struck me about the movie: the film makes you feel so guilty about not being able to find anything to do in the middle of the night, and then when the movie is done, you realize that there is plenty of fun to be had.  This is definitely a film that should be seen by everyone, because it's fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was expecting this movie to be awful. I mean, I hate the whole premise of the movie. The main character is a fat kid with a bad attitude and the worst hair and clothing choices imaginable. His mother is clearly not a very loving person who never makes a move to help her son and who constantly gives him ultimatums to either change or die. I'm not a great fan of his attitude, either, but he's definitely a better person than he first appears. It's easy to forgive some of the bad jokes and the lame jokes are really just bad jokes thrown in a stupid story. But the jokes are nothing that isn't seen all too often on the bad tv shows and crappy movies I watch.   What I can get behind, however, is the character of the little kid. He's a kid with no skills but he knows that it's only a matter of time before he'll meet a girl who will teach him to use his mouth. That's the core of the story and it works beautifully. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was given a chance to go to a movie theater on a rare Saturday evening when a young man, who had recently been a patient of mine in his first year of nursing school, gave me his number.   I called him and invited him to come out and have dinner.  After lunch, we went to a place called the "Wright's Place" where I met a man and a woman who, when he saw me, went wild with excitement.  In the early hours of Sunday, they drove to the Wright's place, and I, a new nurse, went with him to see the new movie "The Wind in the Willows".  The young man had the movie in his pocket and talked about how well he liked it!   He showed me how to ride a horse and went off to a local bar.  He told me he had gotten into some trouble recently, and had lost his temper and wanted to settle it by going and running a man over with his car.  But when we got back to the house, I noticed that his head had been smashed against the back door.  We went to his bed and found him lying on the floor, dead.  I called my wife and told her about it.  My wife got on the phone and called the police.  The next morning, I was called into the office and told to call Mr. Wright and tell him he was dead. He was dead, so I called Mr.Wright and told him I was sorry to hear of his death.  Mr.T. Wright called me in the middle of the night and told me that the doctor had found nothing but a blood clot in his head.  There was no bruising anywhere on his body and there was no way he had been running over another man with a car.     The man was killed for being gay, for having been born a man. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film has a lot of good things about it, like an amazing score by The New York Philharmonic and a very likable lead performance by John Cusack. The story starts with a woman who goes missing. This is the first of a trilogy of "mysteries" where we watch her slowly descend into a bizarre series of events. It has a few twists and turns but it's more like a good thriller than a psychological horror film. It's not just about how strange she can be but about how very normal her family is. There is something about her that seems almost unapproachable, a kind of force of nature that comes out of nowhere to get you.   While I wasn't a fan of The Departed   I was happy to have more John Cuse to watch on my cable tv at night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this when I was a kid, with no expectation. I thought it was the most boring film I've seen in a long time, and then I found out it's not. It's about a family that has been displaced from their home, and now they live in a trailer, and you get to know them, as they try to get out of the trailer and go back to their normal lives. I loved watching it as a kid (I know, why did you have to make it about a kid? That's so lame), and now that I've aged, I've learned more about the film. The best parts were the parts in the trailer, like the "hiding" of all the family members, or when the trailer driver breaks down. It takes some of the horror out of it, and I think it's better than a lot of movies that feature the trailer alone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie I think could've been much better.   In case you don't know what a  , it's a black comedy that's about the misadventures of two young people who decide to get a little out of their element, get into an airplane, and fly across America in a little white VW bug (I'm not a big fan of Bugs, but this movie is way better than that garbage).   The story is basically about two kids that are just two kids who aren't afraid to say what they think.  In other words, it's not as good as you would think it would be, but it's still a funny, silly, and at least a little bit interesting.  It was a bit hard to make sense of the plot, though. I had a hard time keeping track of all the different parts of the story and why they happened.  I know this sounds ridiculous, but I guess it was harder to understand because this movie has no storyline.  However, it is still a very entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the real meaning of the term "cinema" is a movie. A movie without a plot and with no story that is simply a film is a film.   When it starts I knew nothing about it, I watched the first reel and thought I had watched something. It was all the same old familiar pictures and music. I went home and watched it with my kids. The only difference was that the "good" side of the story got played out, the movie just did not seem to have any depth.  I was left frustrated and with only a few laughs, nothing really made me think about the fact that I was watching a movie so I decided to watch it again.  But I would not recommend this movie to anyone else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is like watching the last two years of a romance movie that's in the middle of a slow-burn. It's not the most romantic movie I've ever seen (which is saying something, seeing as this is basically a romantic comedy with a few romance scenes thrown in), but it's an easygoing rom-com where everyone is fun and interesting and it's a very interesting idea about a man that falls for a girl who just moved in next door and thinks she's hot, only to have her move in and take his job when he's forced to get a promotion. That is, until she finds out that she's pregnant with his baby.   That's not all that's interesting about this movie though.  The movie also has a plot that's pretty simple and predictable, the kind that you'll see before in many movies: a guy moves in next to his neighbor's daughter (who's in a pretty bad relationship with her parents, but still), and the daughter gets pregnant.  There's not a whole lot going on here in the plot, but the movie is entertaining enough to watch over the course of about a year.  I like a lot of the characters in the movie, and the comedy is pretty much on point for the most part, but it could be better.  At times, the comedy feels a bit too cliche or predictable, and at times, it's just plain bad.  While the movie has its good moments, there's just nothing to be said about it other than it's okay, nothing spectacular, but very enjoyable in the least.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half is pretty much an action movie with great music, it is not that the movie is bad, it has some good action scenes and it is very entertaining. The second half is a fantasy movie. The bad part is the bad CG. The story is not good, and in the last part the action is not very impressive, but it is good action and the movie has a good ending.   I recommend the movie and I recommend a good action movie if you like fantasy movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, directed by  Ricky Nolasco, is not a bad movie,   it is a good,  interesting film.   The movie   tells a story about   a group of people from different walks of life who are trying to survive in the city of   Venice.      They live in a building that has been abandoned since the early 80s.  The building, which has been converted into a disco, has a small street named  Piazzola where   young people get together for   parties, to drink, dance, to meet, and to do other   things.  To be honest   I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I wanted to.  I liked it   much more when I first saw it on a VHS tape in college, but I couldn't quite get over the   feeling   of a bad film. It is very, very   slow and boring to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't even need to say this but the music is amazing! This is the second movie I saw this summer and I am pretty sure I saw it at a really great cinema that has an all-you-can-eat buffet. If you've never heard the song "Somewhere" before, I think that it might be a great song to get you through the movie. It makes it feel like you are a ghost, but it also makes it seem like it's a very bright movie.   In all honesty, this movie has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. Not only do they do something that's never been done before, but the visual effects are so realistic you'll wonder how they're even done. The movie is well-paced and there's a lot of humor to be had. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously but it's not so serious that you think it's trying to be. The acting was well-done and the characters all had their own personalities.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie with my parents who didn't know much about martial arts movies.   The movie is like a movie in the 80's in the USA:  In the 80s, Kung Fu movies were popular everywhere.  One of the movie of this genre is a Chinese martial arts movie called The Killer.  The character named Kung Fei is played by Bruce Lee.  I don't know about you, but I like the Bruce Lee and I love Chinese movies. The Bruce Lee is an American, he is also a famous movie star.  He is an action hero and a martial artist. The movie starts with him training with the master in a secret location (In a forest). He learns that his teacher was the legendary Jackie Chan. He has also some Chinese martial art experts to train with him.  When he finally finds his instructor, he learns that he was trained to kill.  Kung Fei can't find his way out of the forest and the movie ends with his death.  A lot of my friends are big Bruce Lee fans and they like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great film, a nice one at that.   You can tell it's an enjoyable one as soon as the opening music begins to play.  The story, while a bit convoluted at times, is a story about a little girl who lives in a little town called Little River.  One night, she dreams that she is a horse.  She has a horse's head, a horse body, and even a horse heart.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this is the daughter of the man who has been her mentor all along.  But that's not the only strange thing about this film.  In the opening sequence, the film presents an older man named Jack who is a very interesting character.  He looks like he's about to explode in a fire.  This is an old man.  His face is covered by a kind of yellow paint.  There is an odd sort of humor to his behavior as he walks around the streets of Little River, which we see from a bird's eye view.  I thought the film handled this old man very well, as the story and his behavior have an intriguing charm to them.  And while Jack is very odd, he is very entertaining.  Another interesting character is a woman named Elsie who works in the same gas station as Jack.  Elsie is very clever.  While Jack is eccentric, she is very normal.  Also, a big part of the film is the theme of the environment and the effect it has on the people.  Little River is a place where nature is more important than humans.  We watch the weather patterns and the animals who live in the water, and we learn that there is a kind and gentle spirit living in them.    This theme of a gentle nature that is not afraid to give people a nice surprise is explored in many other films that I have seen.  Some of them have a more realistic atmosphere to them, but some are more surreal than realistic.  These films give you the feeling that the natural world has been completely destroyed.  Like in the movie, there is an environment that we are not supposed to touch, so that people are not too surprised by how much harm is in them when they come in contact.  That is not to say that these films don't have a bit of violence in them, it's just not in the traditional sense.  So while there are things to be disturbed by, there
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a movie of a real war which we know and understand. The story is set in 1944 and the movie is not a propaganda movie but it depicts the reality of what life was like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film takes place in the summer of 1977, on the west coast of the United States. On the day of the shooting the family were in a car heading toward the Pacific Ocean on Highway 1. They stopped for a rest at a gas station and then proceeded to drive on Highway 101 to a hotel where they had a long, intense, and highly sensuous evening together. At one point the husband came home and he and his wife had a conversation about their past love affairs and how they both felt that they were in love with each other again. They then took off on Highway 8, drove through the desert and then out over a cliff. The cliff crashed down behind them as they drove off into the night. In their hotel room they continued to have sex until the couple began to lose the will to live, but still had a passionate night.   It's a very exciting and passionate film. I was fascinated by the film from beginning to end and enjoyed every minute of it.  The sound is great too, and the whole thing is done well.  One of my favorite movies.  - September 23, 2012Fantastic film
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't love this movie, but I did feel like I was watching a movie that had been done before.   The story starts off pretty slow and isn't a very fast paced movie.  We see a lot of old people and the characters seem old too.  This movie doesn't really have a plot to speak of, it's all just flashbacks that don't really tell a story.  They don't do a very good job of explaining how these old people died.  There is a lot to be said for old people in this movie. They are all pretty funny and relatable.  The only thing that kept me from being in love with this movie is that the old people that die are all very sad, and it takes a very long time to get over that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was thoroughly entertained at the beginning.   This is a fantastic example of a classic tale from one of the greatest movie directors of all time.  While I don't think a lot of people will enjoy this, it certainly isn't for everybody.  It is one of those films that can only be appreciated by a small percentage of the population.  This film is filled with good performances from some great performers.  The story follows the lives of three women who have an affair.  One of them is a pretty, but rather boring woman who is not very bright.  There is also a very attractive young man.  I found that the only reason this was entertaining is because of the three people.  All of the others are rather one-note.  I don't know about the others, but I did not find any of the characters especially interesting.  However, the main characters are very good.  They have a good time together, have a great laugh, get into trouble in the middle of a city, and go up to the roofs and yell "I love you" in the hopes that a woman will come and take them away from their awful lives.  Even though this is not a very good movie, I found it entertaining, and at least the best of the great movie trilogy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was given the privilege of visiting the University of Kentucky for the first time after years spent in other locations.  The first thing that caught my eye was the great amount of fans that attended games.   The student section for the Kentucky Wildcats was great, and I can see how it would make a great atmosphere.  I also loved watching the players, and how they played as a team.  Once the game started, I was immediately impressed with the talent that was on the floor.  This was one of the highlights of my life.  Fans of any sport will enjoy watching this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at the same time as I saw The Book of Eli. The Book had a much better ending, but not as good as this one. This movie takes place in a post apocalyptic world where a family of four lives. I guess you could call it a "post-apocalyptic" film because it takes place after an asteroid destroyed a small city in Wyoming. Two teenage girls and their parents decide to take shelter in a small cabin on a lake bed. One of the girls has an accident with a motorcycle and is left in the care of her sister. The father has just left for work and doesn't come home until the morning. He has been a policeman and is now an alcoholic. The two girls are good at everything they do, which includes riding a motorcycle to safety. There is some nice humor. The girls are always making puns, which are often lost. This is a good "family movie".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was actually pretty skeptical about this movie until I actually watched it. The director has done a lot of other films that are quite good, and there is even a scene here where a guy is trying to explain to his wife that he's going to be a cop. But it was actually quite hard to watch a police movie after I saw this one. It starts off with a very interesting and unique idea: there is a guy who is a cop, but he has a secret: he's a serial killer, and he's killing cops all over the country. That's pretty much all there is to it, and the director is just really good at presenting the suspense and the violence of the crime. But the thing that kept me watching this movie was the idea that this was a detective show. This guy is a police officer who is doing all this investigating, but then the other detectives start asking him to solve murders. He then starts to get a bit self-righteous and smug, and starts trying to solve the murders by getting these guys to confess to them. It's a bit too on the nose for me at first, but it becomes more and more interesting as it goes along. It seems a little too clever by half, but I think the director has a real good eye for tension and drama. This is another good example of a good detective show with a killer inside. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a very enjoyable movie. It features the usual comedic moments and the movie itself is not bad.   My only complaints are that there is no actual ending or anything that ties up the plot so to me it feels like there is never a definitive ending to anything. The best way to put it would be "There is an ending but it's never the same."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie    It has a good mix of humor, drama and action.   The movie is set in a small town near Denver, Colorado.  The main character, Nick, who has recently moved to town with his new wife and baby, is not what most would expect when a big old redneck trucker comes knocking on the door.  Nick is a good-looking guy with a beautiful wife.  He has a truck that looks like a war tank.  As a military veteran, he was recently stationed in Kuwait where he took heavy casualties and was awarded the Purple Heart for a wound he sustained.  Now, with a daughter in school and a wife waiting in the wings, Nick has a lot of catching up to do.  In addition to his truck, Nick owns a bar, a strip club and a motel.  His brother is a big time drug dealer who wants Nick dead for some reason.  With little money in the bank, the boys at the bar are in trouble.  When Nick goes to the local police station and tells them what's going on he gets nothing but hostility from the officers.  But, Nick can't go back to work in the bar and he doesn't want to.  It seems he's in way over his head.  So, Nick hires the toughest man he knows, and takes him to the bar to "rescue" his bar.  After a few drinks, Nick discovers the local tough is a professional boxer.  What happens next is the stuff of a good western...   Written by: Michael C. Stokes <mmstokes@hotmail.com>

I never thought I'd have such a beautiful little film about a little girl. I knew a lot about animals, but never anything like this. When you see a dog growl, you don't expect it to be like this, but it really is. The animal noises are beautiful, and the little girl is adorable. The dog, in contrast to the beautiful girl, is the ugly, mean, uncouth, uglyest dog you'll ever see. The movie gets a big laugh out of the dog's name, "Frost," which is a good joke.

It has that unique mix of humour, action, drama, romance and comedy.   It was really funny, really exciting and just plain good fun.  The story was pretty basic but there is a nice twist in the second half which was pretty well done.  It has a lot of humor and great action and the character relationships were a blast.  In a movie like this you don't need to have a lot going on in the background, if you just want a great popcorn movie, then you'll have a blast with this one.  I loved it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first hour-ish of "M.A.N.D.O.K." feels like you are watching a very long and drawn-out, long-term, inbred love story between a man who is, literally, a man (there is a scene where he has to wear a fake moustache to avoid looking too masculine for some reason), a woman who is basically a robot, a bunch of little boys who are obviously going to kill themselves in the next few years because that's what they're programmed to do (this is one of the most beautiful and thoughtful sequences I've seen since that scene in "Pineapple Express" when the boys are sitting around looking sad and silent and everyone looks sad and quiet, and the girl says "Well, if they are sad and it's wintertime, then I'll have to stay inside all day"), and a woman (and the girl) who knows better than to fall in love with a man with no self-confidence whatsoever and is in a relationship with a guy with no ambition.   It's the ultimate sad-sack movie where someone who is so unhappy has to look for meaning in a meaningless world, and it doesn't work because the world doesn't really have meaning, and neither does the person looking for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a HUGE fan of the Twilight movies ( Twilight: New Moon, New Moon: Once Upon a Time in the West, and most recently: Eclipse ).   My love for the Twilight series is so deep that I feel it can never truly die.   The first Twilight movie ( New Moon) was a good film, I found it a bit silly at times, but it was still a good watch.  New Moon was an interesting character study.  There was romance, some action, and there were some twists that added to the story.  One thing that annoyed me at first was the fact that the Twilight crew is never allowed to be any older than 25.  After that, everything becomes much more exciting.  I have a hard time imagining anyone watching Twilight: Eclipse not loving it, and that includes me.  Eclipse is one of the best, if not THE best Twilight film.  The characters and plot are just as good as ever.  This was a perfect way to cap off the Twilight saga, which has been amazing and entertaining.  A little bit of Twilight: Dawn of the Ages:      This movie is very similar to the original trilogy.  It has all of the same characters.  They have all developed well, and they all play off of each other perfectly.  With this movie, director Tim Burton added a lot of his own style to the Twilight franchise.  He took the formula of the original Trilogy and added in a few twists, and a little bit more comedy.  Burton's film is very funny and has a few great dramatic moments.  Another thing that Burton added is a great soundtrack, and the whole movie has a great mood.  The soundtrack is great, and Burton added in more classic songs like "Dewey Decimal" and "When the Saints Go Marching In."   Overall, Eclipse is an excellent movie, and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film about 5 years ago in the New York Film Festival. It was quite a pleasant experience and I found it very entertaining. The story is quite enjoyable. One of the actors playing the role of the bad guy is quite a bit funny as he does a good impression of a bad guy and a good guy. There is also a good amount of action scenes as well.   The best part is when the bad guys are attacking the good guys. The good guy has some cool action scenes that I found amusing. The ending was quite satisfying as well as the ending scene with a group of women. The cinematography is well done, and I really enjoyed the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw "Rambo 3" with a group of friends at a movie theater in Long Beach, California.   The movie opens with Rambo riding a motorbike down a freeway at night.  He is being followed by a killer.  Rambo shoots at the killer, who is flying down the freeway. The killer is flying to the freeway and Rambo has to shoot him to stop his pursuit.  The next day Rambo is found dead in a tree, with a bullet hole in his head.  His wife and daughter find him and the movie ends.  My impression of this movie was of a film filled with action, humor, and good, well-acted scenes.  There is a bit of racism in this film (as they refer to a dark skinned "Negro") but this is not a racist film.  It is more a "we are all brothers" kind of movie.  Overall I thought this movie had a good cast of actors and was fun to watch.  I would definitely like to see the second "Rambos 3" movie in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like some other reviewers, I was very impressed by " The Martian ", a great sci-fi movie that's sure to make your hair stand on end. I haven't seen the movie in a while because I was always busy with work and other stuff, but since I read a great review about the movie, I thought I should give it another look. I'd like to give a little more of a review about what I found to be my favorite part of the movie: the opening. It's not just one of the most effective opening sequences in recent years; it's a classic. It opens with a perfect line: "It was a cold night in the country. The streets were empty, except for one small boy." It's almost too perfect. When this little boy is walking down the deserted streets, he's not aware that someone is watching him. His small, brown eyes catch the light reflected off a window that catches his attention. He's not wearing his cap, but he's wearing a blue, knee-length coat that seems to be hanging in midair. The boy is probably about 5 or 6 years old. He walks down the empty street. He stops to look up at a light shining from a house across the street. As he looks up, his eyes get bigger, and he makes his way toward the house. The camera cuts to a close up of his eyes, then a wider shot. We see him walk over to the house and the lights start flashing. There is a man standing in the doorway, his face is hidden in shadow. The man gives a quick glance at the boy and the boy gets to his feet. The lights come back on and the camera returns to close up on the boy's face. We get a closeup of the boy. He looks tired and haggard, but still very young. He is clearly afraid of something. He reaches into his coat to grab his hat, but doesn't have a good grip. He drops it to the ground and looks around at the city in the distance. As the camera cuts again to the boy, we hear a car start up and he jumps into the passenger seat. The car drives off. We then cut to the city, which is on fire. It is a dark, gloomy night. I think this is a brilliant and original way to get the audience started. I guess it could have been better if there was more dialogue between the boy (a bit younger) and his parents
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's a beautiful day in a country that hates sunshine. The sun is out; the flowers are in bloom; the birds are singing; and the country is full of life."   I've been a fan of David Lynch since the very first Twin Peaks episode.   The world of Twin Peaks   is in a constant state of transition and is never really defined. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a real gem of an old time TV movie and will be on my must-watch list when I see it on the next TV re-run.   "A Man and His Dog" stars John Belushi, a young TV announcer and one of the great comedian's of his time. Belushi is a little drunk and has just been fired from his job as a weatherman. He's out looking for work but finds a dead body. Beluchi takes it as a challenge to see if he can find another job, even though he's not too good looking. After a few attempts to get work, Belushi hires the dog, a shaggy hound named Pongo, to do the job for him. This is not a dog movie, but a comedy of a bunch of people who all have a bit of a drinking problem and a lot of money. The film begins in the early morning, with the dog chasing after his owner on his way to work. Then we get a lot more comedy of manners (belushi's wife, who thinks that Belushi wants to go to bed). Belushi eventually learns to let his dog take care of himself and his wife. They have a lot to drink, including Belushi's alcoholic wife and her two dogs. It's the sort of movie that I never tire of watching. I'll be looking forward to seeing what the next season will bring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I watched this last night and we both agreed that it was a good one!   This film is a sequel to the "Beware of Dog" and they have done a fine job of keeping that story going.   We see the old woman's son and her daughter get along fine.  The mother wants to get rid of the dog but there is a little difficulty because the son has been doing quite well in school and is becoming quite popular.  My father, who is a very serious man, was very pleased with the film, he did not find anything offensive in the film and commented that it reminded him of a fairy tale or something that he might have read as a child and enjoyed.  At the end of the film my father, being the kind and thoughtful man that he is, took me aside to suggest that we go to the store to see how many of the little ones were there.  I said that we had seen this film before and so we did, but we also had seen it with the old lady and her two sons.  We did not buy anything and, of course, we were just as bored as the rest of the people in the theater. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a good sequel to a good film. This film follows the original trilogy, but with a slight twist in the first movie. In this sequel, we see what happens when the villain is the president. We see how the president has to try to get rid of his father's murderer to get a shot at the Presidency.   What I like about this movie is that it's a bit less preachy, and a bit more funny. I like the fact that the film stays true to its source, but still has it's own twist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts with a shot of a cityscape with the Statue of Liberty on the horizon. A crowd of people, a young man and his mother and a young boy are walking towards the building of the Statue. A man is walking down the street, his shirt is covered in mud and his hair is matted. He is very angry and yells in a loud voice:  "Why is that statue not cleaning itself? I bet she's still inside. She was only raised there for a week and now she's got to spend the rest of her days sleeping in a hole! I don't like people like that."   It is an amazing movie in that it is not a horror movie, and also it is a good thriller.   This is a film that I recommend to those who like thrillers, action, mystery, action/thriller, comedy, suspense, or suspense/thrillers. It is very well written, but there are a few scenes that are a little too long. I am guessing that this film was made by a man who enjoyed doing this type of movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie about five years ago when I was a high school senior and it had absolutely nothing to do with my life at that point, but it's still one of my favorite movies.   There was a really cool film crew making this in 1971, that did such a great job with their camera.  They also put on a fantastic show!   My favorite scene is when the gang of teenage thugs walk into the movie theater and there is a little girl there who is very sweet and innocent looking, I love when she goes out and plays in the street like all the little kids do.  This film was made to give them a taste of what they would be up against in life, and the gang goes in and out of the movie to do the things they would do in real life!  So, in the beginning of the film they play the gang leaders in a play, then there is this scene where the gang breaks into the school.  The gang goes up and into the dormitory where all the other gang members are sleeping and does some really weird things to them, then they steal a girl's diary, and it is at this point that I remember how it all began.  I believe that the girl was really sick at the time, and she had a friend who took her to a doctor who was really famous, so they went there and the doctor did the thing he was supposed to do, but then he did something he shouldn't have done.  Then, he gave her the medicine she needed for her sickness and she lived for two days.  He died before she could get to a hospital and it was then that the other girls in the dorm realized that something was wrong with their friend and took her away from the doctor and she was never seen again.  It was all this group of girls who ended up being the main bad guys in the movie, and I am so happy that this film was as good as it was, and that it did so many things well! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is pretty good, there is a decent amount of action, a couple good laughs along the way, and a few laughs to boot.   It takes place in the same universe as   , a sequel of sorts to the first film, and follows a group of friends who have gone to stay with a wealthy family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After reading a lot about it   It really is a very good movie. It really gives the feeling of a movie made with a real love for movies, with a very original plot and interesting characters. It's funny, emotional and I like it a lot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's great to see some of the actors from a different era reunite to make a movie again.   They're all great as they were in the 70's and 80's, except perhaps for Peter Graves who was over fifty.  The story is simple yet the characters are well developed.  I was glad to see a movie in which the women didn't go to the theater to see "Sex and the City" or the other movies that were so silly.  If you want a good comedy, give this a try, it's the kind of movie that's really meant to be enjoyed on a patio with some beer in hand. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun movie and a good comedy.   It has a great, fast paced pace and the humor is not very hard.  The actors and actresses are very good, though I think that a bit too many of the actors are too young and don't seem to be much of a good person.  This might not be a good, well thought out movie, but the characters have a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the movie very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a film that has everything: a good plot, great direction, and a very likable and smart main character.   After having just completed a major, serious, and at times frustrating degree at college, I had the opportunity to visit one of my former college dorms, which is still very much alive and well at this time. The dorm is in a beautiful old part of town, right on the edge of a beautiful creek running into the creek. The sun sets beautifully on the water, and you can see the silhouettes of the old brick buildings as well as the old wooded hills around it.  A couple of years back, the old college dorm where I used to be had to close its doors after an illness, but the college is still there and still has a pretty decent library, a coffee bar, a movie theatre, and an excellent restaurant.  In one of the windows I saw a movie called A Thousand Miles.  It was a pretty good movie, about a group of high school students who decide to travel to a distant land to try and find their missing friend.  There is a couple of scenes of the characters in a small city, but by far the best is the scene when they are in a village.  I couldn't put it down.  The people and the buildings looked very much like something from some other time and place in the world.  This movie had a lot of things going for it and I could not help but think it was a good representation of what the world of college life should be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good comedy about a group of young guys who live in a rural area where they can get away with murder. They have no friends and the local cops are clueless about what they are up to.    One of the interesting parts of this film is how it tries to make an interesting character, the young man with the pony tail, into a real villain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit leery of this one at first but once I got into it and realized that this is one of those movies where it's not about the violence but more about the reactions. The violence and violence in this film is actually a little tame in comparison to the rest of the movies I've seen recently but I suppose I can appreciate that.   This is a film that was very successful in the 70's but sadly the film was not well-received and the studio tried to kill it off after the first two movies. It is a sad movie and the story is about a man who kills a woman over the issue of her being a lesbian. The woman in question is a doctor and she is quite nice as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is pretty good. It's not perfect but it's a pretty good movie, for the most part. It has a lot going for it. The characters, the direction, and the plot are all pretty good; it's not a great movie but it is good.   I like how it's an all-ages movie but in a very good way.  It's more of a thriller than a fantasy but it takes the suspense level very seriously.  I also like how the movie was released theatrically (though it was in theaters in the States) and not home video.  This movie does not hold a candle to the best fantasy movies I've seen but it does hold a lot of the best of the low budget horror movies I watched as a kid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   I was just watching this film and it was so well-made and I have to admit that I did not understand anything. I thought the actors were good (Mia Farrow in particular) and the director, Robert DeNiro, is excellent, but I thought it was very hard to follow the story. The first film I saw was one of the best films ever made and this was the second, and I really did not see it until after I had seen the first. I am so impressed with the way this film is told and I hope it is made into a full length movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last couple of years have been pretty exciting, haven't they?   With the release of his third film, the fourth installment in the The Last Samurai series, Tomi Ushio (the very best Tomi) has proven himself as one of Japan's most talented and respected directors.   This movie is not about the samurai in general, but rather a very specific historical event.  While the samurai had been living in feudal Japan for a very long time, a rebellion against the Japanese government began in the summer of 1576. This uprising ended in defeat, and the government was forced to send in a new army to deal with the rebellion.  This army was led by one General Shirabe Michimune, who in the course of his army's conquest of the rebellious region of Aomori (now Tokyo) had established himself as the leader of the Aomos, the most influential warriors of the era.  The Aomuro were led by a particular Aomuran, a very skilled swordsman and a master of the  kendo stick.  One night, the Aumuro attacked a rival Aomurain army, and Michimunes forces massacred the entire Aumuri forces, the leader included.  It was after this event that the rebellion started, and it is here that the movie begins.  I do not know if I would call it a good, good movie, but I certainly did not think it was bad.  Tomi has been able to bring a lot of new ideas to the samurai genre, with the result being a movie that is entertaining, entertainingly silly, and very, very good.  If you liked the first two movies, you are sure to like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first and the only movie I've seen where the actor is also the director.       His name is Martin Sheen and he is a very good actor and director. He plays a drug addict who is forced to go into a treatment center after his girlfriend dies in a car accident.  The treatment center is run by the good doctor.  He tries to make the addicts take responsibility for their actions, and to become more productive members of society.  This is followed by a series of events and people that occur in the treatment center.  Although he has a very strange and unusual looking beard (what is that???) the movie is about human connection, and that's a very relevant topic.  Sheen's character was a great role, he is the kind of guy you like a little bit and then you don't want to like him anymore.  It was a very funny movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're looking for something that has that classic movie atmosphere and just doesn't get as much love as it deserves, look no further.   This is the film that is a little "different", I'm not sure if it's just me or is it more for the time.  It may be the fact that this was released after "The Graduate" or maybe it's a time period thing. I can't really place my finger on it, but I like the fact it is different.  I would definitely recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching the trailers I figured I'd give this a try, since I've never seen it before. When I saw the trailer for this I was immediately reminded of The Matrix.   The movie is shot from the POV of one of these android-like creatures that look like small robots with long arms, and who can fly. The guy in the middle is about as tall as the guy with the bow tie who watches them from across the river. It makes a pretty cool idea, except that it ends up being way too similar to the Matrix. (   It makes more sense if you know that the android is actually a man in a dress who is controlled remotely by a woman who has a computer chip implanted in her head). The story is about a man who goes up against these creatures and takes them down one by one. It's actually kind of nice watching the android destroy one of the creatures, then see a second one come from behind it and smash the guy into a metal wall.   But all in all, it's just a bad, bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't like to give too much bad marks to a movie that I really like, but this movie does take some major liberties with the facts and the plot.   The movie begins with a young couple who, without really explaining what they mean, are caught between a police officer (Jack Black) and a mysterious stranger (Tim Robbins).   Eventually the man's girlfriend (Jodie Foster) is taken away by the police and they end up in a hotel where they have to deal with some strange people and a strange man who turns out to be a murderer.  There are so many little touches throughout the movie which really work.  I'm not sure why it took me so long to write a positive evaluation about a movie like this.  It really is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You're going to have to wait a while to see this movie, but it's worth it.   I don't want to ruin the movie for you. It's not really a "good movie" at all, it's a "fun movie", but it does have a "story".   It's also, to me, one of the most realistic movies ever made.  The actors all seem to be real people, and if the movie was made today the acting would probably be a little better, and the story would be about the relationship between the kids and the dogs, but in a totally different way.

He is a tough man, very strong, but a great character, a good leader.  And his wife, he has a little child, and they live happily together.

It's got a great cast, some great acting, and some very cool scenes.  The story centers around the relationship between a very bad man (and his beautiful daughter) and a young woman who was the victim of a horrible car accident.  It was my first exposure to the 'Hapgood' character and I thought it was brilliant.  I watched this again the other day, and it's definitely one I'd like to see again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have seen this movie, you must've been disappointed by its terrible execution.   But, its concept is pretty good: a bunch of friends go into a haunted house and end up fighting a zombie.  It's fun, its silly, it's stupid, but it has a very unique atmosphere to it.  The acting in this is not bad.  This is one of those movies you will probably remember from the time you were young.  I would recommend this to fans of the 80s, especially for the 80's kids who would've found it hilarious to make fun of a movie called Zombie!

I've been trying to figure that out myself.  First off, The Producers is very funny.  It is very well acted, with a great ensemble cast.  That said, it is also very clever.  I love that the audience is the one making fun of the people doing the work.  The Proprietors is a fun, low-budget comedy that can be found in any season. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always thought that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was a great film. It's got everything: good acting, a great script, good direction, and lots of scenes of great set-pieces.   Well, The Good Bad and the ugly, what a wonderful movie   It was a real pleasure to watch it, and I think it was an even greater pleasure to be a fan of the director, John Frankenheimer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love science, you're going to love this movie. If you hate science, this movie will make you angry as hell.   This movie is an ode to the worst things in the world, the worst people and the worst times.  This is a movie that makes the idea of "science" look like a really cool, if terrible, science.  To call this movie "science fiction" would be like calling the idea "dance" or "happening" or just "life" or any other boring, generic, formulaic idea.  The "science", if you can call it that, consists of some guys in a flying saucer getting shot down by an unknown alien race, and some guys who seem to think they're cool with that happening.  One guy says "This isn't science fiction. It's a work of art!"  What this movie is not, is anything other than a comedy.  In one scene, some guys are talking about how they want to blow up a giant meteor, and there's a woman saying "I'm a scientist. I'm good at science. I get things done."  This guy goes "Yeah, and I have a gun, but I don't shoot anyone."  In another scene, a scientist shows a group of people some sort of rocket to "take them to Mars in a week."  It is not just one or two guys in flying saucers getting shot up, this is a whole alien race that is destroying a spaceship and we never find out what happens to them or where they go.  It also contains some scenes in which some people talk about some of the things they like to do.  They love to go to parties.  Some guys are going to a party and they're going like "I can't wait till we get there!"  I couldn't watch this movie any other way.  There's a scene where a guy shows the camera a photo of his friend's naked body and someone is saying "Oh, wow, my girlfriend had a sex tape when she was 16!"  The next scene shows them having sex.  So that's two more things.  For the most part, this film is about "people", and "people" are really, really boring.  But it's about the people that make people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun comedy from the director of "Hair." You are invited to the party, which is a blackjack and pinball tournament. The place is very fancy and fun to see.   It has that movie-like feel, but has a better script. I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a bit of a connoisseur of French horror. The movies of this genre are the real treat: in which there's a lot of sex and violence, and a very unique and original setting.   It all comes together well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with some really amazing special effects. A beautiful, dreamlike film. And then, things get weird.   A guy named Paul (Tom Hiddleston) finds out that his twin brother is gay. What?!   I'm not even sure what the big deal is.  What did I do to deserve this?   They are just two guys in love, and then one of them finds out about another man?  There is no reason to be upset!   No, there is no cause to be concerned!  The gayness is just a phase!  And in all seriousness, these two guys are not bad people.  They actually are very much in love.  I mean, look at them!  Both of them are so dashing and gorgeous!  It's such a romantic film.  It really is. The only complaint I can think of about this is that there is a lot of unnecessary nudity.  And there are a few pretty girls, but it is not something that really draws me in to the story.  But, it is definitely worth checking out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been a long time since I last saw a movie like this, it's a great movie with a fantastic script and a great cast. This movie is a good mix of comedy and drama, but it's very funny and it has a great emotional core.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . It's a comedy about a girl who becomes a superhero.   A really well done movie.  There's a bit of romance in it as well, I guess a comedy can't be all romances, it'd be like a rom com with all the jokes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the fact that it has a decent plot and characters, makes it a good story,  especially since it is a good directorial decision to have it set in a small town (it would not work in a big city like New York).   It was enjoyable to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't even know why I watched this, because it just wasn't that interesting, like it wasn't trying to be.   This movie is pretty much a re-telling of a movie where a group of women in New York go to a ball where they are tricked, then find themselves being cheated on at a casino.  A few of the guys, like a fat bald dude and a short bald guy, are not even funny.  It doesn't really have much of a story though, and I didn't really care for any of the characters.  I guess it is supposed to be a parody of the "Honeymoon in Vegas" movie, but I don 't think it is funny at all, and the women were just irritating and stupid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's very interesting that after so long without seeing the original, I finally get to see this remake. I was always very impressed with the original movie, but to me it's the same old thing. It's a story about a guy who gets a job to take care of his dad and his family, but when his dad dies he gets kicked out of the job and ends up living on the streets. He decides to take his family to Australia to take a vacation, but then a storm comes in and leaves the family stranded in a boat. There are some interesting ideas in this movie about people being trapped in a situation of almost no choice.   This movie is a very different take on a story, with a very original premise.  I'm not really sure I can recommend this movie, as it's a very dark movie, and it doesn't feel like it's made for kids. However, it does have a lot of good animation, and the characters are well-drawn. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a fun movie to watch.  The main character, Sam Fisher, is an 18-year old African-American from New Jersey who gets mixed up with some "jungle boys" (aka drug dealers) in South Central.  It turns out that Sam was in a robbery in which his accomplice was murdered and Sam had to save the day.  Sam ends up at the home of a guy named Jimmy (Jeff Goldblum) who lives in a trailer house with his wife, two daughters and a cat.  Jimmy is the kind of guy who can't tell the difference between a cat and a rat and is always having a hard time with his cat, Kitten.  After a while Sam makes the acquaintance of his new friends, Tommy (Brad Pitt), a young guy from Alabama, and a man named Mr. X (Jeff Bridges), the most famous jungle hunter in South America.  This leads Sam into a situation with some big-time gangsters, some drug dealers and a dangerous fugitive who is a cop.   Although a bit corny, this movie was fun to watch and has a lot of good laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at a theater where the kids were watching the latest movies. I was excited to see how a new movie could look. I had never seen this movie before. I am a huge fan of comedy. I watched it again, and again. It is funny. The movie is short. It might be too short to stay funny all the time, but when the movie starts and all the jokes fall down, you know it will be a fun time to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie. I haven't watched this film since its original release in 1993, but as a big fan I thought I'd add my opinion in light of all the recent reviews.    The movie is about a man who discovers an alien device that he believes to be a nuclear bomb. As he investigates the device, he has a chance to meet a lovely lady who has something of a crush on him. It's not a long story, but it's a good story that is definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the most beautiful piece of art I have ever seen in my life.   It is about a beautiful girl who is in love with a beautiful boy who is a vampire.     She wants him to come to the land of the dead to see a beautiful castle.  They both come up to this place and see beautiful things, beautiful people.  At one point they are both in love and he puts his hand on her waist, she pushes him away.  But they are in love.  The girl is beautiful and so are the people. They have a life together, a very happy life. She doesn't like that her boyfriend is a blood thirsty vampire.   She tells him about her castle and all the nice things that are in it.  She tells them about the many things that make it a good place.  Then they are attacked by vampires and she tries to kill the vampire to save him.  He kills her and goes after her lover.  I won't give away any spoilers but the vampire gets the better of her.  It's sad, but it's beautiful.  There are so many beautiful people in this movie.  This isn't just about a couple.  In all this movie is about love, life and a lot more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first of many such "good movies" that I would like to see, this is a good comedy, with a nice cast, a good story and a decent plot, that I feel a movie like this could have been made in the late fifties or early sixties. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw the movie, but can't find a single bad thing about it, except that the actor who plays the guy who says "Fuck you, I'll be right back!" has no facial hair.   (That's a problem that plagues many of the Hollywood films of the seventies: even as it's being filmed, its star can't grow a beard. )   After watching this movie, I'm beginning to suspect that the American actor in this one has never seen a comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never been disappointed in a Hollywood movie: they are so very good:  And you get a chance to be one of them:  I saw this one again a few days ago and found it very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not a big horror movie fan so I found this to be rather disappointing. It isn't that bad though.   The movie has a couple interesting scenes: one with the zombie woman and a "bitch" (actually a guy) who is a little too good at his job. But it's really not a memorable scene in my opinion.  This film is a fairly typical horror movie and I can't think of a lot of scary scenes from this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all great movies, this one is very well-acted and very well made.   We all know what the story of this movie is about:    a girl who dreams of being a famous actress is abducted by aliens.  The girl must rescue herself from the aliens by using her sexiness to scare them away.  One night she finds out that she is not a famous film star after all, but a movie star that never exists:  She is trapped in a small bedroom by an alien in a box, and it is the only way to survive.  This is a good old-fashioned movie that will leave you hungry for the next sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A pretty good movie that I'd love to see again!   This film has a good story, and good actors in it.   But, it is one of those "how long will we go to see a movie" type of movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first ever horror movie was The Silence of the Lambs. I was 16 and I had to wait almost 4 years before I could see this movie. I must say that the movie does not disappoint.   I have a feeling that this movie will stay in my mind as long as I live. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are plenty of horror movies out there.  But  this one is   a little different,   and it   is worth a watch.   The story is great, and it makes you feel   terrified of   all of these creatures that are going on   killing people,  and your main character gets a bit of a backstory,  but the story doesn't end there. There are also a few nice cameos, such as   one of the cops that were on the police scanner before they went to the mall and said they saw something that resembled a headless man with a face and a bloody mouth.   This is also one of those "this   really   gets   creepy " stories. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is a great movie.   A fantastic story from the author of "The Great Gatsby" who clearly knows how to write a good story.    This is a well acted movie with lots of comedy, action and beautiful music.  I love a good "dance" scene, like here.  And, it's great to hear a story about a woman who can make a man fall in love, I have to say.  The dialogue is quite well done, and the screenplay is funny.  There's lots of action in this movie, and it really moves from scene to scene.  One interesting thing is that it uses the same actors in different roles, like in the movie.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  It is a good film! The writing is well done. They are all good actors in a good story. It is not a high budget film, it is not Hollywood. But it is well made. It has all the things I look for in a movie: a good action scene, a good hero, a heroine who is not always evil but a good person with a good heart who has to deal with all these things on her own. I would like to see this story on television more, if it is to be made.

The best character of all is a little kid who has a lot of attitude and comes across like a tough guy, but is totally innocent and vulnerable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is another one of those films that have a bad reputation. But then I remember that the film is about an airplane crash that kills a child and the plane crashes. The only survivor of the crash is an airplane pilot named John Wayne. In the process of being rescued from the crash site, he is given a drug to speed his brain function so he can be saved from his injuries. This drug is called "D.W.A." (which is the initials of the drug's initials: Do-It-All-All) and it was given to him by a doctor named Dr. Peter Gerety, who is a genius who is trying to develop a new form of oxygen therapy. It is not long before this new therapy is put into use. The film is not about the drug itself, but rather about the character of John Wayne as he learns to navigate his new and unfamiliar world and navigate himself through his past. John Wayne is the epitome of the American character: strong, charismatic, handsome, intelligent, strong-willed, intelligent and brave. But what makes him so unique is that he has a hidden past, one that has been covered up to protect him from the dangers that surround him. He is an anti-hero because he is willing to sacrifice his body and his mind for the sake of saving other people from the same fate.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found out about this movie a couple of years ago after reading a review on Good Movie Reviews. I couldn't get a hold of anyone who might have a copy so I sent an email to the director asking if I could watch the film and he told me it had a good cast and a good script. I was in it from start to finish and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good romp. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a well done movie.   It is a great family movie and a movie that should not be missed!   There is a wonderful scene in the first act in which the children of the neighborhood decide to go fishing.  They are on a small boat and the boat is sinking fast. The kids decide to swim to shore but they are so worried about the boat that they swim on the opposite side of the river from the beach.  When the boat hits a bridge they are carried out to sea.  The boat is too small to keep the two boys alive.  But the boat can hold four adults and the children and the girls.  One of the girls, whose name I have forgotten, is a very brave girl.  In the last scene when the boat comes to rest, one of the two children is saved.  He is still alive, but he is barely conscious.  It must have been a miracle to save that boy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never watched a movie like this one. The best part of this movie was the ending, because even though it is a horror movie it made me want to watch it again.    A few changes were made to the story after the first movie. The first movie had only three different characters and the second movie had four different characters. This one had more characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm happy I watched this movie.   While this is not a great movie in terms of writing and acting, it has its charms in the writing.  The writing is good enough that it makes this one of the better films ever produced in the history of horror movies.  As an action film, there are some pretty cheesy moments, but the movie isn't about action, it is about a man who loses his wife to an evil monster that is after his son.  You can get away with many things in horror movies, but when it's done right, there is a special kind of magic that is achieved when the audience is sucked into the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movie which is so easy to watch and the dialogue between the characters is so funny and hilarious, you never get bored, even when the movie starts with a few bad things happening, we are never worried or annoyed, but when the story starts to get good, it gets really funny.   The movie starts off as a normal family, and then one of the little kids falls down a well. His father says that "he fell, and fell and fell, but no-one cares". Then he goes back to the well and there's nothing there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. A group of teenagers meet in the woods and try to survive the winter season, with a group of friends, including their first year.  I wasn't really looking forward to it, but boy, was I surprised by this movie.  It is a little different from your regular horror movie, but if you enjoy horror films, it is worth your time.   This is an entertaining movie, and will definitely entertain you while you are out walking around the woods, waiting for your friends to make it back. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the look of the movie.   It's got a strong storyline with a few twists and turns, with the whole film taking place in one night.  This is a well-shot movie with a darkly comedic feel, but it's also got a bit of an edge to it, with a couple of scary moments.  The main actor does well in it, and does it well, although not quite enough to make him truly iconic, as most people think.  Unfortunately there are a few plot holes that are rather glaring, and the movie just feels like it's taking place a few years in the future, with technology so advanced that humans are no longer the majority.  In the movie, there's a couple that disappear into thin air, and what the hell?  What's more likely is that someone in a UFO has taken an interest in them.  So, it's got to be the aliens from the past that have been visiting this planet.  And they have their own reasons for coming, as we are first introduced to a man who has to watch his children die.  They also make us wonder, what's with the children?  There's also a bit about a man that's apparently immortal and can go on forever.  It may be that the film was originally titled A Good Old Film, but this is not that film.  There isn't any real mystery or tension, and there's no reason for the aliens to bother coming.  We're just supposed to find a good place to go sleep, and some people are just a little too much for us.  But, all of that is swept aside, because our hero is just a good old boy, and that's all that counts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is a good one for a change! It is a "serious movie" but not in the sense that a "real movie" is a real movie. It is about the first meeting between a very bright young man (Vincent Kartheiser) and a beautiful girl (Jessica Lange) who is looking to be his "soulmate." Vincent has a very troubled childhood (and even more troubled adulthood), and he suffers a breakdown in the first scene and then spends the entire movie in his hospital bed. I'm sorry to report that it is not all that "serious."   Unfortunately, it is a movie that is not funny. It has moments that could have been funny (or funny in the best sense of the word) but they are rare. And it's very obvious that the director wanted to be funny but couldn't get it right, either because he was so preoccupied with the theme of the movie that he was incapable of finding the humor, or because he couldn't find a way to get the jokes on the screen.   If you are going to try and do a "true movie" from the point of view of someone going through a breakdown and trying to get back on his feet, and then be completely unable to do so because he's so preoccupated with the idea of "soulsmate" and how to create one with a girl he meets in his doctor's office, then you might as well just make a comedy out of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A story with a tragic plot and a tragic ending and a good ending (as much as I can say a good one) is not all that is needed for a good action movie.   While the film follows an action movie formula in terms of the villain (the villain is an evil overlord of a country who is responsible for the death of millions of his own people), it also follows a good story (the main protagonist is a man who is a victim of his tragic past and has lost his way).   Even though the film is a bit too short, it does a good job at creating a story about what it is like to be a man (not a very good man though). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a great movie, and I was surprised to find that the makers knew how to create a suspenseful mood.   It seems that there has been no good movie on the whole wide world movie screen since   The Man Who Fell to Earth,  and it's sad that this has happened.  It is also ironic that the film, with its slow pace, is about a scientist who is killed by a falling tree, when a very strange woman, with the head of a frog, comes into his life and takes him in a strange world.  But it all ends in the strangest of ways, and the film has some very surprising endings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that this is a fun, exciting, very funny and suspenseful movie about a group of boys and girls that has a bad streak but not enough to get rid of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is not hard to understand why the movie is such a success: a great actor, a wonderful screenplay, great visual effects, a great score. The picture is a little bit dull, which is understandable: it was made before CGI became big and Hollywood was getting used to it. This is just a little film about a man who loves to eat chocolate, has a wife, and his son is obsessed with him. This movie is one of those rare films that, with its wonderful actors, great performances, and a beautiful film to look at, can become a part of your life - or at least I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best films I have ever seen.   I have read the reviews about it before, I do not really understand why this is only being shown in select theatres.  The movie is well paced, well written and well acted.  I really think this is a movie you have to see at least once in your life, because you will probably never see a movie like this again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot.   It is about a young girl who is in a coma and she is looking for a person that can help her. The girl is a very good actress and in a way makes the movie funny. The movie was enjoyable and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen a lot of weird, bad, and stupid movies but this one had a unique and special weirdness to it.   It had a sense of humor in the form of a "cute kid with a crazy hat and an insane father" who lived on a farm and was obsessed with his wife.  He always seemed to be doing stupid things like getting into fights with horses and then running around naked.  I loved it when his father came into the house with a large stick and started beating his son with it, and then the kid had a weird way of punching him like a punch bowl.  This movie was like a cross between "Mommie Dearest" and "The Wizard of Oz" in that it was bizarre, hilarious, and even scary at times.  Even though the movie had a terrible ending (I found out why the movie wasn't better after seeing a new, terrible version) I still loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie doesn't really focus on any of the major plot points of the series, instead it focuses on the side characters and their various problems. This movie is very slow paced and is pretty much a collection of flashbacks to the story that will eventually be told in the next movie. It would probably be more effective if the flashbacks were shown in different scenes but, in this case, this is more effective than the best way possible.   While watching the movie I was surprised that this movie managed to capture the essence of the characters well, I didn't really expect the movie to be as good as it was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   It has everything you'd expect in a story: adventure, romance, revenge, romance-y moments and a strong female lead who isn't the typical damsel in distress (I mean, that's kind of a dumb description, isn't it?).   If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, I'll give you a moment to get your head around it.   One of the things that I particularly love about this film is the music.  The two opening songs, which I assume will appear on the soundtrack, are fantastic and the film itself has a wonderfully dark atmosphere.  I have also noticed a great deal of the cast having played music before and it gives the film a wonderful sense of nostalgia.  A lot of the scenes are set in old, creepy, abandoned towns, and the score and scenery make them seem like a classic film noir, which isn't bad for a film whose plot revolves around a ghost and a girl who hates ghosts. . It's a shame that this is the only film I can remember having a really good soundtrack and that the first film I ever saw with that soundtrack was another French film, I believe it was The Dead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As with most action movies of the past two decades, John McTiernan's Die Hard has a lot going for it: a cast of terrific actors, the spectacle of the set piece, the music, the action, the humour and the action. All of these things are good, but most of all, it's a great and satisfying action movie.      And a great action movie without a single cliché: the main action sequence is the best one ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing that struck me is that, according to the Wikipedia article about the movie, its producer, the American artist/director Roger Corman (The Canyons, Dirty Harry, The Dead Zone) had decided to have the film re-shot by Japanese cinematographers and that the movie would be screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival.   It's a nice little movie, not a lot of story, but it's well acted and the action is cool, which is rare these days.  This movie is like an un-canny version of the old Hammer Films' The Dead or The Dead From Mars, it's a fun little movie that's well-acted, has a great script, a great director and a good cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of people in the movies, my name is Bill Paxton. I am a writer of comic books. I was working in the industry in the late 70's and 80's. I wrote for the big studios, like Marvel, DC, Warner Brothers, and MGM. I worked with my good friend and fellow writer, George Zarr. In 1983, I was invited to write the screenplay for the second Batman movie. I had no idea what I was writing about until I saw it. It was the first time I had seen anything with Batman and Robin that wasn't a comic strip. So, I took my little son with me. I thought that I could teach him about the world in this new movie. The movie went over well in test screenings. My wife saw it in the theaters and we bought it together. The second Batman film was great fun to write, so I thought I would get a chance to work on a third one. And the world kept changing!   I wrote Batman and Kid Glo: The Movie and Robin, The Boy Wonder. I met George Zaccarino through my work as a consultant and he became a close friend. We wrote together a few times in between Batman and Glo. I don't know how George found the time to write for a living when he was producing so many other shows on television, but he did. And he was a very good writer. He also made me a better writer. His style was like a little old-man's. When we did Kid Gloi, it came out on DVD in 2006 and was just terrific. It's a fun little story about a kid with super powers who needs to find out about all the things he can do. But it's really fun.   Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were great, but they were not great to me. The Dark Man is very dark and I don`t want to see the Dark Man.  So I wrote a script about a detective that has lost his family in a tragedy. He is a very lonely man and has to come to terms with his grief. I think the movie will be great and will be very dark.  And a good friend of mine, Bill Finger, who is not the same guy I know today, wrote Superman: The Man of Steel.  He had great success in Batman.  But Superman: A Man of Tomorrow is a little weird for me. There are some people in Superman who

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're looking for a good, action-packed western, look no further than the "Hanging Man" series from the mid-1970's.   For a few bucks, you can find a really good western from the period.  This movie is about a bandit who gets captured by a sheriff (John Wayne) and, instead of fighting, he tries to convince the sheriff to give him a ride to a nearby settlement.  The problem is, he gets stuck in the mud, and his only hope for survival is a woman he saved who can't stand up to the mud.  After a couple of days of struggling, they make it to a new town (actually in California), and the gangster has a heart to heart with his sweetheart.  While the main story takes a turn towards romance and a woman's perspective, the film also explores the western theme of "good people trying to do good things" in a gritty and believable manner.  I like how it never stops moving, and how the actors keep up a steady pace.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a lot of the new movies coming out right now and this one definitely stands out from the crowd. I'm not sure if this was intended to be a full-on, full-color, lavish, movie, but it looks like they pulled it off pretty well. It's a beautiful and romantic story about love, redemption, and acceptance. It has a happy ending and it feels like the best movie ever made, which is saying a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is one good thing about this movie, it's that it doesn't get a 5 from me.   The film begins by establishing some of the basics:  The story starts off as an odd little story involving a group of four strangers that go to a small, remote town.  They meet a couple of town members (the town members are the town's local preacher and the town member of the local fire department).  And the story of their time in the town is weird as hell.  I'll explain:  One of the town members is obsessed with having a baby.  The problem is that he can't get it to work:  He's having trouble conceiving and the woman that he's with has no interest in getting pregnant.  At first, the story is pretty basic.  They get to know each other, they get to visit some of their acquaintances.  Then, the town decides that they want to get together and play a board game.  It turns out to be a pretty bad idea, but what's even worse is that the person who's supposed to be the "player" has a really long and annoying accent (this is the preacher's wife).   There's lots of comedy and a couple jokes about race, but the real reason for the story's existence is something completely ridiculous:  The town decides to put up a boardgame.  This is the first time the town actually put something up.  But it turns out that a woman has taken it down and it turns into a horrible, nasty, and horrible game.   It's so bad that the entire time, the man playing the game looks like he's about to throw up.   The town refuses to take it down, so the man plays another, more terrible game. After a while, all of the players get really bored, so they decide to start making fun of the game. The joke gets so bad (and is so bad) that the woman gets so fed up that she leaves.  There are some really stupid things in this movie:   One of my favorites is how one guy plays the game as if it's a real, live board game, which is so stupid.   This guy makes so many errors, it is obvious that he is trying to cheat and has been since the game was put up.  Another favorite is a couple who are so obsessed with this game that they go to the store every week to look

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed it immensely. I watched it at the beginning of the year and I must say I enjoyed this movie. It had a lot going on that was a great ride. There is action, suspense and heart. There were a few slow parts here and there but for the most part it was entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of good stuff here.   It has a very unique and quirky flavor which is very much at odds with the very serious and serious-ish themes that most films deal with.  I think that the author was trying to write a character-driven adventure, and it seems to have succeeded.  This is a good adventure for a good, good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of the old Hollywood "diversity" and "daringness" that is a constant feature of many films made during the last two decades. As in the first three films, it is a story in which the leading characters have more to say than the audience. As with the others, the plot involves a plot for revenge, for a woman who committed a crime against the most powerful man in the world (with her lover), and for a man who wants to prove he is the greatest detective the world has ever seen. It's a very good movie, with great acting, a very bad theme song (the best part of the movie), and a plot that gets better.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When we first see our little sister-in-law, Anna, on the subway in the rain, a stranger asks, "Did you forget that it was raining?"  The film's director, Joe Mantegna, is probably one of the best directors working in the last decade or so.   Like a lot of his films, it's about family, but it's also about being an outsider.  His daughter, Anna (Holly Hunter), is trying to cope with a horrible loss by going to school, and there are two strangers (Paul Mantegno and Robert Duvall) who are looking for her.  Mantegne does a nice job with a very short run-time: the film starts with an incident at a friend's wedding when Anna loses her glasses.  It then goes to a party at which Anna runs into a man she hasn't seen for years, her older brother (James Spader).  It continues with Anna's sister, Shirley (Melinda Dillon) going back to their childhood home, while the main characters discuss a case at the police department.  I found that the ending was kind of creepy, but the characters and their interactions in the movie were quite nice.  When Anna's father, Ralph (John Cazale), asks if her parents are OK with her going to a school for the deaf, we don't know what to think.  He was a deaf man and he used to take his daughter to see him all the time, but she hasn�t seen him since she was 4, so it seems odd that she would decide to go to the school, which doesn�t even have an interpreter!  The next morning we learn that her father and brother are having breakfast, but they have a long conversation in which they say many times that they would like to go back to seeing her.   When Anna, who is already very isolated, meets a new kid named Danny (Robert DuvALL) and they play games, Anna decides she wants to go too.  We never really know what is going to happen in the next scene, which involves a lot more of Anna in her new environment: school, school, a swimming pool.  The girl in the pool, who has been watching Anna, gets angry and goes to the principal.  Anna is afraid to go out into the rain again so the next morning she does a good deed by calling for help.  One of the characters in the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most obvious thing I like about this movie is the fact that it is set in a city of the future. I really liked that and it was funny, well made, and I liked how they tried to give us an alternative to the future, and it turned out to be a bad movie. It had a lot of good elements in it, but didn't come together for me, and while I was watching the movie I was laughing out loud at several places and the movie kept getting better and better.   This is a movie about a cop who is a good cop, but when a terrorist goes after him and kills his wife he goes on a killing spree. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm in love with the movie   This is one of my favorite movies   One of my biggest pet peeves is movies that take themselves too seriously.   In this movie, the story is a great deal more interesting than the premise would lead you to believe.  To me, there are no real plot twists; the movie has a strong narrative to tell.  I've said it before and I'll say it again:  I think "Killing Them Softly" is one movie that should be watched by everybody, especially young people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like other reviewers here have stated, this is one of the best horror films ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of science fiction and this is the one of the most impressive ones I've seen. It's not the most imaginative thing in the world but there's definitely something different about this.   The film was directed by Ken Loach.  He did a couple of other short films and this one is a masterpiece of a science fiction thriller.  If you're in to science fiction, I'd suggest that you see this first.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would not rate a movie above 6 stars without giving it a massive ego stroke, because this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.   What made it so great?   1.  The acting was so realistic that even a five year old could enjoy it.  2.  Its plot, which was very short, and very entertaining to watch, left no room for interpretation.  3.  It was such a joy to see Tom Hanks again, in such an interesting movie.  4.  For my money, it is the best movie that Hanks has ever been in.  5.  There's so much action, and such a great plot, that it could easily have been rated a 7-star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, it's a movie made by Japanese with English subtitles.   It's a very good movie, like a cross between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Great Wall.   The story is about a young, Chinese boy who is taken by pirates from a small village.  To get them to stop their attack on his village, he disguises himself as a samurai and meets the pirates.  He and his friends will learn about the pirates from their leader, a woman named Wu.  The movie is also about the Chinese and their struggle to survive in a different society.  If you enjoyed the earlier movies of the trilogy, you will love this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has so much good stuff going for it that I am willing to give it an 8.   The story follows three characters: a man who is on a lonely journey to find himself, a woman who is trying to find a man to be with, and a child who is finding a child to be his friend.  All the characters are believable in their own way and I loved their interactions.  There are some really good jokes throughout the movie and even in the ending.  Overall, this is a great story with some really great jokes and a great ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie since it was on TV, so it is a treat to revisit this classic for this year's 25th anniversary celebration.   The original, about a New York City police detective assigned to the case of a murdered girl, has never had a film release.  It was made for a relatively small amount of money.  The director, John Landis (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) didn't really do a lot with the material.  He could have made the movie about a small-time bank robber with a high IQ (Mr Babbitt) or a crooked bank manager (Mr Horsfall).   Mr Babbit and Mr Hors fall for a beautiful woman (Janet Leigh) and try to make a deal.  But she turns them both out of the job and is killed by a bomb.  Mr Hensfall is killed later in the same incident.  John Landers' script for the police detective is simple and doesn't really have much to say.  This movie has become much better since the release of the 1993 video version (with a new score by the late, great composer Bernard Herrmann).  This is a very good example of the early years of filmmaking, when good stories were written with a view to making a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What does it mean?   This is a good film with a good story.   It is about a young man who is in love with his best friend who is married.  The man is called Jules (Eddie Murphy) a successful entrepreneur who makes a fortune when his invention is developed and used.  Jules was an athlete before his accident.  His accident took the place of his leg. Jules is so interested in getting a real leg like that of his friend, Mr. Niv (Ron Silver), who was in the movie version of 'The Sting'.  Jule is going to marry his best girlfriend, Evelyn (Mia Farrow), but Mr. Farrow doesn't want to be with Jules until he is married to Evelyn.  One day Jules walks by a party of young people and they make fun of him, saying he would never find someone like Evelyn who he could make happy.  They say that he would get jealous if they were with Evelyn because he would be with her.  So Jules invites some of his friends, and he and his friends go to a party.  Evelyn is jealous when Jules goes to the party. The guys make fun off Jules when they ask if he has a girlfriend. Evelyn gets mad at Jules because he doesn't know what to say to her. Jule then comes up with a plan to get rid of Evelyn from Jules's heart.  But the plan isn't very good.  She sees that Jules really wants to be in love, and when he comes up and gets the leg, she doesn't see any problem with him.  When he goes to kiss her, her heart stops.  At the hospital, Evelyne is dying. Jase (Ron Goldman) tells her, "I will marry you, but I will never kiss you," and when she asks why not, he says he can't see his eyes.  As Evelyn's body fails, Jules sees an opportunity and gets rid of her. Evelynes mother tells Jules she can come along in her coffin, and Jules thinks it's time to leave.  After they are gone, Evelynn's mom says she knows a guy who can make a good wife for Jules.  He's called Larry (Keegan-Michael Key).  But when J.M. (Cameron Diaz) shows
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins with a girl in an apartment building with no windows.   This is set up to become a psychological thriller.  The apartment building is one of the many buildings that were built along the shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay in the mid to late 1800s.  It is run down, run down.  One of the residents is named Elizabeth "Birdie" Hill.  This girl is not very bright.  She is also a bit odd, which is reflected in the manner in which she moves about. She often sits with her legs in her lap, her head in her hands, and her eyes fixed on the ground, or the opposite wall.  Elizabeth's mother is dead, her brother is not too well off, and Elizabeth has little to her name except a little pocket money, which she uses to buy things on the street.  Hill's mother was a housewife and a single mother.  I found this film to be very well written.  There are several oddities about Elizabeth's life.  First, she is constantly surrounded by her two brothers.  These two boys are not very good people. They drink, fight, and beat the shit out of each other.  Even though Elizabeth does not like them, she does not seem to like the two boys as well.  As an example, when they are not beating the living daylights out of one another, they are in a brawlin' fight.  Their mother died a short time ago, and they have little or no respect for her.  Her sisters do not even seem to know her very well. Her mother is portrayed in the film as a very bad mother. Although it is clear that her brothers are bad, she seems to be in the same category.  While the film portrays her as a bit weird, it is also obvious that she is not much better than her siblings.  Although Elizabeth has a few things going for her, she has the same problem that so many of the people she lives with have.  They are both kind of crazy, and also in the habit of beating the shit of one other at a moment's notice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      It's not as good as the earlier entries but it's still a worthwhile flick with enough action to keep the audience guessing.   The bad:  In a film packed with action, the only real character in this film is the villain, played by  John Malkovich.  This is a character I would've liked to see as a child, not only because of his face but because of the way he speaks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very excited to watch this movie, I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and finally got it a while back.   This movie is a modern classic, and for that matter is a very good movie.  In a movie about World War One, one of the characters is a Canadian named Claude F. Czerny. He is a highly educated person, a scientist with a lot of expertise and a very high opinion of himself. He's in the front lines, he knows what he is doing, he is a good guy, and he loves his wife very much. His life is not easy, his regiment is suffering from many different problems, including being understaffed and lacking in many things. Claude is a young man who likes to talk and is very good at the game of hockey, but he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. He never really leaves the frontlines, so he can play hockey. As the war continues, he sees more and more that the war is a terrible thing and he wishes he could change his life, he would like to be a part of a society that does not have war. He also feels bad about not being able to help the other boys, he doesn't want to make war worse and he doesn´t want to take a life.  Claude becomes disillusioned, but still believes that he can make a difference and he can be a better man than his regiment.  When the war ends and the Canadians are free to go home, Claude is very happy, his wife loves him very much and he has a new life, and a new dream.  He is one of those guys who just keeps dreaming and wants to get to the next level, even though he knows it´s very hard to do, and it would take a lot out of him.  Eventually Claude finds a place where he is free to do his job. He and his wife run a bar, and Claude starts to make new friends and find that even though they may not believe it, there is a lot more to the world than war.  I thought the movie had a real sense of the seriousness of the war and the hardships and suffering in it.  While I can not speak to the history of the War, I will say that I found the movie entertaining.  It was very enjoyable and I enjoyed seeing all the characters.  The cinematography was very good and I liked seeing the sights

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I had to make sure I'd seen it before a film festival. It was so good, I wasn't afraid to be there."   From this point on, I'll be including a review from each movie in order.   There are three movies, and a short-story that is a bit more than a quickie.  The first, "The Day of the Triffids," shows the consequences of a comet hitting Earth.  There's a brief glimpse of the planet from Mars in one scene, but it is rather brief.  After it hits, however, there's an almost complete wipeout.  This isn't a good omen for humanity.  Then there's the story "Citizen Kane" (1941), which is a very different story.  It's about the trials and tribulations of a group of people trying to overcome a very difficult time.  One character, for instance, was a circus freak with a large brain and he was afraid that he'd be in trouble.  But that wasn't what he worried about.  That's a real story. "Citadel" is also very different from the other two movies, but not in a bad way.  At times, this is a little too fast and loose, but I like it.  "Gangster Squad" shows the side of law enforcement that most people don't see and is more interesting.  You also get to see a side of society that most don't get to.  All three films are worth seeing, but in a different order.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the last decade, a lot of Hollywood has tried to make a comedy about a country club, and failed miserably. The film begins with a couple who are discussing the state of their relationship. One of the male guests is complaining about the fact that his girlfriend isn't home. One the female guests, who is visiting from England is very excited. After she leaves, the male guest remarks "Well, what was I saying about her not being home? I'm sure she was having a great time here." This is a very unoriginal movie. In the opening sequence, a young man named Tom (Hugh Grant) asks a beautiful female model (Jill St. John) out to a club. The model is very flirtatious with Tom, and when Tom refuses she pulls a knife out and says "Go on Tom, let's be a couple. Why don't you take me out to this nice new club and I'll give you the night of your life?" Tom's response to the suggestion is "I'm not interested in you."   And that is exactly what we get. While some people enjoy watching a good comedy, I am not one of them.   I am interested in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that, in terms of pure entertainment value, this is a pretty good flick.   This was a decent horror movie.  The acting was good, and I thought the whole thing was done well.  In this one, we get a bit more information on the creature in the first two minutes.  It was cool.  I don't know why it didn't seem to scare me away at the beginning like it could have.  They should have added more and more detail about the creature's appearance, and then it would have been a lot more scary.  This movie is really well made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most obvious reason to pick this movie up is because it's a horror film about zombies, one of the most annoying things in modern films.   It's a pretty unoriginal premise though and although I enjoyed it, the ending just didn't work for me.  The story's pretty simple and the acting is fairly average, although I guess that's expected in a low budget film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll put it this way:    The film is a fairly simple story.   There's a young man (Michael Dorn) who is obsessed with a mysterious woman (Dana Delany) and she becomes something of a mother to him.  Then things get bizarre.  Dorn is a man who knows a lot about love, but he's also a man with a lot of secrets.  There is a scene in the middle of the movie when a man is watching Dorn and Delany in bed and it's hard to make out what's going on.    It's a strange scene, like watching a guy who is so into his girlfriend that he is willing to be nude in front of her and even kiss her.  It's also pretty disturbing.  I guess Dorn has something in common with Dostoyevsky's The Idiot   which is said to be about a man whose obsession with his wife has led to him becoming a criminal.  Perhaps Dorn will become the sort of criminal Dostoevsky imagined, a man obsessed with his own sexuality and so uninterested in anyone else's.  That sounds like something out of the film that was about a group of people who used to live together, but I'm sure it's not.  A good movie, but a film you should only watch if you really want to watch something pretty.

Once he takes a ride it turns out the package was a bomb and the voice belongs to a deranged scientist. Chris starts to work on a bomb with the help of the other scientist and the rest of the group. However, the man with the voice decides to be the bad guy by blowing up the town. Chris and the other group are the only survivors.   ~  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is the sort of movie that if you haven't seen it, you're missing out on an important piece of cinema history.   Directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and starring a strong performance from Peter Graves (who played his first leading role in a decade with this film), the story takes place in a small, bucolic town in rural Canada.   After a winter storm, the kids of the village have the winter blues, and are getting a little rowdy.  Their mother is a little nervous about the way they're behaving, but can't do anything about it because she doesn't have the money to keep them from going wild.  One of the boys decides to get out of the house, and gets stuck in a car with a group of boys on the way to the big town.  As they're driving through the town and the boys are acting a little rough, they run into a group that has been making trouble in the neighbourhood, and that's when the real trouble starts.  A series of unfortunate events lead to a police raid on the village, where a lot of the town's men are killed, and the local boys are arrested and put in the pen.  After being kept in a cell for a long time, a young boy is released, and starts running around the town.   Unfortunately, the villagers have been drinking, and one of them manages to get hold of a gun and starts shooting up the houses and killing the townspeople.  It is at this point that the town falls apart, and everything comes to a head.  The town has been split in two, with the original inhabitants (of the village) now being refugees, and some of the townsfolk being now prisoners of the former rulers of the land.  Both groups are desperately trying to get back to the place where they came from, which is in different directions, so they will both end up fighting for what is left of their own people.  This is the only part of the film that I didn't like, I think, and it is one of the reasons I didn'st like it much.  However, there are some good parts, and I found the story interesting and engaging.  Unfortunately, it also isn't the best film that Bogdanovic has ever made, and has a few flaws in it.  Firstly, there is a few plot holes, especially with the police raid.  Secondly, there isn't a lot
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film about how you can have a bad day or a good day and there are a lot of people that think the same thing. I think it is good that the director gave it a shot.   The movie is funny and I liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After being let down by a number of good films in the 90s, the last decade has been a bit of a letdown.   For all the buzz about this film, I don't think I've seen anything that's as bad as this.  I mean, there are scenes in this that are genuinely offensive.  One has a woman wearing a thong bathing suit and eating a cookie.  Another has a young boy having his penis cut off, and then later having it stuffed back into his arse with a toothpick.  There is also a bit where a male character with an ugly-looking face is shown being pushed down a slide by his two young male mates.  This movie is just so stupid, so cringingly stupid, it's almost funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful movie.   From the opening scenes with the opening credits to the last where they are celebrating the victory, it all comes together beautifully.  The actors were good.  I would have preferred a slightly younger lead, but they did a good job in this movie. This is an American movie and it does play to its audience.  When the soldiers from the States come and talk with the Russians, they have a lot of fun.  One of the reasons they come is the beautiful girl they met on the bus.  This film has a lot more of a feel of a Hollywood movie than a "real" one.  Some of the shots and sequences are too short and do not build up.  But this is a good action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie as well, though I wasn't expecting anything too interesting or unique. There were a few moments when I thought about the movie in a dreamlike way that was so beautiful, I felt like I was living it, or it was some sort of alternate dimension where I was being watched by a handsome young man who wanted to take me back to earth to live with him. The best part about this movie, however, was the love story at the end.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the end, I still think that "Killing Them Softly" is a very good movie. The movie's plot is excellent, and the movie takes a humorous look at modern American military life and the perils that await them. This movie doesn't have anything special to say about modern American warfare, and it's definitely not a masterpiece, but it's probably the best military comedy I've ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really surprised by this movie, in my opinion it was not the best movie i have ever seen but it was well worth it   It was definitely more entertaining than   The Muppet Movie  !   My brother and I actually started watching this movie in the movie theater, I can't remember the exact date but   when   we were watching it  we didn't like it  but it wasn't that bad, maybe the kid was a bit  annoying but then again i don't think   he was in the best place to act   so i guess that's why i didn't really like it very much, i still remember a really funny scene in it but i don t think i would be willing to do that for a really long movie   But, I still love it even though i can't really figure out why   the other kids were so mean to the kids in the first movie so i think  it was because they thought   that it was the new Muppet Show  !!   If you want a movie that will bring a smile to your face   then this is definitely the movie !!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the movie I was waiting for.   I was also looking for a good thriller to watch with my girlfriend (who didn't understand a word in it, so my wife said she'd wait for a DVD copy and watch it with me. I haven't seen a good suspense movie since Gone in 60 Seconds.  The first half of the movie is great.  First half of a movie that starts off so good that I'm sure it'll be one of the best in its genre.  It's like a good Hitchcock movie.  I couldn't put it down.  At one point in the movie, you'll be in a room with three men trying to take a guy out in a car.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this movie that will keep you hooked.  This movie is not for everybody.  Fans of thrillers will love it.  So watch it and see if you like it. If you do, then go watch it again in 3 months. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is actually a really good movie. It's very entertaining and a lot of fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie had it all.   The film started off quite slow, but not to the point where it becomes a bore.  They kept you interested in the movie by using scenes and moments that will stick with you, even if you don't like the rest of the movie.  The movie has plenty of twists and turns, the best scene to me is when the police get to the scene where the accident occurred, and the whole time it was just so funny to me.  When you're watching this movie you'll see lots of funny stuff and plenty of action.  I love this movie so much I would do anything to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is, at heart, a sort of retelling of a popular stage play about the life and adventures of a young man named John Wilkes Booth.   There are some interesting elements in this film: it is a sort-of adaptation of a stage play with a few changes and additional scenes, and a lot of interesting characters, and an unusual setting.  John Wilke's father is a rich man, a member of a very exclusive club of "American" millionaires and members of which include President Lincoln's brother and Booth's step-mother.  But the Wilkeses are wealthy because they bought a plot of land in western Virginia and built a mansion which they then sold and moved to New York.  The other important figures in the story are a local minister, a former Confederate officer, and the wife of a wealthy Confederate colonel, who may be a Confederate spy.  Booth is a young, handsome Confederate soldier, who is fascinated by the idea of becoming a minister and goes about setting up his own "Christian" ministry.  He has two daughters, Emily and Elizabeth, and another daughter, Mary, who comes to visit him.  A young man (Booth's love interest, Robert Sall) comes into his life, and Booth has to come to terms with what it means to be a man of the "West."   I found this film very enjoyable, but it is not a film I'd recommend everyone see.

It has great production value. It is a fun movie. And it is worth seeing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I don't know where to start. I really like this movie. I liked it so much that I watched it three times, with the third watch coming around the time I read this review. The first time I watched, I was worried that it would be too similar to the first movie, so I was watching it over and over. This movie wasn't as bad as the first. It is better than the first, but it is still pretty much the same movie. This one takes a few more things from the first (i.e. the guy who tells the story, his sister's friend, etc) and is even better than before.   I have to give a huge thank you to Chris Columbus for the first two movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the previous movie, The Dark Side of the Moon (1966) is a beautiful, suspenseful, psychedelic adventure. I think it's one of those "unexplained" films that has left me with an appreciation for its artistry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love the movie.   It's a beautiful picture, one of the best movies of all time.  It depicts the early days of the civil war.  You'll love how the movie is filled with funny dialog, wonderful characters, and a very good ending.  The movie is a simple story about the hardships of war. There are no fancy action sequences or stunts in the movie; it's just a simple depiction of one man's life, his love of his friends, his hatred of slavery, his dream of freedom.  What's amazing is how the story is told.  One simple man with no fancy clothes, no gun, and no horse tries to survive.  There are many things we see that seem like clichés, and even the people we know come across as being simplistic.  But I think there's something truly good about the movie, and it's worth checking out.  Recommended for fans of the Civil War, or of World War II.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I said in my review of the original, it's a good idea, and it works well enough. I'm not sure the script is great, but the acting is good. The special effects are pretty good. I guess the biggest problem is the whole whole war thing going wrong.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot of this movie was pretty simple but the ending was pretty satisfying.    As the main character, the character known as "The Master" had a hard time in finding the one girl to marry after a life of trouble and failure.  He eventually gets a chance to meet one, and for some reason he is impressed with her beauty and intelligence.  The rest of the plot consists of some typical bad guy plots that is just bad and not funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have a good memory, you can remember that this film is not only a comedy but it's also a romance, a film about a woman with a secret. It is a good film but it needs a bit more to bring it to life.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie as much as the last movie I watched.   This movie isn't a movie about the end of the world but a movie that shows how people are affected by the situation.  As a fan of a certain TV show called "I Am Jazz," I think that this movie showed how jazz musicians who played in a church band (one which was also the church band of a church) were affected by what happened.  What this movie doesn't show is how the church itself was affected by it, especially in the way that people were affected.  That was one of the things I loved about the movie - the contrast between the music and the way people reacted to it.  It didn't show the people at all who were affected in the church but rather the people playing in the band.  The way that they reacted to the music is very different than the way in which we react to music.  This is another movie I really enjoyed watching because of its contrast between what the music symbolized, the way it affected people, and how the film was made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is not bad. The way that the whole thing is framed is good. The performances are good. This movie is more a comedy and less a drama.   This movie has a "what if" plotline and that really does make it better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of things happen in this movie.   The movie is not about sex, violence, or any kind of sexual perversion.  The point of the movie is about how men's sense of humor gets twisted into something sexual.  After a group of young kids laugh about sexual things in a locker room, they find a guy who is willing to give it a go.  When the girl who plays the "joke" asks him what he does, he just tells her that he is a guy and that his job is to give women a good time.  I like this movie, and I like the fact that this movie is so non-sexual.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot and I really liked the script.   It's a simple tale about a little boy and a big wolf who love each other.  This is a classic story of a boy and big wolf and they need each other to survive.  It shows how even when the wolf is stronger than the boy he can still find a place for love.  I really like this movie and it was easy to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really great. I was disappointed when I heard they were changing it to the French version, but I don't care. This movie shows some amazing fights and I just love the French voice cast. I didn't get the whole story about how the film is about a boy who has to help his grandmother. The movie is set in France, so it's set in the late 1800's, but it's not that long. The people in the movie live on a farm, and the whole family seems to have lived on that farm their whole lives. It's just a short movie, and it's great to watch, and to see some really cool fights.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a great story, and it takes the time to get to know all of the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a movie about a dog who has a habit of jumping over a fence at random, even though the owner was told not to let him jump any more than two feet off the ground.    This dog is actually very funny, and even funny enough to make us laugh out loud, despite the fact that it's actually really sad, since the dogs' owners are really nice people.  This is also a very sad movie, and if the dogs could talk, they'd probably say that it doesn't bother them.  The only reason I rated this a little higher is because of the fact it has a great ending, but that's really only because it doesn?t end there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As someone who's already watched this movie and loved it, I feel like I'm giving a 3 star rating instead of a 5 star rating.   It is definitely a good idea and very entertaining to see how the various "characters" (i.e. the other characters in the movie) react to a "disaster" and try to save their friend in the midst of it all.  It's definitely a better idea than what I was expecting, and I'm not sure I would've seen that coming from someone who is more of a horror movie enthusiast.  I did watch the movie twice and was shocked by how well it all worked out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It's great fun with a great sense of humor.

The movie was not very good, yet there is a lot of excitement in it, as well as something more to it, some really good scenes, some of the best acting in a long time, great cinematography and some great stunts, great effects, but the ending was not really great either, because it doesn't justify all the time spent in it: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know how this film is called The Day After Tomorrow   but this film had a very special feel to it.   For me, this is the film that started my interest in science fiction.  At first I was just seeing a bunch of different sci fi movies, but then I stumbled upon this one.  There were so many good lines in this film, it made me laugh so hard!   When I saw the trailer for this film I thought, wow, it's a good film.  I really like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A friend of mine had seen a movie called "Gilda" about a group of misfits who become friends at a camp where they have to live among the "Gannys" (Giants) in an old house that is a parody of the Gilded Age. It was hilarious to watch the Gannys try to fight the "real" Gannies in an "epic battle". One of my friends and I tried to imitate the Gilders with our "Ginger" outfits at a party and we were both ridiculed by the other kids (who weren't even really Gilder-esque - we were just silly kids). So, after I watched a second "Gilder" film (also called "The New Gildar" or "The Gilda's" in the English version) about a young man who is forced to fight a Gilderous and a Gilda, I decided I must see "Gimme Shelter."   I don't know why the hell I did this but I felt I needed to see "the good 'ol' days" of Gilda. This film was funny, I don.t know what more could be said but I thought it was really good.   It has a few laughs and then the action really heats up. I was very pleased with this film. I am very happy that I watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very excited to see the trailer when I found out that it was about a guy named Ben who lived in the future. Then I saw the movie. Wow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie and the story as a whole.   The story and characters were good, but there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and plot points that just kept piling up for what seemed like a long time.  I was glad to see that the actors were really well-trained, but it was hard to feel for them, because I wanted to punch the little bastards and throw the broken statues across the room.  At one point a character gets shot, but we don't see his corpse or hear the gunshot.  We only hear a dull thud when the bullet hits the victim's head.  Even with those annoying moments, the story was very good and the characters were interesting.  There are a few moments that just don't work.  For example, we see a man get shot with a sniper rifle, but then we see the sniper's face clearly in the reflection of the lens.  The character then has a flashback to when he was a young boy and he is watching a man in the woods with a gun.  Unfortunately, the film was too long, and too boring.  It was hard for me to care about the characters and the setting.  Overall, I enjoyed it a lot and would probably watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun, well-acted movie that can be enjoyed without any serious connotations (that's why it's not called 'Buddhist'  ).   Unlike the other films, this one does not use the same story, but rather a story taken from another book, the Chinese folk tale "Wu Jie Xing"   (Wu Xing is a man who lost his way, who found a dead body in the forest. He picks up the head and buries it in his shoe. A girl follows him to the village and becomes his mistress.   So, in a nutshell, this is an old Chinese tale told in a Chinese style.  I did find it more enjoyable that the last two films .  I think I prefer this one to the last one   because it is more funny   and has a better storyline  .  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not expect much of the film at all.   It was so over the top, it was fun, but the whole thing felt like a joke.  A movie about a clown, with a whole lot of goofy moments, lots of "BORING" moments, and some silly moments that seem like they had no reason to be in there, but weren't.  It made me laugh out loud at times, it had a LOT of goofy situations, it's a bad movie, but it did entertain me for a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last few years in China has seen a huge rise in films with good plot, but not much of a plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "The Big Lebowski" (1993) is a classic.   There are many ways of describing it.  It's a "what the hell" comedy.  The main character is a leech who gets caught in an underground bar.  He wants to get clean, so he does a deal with the boss of the bar to get the key to the vault.  One of the characters is a rich guy who has everything he needs.  While getting what he needs he runs into the bartender who steals from him to give to his wife.  His wife is a heroin addict and is using their home for a drug den.  This is pretty much the setup for the story.  So how does this movie do it?   I'll leave it to others to explain the plot points.  There is some fantastic dialog, including a very amusing "The Dude" character and the famous line: "Hey Dude, what are you looking at?"  The film is set in a fictionalized version of Colorado.  I wish I could remember where this one was filmed, as it's so well shot.  They take advantage of that natural setting, using the setting of Colorado to great effect.  However, for all that I loved the film, I think it's got some issues.  Firstly, there is a large amount of action.  Even for a "big lebowski," there is very little.  If you like a lot of action, then the movie may not be for you.  A "bob leb" is a pretty big guy, and the character doesn't look all that big to me.  And there are a few times where there are some pretty impressive camera angles.  But there isn't a whole lot of plot here.  That may be because the plot is all over the place.  What the movie is is a satire of the "The Lebkewitz" bar, as the bar owner is a big fan of The Dude, and they even dress up like him (I've been looking for the lebkowskis' theme song!).  I'm not sure what to make of this one, but it's pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent, well-told, and fun movie, and not just a movie - a story.   This movie reminds me of the great old cartoons I watched as a child, and some of the old radio plays from the 40s.  It's a very well-acted, very well animated movie, with plenty of great dialog and good humor.  All of this is balanced out by the beautiful visuals and fantastic musical score.  This is a movie that I would highly recommend - it's a great example of a true story told in an entertaining way, and with great characters to match. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good thing that I can watch a film and go to sleep without worrying about spoilers.   I don't really understand why there's so much controversy about the ending of this movie, other than the fact that the guy's son is still alive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So if you didn't know who Richard Gere was before, and you did see the movies he's in, you might think he was a bad dude.   But in truth he is one of the most talented actors alive, and this movie is no exception.  He really knows what he's doing, playing the part of a guy who is trying to find love and respect for his daughter, and not knowing how to do it.  It's kind of like watching a little girl play with a little boy in a car.  His wife (Jena Malone) is the same way, and the two of them make for a nice little trio.  The movie really needs some editing help, because even with all that talent on display, it's still hard to follow the plot.  There's too much going on, and it's hard to get the whole story.  But it's worth the watch, especially if you liked the earlier movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of American action movies, you'll love this one.   With no dialog, dialogue is very minimal, and there are hardly any action scenes.  Like a lot of Westerns, the guns are so overpowered that it's almost like a computer-generated show, which is kind of cool, but you get the sense that the guns would be just as effective if you didn't have a computer running them.  A lot of the action involves high speeds and a lot more than I can write about here.  This movie is just as much about people as it is about guns.  There is a lot to like about this movie, and it should be available on DVD soon.  I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I'm guessing the same story happens again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not going to tell you the movie was good, it was amazing, the actors, the directing, the production, and the acting.   There were a lot of different characters in this movie and the director made it work.  I really enjoyed this movie, I recommend you watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a remake of a movie with the same name. I am not a huge fan of remake/sequels, but this remake was not bad at all. I liked it a lot. It has a lot of jokes and characters who seem a bit "stupid" and out of it. The movie is short but it does not seem rushed. The special effects are okay but nothing bad. I think it is worth checking out but I don't think it will be a big movie like the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great because it is one of the better action films I have ever seen, a good balance of comedy and drama.   I'm not sure how they could have made it any better, because it has a story that seems very easy to follow, but the real genius of the movie is that the action sequences are really thrilling and scary.   The only thing that makes the movie a tad boring is the ending.  I could easily see this movie being a hit for any action fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a good time!   As a "newcomer" to the movie industry, I can't help but say that I like this movie!  From the "new comer" bit I've noticed that there are a lot of young actors in this movie, and they all seem to be doing well in their roles.   I did have some problems with this film, but mostly because I felt the same way a lot as I did when I watched the movie "Sid and Nancy" the other day.  For the most part, these children are getting through the first half of the movie with a little difficulty.  After their parents find out about the curse, they have to make a choice of whether to go on with the curse that caused it to happen in the first place, or accept the curse's removal from them.  They don't really have any choice, but they do make one very important choice: They take a little girl they see on a street corner (a "nanny", as they refer to her) and give her to a young man, who in turn takes the child to the house of an elderly couple.  It seems that the older couple had been cursed too, and their house has been set on fire.  Thereafter, the "nannies" are sent to various locations, trying to find a way to rid the house (in case it's already set on flames) and save the couple from certain death.  Unfortunately, this is the part where the film takes a dive into cliché:  One of the children gets lost in the woods; the "kids" are then sent out to find him.  One woman is killed by a rat; one of the "Kids" is killed when a woman walks in on him having sex; and others just make the children feel terrible for letting the older man die.  At one point, it's mentioned that the children have to go to school, and that's where the problems start for them.   In fact, the film seems to be more about the kids than it is about the adults, and I think that is the point.  The children are the ones who do a better job of solving the problems in this film.  I would say that the "Children" do a lot more in this short movie than most adults would do in an hour.  Some of the dialogue seems to come off a little childish, like the first couple lines of this review
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was initially turned off by this movie from the very first scene. I'm going to get into a little bit more detail about why I didn't like this movie, but it's really best to just watch it for yourself.    It starts off with the main character, Ben, who is played by Tim Blake Nelson.  He is an intelligent, but not very bright, kid that likes to get in fights.  The movie takes place in the backwoods of North Carolina.  At the time of this film, it wasn't as wild a place as today's movies.  Ben is living in a trailer behind a river and when he hears a woman calling his name, he runs to see who it is.  We don't get to see what this woman has to say, but we are sure it isn't good.  Before we get to the good part, we have Ben meet up with his brother, who doesn't know Ben is his brother and Ben's mother.  They are all sitting around and talking about a man that they all know.  It's hard to tell, but his head looks like a turtle shell.  Unfortunately for Ben and his family, he gets picked up by some men who kill him.  This brings Ben back to the trailer, where he meets his mother and father, who both think he is dead.  So, after killing a few more guys who were just coming over to say hello to Ben, the two people that killed him, Ben's brother and a local hunter, get the drop on Ben and then just take him away, leaving Ben on his own.  As we can see, this movie isn't a good time at all, but Ben doesn't really care, because he is too scared to tell anyone what happened.  I'm pretty sure the reason he doesn't tell anyone is because his mother says that if she ever finds out about it, she will kill him as well.  There are a lot of kids in this movie and it's hard for me to know which ones are good, and which ones aren't.  These kids have some really bad traits, including:   a) all of them having a bad attitude; b) all children talking in a bad way; c) no kids wanting to be with Ben; d) no adults really caring about the kids; e) a lot more violence than you would think; f) no sense of humor; g) no characters like Ben
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I'm glad to see a remake of a good picture." - James M. Cain   This is the first and last time we see "The Last Man on Earth" as a "science-fiction" film.   The only difference between this movie and "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid" is the title (and the fact that the "Last Man on earth" was a woman).   There was a reason for this title:  This was the first film to portray man as a species of the apes.  I have seen a lot of movies where humans were portrayed as the smarter ape and the apes as the dumb human.  This movie has "man" as the smart ape and "ape" as dumb human and is a great example of the two races being shown as separate and separate.  The movie had a good cast of supporting actors including Edward Dmytryk and George Reeves who were also excellent in the movie.  If you have a favorite ape movie, it should be "The Man Who Saved the Apes"   As usual, "The last man on earth," made me laugh, cry and appreciate life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a nice action movie that was very good for the time.   I don't like many martial arts movies like that but this one had a little romance and I enjoyed that a lot.  I was really excited to watch this one but I couldn't wait to see the finale.  My only complaint is that the final fight scene felt too rushed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first encounter with "The Devil's Advocate" was an event in itself. I was in my parents' garage in the suburbs of Boston, listening to a collection of mostly banal but entertaining radio plays performed by various comedians, most notably Richard Pryor, with whom I was already acquainted and enjoying. On the air, they had been doing a segment about the trial of a convicted killer in Chicago and his defense lawyers. The theme was, as usual, a defense of law and order, and one could guess from the title that the show would be mostly about the case, with the lawyer on trial as a sort of devil. In fact, the comedian had a similar defense, but it didn't get off. I don't know the name of the show, but I remember it fondly.   The second I heard it, I knew I had to see it. It was so fast-paced that you almost had to be there to see all the jokes. It wasn't.  I didn't find out about the movie until later, when I was reading up on it in a copy of an old science fiction magazine called The Galaxy. It didn't give me much hope, but then I read a synopsis and realized it wasn't just an entertaining television comedy but a serious piece of work.  The movie, directed by the great Howard Hawks and starring Frank Sinatra, is full of comic bits that are at times funny but are mostly just silly. At times, like in the first half of the film, it is very funny, though the jokes aren't very clever. I didnít know what to make of it. But then, something else happened in the movie: Sinatra and Sinatra alone.  Sinatra is playing his best role in years, an actor who is playing roles he has never played before. He is so convincing in all his roles that I thought he could be any actor playing different characters in different films. He has a variety of characters on stage and in films that make him an interesting actor.  But itís Sinatraís character that I found to be the most entertaining of all. He plays a defense lawyer who canít seem to remember how to do his job, and it becomes obvious to the audience that his brain is failing him. Itís obvious from the start of the movie, when we learn that his job is to defend murderers, not to try them, that Sinatra doesnít want to be a lawyer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening is one of the finest opening movies I've ever seen.   After having seen the wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick during the 70's  it's a real treat for me to see that the style is still intact.  A little girl named Molly who is going to get an appointment to have her teeth fixed is given a ticket and an hour to get her teeth done.  But before they can get started the road is blocked by a bad driver.  And the only reason the driver doesn't crash is because his mother is trying to fix the car.  When the bad driver is done with his job it's Molly's turn to get a seat in the car and get a teeth cleaning.  As you might expect from a movie made during the 50's   Molly isn't going to do very well but she does manage to stay conscious long enough to get the teeth done and a new haircut.  It's all part of the opening and a good one at that.  The other aspect of the film which is worth mentioning is that the kids acting is so very funny.  My favourite scene of the whole movie is where the kid's car has hit a deer and then he and Molly have to find a way out to the other side of the road.  In the end the kid is able to get out of the car by kicking it out of a ditch.  Another scene which I really liked was where Molly and the girl she gets a job at is talking about how the kids are all going to die soon so that's why they're going to have the job.  I guess this film is going on the list as one of those "great" opening movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the same as all the other action movies that come out of Hollywood. The main story is nothing but a series of explosions and blood splatter.   The director is a decent guy who knows how to direct and write, but he has to rely on a small crew of guys to carry his movie.  This is the fifth movie of this type, but it has nothing to make it stand out from the others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the 1970's this is how the "great" science fiction film was: A starship is on a mission to visit a distant planet. It encounters the alien race of K'Nax, who claim to be the best people in the universe, but who are also the worst, and the most evil, because they are so stupid and have no common sense. The crew is put through the most awful tortures, and then are offered a new ship and their freedom if they promise to never harm the K'nax. They do, though, and when they reach the planet their ship is destroyed, and their commander is killed.   The crew are put in chains and sent off on a ship to be tortured again.

When her mother was killed, Anja has to go to the big city where she has to learn to survive by her wits. Her father, who doesn't know that Anja is a girl, teaches her to hunt rabbits, to fish and to live a simple life. This movie made me think that a person is never alone, that life is never easy. The story is so cute and the characters so sweet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a scene in a movie which goes along the line of this:  "I just wanna get away. I don't need no car. No one's got time for that.  I just want to get away."   And the same thing is said by one character in a very long and complex movie: "I just know I wanna get off this planet.   I just want...   No one knows."  They are both men.  They both are saying the same things.  One of them has a good idea about escape, and the other is saying that he does not really understand it.  In the end, what the film tries to say is:  One wants to get off his planet because he is lonely and lonely people are difficult to live with.  He wants to be out of this world.  But there are a lot of other people who want to stay here and are happy to spend their lives there.  And so, he keeps looking and keeps going and keeps running but he does nothing.  It is a wonderful and powerful film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was younger, my mom would often tell me to avoid sitting next to her when she was talking to friends on the phone or if there were any other adults in the room. I was never the type of kid to do that, but now I realize that she was onto something.   In addition to being a good action movie, it's also a good family movie.  I hope more people make similar films and not forget the great characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, the movie is a very good one and I would really recommend this one to everyone who is in for some good fun!   It is a great time to be a kid and I was entertained all day!  One of the reasons I like this movie is because it is so well made and because of the great music and effects.   This movie is really good and has a very unique plot that keeps you on your toes.  It all started out when a very special girl with amazing skills came to a small town and decided to leave it to find herself.  Her name was Dolly and her mother wanted to take her to a better life and she had a wonderful day on her way to the city but she met some people in the city who seemed to be much more skilled than she could be and she did not like them very much.  There were people who would be able to do the things she couldn't and her life got very interesting very quickly and Dolly had to learn a lot about life very quickly.  Dolly ended up in a very small, very dangerous and scary little town and it started to get a lot of attention because of how bad the people who lived there were!  But Dolly was very happy and was very much in love and this made her very happy.  But the town was really bad!  It was full of people who were very dangerous to Dolly because they wanted to hurt her and get to her.  This was all going too fast and D Holly was very afraid and worried about her safety.  So she took a chance and ran and this led to some adventures for the town and the people in it.  The good guys were there to protect D Holly but the bad guys were the ones who hurt her. Dolly started to learn some skills and skills that helped her to fight them off.  When Dolly got back to town she was determined to learn what she could about the town before she could leave it. She began to try to learn all kinds of things and to teach others about the danger that was in town.  Soon she was helping people who could not help themselves to make some money.  They were all happy and making a good living and that was great but Dolly still had a problem.  She was still trying to learn about the things in town but there were some things that she did and that scared her because of what could happen if something was not understood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't had this kind of movie in a long while. There is something about the movie that's great: it has a sort of romance in the middle that doesn't feel forced, but instead is quite clever. The lead male character is a great character, and a wonderful actor in John C. McGinley. He's kind of like a good father figure for us girls (in this movie, I mean). And it's funny, too!   This movie is a bit of a throwback, a little bit like an '80s movie with a girl next door.   But it doesn't forget its roots, which makes this a good romantic comedy with a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with the most unbelievable "couple" ever. They have a couple of kids together. They are so sweet and love each other so much, that it is impossible to watch this movie without smiling at some points. The children are funny and love to play with each other and so much more. The movie is about their journey from poor little people, to the nice wealthy people that they can be. This is so sweet that it makes you want to hug them and love them all over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of John Carpenter, David Lynch, and Stephen King, I'd highly recommend watching this movie. It's one of the more interesting horror movies I've seen. It has some unique features in it.   It has a strange atmosphere. The setting is creepy enough that it's hard to believe the movie is being made in 1988.    The character of a young boy is especially odd and it's a shame he is given so little screen time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The best of what's coming out this year" (Rotten Tomatoes)   Is there a worse kind of horror movie? No, but then, neither is this movie.   I found this film in the same vein as "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and "The Fog", and in a sense, they're more faithful to the films they're inspired by.  It begins with a young couple in a car that has somehow gotten stuck on a side street, and now they need to figure out what to do about the situation before the cops get involved.    It's a simple, but effective, story: young couple with a problem.  But then, suddenly, something changes.  And not in a good way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said at the start, there were a lot of films that took a bit more than a week to get a DVD release. This one got its DVD release a week before the movie had finished its North American run. I remember watching the first ten minutes, and being struck by how different the film felt from the other Hollywood pictures. It took the director, George Lucas, a lot longer to convince audiences that he was right about the "dark side" than he would have liked. The film was set in a futuristic city called Coruscant in the Star Wars universe, but the action took place in a desert planet. The desert world was an interesting setting. It was a planet where, in the pre-WWII era, there was little in the way of advanced technology, only primitive human technologies. People were not wearing much, and the only advanced technology they had were the primitive forms of power they had at hand. They lived their lives by "hustling" for food, drinking water, and shelter. It's a strange film. I liked that it looked like Star Wars (the story took place during a time when the story was very popular) but I did not like the end result. It has a great idea that is not quite fulfilled. It does have a great set, but it's more interesting to look at it than the finished movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first impression of the film is that it is very good. Not exactly something you would come up with by accident, but very well done and entertaining.   The film is set in the 1940s in an American neighborhood that is very similar to New York, but far better. The family of the lead character, Joe (Dana Andrews) is a very large family with a lot of different types of relatives. As a kid, I loved this character, especially as a kid as I can easily see the resemblance.  The setting and the style are good as well. The humor is good, but not perfect.  It is a good film with some very funny lines and good acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not exactly a horror film, but it has elements of a horror movie.

I am in love with her   and I don't see the movie going down easily   She eventually finds a car to escape the city but the car is missing her.  She has no clue how to drive the car so she drives it as a tourist in the city that she knows nothing about.  This story has some suspense and horror as well as some good dialog.  I have seen the movie several times and I still enjoy it, but the only reason I give it a 2 out of 5 is that the movie does not have a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I had seen the trailer and read the blurb. And I was a little bit disappointed when I saw the movie because I could tell that there were some problems. I have seen a few movies about Vietnam and I would never put up with the war. And so it was a disappointment. There were some very strange and bad ideas put into a movie that was clearly meant to be about the Vietnam War. The way the movie started was really odd and the ending was pretty good, but I guess that was more than I expected. The performances were pretty good. But I guess I was disappointed because I don't think it was all that bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little more than two years after releasing the original, the original sequel to THE HATEFUL EYE RETURNS (1984), John Carpenter is back with a second chapter in a saga that has grown steadily in stature, a saga which he has described as "the last of the true science fiction movies".   One year has passed since an unfortunate accident has cost the crew of a UFO spacecraft two members, while another crew member is injured; a UFO has been recovered, and with it, a secret alien device. The crew of the spaceship must flee from the ship's pursuers to escape from the planet where the device is being kept.   This sequel to The Hateful Eye is a better movie, for a variety of reasons. Carpenter, now with a career full of hits and near misses, has finally found a way to make a film with some real fun and excitement and a healthy dose of science fiction elements.  This movie is a lot of fun to watch as well as an excellent example of a John Carpenter movie.  It's easy to see the influences of the films of David Cronenberg and other horror movie directors in THE HATEFUL EYES, but there are also more subtle touches, such as the special effects, which are more than adequate to support the story.

The plot is very simplistic, but the film is fun and well-made. I'm a sucker for this kind of movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good comedy about the life of a famous comedian, in this particular case, the famous comedian being a guy who does stand-up comedy in an airport, which means he is also a bit of an idiot, which is not at all like the movie's title suggests. This isn't a very good comedy, nor is it a very bad movie. It's the sort of movie that is enjoyable, and is not something I think will be remembered with fondness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just had to see this movie. I have seen the original (The Incredible Hulk) over the years, and I have never seen anything with even one ounce of that great power that Bruce Banner has. I didn't expect anything like this at all, but I was still amazed.   It had its ups and downs, but in the end it was awesome.  This is the ultimate Hulk movie, the perfect blend of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never watched any other James Bond films.   As a kid I watched the first movie when I was about 10, then again when I started high school.  The film was excellent, and the story was clever.  I thought that the Bond would kill someone at one point.  It turns out he didn't kill anyone, and we all know that James Bond always saves the day.  All the Bond films have to do with James Bond being very evil, and yet in every movie that the villains have to pay a price to win.  This film was a treat, and a terrific ending that left me thinking the whole way through.  For the next 3 movies we will see the Bond fight evil, not evil people.  James Bond will become more like his nemesis Mr. White from "You Only Live Twice"  He will be more like a vampire.  We may never get another Bond film like this.  So this is it for Bond. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I loved this movie. It's a dark comedy, which is like being on a wild roller coaster ride for a bit. The ride is long, the scenery is pretty, and the girls are cute.   But there's one thing the girls don't understand, and that's why they are all wearing their school uniforms! The school has uniforms! What! Where did they go?   I loved the movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this yet.   This is a good looking movie.  The costumes are nice.  I liked the character.  It has an interesting story about a guy who has a gun in his back and a woman who is a detective.  My wife liked this one.  This would be good for people who like action, a mystery, and action-comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well if you've been waiting for a remake for a while, this is a good one!   This is not only a remake, but an improved one.   The story has a few rough spots and some of the acting seems to be overdone, but for the most part this is an enjoyable remake and a great film to watch on a cold winter day! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see this movie that I almost spoiled it for me.   It's a really enjoyable comedy that takes place at a small college in an old building.  There is a lot of drama but it's not really that bad of a deal.  You'll laugh a lot and you'll feel so good about yourself for being a good guy.  This movie is the epitome of the 90's comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film stars Bill Murray and John Goodman as a pair of people who meet, fall in love, and then marry each other.   I'm not really a fan of Bill Murray films.  The funny one with the guy playing the clown (who's not funny) and the drunk guy (who isn't drunk)  is good.  However, this one is much worse.  A guy comes over and says he's a lawyer.  After the two get married, the marriage collapses and then the clown tries to kill them.  This is all to avoid a trial he believes he's entitled to and wants to have.  Even if you don't find the movie funny, it's not really any more.

One day, they meet a beautiful woman named Natsuhi who also lives in the house. They agree to get married so that she can live with him. She does have her own problems, she's been having an affair for the past few years and has moved out. Now the problem is that they can't get rid of Natsu. The guys try to get rid off of her but with no success. Natsu will continue to have her affair until she finally commits suicide and leaves the house to go back to Tokyo. In the end, the guys find a way to move on without Natsu, but will that mean the end for them?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This film does not try to tell anything new and has no pretension to greatness or artistry. It is only a simple, silly, and quite enjoyable ride.   The first half of the film follows an ex-cop who, during a drunken car crash, is transported to a strange place where he is captured by a man in a black cape with a baton.  The second half is where the film really shines.  As with many great science fiction films, the world and its people are portrayed in such a fashion that it appears as though humanity has evolved. The film is not afraid to have a little fun with things and there is nothing subtle about it.  At its best, the film is witty, creative, and entertaining.  With a little bit more effort, it could have been a much better film.  "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a nice little movie with a few surprises.   While it may not be for everyone, it's very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can tell you right now that this is going to be a great movie.   It's the story of a young man and his wife who leave their life in the Midwest behind to visit their grandmother in Florida.  They discover a beautiful old house, a beautiful young woman in the kitchen, a new friend on the street and the love of their lives.  This story is told by a young boy in an old man's voice. It's a bit hard to watch when you first hear it.  It would be a good idea to find a quiet place to sit, because you won't be able to watch it all the way through.  The story is beautiful, the sound is great, the film is very well made and the story is a true story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what I like?   The movie is about an old man who is looking to get his life back on track.   And he is not the only one looking for a way back in time.  You are watching a movie about a guy who gets caught up in a time machine and a time paradox.  Now, you might think this movie has some flaws, like a lack of continuity in the timeline or a lack in the action.  But the movie is so well-written and so well paced, that I can't say too much about it.  And I'm not even going to talk about the actors.  All I can say is to go out and see the movie for yourself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the title says this movie will make you feel like the bad guys are better than the good guys.   While the movie is very funny, and has a great storyline, the ending was a let down.  I was hoping to see a more heroic version of this guy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After being out of the movie industry for 5 years I had the opportunity to re-watch The Godfather Part II.   The movie follows the life of Corleone family.  It has some of the best fight scenes of any film.  The best fight in the movie is the one between Vito and Michael.  After you watch this movie you will not be able to see another movie of this calibre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have enjoyed this movie, I was at first afraid that it was going to be another of those movies that were really quite good but then I discovered the twist in the film. A bit like some of the films in the 70's about the Vietnam war, this film is interesting in that its main subject is a woman who is suffering from a horrific mental illness, not much is known about her other than she is a beautiful woman who suffers from hallucinations and other problems. She is a loner and she doesn't feel real, she seems to be a little crazy in her own right. But she isn't a crazy person she is just the opposite. She cares about her family and husband, she loves the music of her son and she likes to sing. She can dance, she can sing, she is quite an accomplished actress, but her hallucinations are really quite scary, there's a very strange and disturbing aspect to the film, the audience doesn't get to really know her and her relationship to her husband or to her son is a bit unclear but she is very interesting and I found myself completely interested.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts like a horror film with one of my favorite movie themes "What do you mean the dead don't walk"   It was a good horror film that used it's premise to great effect, with many twists and turns, it was a suspenseful, creepy movie.   I didn't see any other movie like this since the days of Alfred Hitchcock, It's a good time to watch a movie of this kind because you know it's going to be scary and eerie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What I can't help but admire about this movie is its simplicity.   All you need to do is sit in a room, drink some tea and listen to some soothing music and enjoy the journey.    There are no fancy special effects, no action scenes, nothing too flashy.  To me it's more like a film you can sit down to and enjoy for a day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was a very interesting movie. In fact it is a great movie. It is very original movie and you can find this movie in many other movies that are not very good. The story is very interesting. You will see a lot of things. The characters are interesting and funny. It was like a mix between the characters in "A Little Night Music" and the characters of "Moulin Rouge". The movie is very fast paced and it does not waste much time. The movie has no flaws. It does not have a very good ending. It has no great comedy in it. The whole movie does not seem very serious at all. You can find lots of comedy. The music is good and the acting was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film, and a great one. It is a story of a young man who has left his hometown for the mountains to escape the war and be part of the peace movement in this poor part of Scotland. His experiences in this isolated place teach him the importance of the human spirit and how it can overcome any evil. He soon realizes that a man who calls himself a pacifist is just as dangerous as a man that is willing to kill.   The film begins with the man trying to make it through the worst night of his life as he runs out of the woods in search of his wife. It isn't long before he is captured by the enemy and his family is murdered. He escapes by hiding on the top of a hill. He is soon captured again and the only way he can save his family now is to find a way to the other side. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Big Lebowski" is a great comedy.   This is the kind of movie that I can imagine the great Richard Pryor making.  It is a fun ride, the way the first scene makes you feel like a kid in a candy store.  The story is very basic: a guy has a big night out; he has a great time; but he has no money, so he finds out that the bowling alley doesn't accept no-shows.  After that he finds that bowling is his job.  I can't believe that "The Dude" (Richard Gere) was in a bad movie.  He looks like a cross between Steve Martin and Walter Matthau.  There is a lot of dialogue:  This one has a lot to offer.  "There's no way I can take care of a chick like that."   So he throws the bowling ball and it goes right through a woman's head. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it twice now and it's the first movie to give me goosebumps.   The first time, I was sitting in the theater feeling a little uncomfortable about the first third.  I had just finished watching a bad remake of The Devil's Advocate.  It was about a lawyer who gets sent to death row for the murder of an innocent.  He then makes a deal with the devil and is released from prison.  The Devil and the Devil's advocate get ahold of him at the station where he meets with the murderer who had framed him.  Apparently it was a trick, but they had a little fun, and then he gets the murder case overturned.  Then he is offered the chance to make amends to the man who put him there.  In this case, it's a deal to keep his good name, but at some sacrifice he will have to deal with his anger at the people who framed him in the first place.  But the most important part is that he can live again.  As the film goes on he gets more and more into the spirit of things.  This is the first true love story in this century.  After the deal is put together and it is apparent that the devil is right, they make an attempt to save each other's life.  While in prison he tries to be a decent person.  Just then the Devil tells him about a girl and offers him an offer.  If he kills the girl and gets her body back, he will be forgiven.  That's it!  He doesn't even have to hurt the girl, it'll be forgiven by the demon.  She dies and the devil's advocate takes the body back to the underworld and they decide to go to Mexico and find the girl's father.  With some help from the Devil, who knows what he's doing, he makes it to Mexico with the body of the girl.  They find her father who turns out to be an old friend of the woman's father's.  And so begins a new beginning.  For once, the Devil and Devil's advocates are trying to do good.  So that's something to smile about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think that you have to have read the comic in order to enjoy this film:  I'm not sure that anyone who is familiar with the comics would care to see this film, so perhaps some of the comic readers will be able to enjoy the film with a fresh attitude:  It's an interesting look at the "fantasy" genre.  The story is really well told, and although the film is not as funny as some of his earlier films (it is a little derivative), the humor is still really good:  The film is a "love story" in a sense: the girl is really beautiful, but also very mysterious.   The movie is interesting: it's a very interesting story, and the story is told well.  I liked the idea of making a movie about a young man who falls in love with a princess; I liked how the film takes a step back and looks at the big picture:  If you like the films of Christopher Lloyd, you'll like this one:

Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   This is a funny, good movie.   It's about a dog with the power to heal other dogs.  There is a scene when the dog is talking to the other dogs and they talk about some animal disease and the dog says that he can make a cure for that, or a way to heal the dog.  After the dog talks about the dog disease and how to cure it he then decides to eat a can of soup.  It ends with the dog jumping up into the air and catching a fly on his mouth.  The dog then goes to see some humans that were attacked by a dog and eats their brains.  So there is a lot of humor and good movie ideas that are used in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was expecting a bad movie. I was not looking forward to watching it. However, I have to say that this movie is better than expected. It starts off with a very creepy scene. I never thought that I would see a scary movie in my life. That is, until I saw this film. I am not sure why I watched this film, but I have always wondered about ghosts and what happens after death. Well, this movie has something to say about that. It seems that this film takes some inspiration from a famous ghost story of the 1800's. The movie is very disturbing and you should not watch this movie if you have not watched a good horror movie before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I enjoyed this movie so much is because it's a fun romp through time. I was surprised how long this film took to come out.   As a little girl growing up, this was one of the first Disney movies I ever watched and it had a pretty simple story. The main character was a little boy named Ralph, his younger sister Sophie is always a lovable little girl and the two are always playing together, making and getting fun new stuff to play with.    After years, Ralph is older and he is an adult now. The world is a much darker place and now he is trapped. He is looking for a new friend to play games with, but his past life is making his new one much harder and the game he's playing more interesting.  It's an easygoing family affair with the boys playing games, making stuff, and playing hide-and-seek and chasing rabbits with a pet fox.  If you're looking for something with a strong, simple story to keep you entertained, I would suggest this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film about a nice man who loves his wife and her son.   He has a little car, a wife who is sweet, a son who is spoiled, and a dog who looks like a tiger.  As always, they all live together in a beautiful cottage in a lovely spot, and it is a perfect life.  One day they're relaxing on the patio, and the wife is complaining about how the old man is always nagging her about how they can't live anywhere near the city anymore.  She says it's a real shame because it's nice out there and they can afford to live here, but he tells her that it's too cold in the mountains.  At this point, the old guy comes up to the patio and tells them he is trying to make a little money in the mines.  He says he hasn't been paid in two months.  The wife says she knows about that.  But she wants to help him out because he looks so sorry.  So she calls a friend of hers, who happens to be a witch.  When she goes in to talk with the witch, the witch shows her a beautiful tree that has come from the mountain and is growing right here in the cottage.  Just then, the son comes out, and he sees the beautiful tree and runs outside to play with it.  Then a terrible accident happens in the middle of the night, and his mother is killed.  It's a tragic story, and while there are many horrible things about it, the sad part is that he will never be able to see his mother again.  His wife wants to keep him there to see her, and she is determined to do it.        A wonderful story about a family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in New York City. My parents moved to Ohio in 1979, where I graduated from high school. My high school friends and I would sometimes go to the movies in our neighborhood (a block of flats off of 14th Street) when we weren't out at school. We were all there, and we were all just as weird as one another. In one movie, we saw a group of kids sitting on a rock. One girl stood up and put on a show, dancing in a circle with her friends. Then, in the next scene, the girls ran away in fear. I don't remember the name of the movie, and I can't find any information about it online.   A young boy who is in a dance club is in trouble when he is mistaken for an actor by the people who are looking for a thief. After that, the man who has been waiting patiently for this young actor to leave with the $2,000 in the bill starts to get impatient and asks the young boy to take the money with him.  I've never heard of this movie, but this is just about my favorite horror movie ever made. It's the perfect balance between silly humor and scary horror, and its cast is great, including Stephen Rea, James Cromwell, James Earl Jones, and Lilli Cooper.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is very good. The plot is very simple and predictable. But it makes up for that by the superb acting and beautiful imagery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I can say that this film has a nice message about a real human being, that is not an elf or a wizard or a demon.   This film shows that you don't have to be some sort of hero, or villain, or even good guy/gal to make a living, get love, get a woman, and keep from losing it all.  It's the true story of a man who can't let go of a promise made to his dying mother.  He still has a good wife, and three young kids, so he has a chance to change and be a better person, if he can find a way to live his life with the same values that he had when he was young.  So, when his best friend comes along telling him that he's going to be the next president, and has a new wife, John F. Kennedy, he can't accept it, and starts thinking about how he can get to know his old friend better.  That's when John comes back, after being in the war, in a car accident, and is unable to walk.  John was a regular guy who couldn't give a damn about his life, and was still looking for the "next thing" to take his mind off of everything.  As he and John were talking about his past in the Army, and how he hated it, this is what happened to John.  There is a scene in the film where a group of soldiers are trying to move a jeep that is stuck in a snowbank.  One of the soldiers has to be dragged out to the car by the others.  The driver is shot, and a man is hit in the shoulder.  When the driver is dragged out, he goes over the cliff, but is saved by John, who tells him to get out of the car before he dies.  Well, the driver manages to survive, but he is left paralyzed from the waist down.  At this point, John is worried, and says he's coming home for good, if the soldier doesn't make it.  In the meantime, there are rumors of some sort, and John wants to find out what happened.  Later, he comes to the hospital to check up on John, but finds out that he has died.  If John had died a few weeks earlier, would he have wanted to talk about it?  Yes, the movie is a movie about living, but it's not
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is something about this movie that gets me every time.   This is one of those movies that is easy to watch and enjoy without the usual plot twists, as it follows a simple and very well written character who is going through a very hard time that he has been living through.  This movie is about the journey he is on and about the hope and faith he is keeping.  He is a man who knows a great deal about losing one's faith and faith can be restored.  It is also about a man's heart and about his faith.  I would not recommend this movie to everyone but to the ones who feel their faith is being threatened or taken away from them by a system or people who are not living up to their own standards, this movie will give them hope and strength in their times of trial.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I can say that the first third of the film is pretty well done. The main character (a "human" for that matter) comes across as a fairly ordinary guy, and we have a couple of pretty great scenes. The "human's" behavior is a little strange (at times he is very silly and often times he becomes too serious). He is never boring to watch and has a couple good lines in each one. The film keeps its cool until the halfway point. There is a scene where a "human"-type gets into an argument with another "human", but as we know, "humans" don't have to argue with each other (unless they are the good guys, but then that doesn't really work either). Eventually the "human"'s friend is shot, and the "good guy" (the "human") decides to go look for his friend. When he does, he finds a body, but as the movie goes on we find out that the other human was a drug addict, and as a result, the other "human''s friend died from that too. By the end of the movie, we are not really sure what we are supposed to think. The ending seems a little contrived and the characters are a bit like caricatures. There are some nice scenes in the last third of this movie (it is really a shame that we only get one or two) but the film's style is really out of the ordinary for a science fiction/horror film.

I don't usually watch action films or anything like that, but this movie had so much going on that it was actually hard to put into words.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is one of those things you know is special but you never really get to enjoy it.   It's a great idea and you get the feeling that you will enjoy this film but the execution and the quality of the film are very average.  This was a film that I found out about from a film critic in an obscure periodical and thought it looked really good, the concept is really unique and you really feel that the film is going to be a classic for many years.  The production was very expensive and not a lot of people got to see the film so it is hard to recommend this film to many people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       This movie is a little slow, but when the movie starts, the whole movie is slow. It is slow because the film is made in the style of a documentary. The documentary is a "behind the scenes" movie, which makes the movie seem slower. But the slow parts are very important. This movie does have some good humor, but the humor comes from the real life of a woman who was a housewife, and what she did when she had to work with a bunch of children who were in school. The movie starts out in a very realistic, low-budget way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful film with an excellent acting performance from the lead actor, a story filled with a lot of twists and turns, a good plot, a lot happening in a small period of time.   (I have been a bit lazy with my reviews recently.  This review may be a bit repetitive but I will try to do it in a good way.)   While the film is not as great as I was expecting it to be, it has a very unique and attractive style.  I would have liked to see more of this story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this movie as a kid. The idea of a boy trying to get out of a monster's grasp was pretty cool.   The best part of the movie was when the kids tried to convince the monster to let the boy out.  It's a really funny movie and has plenty of good moments.

They are forced to move to a new town where they live in squalor. They soon realize that they're not alone and that the townsfolk are hiding a secret and there is more to the story than they first thought.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In "The Devil's Advocate", Alan Siegel plays a trial lawyer who is about to defend a rapist who was sentenced to death.   He has no luck whatsoever and loses the case, when he is summoned to a meeting with the Judge who is in charge of deciding the case.  He tries to get him to change his mind by offering the rapist two chances to plead guilty.  I thought this was the most ridiculous thing in the movie and that a lawyer from Hell would say something like that.  It's like watching a bunch of fools trying to make a fool of themselves while the judge decides the case (I thought it was so funny I actually laughed).  The judge then makes his own proposal:  To let the rapist live if he confesses to having done it and pays a ransom of fifty thousand dollars.  To give him the maximum punishment:  "Death by crucifixion."   Siegel agrees to both the rapist's proposition and the Judge's proposal, and the judge takes him to the next stage.  The rapist is arrested, brought to trial, and given his sentence.  So we have a jury, a judge, and a murderer (who is sentenced to be executed). The movie ends with the judge pointing to the crucifix hanging above the defendant, and saying:  He will be hanged, crucified, and his corpse hung for a thousand days.  This was a very stupid movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad to see it's going to be a feature-length movie for once.   While most of the story takes place at school, the story actually has a real meaning and the main character is really interesting.  It's like a slice of life but the setting and the characters are different enough to make it interesting and fun.  If you like harem, slice of lifes and have a bit of a sense of humor, then you should like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it's the first time a character is as badass as Riki. He doesn't talk much, but he shows a lot of passion and will.   As a main character, Riki is a bit dumbed down in the middle but still a good guy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a classic movie that had some wonderful effects. You may be familiar with the story of the little boy who can fly. And he loves to fly. His mother tries to stop him because he has been doing bad things lately. One day, the little girl asks him if he can fly a plane. He thinks about it for a while and finally decides to try.   The film opens with the little kid having to do some tricks to get to school. He's dressed as a boy, which is probably a good idea.  A bit later we meet the little flying boy, flying down a steep road. A few girls see him, and his mother doesn't like his new look. The little boy says that he can't fly a bicycle any more. His father gets a motorcycle and takes him to school and he's happy.  But then he starts getting in trouble.  After he's caught flying down the road, he is thrown off the bike. He crashes, and is caught on the other side. His friend tells him that he is very lucky. He is caught by a dog, and he takes off again. His parents come to see if he's alright.  He can't believe it. He tries again. This time, the bike works and he is able to fly on it.  It may not be a big deal for most people, but it's a nice idea for a short film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked the original film then you will love this sequel. It has the same feel as the original, but with some improvements. The pacing is even better. There is more action in this one. You will see the same types of aliens from the original and some new ones.   Like the original it's a very fun ride, and there are some surprises along the way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished watching this film a while back, and I can tell you that it's a well made movie that has a lot to offer for a movie that is a sequel to the first film.   This movie is set in the future when most humans are extinct and live underground.  This is a bit more sci-fi than the first movie.  In the second film we see a little bit more of our main character (also an astronaut) but the story is very similar to that of the first. The only difference is that our protagonist (which is now an "old" scientist) is more mature and responsible.  It's obvious that the story for this film has been put together and polished to a high degree because the story and the actors are all great.  The plot for this movie is a lot more realistic than that of The Day the Earth Stood Still.  While the first story is filled with aliens, this film takes a much more realistic approach to the aliens.  Our characters have to deal with a lot of problems, like the fact that they are all living in a hostile alien world and can't get out of it without the aid of a nuclear warhead.  They're trapped underground and they're on their own all the time.  While that sounds like a pretty tough life, it isn't as the movie does a great job of showing us how they overcome these obstacles.  We see them try to grow their crops and try to develop their technologies, but to no avail.  There's a lot going on in the story, but it all comes together with a good bit of humor.  Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and it's good to see that these characters have been able to survive a few hundred years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A little more about it:  This movie is a film adaptation of a Japanese manga, called  The Legend of the Red Balloon,  by  Hidetaka's (Sakamoto's) father, Atsushi. It was created in 1965 in the town of Izu in Japan. Atsuki's character is a man who, with the help of a small red balloon, escapes from a strange and deadly forest filled with monsters. It's a very eerie and unsettling story, which is about as close to real life as a story can get without being realistic. But like most of Atsui's work, it does have a good dose of fantasy at the end.  This was directed by Kenji Kamiyama (who made the first version of The Grudge and the original version of Night on Bald Mountain), and his cinematography was very good.  The story was adapted by  Yoko Niiyama, who also did the original movie. It has some pretty good performances by the cast, especially by the two main characters.  You'll probably enjoy this one too!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this movie really had a lot to do with me becoming a vegetarian.  I was born in a poor family in a small town, where I was the only child.  So the movie made me think about all the hardships my parents went through and it made me realize how my dad was not very happy with his job.  But then the movie turned into a story of a young woman who has to overcome many obstacles just to overcome her past problems.   And then at the end there is a big celebration at the restaurant where the three lead characters eat their meals.  My mom, who had to move to California with my father and I when I was just 3 years old, is now a retired nurse.  And so in the movie I feel like she was a real character and it shows in her story and in her performance.

I haven't seen either of those movies yet, but they were both on the list. This movie, however, is new to me. I never saw the movie it spawned, but from what I know, it's about a man named Michael Smith, and his relationship with his daughter. This story is a lot of fun, I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good "action" movie (as it were), that is really interesting to watch (the story is good, the action is well done, the sound is decent but nothing very special).   If you like action movies, this is a great movie, but if you do not like action, I think you will be disappointed.   However, I believe that it is worth the $2.95 a ticket it costs to watch it (in the 1970's). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful movie, with a great cast of actors. This is not the type of movie you will see many times again, in my opinion. It has a lot of comedy. The movie is about a woman, who decides to take care of an abandoned dog, by taking care of him with a bit of affection and kindness. In this movie, the dog has so much personality, and is very playful and cute. He can play with anything.   The dog has a special ability. If you leave him alone, he would just run around and play. He loves to be close to you.  I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the movie very much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of movies like this.   It has that "old school" look, that just seems to be the way movies were done in the 80's, and it does have that nostalgic quality to it.  The story of a young man who has gone down on one knee for the woman he's wanted since the first grade and is trying to win her heart, just seems so innocent that it has me wanting to see it again.  It was a little disappointing that the last 20 minutes were pretty much a quickie before the ending.  But, it's worth a watch for any of you who love "old Hollywood" movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film with a simple premise: a couple is having an affair, a child has been killed, the couple tries to get the child back, the child does not come back, and the couple starts a "hunt" for the child.   It has a good plot with the characters developing and the story moving along nicely.  This isn't a classic film. It has some slow and boring scenes in it. The characters are pretty one dimensional.  If you enjoy horror or a little dark humor and are looking for something new to watch, give this a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I don't know why I haven't seen this before."   Well, I'm happy to say I'm a new fan of "The Room," and one I hope is for a long time.   It is hard to write this review without bringing up the entire story:      I've been a big fan of horror movies for over 30 years (all genres).   I first saw this film at a college party with a lot of people that I really liked (like my future wife and father-in-law) and I was in total shock.  There is a scene in the film where a boy comes into a dark room and disappears.  We all go upstairs to see what happened.    A few minutes later I'm walking out of the bathroom and see a shadow outside the window.  My wife and I ran into the hallway (not thinking what could have possibly happened) and yelled at each other.  I don't remember much about that night.  Then a year or so later, we bought a house.  And I thought, oh, my god.  One night, I heard some noises in my house. Not screaming, but quiet noises like somebody was walking by on the stairs and not coming back up.  Sure enough, at the bottom of the stairs was my wife and my father- in-law.  The next day, they came to tell me they saw me watching this film one night. I told them I was really sorry, but it's been a long, long time since then.  It was on a DVD a while back.  Now we get to see this great movie in its entirety for the first time!   The original "The Night of the Living Dead," is a good one.  "The Shining" is my personal favorite.  But this movie is something completely different.  This is the movie that made me realize how amazing my wife is.  Is it weird to say this, but she's the best.  While my wife watched the movie, I was looking out the windows and observing the events that were happening.  She was also standing at the top of the staircase watching the movie with me.  Wasn't a very nice picture, but my wife loved it.  So here we are today.  We're watching the entirety of the movie together.  What a nice experience!  This has been a real life experience.  All
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple of years ago I watched  The Hunger Games  and found it to be a great film and a very well done movie at that.    It was a really good movie and I loved it.  And then this year I watched the movie again (at a friend's house) and I thought "man, this is even better!"   At first, I thought the movie was just the same thing as last time.  The same music, the same actors (except that there are some new faces).   But what really surprised me was how well the screenplay matched the movie and how it pulled it off.  I loved the way that the movie went with the plot and the characters.  At the same time, I think the movie could have done with a little more gore.  This is probably one of the better, better movies I've seen all year!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people were pissed off about the ending, but it is better than the original.   What the Hell happened to this movie?   I'm a real fan of the original and even though I watched it a few times and loved it, I still found the movie kind of annoying.  It's like a little kid who got really into playing with Legos and started having nightmares about how his dad will burn in hell.  Yeah, I like it, but I would be much more upset if it was about a kid who never played with Legoland but who was told he couldn't do it because he's a fag.  I didn't have a problem with the ending (for that matter, I had a problem when it ended in the original), and I was a little disappointed that it didn't go on into a sequel, but at least it did get some good laughs out of it.  What I can say is that I really like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is so much about this movie that I want to put it into words, but unfortunately, I don't know how to.   This movie, much like all the other things I have seen this year, is a testament to the power of passion.  When I saw it for the first time, I was amazed.  It was like a dream come true.  All the characters are written so vividly, that even the non-characters are drawn with the same attention to detail.  The story is amazing.  There are so many different characters, it feels like there are hundreds.  At the end of the movie, the story ties up, and everyone just kind of disappears off into the night.  I'm sure there is a sequel to this movie.  My favorite part of the whole movie is that ending.  That final scene really left me wanting to see a sequel.  This is a perfect movie, and definitely worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is set in 1920's America, and it stars the great Gene Hackman.   The film stars a group of young friends on a family vacation that is interrupted by the deaths of a father and his two sons.  In order to cope with this sudden loss of life, they set out to kill a large group of murderous bank robbers, who rob the local banks while leaving nothing but destruction in their wake.  The movie is based upon the true story of the Great Train Robbery, which took place in Omaha in 1887.  A number of other movies have been made about the Great Railroad Robbery.  This is the only movie made about this robbery, which was the second largest theft of American money at the time.  There are a number of famous actors in this movie: John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, James Stewart, John Barrymore, Gene Hackmann, and John Wayne's son Gene Hackenberger.  These actors all seem to play their roles well.  Gene Hackinberger is a great young man.  He is handsome and charismatic and seems to be an upstanding citizen.  His sister is a beautiful girl, who appears to be a model.  They are on their way to a bank and Hackenburgers father tells them about a group who rob banks to rob people.  One of the men, who is called Ducky, is a good friend of Hackenburger's father, and he is there for the robbery with a number men.  When they get to the bank they see that it is empty except for a man on the roof with a rifle.  Ducky says that he is a farmer and a good shot, so they will have to shoot him to take his rifle.   The young man is a little afraid of Ducky's gun.  Hackenberg hesitates a little, and then shoots him.  It looks like the bullet hits him in the arm.  This is a nice, light, fun movie with an exciting plot and the kind of acting that makes you feel you are watching a real-life movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can say that this movie is worth the watch. It is a great adventure movie that is set in the 19th century.   The storyline is really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of great ideas are done in this film. It's quite entertaining and fun to watch. The movie is mostly about a little girl that is raised by a cat. The cat looks like it's a girl at the time, and she wants to be a girl, but the people around her don't think so. It makes for a funny and lighthearted film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie.  It is more funny and more tragic than a lot of films made in the past 15 years.   It takes a couple of decades to learn that no matter how tough the person may be they will eventually go to hell.  For a while this movie was a good laugh but then it got really dark and really funny.  There is a lot going on in this movie and the characters are all very human, you will never see an action movie like this with these types of characters.  Even though it is a black comedy, it is not too black, it has a sense of humor about it, but it is about as far away from the camp and the melodrama that we see in a lot Hollywood films.  My favorite scene in the movie is when the priest talks about God's plan to destroy the earth and all humans. It is a very poetic and good scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good.   While the action was entertaining, I liked it more as a social commentary and as a comedy.  I thought the film was very funny, but the actors did not hit the high notes they had hoped.  The music was wonderful, and the camera work made it good to watch as well.  If you like comedy and social commentary, you will enjoy the movie.

So I've been in shock since I watched it, even in the movie theatre. However, it didn't shock me like I thought it would, because it is so far from bad. It's like a bad movie that's bad in the beginning. But at the end of the movie it is good, so I'm glad that I saw this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension" is one of my favorite Disney animated films. It has an upbeat feel to it. I thought it was a good idea to make a film about the World's Largest Animal and this would be a great way to show the World how awesome it is to have an animal as big as an elephant.   I also enjoyed how the animation was much better than the previous ones.  This is one that I would definitely recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid movie.   I am not really a fan of martial arts films, but this film doesn't disappoint.  The movie starts off with a pretty cool shot, but we then cut to a battle scene in which the main character has been badly injured and is unconscious.  As he lays there, the two bad guys enter and begin beating him up.  They then leave and come back, beating him again and again and laughing at his misfortune.  Finally, he has no other option than to escape by jumping out a window.  If you have watched any of the martial arts movies that I've seen, you'll recognize the scene immediately.  Then we cut to the next scene where the main guy is being held prisoner.  His captor is trying to rape him, but he is having a good time.  There is a great line, "It is like trying to push a bucket of ice water through a straw with a knife!"  It is a fun movie, especially if you like the kung fu genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I both love horror movies (mostly slashers), so the idea of a horror movie with a twist at the end was awesome!  The twist at end was very surprising, as the story went from a man who could not get a hold of a girl, to a girl who turned into a monster and ended up destroying the city, then the guy who made the monster, turned into the girl he was trying to get ahold of, so that ended up being the twist at a good end to the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of movies that involve time-travels and alternate realities, then you should not miss this movie.   It was such a great experience, I can't even put it into words.  It takes you on a ride of time-travelling from the past to the future and back again.  The world of this movie is amazing.  They use the same set of characters over and over again. You are really transported to a different world every time you go to a place.  This movie was made in 1970, so it's not your usual "time-travel" film.  And, the movie is so well made, so much fun.  It takes us through the different times in history and tells us about their people, animals, and other things.  What I really like about this movie are the special effects, the cool effects on the cars, and the other scenes.  There are many special effects used in this movie, which is the way to a good time.  For example, when the time-machine (the car) changes a city, the effects look like they are real.  But, you know that they are not.  So, it's funny to see that when you go into the future, and then look at the old pictures, they look real.   There is a great music in this film, and it's catchy.  Of course, the special effect, like the time machine, are awesome.  You know that you are going to be entertained for the rest of the day.  I also like that there are lots of different places to see in this time-trip movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't have high expectations when I first heard about this movie, or at least I didn?t know much about the movie?s before seeing it.   It looks like a bad sci fi action movie, but it?s not.  This movie has many different genres, from an ancient alien conspiracy to a little girl being kidnapped.  I have to admit I liked it. The movie was pretty interesting.  The story line kept me interested.  It was exciting all the time, and was a lot of fun to watch.  My only concern about the story is how long it is.  There are a few other movies in this genre, but I was not able to find them on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First let me say, I loved this movie! I am a big fan of the Twilight movies and I love Bella. She has her issues, I can see that for those who haven't read the books, but her love of her best friend is sincere and beautiful.  I loved that the movie was made after the book. It had a different feel to it. It has a slightly different pace, and some scenes were even better than the book!   And there's some really pretty music in this movie too!  This is one of those movies that will never get old.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An American drama about the American Civil War, it starts with the famous Battle of Gettysburg where the Confederates were defeated. The movie starts with a character who is a Confederate Lieutenant. The Lieutenant's family was very rich, the wife was rich and so they had a house. Then his wife died and he took up with a young woman and her two sons.  The Lieutenant comes back to his family's mansion and is amazed to see his father in the kitchen cooking with an electric frying pan.  Then the Lieutenant's mother returns home and is so happy to see her husband alive she kisses him passionately.  After a few days the Lieutenant is sent to a front and finds his wife is pregnant with twins.  But the Lieutenant sees something different, his wife has changed.  She has grown up, she has become more educated, she is less uptight, and her behavior seems more like a love story.  One night as they are watching television they hear a shot and find a soldier on the other side of the battlefield.  Now the Lieutenant wants to go back to the war and save the war but he has to convince his wife to stop her relationship with the other soldier.   So the Lieutenant finds a young girl to talk to who looks like his wife.  As he is speaking to her the soldier appears.  They both talk and she agrees to stop the relationship.  When they return to their mansion the Lieutenant has two boys by the side of his bed.  So he asks them to stop playing and then he leaves to fight.  As he fights he is so exhausted he is glad when he wakes up in bed. He finds a note from his wife saying they would have a baby, but now she can't bear children, so he will be his father again.  This is a good drama about a war that has been lost. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is not so bad that you don't like it at all. You know that's not so good, but I'm going to say it anyway:  There is some good movie to be made in this world.    If I were given a blank sheet of paper with the title:  I would write the first line:  "He is my friend.  "   Then I would explain to you why this is a bad movie.  And I would probably write the next 10 pages:  It's all in the first hour:  The first 10 minutes of the movie are about:  1) a group of school kids going to a house party 2) a boy's friend going to the party, trying to get into a car, which gets stuck in the mud, so he takes it to the top of a hill 3) a girl and a boy get in a car and drive off, but the driver gets in a wreck and is killed 4) a police officer who is following a car full of people who are speeding to get to a wedding (they end up in a ditch) 5) a policeman is following the car, but his truck is too far away. 6) a bunch of people are waiting for a cab and get in the cab, but when the cab leaves, it's in the ditch 7) a man finds his truck out in the middle of nowhere, but he thinks it's parked in a garage. 8) another group of people walk along a street, talking about their lives, and the one who comes up to them is an old man.  But he's not all bad:  He gives the kids a ride to the house, and tells them they should get their parents. Then he lets the kid drive the car.  After the group is finished with this, it goes to the church for a wedding.  Then a policeman walks up and starts shooting at the people there.  The policeman is trying to stop people from leaving, but there are people there who are going to leave, but they are not leaving because the police aren't stopping them.  So then the policeman walks away, and then a car comes over and picks up all the people.  Everyone in the car is dead.  A bunch of kids get out of the car and they run for help, but a police car is driving toward them. So the kids get on the car (the police car has the steering wheel stuck in neutral, so

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, it's a great idea to have an interracial romance and a romantic movie that is about the struggles of the black man and the white woman to love and be loved by each other.   The film is about a black man (Bruce Wayne) who has a dream to learn how to swim and become a good man. He lives on a boat in the harbor of a fictional city, a city in which race is a major issue. The city is ruled by the Queen (Lena Olin), a woman who has the power to decide who is an acceptable man and who isn't. The movie starts out with a very stereotypical African-American gangster (Bruce's best friend, D'Angelo) who is very angry about his life and is very bitter at the whole black man stereotype that exists in this movie. He is angry that a black woman has all of the jobs in the city. He also has a jealous daughter who is constantly talking about how a white woman has it all and is a beautiful woman.  One night, Bruce Wayne's mother (Deborah Kara Unger) comes home. She has been ill for a long time and is not feeling very well. Bruce is so happy to see her and tells her that he is going to teach D'Ago that he can swim. He plans to take her on a nice trip to some tropical islands. As they are swimming, they start to fall asleep. Bruce wants to be in the water and tries to stop her. After Bruce saves her, they fall asleep on the shore.  The next morning, D', who has gone to buy groceries, sees the two of them in the boat and runs to check on them. She runs to Bruce and tells him she saw her mom again and that she thinks she is still married to D'Andrea (Leno), a fellow gangster. He tells D' Angelo he is sorry and leaves. D' and Andrea argue over who is the better swimmer and eventually they make love.  They have a son (named Alfred) who they name Alfredo after Alfred E. Neuman Jr., who is a real person who is actually a very good swimmer (it's interesting to note that Bruce Wayne was a great swimmer).  Alfredo takes a liking to Alfred and Bruce starts to notice that he likes Alfred. When Alfredo falls asleep, Bruce takes Alfredo to see Alfredo's mother and learns that Alfredo has come from a

I also really loved that the story told in this movie is all about "The Great Pumpkin" and how he was made of candy and that the other characters just want to get into the pumpkin so they can get "the greatest candy".   It was an awesome movie and I can't wait to see the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would say it's a comedy, but it's not. It's an awkward movie, a pretty little movie at that. The two main characters are a guy who's trying to win over a pretty, shy young girl, and a girl who is a very sweet, very intelligent young lady. They have some sort of an incident when they have to go to the park in the afternoon. They meet two boys, who are really cute, and the guy who likes the boy's friend is very nice and funny. There are some other characters who are funny.   This is a sweet little movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always loved the "Twilight Zone" and this one is no different.   It is fun to watch but there is a part I was just a little afraid to see.  What was supposed to be one of the best episodes was really a bit lackluster, the plot line of the episode felt pretty pointless and the acting of the cast was not nearly good enough to be worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main reason this is good is because of the way it keeps you interested even through the long running, repetitive storyline.   It's not just about getting to know the characters; they are all likeable and endearing, so why did I feel sorry for them?   This movie just keeps getting better and better with each new revelation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . It's a little bit hard to explain, but the story is about a guy who was trying to find a place where he could take a break from the city. So he started out as a barman, but as the war became more and more intense, he became a guard on the city walls. He was forced to carry a giant cannon called the Big-Gun through the city as the military tried to destroy it to stop the enemy from coming out.   The story is very simple, but it's very beautiful. It's about a soldier in the war. He wants to spend some time on a hill in a beautiful setting. It sounds like an idyllic story, but when you get to know him and he tells you about the war, it's not.  It's so sad, but if you watch it and tell him it's a beautiful story, he'll change his mind. It gets a little dark at the end, but then you'll realize, he's not like all the other soldiers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie is good only if it is honest in itself.   This is not.  Instead it is a movie of deception.  There are some good sequences but most are badly disguised. The story of a couple of young men is not very original, the ending was predictable, and the characters are undeveloped.  The picture has a good cinematography but poor acting.  This will not leave you satisfied. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, we start with the protagonist:  In the beginning, the movie is set in a hospital room where a man, who's called Ramiel is trying to solve the problem: He is having trouble waking up at night (or so he believes, but that's another movie) because he has no recollection of who he is or how he got there. One night, Ramiels friend comes to his house in order to pick him up. He goes in but the room is not what he expected it to be. There is a large bed with a table and chairs on it. He does not recognize any of the people there. The other guy comes in and says that he wants to talk about a woman he once saw in his dream, he says that this woman was not real but he saw her in his dreams and knew what to do with her and he was never able to get the dream out of his head. He also explains that there was a girl with him, but he never saw her again. He says that a lot of people he knew from childhood were always missing each other and then a woman dressed in a white gown appeared. She talked about how he had to follow his dream and he had a long dream and then they talked about what he should do in the long dream. The man asked for her name and she said it was Diana, who was also dressed in white. Diana says that she has a job and the other guy says she is not a nurse but a prostitute. Then she asks Ramielsh to tell her about his dreams. Diana, however, says she can't give him a good dream, because he is always thinking about his dream. She says that sometimes he doesn't have a dream at all, and that's when he knows it is a nightmare. He asks Diana to tell him more about his nightmare, but she doesn't say it. Then Ramieli says to Diana that he has a nightmare all the time and that he does not remember what is happening, or why it happened. He gets a bit upset and starts to leave. Diana asks him to stay but he says she should go. Diana has an idea and she takes a needle and says it is not necessary. Ramiem, however gets angry and says Diana is a whore and then starts to beat up Diana. Diana tells him that he is not allowed to hit her but he keeps hitting her.   It looks like a pretty straightforward story, but there are
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of movies that are similar to "Rear Window", but they don't look like it at all. The movie takes place in the time period around the time of the First World War and it follows a couple that are on holiday in a nice resort, but then they have a terrible nightmare where they see a man in a nightgown dragging a dead body behind him.   The movie is full of bad memories, but also a beautiful movie to look at.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've had this movie in my mind for a long time but never really got around to it. This is a beautifully shot film about a lonely woman on a train that goes down the tracks. She is about to be trapped on the tracks and is in the last moments of her life as she is seen in the camera looking down the track.   The film is also a very quiet film with the only sounds being the train wheels, the wind and the trains horn.  The story is about a widower who leaves his wife in the care of his brother.  It shows a beautiful lonely wife on the train going down the train tracks.  This film was an oddity at the time.  I know that when it was released it was seen by many who loved it and others who did not.  There is still no English translation available but I will include a scan from the Japanese trailer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like The Green Mile because it's about an astronaut who has to go to prison, which is in the middle of nowhere.    In the movie, we are shown a man who was supposed to be one of the best astronauts of the 20th century, and then he is sent into space for a mission that ended up with him dying in a freak accident.  He was supposed be a genius when it comes to space travel, and his death shows that.  Even though this was a long time ago, we still understand that he was supposed of be one amazing guy, and he died at such a young age.  This movie is a great movie that shows that astronauts can be badasses, but only when they have their heads on straight and they really believe in themselves.

There were a lot of great scenes in this movie, but some of them made me sick.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the late 60's, a young man named Ray Bradbury became a successful sci-fi author. But his dreams of a better world have only been crushed by the evils of the U.S. military. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Bradbury takes on the "Grendel" - a deadly alien beast that has taken up residence in the U-Boat, a giant, floating, nuclear-powered submarine - and with his friend, Ray's daughter Mary, a former prostitute. A mysterious girl named Dandelion, Bradburn's "little girl", seems to have some connection to the creature and may be the key to saving mankind.   The movie has Bradbury's trademark wit and imagination but the "B" films of that era were really weak. And with a few minor improvements in the acting, the Grendel's story may be improved but the ending is unsatisfactory. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an actor I've seen my fair share of bad movies, from the first two-and-a-half minutes of the first "Taken"   to the last third of "Takers".   The first one was very well-acted by Ben Barnes and his new wife, the second one was even better, especially since the lead actor didn't suck, and the third one was a mix between the first and second films with the worst performance by Tom Hardy ever.   But this one is good!   So much so that if you hate bad movies this is a movie for you! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts in a church, the first shot of the movie is the priest looking at the picture of a young girl, and then he realizes that she is not a girl, but a girl.   When the priest goes to the girl's mother to ask for the name of the girl she is talking about, the mother tells him it is not the girl he is looking for, and says that it is a boy.  The priest goes down to the street and sees a girl with long, black hair.  He goes to a store and asks the girl if she is a girl and she says no, she is looking at a picture of her younger brother.  Then the priest asks the boy if he is a young man, and the boy says no he is not, he is in his teens.  At the church the girl turns out to be the girl the boy was looking for.  When she is told that the priest is mistaken, she looks at the girl, who is now a girl again, and asks if the priest will change the girl back.  To which the priest says, no, the girl was a boy before and so is the boy, so the priest can't change them back.   The movie moves along with the priest trying to find out what caused the girls to change, and they seem to have it coming to them.  They are both very young, both of them have long, wavy black hair, and both have lost their family.  Their lives seem to be a complete nightmare, and neither of them seem to know what to do.  Finally the priest decides he has had enough and goes to get the priest who is supposed to be in charge of this, and in doing so the girl who was a man in the past turns into a girl who is a woman again.  It is a nice story, and I liked it.  There was a scene where the girl told her mother about the boy she had been looking for since she was a young boy, and her mother tells her it is still possible to change back to a boy, but it takes a man to change a woman.  I liked this story, but I'm not sure it was that interesting.  For a movie about a girl changing, I was hoping there was some more going on than that, but that didn't happen.  Overall:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll never forget this movie. It's an original take on the classic tale of a boy and his dog and the mysterious town of the same name. I've been in love with the concept of a town that grows up around a single, old abandoned shack for years now, and in all the movies I've seen of the original story I never thought about it again until the day I watched this one. It was a story about a boy who was raised with only his dog, that grew into a large beast with the power to see through human hearts, and a small town that seems to want nothing to do with him. I remember having this film as a child and wishing it was still around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very interesting story.   The director of the movie, Robert Redford, does a nice job of portraying the life of a man who is trapped in the middle of a civil war in France.  His role in the film is not as prominent as other actors in the movie (such as the French characters who play his friend and lover), but his performance is very realistic, and he plays the role very well.  There are a few things about this movie that I don't like:  It does not make a big deal about the war;  It's set in France;  Redford is played by a French actor and the movie seems to focus on him for about 20 minutes;  The movie shows no fear of dying, although the French in the war do show a lot of fear;  Finally, there's a character named Marie who seems to be the one to get the girl, although she is not a very nice person.  Overall, this is a good, well-made movie that does a good job of telling a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's no secret that the James Bond franchise has never been my cup of tea. The 007 films aren't bad, but the Bond films have always been kind of a downer (not to say that the previous films are bad, just not my cup) and the first one in a long time really let me down. Not the least of which was a story about a spy who's only goal is to kill 007. I understand it's a James Bond movie, but this Bond has a problem. That problem is that he can't shoot, but can't be shot, because 007 has the greatest gun in the universe: a giant ice pick with a laser beam on it. I'm not sure how this movie was supposed to play out. The Bond film is always supposed to be about the villains and Bond does his best to get the bad guys to reveal themselves by making sure he's standing over the bad guy when the bad people show up. What the bad person doesn't realize is that Bond is really, really tall, so it looks like Bond is standing over them, but they still end up blowing each other up. They're also trying to escape by going through a river, but that's not an option because Bond can't run. Bond makes it out to sea, only to run into a man in a submarine. He does a little bit of shooting and runs into a small boat that has some sort of big gun. Bond finally gets to shoot the submarine and it explodes, but what follows is one of the most comical sequences in film history. One of the men on the submarine is trying to shoot Bond, but he can see the guns coming, so he just shoots the men and then takes the submarine to the surface. Then Bond tries to drive the submarine through a bunch of ice, but it doesn't work because the water won't let it go. Then there's a scene in which Bond is driving the submarine into a river. When he starts to move the boat, the water starts moving in and the ice starts falling out. He's trying to stop the boats from getting away by putting on some skis. The water gets deeper and the water is coming up to the top of the car. Bond realizes that he has to get into the car and drive it into the water.   What's most interesting about this is that the people who are supposed to have the best knowledge of the movie world know so much that they know all of

There is a girl with a brain tumor, and her family decides that the best way to help her is to put her in a very dangerous mental institute in a little town called Lecompton. The people there don't seem to like her very much and don't really understand what she can do. Then the director tries to give them a reason to think of her by creating a movie with a great score, a beautiful picture and a story that is very real.   This is a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The film was written and directed by a man who understood his medium and was very good at portraying what it's like to be human, when that's not the usual fare for the genre. In a society that seems to be dominated by one or two'superman-type' men who rule their subjects with iron wills, it's very easy to forget that there's a great many other people who have feelings and a complex set of emotions which they feel, which is not something to be overlooked, for even the world's most powerful people are not immune to their own failings. It's good to see another film which deals with the subject in an original and respectful way." - New York Review of Books

This is an old western, with a new and very different story, but one that has a very familiar look and feel to it. The cinematography and filming is just brilliant, and the story is fun and funny in the best possible way. The character of James is a very different, yet familiar, character, and a good change of pace from his usual self.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is just about as good as the previous   films.   As in the others, this movie takes place in a place which has changed. People dress in a certain way, walk like they did in the old days and talk like old time "talkers".   In other words, they're all still acting like the same people we've seen before and the   people that have   lived in this country for   many years now.  At the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to several characters who live in a small town and it's apparent that this town isn't all it's cracked up to be.  While the town appears to have the same characters like in   the previous films,   their behavior changes quite a bit over the course of the film.  Also,  like the previous movies, this film is very faithful to the old times.  This is a fun romp that doesn't take itself too seriously and is well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an American. In the late 1920s, Hollywood was flush with starlets. But there were only three great leading ladies: Norma Shearer, Clara Bow, and Rose Wilson. These women, by all accounts, were just as good at what they did as the male stars: singing, dancing, and singing, and dancing.   The movie is good for the two girls. It is not very good for all the other characters.  I'm not sure if this movie is a little too good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story:  I have never seen anything like this film, as a matter of fact I've never seen an entirely bad movie.   This film is about a man who is out for revenge, as he thinks he has killed a person.  He finds out however that he didn't kill that person, the person he killed died, and after some time the man's daughter is taken from him and he's not certain who it is that's taken her.  He thinks the woman that's taking her might be a child who killed the person.      One day, he meets this man who looks just like him.  At first the man doesn't seem to believe him, and it seems that they have a long and complicated history.  After a little while the man finds out that this is the same man that he knows as a teenager.  The main conflict is between two people; a man and a woman who both want revenge, and they have some similarities, although the two have completely different ways of getting there.  It's really a great film.

They have a number of interesting and unusual characters, and they look fantastic.  I've seen a number in the Disney channel and they always look amazing, but this one is the most beautiful.  This movie is wonderful, and I'll be looking forward to the next Disney film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw "The King's Speech" as a kid, it was a great film.   This is another wonderful, funny, and educational film about a young British guy who has an epiphany in his first day of school.  I was a big fan of "Shakespeare's Sister" when I was younger and I hope it will do well with its sequel, "The Winter's Tale" (which opens with "The Tempest")   I've been following these films for a long time and always enjoyed watching them and being amazed by their performances, which are outstanding.  The acting in this movie is all about the young, talented cast, but the direction by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts is excellent and a very worthy sequel to "The Man Who Wasn't There".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a well-made movie, one of the better war films of all time. It is more of a psychological thriller than a straight-forward action movie and a more powerful movie. It would be interesting to see a remake of this film with different actors, and different settings.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has everything a good horror film has:  - scary moments (like a kid dying)  - a lot of "you never see this stuff coming"  - one of the best scares  - excellent, creepy score   The special effects are done by Roger Corman, and were very good.   It's a good reminder that the best things are in the film industry. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I am not a big fan of horror movies. They're often cliched and not very good.   But I was able to finish this film.  I found it interesting, well written and I felt sorry for the characters. I didn't like the acting, but it was very well done.  As for what I liked about the film: The script was good. The story was well paced. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a very interesting work of science fiction and fantasy.  This is a movie about a young man who has a rare genetic defect.  It prevents him from aging and, more to the point, makes him into a vampire.   A great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so funny and great.   Like a comic book in an early 80's superhero movie, the film features a guy that is just plain cool. I like to say that if this dude were Superman, then he would be Batman and if Superman were Batman, then this dude would be like Superman.  This dude was an awesome stand-up comedian.  When you saw him on the TV, you just knew he had that charisma, charm, and he could really get a crowd in the audience.  Like Batman, this dude had to keep himself cool and cool, even in the face of ridicule.  He would take the worst insults from others and just give back the best insults.  His girlfriend was hot and I can not tell you how hot this lady was.  I love when a lady's big boobs jiggle all the time and when I think about that, I am jealous of that lady's boobs.  As an aside, if you are looking for something different with your buddy, give this guy a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The cast is quite good. A new girl has come to the bar and has been asked to stay by her new bf. She says she needs to see the other regulars, but gets a bit carried away, and doesn't want to leave. It turns out that her new "friend" has a crush on her and is ready to pay her. It is an action film, and not much dialogue, but the girls are all great.   I really liked this movie. I don't know if it will be the last, but for now, it's a decent action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As someone who grew up in the early 80's as a "hustler", this was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen. It was entertaining and funny, but not as dumb as it seems to be on the first viewing.   My second viewing was a much better movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie I just finished is a good one and has a very good script, and has an interesting concept.   Although there are some moments of confusion, I think the movie works on several levels.  A small town is attacked by aliens, and some people try to protect the town, but are defeated by the aliens.  As the movie goes on it gets even more interesting, since the alien's attacks continue, but only intensify the town's isolation.  It was interesting to see how the alien developed, and the way they used human bodies.  Although the script is good, it does seem that the film should have been better acted, and there were some scenes that I did not particularly enjoy, however it is still a very enjoyable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title of this movie, I will admit, is not as catchy as the movie it is based on. But it works.   A few days after an earthquake has caused the devastation of Japan, a man comes across the wrecked remains of an old house in the hills. He's the only survivor. After finding a bottle of whiskey at the scene of the disaster, he drinks it and feels like a normal guy. Then, he decides to take a trip. He goes to a town that used to be a famous mountain resort in the middle of the Alps. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good, straightforward adventure movie. The story begins when a small boy (Gunnar Karlsson) gets lost in the woods and runs away to his grandmother's house. She is a strong woman, but she can't remember where her house is. The boy takes off his hat and boots in front of the house and then tries to climb a small hill. A man (Christian Torborg) sees him running and follows him until he gets to the top of the hill. Gunnar is afraid that he might be attacked by wolves or dogs and tries to hide under a rock. His grandfather (Karl Johan Kristensen) tells him to come back home and tries everything to get him to return, but he can't do it. After a few more unsuccessful attempts, Gunnar runs off again. This time, he is followed by a young girl (Fjalar Kristensen). After a day, Gunnar returns home and is about to have dinner with his family when he discovers that the neighborhood is being terrorized by a group of dogs and wolves. When the wolf is finally killed, Gunner is afraid to come outside. He decides to sleep in the basement with his grandfather. A dog follows him, but is scared away by the grandmother. Gunnara sleeps in the same room with him, until the morning comes when the neighborhood was attacked by a man (Arvid Wibbels). After the attack, Gunniar manages to sneak downstairs. When Gunniara finds out about this, he follows Gunnar outside to help him. The neighbors try to stop them, but when that fails, they burn the house down to keep the animals away. Gunni and Gunnar decide to follow the animals to their caves and the others decide to take refuge in the river. The group arrives at the cave, but there is no shelter and they quickly run into a trap. Gunner has to fight all the wolves and tries his best to run away. But he is bitten by a wolf and falls unconscious. When he wakes up, he realizes he is back in the house, and he's in his pajamas.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by the way this movie was made, not because it is so great, but because it's a movie that seems to have a story in it that wasn't there before.   For those of you who don't know about the movie, it's about a little girl named Sophie who has a dream about having a dog, and the dog decides to come out of the woods.  She is scared and then a big dog comes out of nowhere and bites her head off.  Sophie wakes up in the hospital with her head back and no body to be found.  So, she's not dead yet.  This girl is a little odd, in the most beautiful way, and she dreams that her dog has been taken away by some people who want her to be their slave.  The movie was fun and made me laugh a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure it's an awful movie, but I like it.   It has all the trappings of a Hollywood movie: the sexy women, the drugs and the sex.  I like all of the above except for the sex, but it's pretty hard to ignore.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty good.  It doesn't have any memorable songs, but the background music is nice.  My only qualm about this film is that, for a remake of a horror movie, it is actually pretty bad.  For a remake, I have to say it's disappointing.  At least it didn't have a bunch of bad special effects.  This is a bad remake, not a bad original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like any of the big action movies from the 90s, then you will love this one!   Directed by the great Peter Bay, it stars Wesley Snipes, Bruce Willis, Richard Gere and Christopher Walken, who are all doing a great job of playing the kind of guys who like to take over the world.   I saw it in theaters a few years ago and my review was a bit harsh, it was too violent and had a strange humor which I found somewhat offensive.  Since then, I have seen it about a dozen times and I have noticed that it is still just as great as it was.  It is full of lots of laughs, violence and sex.  A great action movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, I am the biggest Steven Moffat fan and I am so very happy with this movie.   I think it's a masterpiece.  I love this movie!   It's a great story, wonderful characters and a great climax.  It was a great ride for me.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Liza from I watched this a month ago.  Now I need to get more!  I've been watching this a few weeks ago now.  This is my first fan made video.  You guys must be a fan of Moffat.  The characters, their personalities and how they act are incredible.  Every character has their own voice.  Even the "villain" is great.  All in all, this is amazing!  The story takes place in a world where there is a huge army of robots who are called "The Daleks."  Each person has a job and a role to play in the group.  They are so perfect!  A little over half way through I was crying.  Very good story and acting.  If you like science fiction, then this is a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a film with the "magic" of fairy tales. It is about a "fairy" who was abandoned as a child and is rescued by a beautiful young girl who takes him in her arms and gives him a warm home with her own sister and brother.   The film starts with a long scene in which the "fantasy" of the "strange-looking" creature is shown. The girl gives him milk and he is given a spoon and a glass. The next scene shows him with his new family and living in a house with many wonderful things around it.  It is very interesting to look at the beautiful young family.  We have the beautiful sister who is dressed all in pink and we have the mother and sister and the uncle, who is playing with a "bun". The "Fairy" has a great role in the film and we see him taking care of his new sister.  But when we look at his family it is like looking at a fairy tale.  In every scene we see the wonderful things in which they are living: the food, the houses, the children, and the flowers.  The family loves each other and it is evident in the scenes they take together.  While the "Fantasy" is not "realistic" in the sense that it is a real fantasy, it is very real in the fact that it has a real life to it.     I like this film for its beautiful fairy tales and its beautiful characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a fantastic adaptation of a very good novel.   "We the People" is one of the most famous speeches ever:  1.  At the end of World War II the nation of Great Britain is split down the middle. One side fights to end all wars, and the other side fights against all wars.  2.  The "We" here stands for a world community, but in the story's main character the "We", we have a nation divided between two warring groups:  3.  One group, the "Eighty-four," is a loose association of men, mostly students and unemployed. They want no wars, no peace, and no interference from anyone else in their lives.  4.  These are people who are good people:  5.  They are all hardworking, honest, and sincere.  6.  Many of these men, while working for a living, have volunteered to fight and die in a foreign country.  7.  But for all this, the story has a happy ending:  8.  As in the novel "We," the world is divided into two parts:  9.  There is the "I," which is an "America," made up of many different groups and groups of groups.  10.  To these the men of the "we" are "We-people" — the people of "We."  11.  This part of the world, and of the story, has an atmosphere of happiness, where everybody wants peace, but people are not at peace:  12.  A group called the "Five-Seven" wants war to be resumed, and are looking for a new nation to be created.  13.  Then, we have the group called "We and the World," which wants no war, no strife, and an end to interference by the outside world.  14.  So, this group wants to fight for peace, just as the "eighties" did in the movie:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins with a typical love scene in a restaurant. In contrast to the usual film genre clichés (as if it's just an old-fashioned, clichéd story) this one is funny, romantic and well acted. A well-dressed man, who is very much an unknown figure to the waitress, gets to know her a little. The waitress doesn't seem to know anything about him, except he's very good-looking and rich. This leads to more laughs from the crowd at the restaurant as the guy asks for a room. The woman is a professional dancer but is a little too timid to be good at it. The dancer is a womanizer, who has more than one woman in his life. We also have some strange characters in this film: one is a blind man and the other a blind woman.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not what I expected at all.   I knew that it is based on the book of the same name, I also knew that the book is a very bad movie.  But I was so confused when I watched it. I was not confused about the movie at all; it was so obvious from the start that it was a bad movie, that it never had a chance to shine at all!   It was so slow.  They all just sat around in the same room and spoke about something they did not know, while in the background there was someone playing an accordion, and the person playing it was playing very fast.  The movie's climax seemed like it was only half-hearted.  I just could not imagine what the movie was supposed to be about!  I suppose it was supposed be an excuse to use a lot of old movie tropes and do a "star-studded" version of a "good movie".  I guess it was made to appeal to the "lowbrow" audience!  It is very strange that someone would actually be making a film based on a novel which is so bad, so cliché, so unimaginative and so bad that it should not be made at all, let alone directed by a person who could write a decent book.  In other words, I guess a very simple and obvious mistake was made; it should have been made by someone with a better command of the English language.  So, I will give this movie a C. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is not very good but it is a good thriller and a good horror movie.    A lot of people criticize this movie and the movie itself is not good but there is a reason for it:  It is a scary movie. I like horror movies a lot because I like scary movies a bit too much. This movie will always be in my horror movies for this reason.  If you like scary scary movies, then this movie is for you: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's been a while since I've watched a John Carpenter movie, but this one stood out in a lot of ways.  The opening scene is amazing, as is the scene of the two friends' final moments before they meet with the devil in the elevator, and the ending scene with the little girl who's just seen her parents die is amazing as well.   The movie is about an unnamed protagonist who falls into a trap and is subsequently chased by an evil woman.  While the protagonist doesn't actually fall into the trap himself, the woman does, and a terrible, horrible, horrible fate awaits him.  This story is actually based on a few different short stories: one about a woman falling into a box trap, and another about the narrator becoming her guardian after he was found on a train in the 1950s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the funniest movies ever made, a classic.   In this movie, you'll laugh at a guy who keeps losing the lottery and can't win it again.  It's like a cartoon: a bald-headed guy in a raincoat tries to win a lottery with a $100 bill.  In fact, this is the only time in the movie that you think the movie is based on a comic strip:  One man wins the $100 with a bill with the same number in every state, including Alaska, Hawaii, Colorado, and Washington (though only Washington has a state lottery). The guy is a louse: a poor bloke who can't figure out how to play a lottery that has millions of winners.  We laugh, too.  But, in the end, we win, too! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed watching this film.   It was very entertaining, entertaining and just plain funny!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film about good people. It's the kind of movie that you can watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon or in the middle of a long, boring day.   It's about the lives of a group of people living in a suburb of Chicago.  While the film opens with a man named Jerry (Paul Newman) getting a ride from a fellow resident, it quickly becomes apparent that he's not a man who enjoys himself.  Jerry is a man with a serious head on his shoulders, and even when he's feeling good about life, there are times when he wants to go out and have a good time.  What Jerry is not is a nice guy.  He's a prick, with a long list of things that he would do to any woman who dares to approach him.  If you don't want to see a lot of violence, nudity, and vulgar language, avoid this one.  The film is set in an extremely bland suburb called New Lenox. There isn't much going on in this one, so it doesn't have to be anything special.  There are some nice effects in this film, but they're nothing special. However, it is a great little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  It is also a great looking movie, and it's fun to see some old faces in a new setting.  This film is an instant classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie, I was actually surprised the director decided to go for a very original idea. It is one of the best things about the movies of the 80's, and one of my favorite films of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Babe...Babe....Babe!"   It is the most perfect movie ever made.   I was so entertained by the main character and his life as a slave to the man of the house.  When the film began to pick up steam, the first line the character said, "I am tired of living like this!" was so true and the rest of the film followed that perfectly.  I really think that a film can have so much to say and still make me laugh.  So many people have tried to make movies like this, but no one has done a good job of it.  It's not a story about slavery, but a story of a man who had no choice but to live that life and then some.  If you are in the right frame of mind and have a good, strong heart you will be completely satisfied with this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about the battle between the forces of good and evil is one of the most enjoyable.   The story is simple and well executed but it is not very original.  The battle between good and bad is done well and does not require too much explanation.  An action packed movie, well worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the film and I like the character:  I like how the film makes the idea of a girl in a world where everyone is male seem strange.   They seem to say that men are the new female role models?   The girl seems a bit naive but I like that.    I like her character: I think the movie has a couple of scenes in it that I think are pretty interesting.  I really like the movie and I think it is a good idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has all the ingredients of a good action movie with good acting and decent special effects, in a movie without a great villain it's hard to find any other positive things to say, and if you were interested in some of the less famous villains in other action movies you could have done a lot worse than this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of scary movies but never anything like this one. This movie is like a nightmare from hell. There is a guy (Buster) who is looking for his brother, the other brother. In the beginning, when the brother is lost in the woods, it looks like his brother is the one who is lost. But after a few days, it's clear that his brother doesn't want to be found. Buster decides to go to the other side of the forest to search for his lost brother. But the forest is a dangerous place. When he gets there, he comes face to face with a creature that can smell a person's body heat. Buster is frightened by the creature and runs away but before he does, he runs into the woods where he meets the creature. This is not a friendly encounter. Buster's brother is gone and he wants to find him. It was not until later in the movie that the two friends (Bobby and Mollie) finally discover their lost brother in the forest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is another film by John Hughes, and another good one.   The story is about a boy who gets lost in the wilderness and finds a strange tribe with a mysterious leader.  This one is a little slow, and some of the characters are rather annoying, but still you can't go wrong with it.  I will probably get the second (solo) film after this one.

They travel in a train to avenge a friend of their parents.  A lot of fun.

I love that there is no good guy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all,   This is an old school science-fiction movie.   There is no CGI, no special effects, no elaborate special effects.  There was just a good story and a good cast.  In order to understand this movie I have to first say a lot about the future.  We are now at the end of the 22nd century, which is a century of peace, a time when our planet is a paradise.  However, on a planet called Earth there are two species, the humans and the Vissers.  The Visser species are the most intelligent race, and they are very peaceful.  Humans have been conquering the planet for thousands of years, and the humans have also been the most evil people.  They have created an army of Visses to fight their wars.  One day the human race gets a surprise visitor on Earth, a Viss, called Balthazar (the name means "bright star").  This Viss is a very nice and polite man who has been living on Earth for a long time, and is always telling the human world the truth about how the world is going wrong.  It is at this moment that humans realize the mistakes their civilization has made, and realize they are not alone.  When the humans meet the Vess they are shocked to see how much the VISS can understand their civilization, and how much they are influenced by them.  This meeting causes a split in the human empire, and both races try to kill each other.  Balthazars life has been long and hard.  He has lived on Earth his whole life. He is the last son of his family, and only son of the Vresser Queen, he has no other father, and he is the most useless, worthless creature on the planet.  But in order to survive he has become the keeper of a Vess secret, he knows about the VESS' evil and the secrets of their world.  With the help of the alien Balthazon, he helps the human people fight back against the VIS' evil.  After a long and brutal fight Balthazzars life is saved.  All he has to do is to get out of this universe and into a new one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an old film buff, my first love being the early 70s exploitation films. So of all the films I have seen of this period, the only one I've seen twice was Blood Sucking Freaks. This is my second experience seeing a classic film from this period.   The story is not as good as that, but it has the advantage of being an interesting and entertaining movie, and the ending is fantastic!   It features one of the most memorable and memorable sequences I've ever seen!

I was amazed at the quality of the film. I was surprised by the amount of information that had been conveyed to me over the two films. I've always wondered what it must be like to be the son of a notorious movie director and to go to Hollywood to meet the most famous stars of the 20th century.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have just finished watching   this   and  .   It's been a long time coming but it was worth it.   The film is a very good example of a good western. It's set in the 1860's and it's set around a little place called   Littleton.  The only way to describe it would be like a good old fashioned Western set in a small town in South Carolina.  This is a really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very excited for this film and that was part of the reason that I made this my top rated movie on my list of the best films of 2015. It did what it was supposed to do, it brought about a great look at the criminal element in the Bronx. It was hard to watch and watch it was really hard to understand what was going on. There were a few scenes that were too close to the film that took away from the film's impact, but overall, this was a great movie with a great cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As you know, we're in this movie for no particular reason: We're not even a group of people who happen to be in a town; the place we're all in happens to be the middle of nowhere in the middle part of nowhere, and that's pretty much all there is to say about that.   There are some very memorable moments; the ending has it's own eerie feel, as the whole film makes us feel as if we've been trapped in a dark room for the past decade, and only now are we all emerging into daylight.  It's a great, fast paced, well-executed film, that is at once scary, heartwarming, and just plain silly, with a few nods to "Raiders of the Lost Ark" thrown in for good measure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?   It is a pretty good movie in the sense that it does a good job of giving you a good idea of what life in World War II was like. It also does a pretty decent job of showing the horror of the war, both of the fighting and the atrocities that the Nazis were capable of. This film has some good acting, and the setting of World War 2 Italy is a very interesting place.   I gave this a 3 stars on the grounds that it is only average, and a movie about a man who goes from a pretty successful boy to a broken man in a short time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie which has a lot of interesting ideas but which lacks a solid story. It is about a team of scientists working on a nuclear plant in Antarctica. They discover a strange object which can emit energy. When the scientists send a radio signal to the U.S.A. They are told that it will only take a day to arrive. A short while later the object is seen in a small valley which they reach via a long, winding road. As they reach the object they find that the radio signal is gone. When they get back to the base they discover that the entire facility is deserted. All they find are a few rocks. After a while, when the scientists are in the middle of their work in the small valley they come across a strange light in the distance. It grows gradually in intensity and then all of a sudden it explodes in a shower of stones. All of a s ee the survivors of the explosion run in all directions. This is the first part of the film and is followed by a story which is quite short but has many twists and turns which makes it more interesting than the story on the surface. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While not a bad movie, It is not without its flaws.   It has the potential to be a very good movie, if the characters had more depth and a few more interesting things to do during the first act.  And it doesn't get the attention it deserves either.  The movie has no real plot at all and yet a lot is going on.  It feels like a long movie since the very beginning and most of the time it is just a long chase sequence.  Also, the movie does a poor job of giving us an idea of where these characters are headed.  I would prefer a movie that was less plot oriented and more of a mystery that would be more interesting to me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My two favorite things in the world were ice cream and watching a movie.   In the early 20th century, a little town in Ohio got its name because it was home to a bunch of   big dogs.  One of them, a big guy named   Puffy,   (that's his name, not puffy's) is a little old dog and has been around since the 1920's. He's a good natured dog and loves playing. One day, he decides to leave the   town to get some ice cream.  Once outside the town, the  ice cream truck crashes and is run over by a   car.  Puff is thrown from the truck and hit by the  car and is killed.  He was just in the middle of his favorite treat and his death is terrible.  There are a lot of funny little things going on in this film like the truck driver who gets a broken neck (and doesn't die) and is covered with ice cream (but doesn't eat it) and the girl who is a bit on the crazy side.  In between all of this humor, we have a pretty nice story about a dog who tries to do the right thing despite it being horrible.  It was a fun little flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You're probably familiar with James Bond films as they are the source of so many wonderful films of a very different genre.   For this movie James Bond and an older spy master (Brigadoon) work together to take down the mysterious villain and to get some treasure from him.  This film is about a young man who is recruited to help an older, evil master (Arsenio Hall) to destroy the good guys, steal some treasure, and become a new world-famous spy.  James Bond is a bad guy who is only in this movie for his money.  Arsenio is great, and he's a big part of why this movie works.  The villains are fun, the film is clever, and it has some good fight scenes.  There's not a lot of "action" but it's still a good film.  In other words, this film is a lot more interesting than you might think.  Bond and Arsen-Ich have lots of laughs and banter.  I don't remember all of the dialogue but it doesn't matter.  It's a good, good fun flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie! It's a little corny, but I'm a sucker for that. The film is very well-done, with some good acting.   The story has a great cast, and they all get their scenes.  I enjoyed it so much that I made a little post about it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Shining is the worst movie I've seen in years. It's a great film, but as a horror movie I'd have to say it's the worst."    I was expecting a few scares, especially when one of the two main characters, Jack Torrance, meets his fate, but what I got was a film with no style or charm, a film that could have been shot in any suburban neighborhood, a movie that I wish I hadn't seen.   At the time I was too young to know about "The Exorcist," so this film didn't quite register in my mind like a true horror movie, but there were so many moments where I was left shaking my head.  - I think I like this film better than "A Little Princess" in that it has more horror elements and scares but I would prefer the old "The Evil Dead" for better scares and more character development. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an awesome film for sure, great dialogue, a really cool story and the best performances are in here. I would say I like it best if you want to see a comedy with lots of violence but I would definitely recommend this movie as a watch out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's very obvious that the film is made for kids because it's so funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good and an interesting movie.   I liked it a lot.  It has some action scenes, but it's not too much.  This movie is not so funny, so don't watch it with people who like to joke and who like the whole "fun" thing, because this movie is about some really bad shit.  The movie starts off very interesting.  In this movie, I've noticed that this movie has an actual good idea to it.  I don't know why they chose this movie.   They just didn't know what to do.  So, this is a good idea.  But, it's a bad idea.   The movie takes itself so seriously, but when it wants to do something funny, it does so very badly.  There's nothing funny about this movie at all.  And it's just an idea with no actual funny things happening.  At some point, this movie loses all its funnyness, and ends up being a bad comedy.   That's a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As much as I enjoyed The Man From Nowhere, I have to admit it is a very short film. It only had about thirty minutes to tell its story and I was not impressed at all.   The script was too long and I didn't really like anything in it.  The story was very strange and I don't think anyone could have possibly believed it was possible for a guy to go into a movie theater without getting killed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never got to see this film until it was released on DVD. I've always felt that its strengths lie more in its themes than its visuals. In the movie there are moments where I felt like it was trying to go for the shock factor of a Tarantino film. That the character that the movie centers around is a woman of substance. But there were also moments where the movie made me laugh, but was ultimately still somewhat disturbing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw it, I had a vague notion that I'd be seeing this one again. The first thing that hit me when I watched it was the fact that the movie doesn't waste any time on the characters: it's a quick and brutal shoot 'em up that quickly gets you hooked on its unique brand of combat. It's more of a thrill than anything else.   I'm a sucker for a good, old-fashioned, good time, and I loved this movie.

The kids are adopted and live a normal life with the older sister and grandfather.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the beginning, the movie shows us that people like this can be good people and also bad people, but not only can they be bad people but they can also be good and at the same time bad. But even if they are bad and at times they are good it doesn't mean they are all bad and it doesn\'t mean they don\'t have good moments like when they are doing their act, or the time when they went to the park together and they laugh together about something.   What is also important is that we have a very positive feeling when it is all over and I mean the ending.    It seems like this movie can make people like and admire other people because I have been watching it and the movies are so good!   I like the movie as a movie because there are a lot of interesting characters that are well drawn and all the characters have a different and nice personality. I like all the people of the characters and I hope you like this too! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best comedies I have ever seen.   It is a bit like the "Shine a Light" movie, but much less scary.

In a lot of the other movies I have seen I have been bored and I did not feel this one was too dull.  I think this movie could be good. I will see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I thought I was watching a good comedy, not the usual stuff you are used to watching on TV. But, this time, it was not funny at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like good movies and you like films with a strong sense of mystery, then this is the movie for you. The plot is simple, but not so simple as you might think. A young woman is living in the home of her late husband, a man whose murder has been the subject of some public speculation. When her husband's body is found, the police have no suspects and the whole area seems to be plagued with unexplained disappearances. The police do take the lead in the case, and the wife's attempts to uncover the killer's identity make them a little suspicious.   It is easy to watch a good film without getting too involved. The film was well made and is definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First and foremost I will say that this is an awesome movie. This is a wonderful movie that should be seen by everyone who is a fan of old time movies. This movie is a great film that is set in the early 1900's and stars a beautiful woman named Dorothy Dandridge and a handsome man named John Keogh. This film is not a story of love. The love interest is the best love interest that is ever conceived of in any era. I know this movie is set years before the movie of the same name in this genre and is set about the same time period, but that does not matter. The movie is so well made and so interesting that one can't help but sit in the theater and be completely charmed. The acting is excellent in this movie, and Dorothy is wonderful. The entire movie is full of a beautiful setting of flowers, parks, and the beautiful scenery. The music is a perfect mix of the old and new. The plot of this movie begins with the opening scenes of a carriage and the two men driving it through a long and beautiful avenue. It is then followed by the beautiful Dorothy and her friend, a young man named Charles Rauch, who is about to meet with a woman named Maria, a beautiful and beautiful woman. The first half of this is a delightful ride through the countryside with great music and an excellent cast. Dorothy and Charles talk about their respective lives and Charles asks Dorothy to go to New York to see him. The rest of the movie follows their travels across the United States and a wonderful romance is created between them. After Dorothy's visit to New Amsterdam and her meeting with Maria, Charles takes her to a famous jazz club called the "Fink" (for the Fink is where the action takes place), and Dorothy falls in love with a man named Jack Smith. The romance between Dorothy and Jack is quite sweet, but is eventually ended when Charles learns that he is going to be married. Dorothy returns home and talks with her brother about her adventures in the West. The film ends with Charles telling Dorothy about his life in New York.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the reason why I'm never going to watch it anymore.    I know it was filmed in the 90's, but it really was a good idea.  There is an idea that is never done that I think would be good:  Have two people from opposite ends of the planet, each of them in a different time zone.  The first man is from New York and the second man is in Philadelphia.  I don't know why this was not done in the first movie, and in this movie it's actually done to the point that it would be funny.  One of the characters who talks about being in his mid-thirties in New York is actually from Philadelphia, but I'm not sure how that's supposed to work.  They also spend a lot of time traveling.  So much travel.  It's a good plan, but they never really go anywhere, so they just hang around, talking.  But it's fun!  So I guess what I'm saying is that it's a lot more fun to watch than it is to write about.

The director seems to have forgotten that the birds aren't birds:  This movie is a pretty good time! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen too many "superhero" films that make me laugh, that is, unless you count the three "Super" films (Superhero Squad, Batman Forever, Superman Returns) and the two "Supergirl" films.   The problem with all the other superhero films was that they had all the potential to be a good film. They were all good enough for me to not care if they were bad.  There was something that was fun about the action (even though it was a little on the repetitive side), that they didn't show it too much, it was just enough to get your heart pounding and make you want to keep watching.  If this wasn't for me, it wouldn't be a "superman" film at all.  The story was interesting enough to keep you watching and not wanting to turn it off.  I'm not a big fan of "super" movies but these ones did it right.  It is worth checking out even if you aren't a fan of superhero films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great film.   It is the story of a man who had no family and no hope in life.  He had a little blacksmith named Simeon who would fix anything he could with a few tools.  One day, he was building a wagon out of mud.  It was a beautiful piece of art.  Simeo was working with one hand while moving a large log with the other hand.  The two men did not see each other and he never saw the wagon.  Somehow, Simean survived.  But that did not matter to the poor old man.  After all, he had nothing to live for.  Then, a farmer offered him food, which he gladly accepted.  Later, an old woman who was sick came to him.  She told him that his life was a wonder.  When they left the old woman, he looked around to find her house.  There, he saw all the other poor souls in his situation.  And it was all the man could do to save them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to tell you a story about an old-time movie that my parents watched so often that we can hardly remember the title of it. We never knew how old they were. In their prime, they were still going strong. One night, a couple had come out on the front porch and were talking about the old movies they used to watch. I remember the sound of their voices, and my mother said something about "I'm the kind of girl who makes old movies." I knew that she had a good head for a little girl. "We used to go to that old movie house down on Main Street." My father said to me later that night. "I wonder if my mother still watches old movies?" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think the reason why this film is so good is because of the combination of the different genres.

The movie has a great combination of different genres to make it even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie.    I loved it for a few reasons:  * It's a beautiful, dark, disturbing story about the power of love.  * This story is a perfect example of the genre.  When I think of the great writers that we have today, I think about their incredible imagination and creativity.  When I think that a director could not only make a beautiful film but a beautiful movie about a very dark subject, it's amazing.  I think the reason that this is so wonderful is the fact that I can't put the movie down.  So I'm glad I watched it.  It's definitely worth the viewing experience and I'm looking forward to future stories.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You will see something you never seen before:  If you've ever wondered what it's like to be an animal in the wild, this film should give you a good insight.  The acting is excellent, the sound is good and the picture is pretty good too, which is something you have to admit is rare for a low budget movie (especially one made on a budget of $8,000).  The story is a bit convoluted, which would have been fine if it weren't for the fact that there are a lot of twists and turns, which are pretty much inescapable if you've seen a movie like this.  However, if you like animal movies, you should like this one a lot!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The thing that makes this film so great is the characters themselves.   The movie starts off with an old man who just wants to get home to his wife and kids.  He decides to take the subway to his home but when he arrives he finds a car parked on the side of the road.  The old man jumps in the car to get it and get home.  His son gets on the subway and rides it all the way to his own home. When he gets to his house he gets out and starts looking around.  Then he sees the car that his dad jumped in!  The car doesn't belong to anyone.  It is in great condition and is the only thing he has in his garage.  When he walks up to the car he discovers that it is the most expensive car in the world and it is worth a lot of money.  But that isn't all!  It also has a huge bomb in it.  Now he doesn't care if it is a bomb or not!  He is going to use it on his wife so that he can get home!  So with all of his friends around he has to decide what to do!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the premise of this movie. You have a girl (a good looking brunette) living in a tiny apartment. She is a very good cook, she also has an excellent nose. She keeps the apartment nice and clean and she never lets anyone in, even her maid. Her only friend is a guy who is a great dancer, and she goes out with him a lot. The movie is not too long and it has great music, so I liked it a lot when I was watching it.

A bit like the old Bambi.   Recommended for people who are interested in real life situations of children and adults living in such an oppressive society. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not often you get a movie like this with a plot that's not a cop-out and a movie that's more than a little funny.   The plot is fairly simple but also pretty original:  To the rescue comes a private eye who gets hired to track down a group of kidnappers, all of whom had been murdered in an earlier film.  It was also directed by the same guy who made the great comedy film, The Big Sleep.  The movie has some very memorable scenes, particularly the scene where the kidnappers are trying to get the lead character, Henry (Tommy Lee Jones) to sleep with them, but the best part of the movie has to be the whole movie.  The dialogue is also hilarious and there are some clever twists that go a long way towards keeping you on the edge of your seat.  There is a nice story and some interesting twists and turns.  This is not a great movie but it is definitely worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this film more times than I can count since I was 13 or 14.   This film is a really good classic, a classic in the genre of melodrama about a family in the late 60's that were struggling to make ends meet with the fact that the youngest son, a college student, was taking out loans to pay the tuition for his degree, while the mother was struggling to pay off an old mortgage and feed two little boys.  This is the true classic of that era.  The actors are all really good and it is just fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's nothing wrong with "Halloween: Resurrection," a well-made horror-thriller that is equal parts creepy and entertaining. It takes a couple of things from "Hocus Pocus" and combines them in a way that has some really cool results.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is fairly straightforward, involving a college student named Paul who is hired to help a woman who is running a circus out of her home. As this woman is a magician, Paul must help her perform the "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy," a dance that has been performed by the great, and now deceased, Lillian Hellman for many years.   It is a pretty simple plot but a lot of the humor lies in the way Paul is used, or misused, by this woman, with the circus being just another way she abuses Paul.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months back a friend and I decided to drive to New Orleans to see some movie. I remember thinking, "A movie? Really?" That's pretty much all I could think about while I drove along Highway 10 toward the French Quarter. It turns out that a friend of mine worked in New Orleans a few years ago, and he said that there was a film festival that ran from the end of July to the middle of August every year. That is one of those movies that, when you first see it, you really can't believe it, but then when you sit down and watch it, I think you'll come to love it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is good.   It is an unusual mixture of comedy and drama, with plenty of action to keep the movie going for a long time.  The plot involves a girl who gets a part-time job as a model in a modeling agency. The company is run by a guy who is obsessed with her, to the point that he has to wear an eye-patch (he is obsessed by a girl in the movie who has had eye-patches on her eyelids for a while now.)  While modeling, the girl meets a mysterious stranger, a guy in a white suit who has something to do with modeling.  However, the woman has to work with her boss, a young man who does not care what the company does to her, so long as she looks good. They get into a fight, the fight goes wrong, and the guy is dead, his head blown off.  Eventually the girl goes home, and it is a surprise to her when the guy she knows as a "neurosurgeon" suddenly arrives and takes over the company.  This movie is so strange that it is hard to explain, but the movie makes it seem like it was made by someone who knew what they were doing.  A great movie, with some great acting, and some great drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a movie which has to be seen to be believed. It is one of the most moving, touching and thought provoking films I have ever seen and if you haven't seen it yet, don't hesitate to give it a go.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a movie, the movie was funny and entertaining and really did not take itself too seriously. I mean the title says "a comedy of errors" but I don't believe it was "of errors" and I think the movie should not be so highly rated at all.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a good adventure in the history of the world and a good piece of work by a very good writer of the last 50 years.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. I loved the opening scene where the characters (one is a dog) are driving down a long highway and stop for a snack (sardines). We then cut to a scene of a man at a gas station (no one's ever asked him for a beer). The man sees the dog. He's going to pick a fight with him, but he knows there's a good chance they'll just bite each other and he needs a break. He takes the dog's leash and takes it down to the end of the road. He waits for the dog to leave and then he does. As the dog walks away, the man runs after it. He catches up with it but then the dog grabs him by the neck. He starts yelling and pulling on the leash, yelling and crying. He then runs off, yelling all the way. This happens about four or five times, and I was always afraid the dog would try to grab my throat with that big mouth. Finally, when the dog is out of sight, the dog runs back to where it belongs. The man gets in the car and starts to drive away but a dog jumps in his car.   It's very funny. I think this was my favorite dog scene in any film, and it shows a lot of the things I like about Doggone. I also liked that the dog didn't really attack the man, just stood there until he was on the other side of the highway. I'm not sure why the dog came up and started yelling at the man when he's not even there anymore, but it did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie! It is very good because it has a great story and good music.   I am really interested in the story. It has great story because of the way it is written. I found out the way that it starts. I watched the movie again and again and it just get better. I really enjoyed it because it is really funny and well-written!   It is about a man named Paul who runs a restaurant that is a hot spot for people to come and eat and drink. The first scene in the movie is the scene when Paul goes in and there is a woman eating. Paul then notices that she is very hungry and then he tells her to sit at the table. She looks down at the menu and tells him that there are no hot food items. Paul looks at the sign and there are hot foods! He tells her that she can sit there! Paul then takes a picture of the woman and then leaves. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's nothing better than a well made romantic comedy.   The movie is very funny.  It also has very good character development.  The script is well thought out.  I thought the actors did a good job with the movie.  My rating is a 2.5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last part of the series had a bad ending. I felt like they did their best to leave it right, yet the series could not get over the feeling of "that's not really a part 4". There is a movie in there which I recommend you to look at.   I hope that they'll make a season 2 and that it will have better resolution.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was hoping this movie would be a good way to end the new year, so that I could get back into the groove of movies again. But there are several things about this movie that make it look bad. It is slow, uninspired, and lacks some of the good parts of most action movies. The characters are all annoying and there are even more annoying characters.   The action sequences are all over the place. A lot of scenes look like they are taken from another movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't care that it's an American horror movie about a group of college kids who are kidnapped and put on a boat on the sea in the middle of winter.   (If this were really that bad, it wouldn't be on this list.)     This is a movie where you don't even care what happens next.  The characters don't really know what to do with themselves or their situation.  We follow the plot (but not in any way that matters, of course) and it just goes right over your head.  You never know what the next step is and it's not fun, because the characters just aren't that interesting.      But then, all of a sudden, the movie just completely takes off, because we're going to be abducted to some place, and the people there are terrible monsters and I don.  I mean, it was great to watch a movie like this one, I'm sure you're going into it completely new and fresh and expecting to be completely entertained.  They didn't bother to tell us anything about what was going to happen.  Well, except that it wasn't going to end happily. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie!   First off, I want to say that I am a big fan of comedy movies.   This is another comedy.  When the first act is over, you are laughing in all the right places.  It isn't always funny, but you feel a great sense of relief once it is over.  This movie is filled with laughs and you will laugh a lot.  I love the characters and the situations they find themselves in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is funny but it has a dark edge to it as well and there is some great acting that is in keeping with the theme.   The director, John Waters, is always fun to watch, he always plays it smart and he knows how to make a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure if there was a way to do the ending any better.   The fact that the movie doesn't really care about any of the characters is something I never would have expected from a movie this good.  It's a really good film that I hope to see again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty much like "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" except instead of a mopey, old man, the lead character is a little girl who has the powers of a 10 year old girl.   The movie is quite good at showing the world from the perspective of a kid who likes to play with and make toys.  The best of the films in this genre are "The Goonies", "Home Alone", "Pretty in Pink" and "Cinderella" and this is one of those films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a solid action-thriller and a good watch from start to finish. I liked it so much, it made me laugh out loud for the first time in years.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to see a good action movie, pick this one up.   This is a movie that is made better by its star (David Carradine) and is more than capable of carrying a solid action story.  Carradines performance is quite interesting as he has one of those voices where if he was trying to be serious and serious he wouldn't sound very good.  In one scene he's talking to his wife when he thinks that he's caught a bad guy in the act, but he gets away. He then picks up his gun to shoot his wife (for which she was mortified), but then he realizes he can't shoot the bad guy and has to get out of the house.  His character also seems to be getting better and better, and this film is an example of this.  This movie is also a movie made for kids as it's quite dark and funny at times, and is also pretty well made.  Overall a very good movie that I found more and more amusing the more I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not really a fan of horror movies, but this movie was a big part of the first three days of our vacation in Canada. There is some violence, but it is kept very subdued and not a lot of blood is seen. There are some scares, though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film "Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" is quite an enjoyable movie, one of my favorite movies of 2015, and a new discovery for many of us.   First of all we are introduced to The Hobbit (played by a really cute and talented actor), a man from the North of England who gets drawn into the dangerous world of the orcs, with a lot of fun that could be seen as a precursor to the next installment of this series, The Battle of the Five Armies (to be released November 18, 2016)   In the film there are a lot more laughs than you could imagine in a film this size, and as you will see it never stops being funny.  With all the humor that this film can offer the story is not a huge deal, but what we get is an excellent action-adventure flick, one with plenty of humor and a story that is both relatable and a real roller coaster.  The Hobbit: AnUnexpected Journey will keep you entertained and keep you wanting to see more from Peter Jackson, this is one of those films you want to see in a theater for the rest of your life!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all: "Funny."   While the movie has some great moments, it isn't really funny, in the sense that the story is very well-done.   However, if you're not a fan of the genre, you might enjoy this movie a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about the story and cast, I was worried that the movie might be boring and forgettable. I was a little disappointed.   The characters are very well done.  Some of the action scenes are great, some are not.  I would have liked to see a little more depth from the main character, but that is understandable considering the setting.  As the story progresses, the tone grows darker and darker.  The main character does not have a strong personality.  A lot of the characters are likeable, and some are annoying.  My favourite part is the ending, which is so dramatic and disturbing.  It is hard to summarize a good story, but I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes dark movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must see.   It is a great movie about a war veteran, a doctor who is a very strong man, a woman who was just a poor woman until she met a man and became a very rich woman, a man who is just a very brave man who loves his family, a war hero and a woman whose husband was just killed in the war. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   There are so many ways to describe The Shining, from the slow reveal of all the psychological horrors of the house's history to the scene where you find Danny with the dead girl, but what really got to me were the many little bits that just made this one of the best horror movies ever made.   After the opening of the cabin, we are treated to an old fashioned story about a man who has lost his wife in a house fire and is trying to get back to her home in New England.  It's a pretty generic story, but somehow it manages to get very unsettling and scary every time.  But it doesn't stop there.  Every single shot of the woods is creepy, and it doesn' t stop there:  The woman that Danny is searching for is actually another man who was murdered in a similar fashion.  Danny's search for his wife leads him into the house where all his other wife was murdered (and it turns out that the killer was hiding in their bed), and the house is filled with countless creepy scenes and scenes of horror that you won't be able to forget.  And what's really weird is that when Danny is finally able to find his wife, he doesn't find her at the end of the trail.  The only way that he can get home is by following a mysterious figure in the woods that seems to be following him at all times.  If you're anything like me, that's a big jump and one that will keep you guessing.  I know that I probably wouldn't watch this movie again, but even if I didn't enjoy it at the time, I would certainly return to it later on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all. This is a great film, and it's not just because it stars two great actors, it's because it has a great plot. The movie starts off with an evil clown coming to New York City and he is supposed to be a bad guy. However, he is not all that bad. He wants the same thing all evil clowns have, which is to get you to see what they can do. He has a lot of tricks up his sleeves, some of which have the audience going crazy (think, "The Dark Crystal"), others have you laughing out loud (think "The Shining"), others are genuinely creepy (think that creepy-looking clown with the beard). His plan is to lure kids to the abandoned amusement park that he has built. However the park isn't abandoned, he has to get kids to take their cars away so he can steal their engines. The park has lots of rides that are supposed to scare kids, but they never do.   However, the clown has a plan. He can make a kid's engine start by blowing a whistle. So when the kid's car drives away, the engine is running and the kid is gone.  The clown then takes his stolen car and goes to a local town and finds a kid to drive it away with. Unfortunately the kid doesn't seem to like the idea of being driven off a bridge. The clown tries to get the kid to get back on the bridge, but the kid refuses.  Then the clown tries for a second time, but once again the kid stops the car, not wanting to be taken to the bridge.  After all, he's been through enough, he knows he can handle it. The villain decides to pull a fast one on the kid. He takes the car away, then runs away to the next town, where he runs into a local man who has some crazy gadgets that will frighten the kids.  And then it all turns out to be for nothing.    The clown gets caught, but instead of dying the evil clown laughs. The people who were going to give him a ride to the town get ahold of his stolen engines, so the evil, and scary clown is back.  I like the ending, too. It's really cool how all the people who wanted to get away from the clown all ended up dead in the river. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   We see a lot of bad guys in the movies.   This movie gives us a great villain.  He is not a bad guy at all.  We get some great dialogue.  I loved watching the old school movie "I'll Give You A Ring"   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty excited to watch this movie based on the novel by Charles Portis. The first couple of minutes were pretty creepy and the next couple of scenes were downright scary and suspenseful. It takes some time to get the movie going but once it starts moving along you'll be hooked.   This movie is a little slow but it definitely has some heart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and it is not just because it is a good story but also because its a really funny movie!   It's a fun movie to watch because its the first movie where we meet a young boy who lives in a house. His name is Bob, and he is really shy and is afraid of everybody and everything.   This is the story of Bob's meeting with a witch (played by the incomparable Jane Fonda) and after her visit to his house she helps him make a really good movie.  The story is full of funny scenes and funny lines that make the story even more amusing.  Fonda makes this movie a very enjoyable one and she gives us a good, funny story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the movie The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  , about a poor farm family whose life is saved by the invention of a flying machine, it's said that in order to build a giant windmill that floats, a crane must have three horses. That's exactly what this film is about: The Blimp, a flying windmill powered by three horses that floats over the plains. But there are three horses!   The other two, named Big Bo and Red Riding Hood, are a little faster, but not that fast, and can only carry the Blimp so far. When the two slow down, so does the Blimb.   When it gets to the plains, the two horses, when they run out of steam, blow up, which leads to the Blimper (yes, that's the name) exploding, burning everyone who is near it and turning into a flying tree!  The blimp explodes and the blimp starts its ascent into the sky. It's not clear who the Blimmer is. He may be the Blint (I'm sure they spelled that wrong), a young farmer's pet dog.  A strange man is living inside of the Blamper.  His name is Jock (I wish they spelled it correctly), and he keeps trying to kill the Blimm, while the Blimming has other plans: he wants to be an astronaut.  The Blimmer and Jock become friends, and they join the Blims in their journey to the skies.  But they're not the only ones out there:  the Blimmers have hired three other horses, the Blinch, the Cabbage Patch Kid, and the Wild Wabbit.  After the Blumper, the others get in their way, trying to stop them.  Will the Blummasters survive?   And will the Blems make it?  Posted by Richard Behar at 4:25 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is hard to believe that such a good film has never been made, yet it is: it has the most original plot, the most clever dialogue, the finest music and, best of all, the greatest cast ever to be seen on the silver screen.   The film was filmed almost entirely with still photographs, of which only one is still in existence. The original set, with its wonderful costumes, is the most beautifully made and decorated theatre set of its time.  As an entertainer, I never felt so much as moved by an actor as by James Stewart, in the most important parts of the play: the villainous Professor O'Brien and his sinister, cruel and unappeasable plans.  The cast was also superb, especially the two leads, Marlene Dietrich and Walter Huston, who never gave any performance more than a droll and irreproachable air, but both were so convincing that their roles were more than worthy of their talents.  After the film was over, and as the audience started to leave the theatre, we heard the greatest applause that has ever been given to a film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure why this movie has such a bad reputation, but I think it has a lot to do with the fact that most people seem to associate this movie with the old movie of the same name. In this movie, Bill Murray plays a man who decides to buy a house and build a family.   Unfortunately, this is not what makes this a good picture. It's really a terrible movie with a weak script, and terrible acting.  I would definitely give it a 1 or 2 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a great man.   His character is both a caricature and an icon. He was not a saint, he was a person who could not stand having his friends talk about him that he was not good enough to take their best shot. He did everything possible to make himself a hero, but was not quite good enough.  This is a good example of the fact that good acting is not enough. As a character he was great, he knew how to make his life fun and light. It has all the ingredients of an enjoyable movie, except for one thing. It was set in the early sixties.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A new film by director Ken Loach about the war in Yugoslavia was recently released in theaters. The film has many aspects that made it enjoyable to watch. The acting was good and the cinematography, while a little shaky, was decent. The story about a small town in Yugoslavia with a history that is rich with hatred and corruption made me feel like I could have been there. Ken Loache was right about this being a great movie and I would suggest this to anyone who enjoys a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First I want to say that I am glad I saw this movie because I loved it. If you love cheesy 80's films, especially the ones that have a good soundtrack, then you should enjoy this one.   While I love all 80's comedies and are fond of the classic characters like Andy and Daphne from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?   Now here's where I have to say, that I have not watched this movie since I was a young girl and I haven't seen it since.  This is not a bad movie, it is more of a silly one, but if you love 80's movies like I do, then this is one for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this movie as a kid with my mom, and I can never get it out of my mind. The movie was good, but it was also very depressing, very real. I remember thinking "Why can't the little boy get out of that horrible little window he was trapped in? What kind of horrible kid would do that to himself?" It took me a long time to get over the fact that I didn't like the film at all, so I'm glad I don't hate it anymore, I still think that the scene where the girl and the boy are walking around was a good one though.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't had any more trouble with the plot than I had with the first. I think it's an extremely well put-together movie. It's got all the elements that make good TV: good acting, good plots, interesting characters, a couple of good one-liners, some good scenes of action, etc. etc. The story, which involves the world's oldest and most highly respected organization of detectives, is good enough, too.    So this is the movie that was supposed to make the detective show into a more modern, more exciting thing, because it's got a young, sexy detective, an old, sexy female detective, and lots of little plots (the police are investigating a case of a woman who was found murdered, and a local crime boss has come into the picture).   This movie is actually a remake of a short story in which a young detective solves a murder by solving it through intuition.  I had a rather pleasant and enjoyable time watching it (I'm a detective myself, so this movie is not entirely surprising).  I'm not going to do a review of the movie--I've seen a lot of detective shows, and this one is really nothing more than a good one.  In addition to being a cop show, a crime drama, and the old fashioned '60s cop show that everyone thinks is "cool", this was also a classic, like all the shows that people think are really cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the success of  The Crow  (1992), Joel Schumacher  ( The Rock  ) and producer Michael Bay began production on a sequel to this hit 1990 horror movie.   While it was never made, it was rumored to be the inspiration for the upcoming sequel to  Alien   (1992), although this is unlikely considering how long Alien  has been in the movie industry.    The Crow:  This film is very good, in that it has some horror elements in it (as well as comedy) but it is not a horror movie and it does not have any "gritty" scenes or graphic content.  It is, however, a very enjoyable movie that has some good performances by the cast, a great score by Michael Angelo (of  The Blackout ), and some nice gore and violence.  While this is not an especially good horror film, it is a fun and enjoyable watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        (May 1, 2012; originally posted in the "Feminist Theory Blog" ) I am happy to announce that the new film in the classic series The Twilight Zone, The Body is in fact about the body, not the soul.  It has the same title as that television show, but in this case we can't blame the writers for going with another TV show:    The Body does an excellent job of explaining what happens when our bodies become a bit too corpulent.   It takes the form of a movie which is neither "drama" nor "horror" (not even really a horror movie), but a documentary about what happens to people who have been too much in-shape.  There is a bit of mystery to this, but then there's a whole lot of mystery. It's a real roller coaster of a film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this is a great movie with some really good acting. It has great dialogue and also some great acting that has me wanting to get up and see it again. I can't say enough good things about this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie a bunch of times.   It's definitely a low-budget film.  There's not a lot of dialogue.  Some of the best scenes are in the beginning.  The camera is usually in a lot higher angle than we've ever seen it.  This movie is very short.  When you stop it's still pretty fun.  It doesn't get any better than this, really. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie's very simple plot consists of two different stories playing on the same subject: one about a young boy who wants to be a scientist and a girl who wants a normal life. This kind of movie usually ends with a happy ending, as it usually ends in most science fiction movies, and most of them are just stories about two characters trying to live out normal lives, but this movie is a little bit different: it is about the future of humanity. In a story called "Earthquake," our heroes become trapped in an underground chamber after an earthquake caused by a volcanic eruption, and they find that something is very wrong: the people who live there are mostly zombies.   However, in the end, our heroes will find their way back to reality.  As a good sci-fi movie should, this movie has a lot of clever ideas, and is even more interesting because of how well it's realized. The story, which takes place in the year 2200, is pretty typical sci- fi stuff: our heroes are trapped underground after a volcanic explosion, and while they are there they meet a young girl named Tanya.  Tanya is a beautiful young woman with a passion for science, and she is the only person they know who can help them out of the chamber.  The other scientists who have been trapped in the chamber for a few days are not too friendly to our heroes, but they do help them as much as they can. The other story in the movie, "Rockets Over Los Angeles," is a far more complex and intriguing story: after the volcano explodes, people start to die all over the planet, and there are rumors that a secret space program has been underway, and that extraterrestrials are involved.  When we get to the actual movie, however, we realize that it's actually a bit more than a simple story about a group of people trapped underground for a while.  For one thing, there is a lot more to it than meets the eye, and it's not easy to follow. We get a lot about the nature of the apocalypse, and how it affects our society, and the human race. The movie is about people and how they deal with a world that they can no longer understand, but it's also about what it means to live in the world we live in: how humans react to disaster, how they try to change the course of a terrible apocalypse, what they think of the people from the outside world
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a film which has many strengths. For a start, the animation is great. The movie also has a nice story. It shows a good way of being a person, and you can definitely tell how the story is told.   The voice actors of the characters are all great, and the story works well because of them.  This movie is very different from the other "kids movie" films out there. Instead of having lots of fun playing hide and seek with the neighbors, there is an evil that needs to be stopped. I think that the movie works best when the kids play, but when they have to hide they become much more intelligent than when they play. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie a good watch.   The director of the movie is a decent guy.  The story takes place during a war which is not exactly a war.  It was a time when people were happy to get away from a difficult life.  They had a good time and it shows through in this film.  This film also has a good cast of characters.  There are good acting, good dialogue and a good story.  I would say this is a good film if you want to see people getting along.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think we have a "perfect" film with "perfected" production values and "perfection" of a film as a whole.   The film has a simple story with an intriguing, enigmatic and fascinating cast.  The music is great, the acting is great and the screenplay is great.  It's definitely worth a watch and worth watching again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This film is really good and I really enjoyed it."   The best film in the trilogy!   I'd say that the best part of the film is the sequence when the camera zooms out from the room where the children are locked in their room.   When the camera pans out from their window the children stare at the ocean and all seems calm.  But a sudden noise is heard and the children run up to the window yelling for help.  It's as if they have no clue how to save themselves and have no idea who's there.  This was so good! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -I saw this movie a few months ago at a local art house theater, it's a very good movie that you don't see a lot of these days. I thought I had missed something when I watched this a few years ago. This movie really shows the art of photography, and a bit of story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      One of the best movies I have seen in a long while, a perfect blend of action, drama and humor. The best scenes are the scenes of the people in the desert, laughing at all the bad puns the bad guy makes (which really is a good example of a bad pun). The movie also has some great action sequences. One of my favorite sequences is when the bad guys sneak into the ship and they hide in the engine room. It's very suspenseful because we know the baddies are right there waiting for the ship to explode, so the entire time the audience is anticipating the big explosion and the good guy (who has a gun) and the baddie (who is trying to kill the good guys) are running through the engine rooms.   I'm very impressed by the talent in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about this movie from my husband, I had my doubts about the movie. I was in college at the time, so I never saw the movie that it was based on. When I did hear about it though, it was pretty bad. The movie was made in Hollywood, and had actors from "The Godfather".   I really wanted to see this movie, but I thought that it would be too much of a stretch to do justice to what was being done in this movie. But I must say that this is not bad at all. I actually really liked this movie in many respects.   Andrea Pirlo's portrayal of Pirlaro was quite a nice portrayal. He was just a little bit rough around the edges in many of his scenes, but his role as a mentor to a young player was very effective.

After he became rich, the man lived a life of luxury.  He had the best apartment in the city, a luxurious home, and a fancy car. He had his own secretary and bodyguard.  It seemed like everything was perfect, until one day he woke up to find that he had become fat.  The man's life was over.  What follows is a man's struggle to regain his life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I'll begin by saying, this movie is a total masterpiece.   It is a fantastic story about two guys named Mike and Jimmy who have never met.  They are the only boys in their neighborhood who will never have the chance to have a girl like their mother, whom they love very much.  When they find out that their mother is going to move out, they set out to find her and take over her apartment.  Their first stop is to a nice little motel in a small town, that looks nice enough.  The first night in their new place, it turns out to be the worst night ever.  That night a crazy man calls out to them, saying that his son is dead.  Then the next night, a crazier man with a gun comes to their door.  If the story didn't get so ridiculous I may be inclined to like it a bit more.  But you've got to love a story about these two brothers who are so totally in love with each other that they are willing to do anything for each other.  One of the best parts of the movie is when they go out one night, and while they are walking around town, they run into a friend of theirs named Mike.  Mike is a good guy, and he helps them out, which really doesn't make much sense until you consider that they have not been out of the house in two days.  This guy, Mike, turns out, has the same problems as the boys, so he helps Mike out as well.  It's not long before Mike and Mike have to face their real problem, a guy that can't keep his mouth shut.  So we end up with the story of two brothers that are in love.

The only problem is that the movie is just slow, it is slow because of the way that the main girl ( I could not remember if it was a girl or not) has her face cut up and in the next two years, the boy keeps on finding ways to get it back.  It is a slow movie with some great lines from the main guy  It was really funny because the boy does not know the word "cute"   It has some nice music   This movie made me feel happy and the girl made me happy   I recommend this movie 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I know that some people aren't going to like this movie.   Well I thought it was funny and good.  Well that's not all I thought but I can't say much about it except that it is about a group of friends trying to raise money to help a sick child.  I enjoyed it and thought it had a good cast, though it is a little thin in the comedy department.  There isn't a lot of comedy in this movie so this is the one that could have been more.  It was pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, really, but a good one.   It's not all about the good. It's all about a very interesting movie about a man who becomes involved in an attempt to get an old family car out of a museum, and who gets involved in a story about a guy who works for the mafia in an effort to prevent the man who drives it from being executed. This movie had a great cast: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a young kid of the early 70's, I can't say that I ever got to see a good action movie. Even today, a movie such as this is a treat.   For an early 90's action movie, it was great.  The film's premise is simple; a guy gets shot and is transported to a strange world. This world, known as "Majik", is inhabited by giant flying monkeys. When the guy is in this world, he starts to fight these monkeys and save a man named "Takuma".   The movie has many moments of action with this guy fighting these giant flying apes, who are mostly just good at attacking.  They don't take much of a beating and don't make any mistakes, and the film keeps the pace well through a couple of short scenes.  It also does a good job of capturing the atmosphere of a Japanese island village.  In terms of a good story, this one is good. It doesn't leave much room for characters to grow. The characters are pretty basic, and even after the movie has concluded, it seems there will be more of the same.  However, these characters still have enough personality to keep them interesting. This movie is very enjoyable and it gets a lot of laughs in between its action scenes. Although the story is basic, the story still works. There is just enough story to make this movie entertaining, even though it seems to be missing a little something.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think "Happiness" is a solid comedy with great performances that keeps the comedy going for its entire run time. I know there's a lot of people out there who feel "Hanging Out With a Racist" is better than "Hating Whitey," but I'm not one of those people.   It's true that "Hangin' Out With A Racist," while still funny, is a bit more mature in its approach.  The film's premise is that a group of students who were recently sent to the back of their class are treated like lepers by all other students, their "lady's man" is treated like a freak by most of the girls, and in the end, one of the best students is given a place to sit at the front of the class, just like the teacher.  Unfortunately, a big part of the comedy comes from the fact that a lot more than it needs to, the film is forced into an ending that just doesn't come together very well.  "Hitting It Rich" is an easy movie to laugh at because of the fact it features some great comedians and great lines, but "Hateful Eight" is funnier because it's a more focused comedy that goes from funny to ridiculous, from silly to scary, from ridiculous to awesome, all without ever losing it's comedic tone.  Overall, I give "Haming 8" a good 8 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are like me, you hate seeing a good movies be remade, remade again, remastered, remastered, remarried. It's like a bad movie got worse.   There is a movie called "Dawn of the Dead"   which was originally released in 1979. It starred Frank Darabont as a zombie who is trying to find a girlfriend with which to have sex. He finds a young woman who is also a zombie with whom he has sex. The young woman goes on a rampage.  There are lots of things wrong about this film: -The acting in this film is the worst. Frank Darabeln is too old to look sexy. His Zombie looks like an old woman who has dementia, but he's also too old. His acting is also bad. The only thing he has going for him is that he is an old man with an interesting zombie.  -It has bad music, terrible effects, and a very bad script.  Some of the effects are pretty bad, especially some of the zombies.  When the young woman comes back to life and starts to rape the old man, there's a fight and the old zombie is stabbed in the neck.  After the old woman is killed, the young zombie's head explodes.  This is a pretty good movie, but there are a lot of problems in it. I think you'll like it if you are a zombie fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has been an awesome experience.   I've watched it three times now.    The story is a bit over-the-top and has a bit of a cheesy, cheesy feel, but it gets to the point.  The characters are all well-developed and seem real.  And I have to say that I am a sucker for the over-acting of our lead actor, Jeff Bridges.  This is probably the most over-rated movie of all time.  It has a great ending, but the rest is just a little too cheesy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful, well-directed film with a marvelous cast and an enchanting musical score. The film is set in a rural Welsh mining village in the early 20th century. The village has been reduced to a few buildings. The only people left are a young couple, Tom (played by Peter Farrelly) and Mary (played in a charming, young voice by Ewa Michalowska). Tom's brother (Ged Gerson) has been shot in a road accident and is in a coma; Tom, in a fit of rage, has killed him. Tom is sentenced to death in the local gaol and is given an opportunity to change his life. The cast is very good and the screenplay is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the final moments of his life, the dying Algernon Bluestone, who is working as a policeman in a small town, is confronted by the mysterious and terrifying apparition known only as the "Darkman." After a brief confrontation with the apparition, Bluestone is found dead by his wife, his two young sons and a neighbor who had been watching the children when Bluestone was murdered. The film opens with a narration by the Darkman that is delivered in a droning, monotone monotope that is almost comical in its audacity. This is probably the only movie of its kind ever produced, and I can only applaud the genius of the filmmakers for having made it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It was the year of the movie star. John Wayne was a hot commodity. The movie's first scene shows him and a beautiful woman eating out in a restaurant. They're kissing passionately, and he's dressed in a white robe. She's a gorgeous actress who plays a seductress in a big budget movie that's set in Italy in the late 1800s. It's about a real estate agent named Vincent Piazza who has a long affair with a young, beautiful woman. He comes to her apartment with a proposition to purchase a house she owns. She is afraid that they can't afford it, so she agrees to the deal. But when the money runs out and he refuses to help her, she tells him to leave and he agrees. But he soon finds himself in deep trouble when the young woman who helped him buy the house wants to get out of the deal as well. Then he learns that the real estate broker has a rival and a very unhappy marriage." -Cinemaland

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been a big fan of the Harry Potter films, even though I love the books. So I was not expecting much in this movie, though I was prepared to be disappointed.  The plot was nothing special.  What was interesting was that the film followed a different character.   When Harry goes to see Professor Flitwick the first thing he does is to teach him a new spell.  Flitwort has just been discovered a century ago, and is now in the hands of an advanced wizard named Dumbledore.  A long time ago a man named Newt Scamander found the book that made Flitweort possible.  But now he has been kidnapped by the Death Eaters.  At first, Newt is more than a little frightened of his new instructor, but it does not last long.  It turns out that Professor Flourishwort, who Harry had a brief encounter with in the library, was the man who found Newt's diary.  This book is the key to unlocking Flitewort.  He wants it for himself.  Dumbledore is not going to allow that, though.  So in the movie there are three people.  Newt, the diary and Dumbledore.    Newt has a lot of fun making a mess of everything around him.  I liked this because it reminded me of a good scene in the movies of the early seventies with Egon and the PTA.  Harry and the kids, as they are called here, have trouble with a flying reptile and an evil dragon.  When the kids fall in a lake, Harry and Scamanders go to find the lizard to help them.  And Scamwort is a smart guy who is about to get more than he bargained for from Flitwell.  We all like to think we can outsmart the bad guys, and Flitwerff is no different.  Even though the movie is over two hours long, the story never gets old.  As a fan of Harry Potter, this movie will not leave me disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's funny, heartwarming, and very relatable to a lot of us.    The story begins with a young man in an awkward predicament. His mother died two years ago and he's an only child.  He is the only child of a mother who was an only daughter and a father who was a single father.  But all that changed two years later.  His father had lost his job and a new woman was taking up the role of mother.  So he turned to his brother's girlfriend and a girl he met at a local bar to take care of the child. His brother came home with the girl, but it wasn't long before she told him she was pregnant.  The baby was a girl, and so was the girl's mother. That's right!  So, you've got the only kid from a single parent family.  There are some moments where it's a little hard to swallow, as they may seem a little extreme.  Yet, there are a lot more moments of warmth, love, friendship, and laughter.  This movie is good.  I give it an A.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say enough great things about this movie.   The story line is interesting, you don't feel like you are watching a normal film but the story is about a man trying to find his life, and the fact that he does so in a strange way is very much believable.  I don't know about you, but watching a woman with a man's face was very interesting to me.  It's great to see a woman who can speak the language of the locals and have the same level of intelligence and wisdom as the man.  The movie isn't so dark or twisted as most films are.  There's a good balance of comedy and drama, with some interesting stuff in between.  Overall I was pretty impressed with it.

While they are not especially well developed, their motivations are well explained and they are well presented with a lot of detail.  There is also a small amount of nudity in this movie, which I don't mind as I think it's funny enough without it.  I thought it was funny enough for me, so maybe some people might enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the epic finale of the first season (a masterpiece in its own right) the show finally reaches a new level. A new, unexpected level.

If you're a fan of the original, and enjoy the show, then this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is my fourth or fifth time watching a remake of an earlier movie, the first being 'Logan's Run', this movie's a rip-off of that movie. This is the same story, but the plot is a bit different. The plot of the first movie is about a guy who is supposed to be dead (he is supposed, but he isn't) that is released into a society with a bunch of people that have never seen a movie before, which turns out not to be a problem as the movie is really, really boring. However this is the only negative thing about this movie. The music is really bad and the cast is really poorly made.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character, Joe, is a sweet, naive but brilliant boy who is very happy to have some sort of family, though this is not to be taken for granted. After all, it is a small town, and there is always some trouble that has to be managed.   He's also very good with horses, even being able to tell you why one is better than another:  He doesn't just do anything for his horses, he also has a kind of special intelligence about horse behavior and horses. He never gets drunk, he knows the names of the horses and what they're worth and even manages to pick them out by smell when they're in a pasture.  They're also good with kids too.  His mother is not very bright, and doesn't understand Joe, though she doesn't seem to mind.  As far as we know, Joe never really goes off to school (though he wants to), and so he is always riding around, doing chores, and being a kind, but smart, young man.

It flies to the big city, the capital of a world populated by people with no understanding of the ways of nature, and lands on a city bus, where it tries to fly back. There is a small boy who is on the bus with it and he is a very nice boy, who has a smile that brightens a room, and a small pair of spectacles, that he wears everywhere. There are several others on the big bus who are also nice, if a little odd. A group of students is sitting on the top of the bus, and there is a girl who has an odd fascination with them, but is not very observant. One of the students sees the little bird on the stick and is entranced by it, and when the bird starts to fly towards the big cities in the sky, he tells the boy to try and fly with it. When the boy is ready, he is able to fly with the bird, but he notices something odd about the bird and begins to have a strange dream. He thinks the bird is a man who is being pushed down by a train, and he tries to run away with it, but all he does is fly to the top and then back down again. There seems to be a strange sense of dread in the dream, and the bird does not seem happy about it.     The story is really interesting and not too long. I enjoyed watching the bird fly away in the clouds, but I was rather disappointed by what happens next. There were two bad things about this story. The first one was that the bird landed on a train and I really thought the bird was a bad thing. The second one was I thought the story was a bit dull. It was very uneventful and there were some very bad things that happened in the story.  The cast did an excellent job with their characters. All of them, especially the boy, are great. They are all funny and charming. They had some strange characters, but the cast really made them memorable.       For the good, there were a few minor things. The main villain in the movie was uninteresting. The villain was an uninteresting old man who had a lot of power and a lot to lose, and it was nice to see his power on the map. He was interesting, but his motives were pretty dull. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a well acted and written film.   There is enough nudity and sex for everyone.  This is a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is very good, but it has some flaws, I must say. The script is great. I don't get why this film has this reputation of being a bad film. It's a very good movie, and it's got some great fight scenes.   One thing that is very funny about the film is that the guy who wants the money for the fight, wants the fight to be more intense and more violent than the movie is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie in a while is The Avengers, with its terrific ensemble cast (especially for its length), great special effects, and amazing stunts.   The plot is pretty straightforward: the Avengers and the Fantastic Four face a new threat from the future. They have no idea why a giant man-thing from another dimension named Quasimodo is suddenly appearing in their own time and space.  There are lots of super-powers involved: Iron Man shoots electricity from his fingers, Iron Man can run faster than the speed of sound, Hulk has the strength of a hundred men and can throw around a whole lot of stuff, and Thor can generate electricity. The plot does contain one major twist, but otherwise it's pretty standard for a Marvel movie: they face some sort of cosmic threat and they go to the source of the trouble.  The final scene is a delight: an epic battle in space between the Avengers, a bunch of villains, and a few other superheroes. The characters have a fun time fighting each other and using their superpowers (which aren't very super-powered at all, by the way).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting film about a man who has to take care of his mother who is completely insane.   In a small town, there is a very peculiar lady named Alice, who doesn't like people who don't like her or her mother (she's nuts). The neighbors are so afraid of her, that no one dares to talk to her, and there is an elderly woman who is also afraid of Alice (she doesn't seem to like Alice at all), but Alice doesn't take her too seriously, and sometimes she can be kind of fun. Alice likes to play the piano (that's pretty much the whole movie) and she has a very kind and beautiful son.  It doesn't really matter to Alice who is the mother of her son, and the story ends in an interesting way.  - May 24, 2005A good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy this movie   There is something that the movie  has that just doesn't seem like the main characters are   at all interested in   whatever is happening   It seems like the whole movie  is just going down the same route   No big story here   and no real drama to be found   This is a good way to spend a couple of hours  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so sad to say I'm done with the Harry Potter movies.   They're just too clunky, too slow, too dull.  The last third of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was the most fun I ever had watching a Harry Potter movie.  But this one just feels like a disappointment.  And that's not just me saying that.  People who've never read a Harry book will think this is just another clunky and repetitive fantasy movie. Harry is a bored old man who has a weird job that gives him only a very superficial connection to his son.  He lives in an airy little cottage in a countryside setting and gets his news from the local paper.  This is a story about a magical school that is trying to save the world from a race of superpowered children.  They all have special powers, and they're all running for the school.  It's basically the "Hercules" part of a Superman movie. But then the movie loses its plot, and all that's left is the bad acting, the clunky writing, and a ridiculous ending.  Now I don't know what to do with myself.  Maybe I should write a novel about a little boy who learns how to fly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was the most fun to watch since the last "Spartacus" movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a really good film.   This film is an old style western based on the actual events.  The plot revolves around the characters in this movie trying to escape from the clutches of the evil sheriff.  I never had an opportunity to watch the film but the story really grabbed me.  It is very well written.  There are many scenes that really hold your attention.  This is a classic of the western genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was a masterpiece of a film and a masterpiece in general.   It may not be for everyone, but there is no denying it's greatness.  It is so epic, it is so emotional, it's so great, it deserves 5 stars, and it deserves 1. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would really like to thank M. Night Shyamalan   for making this great movie. This movie has all the elements to be a classic: great actors, brilliant storytelling, incredible cinematography, an unforgettable theme song, and the most bizarre scene I have ever seen!    This movie is a classic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting and funny little comedy about two guys, one a retired guy from WWII, the other a new guy that works on the construction site of the old train station.   The main characters, the new guy and the guy who was there during the war, work side by side on a construction site together.  The guy who is there in WWII is kind of dumb but a good kind of smart.  They talk to the train conductor and the old guy that worked on the train station during the day and at night.  So, the guy is pretty smart, the old man is a nice guy who talks about some real good stuff.  If I didn't know the movie I would have thought the old lady in WWII was the main character.  This movie is very silly but it has a real good heart about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, The Girl on the Train is an important film. It is not a good film. This is not the best film ever made, and it is definitely not the worst. It has it moments. It will make you laugh, it will make your heart sink. It's an uncomfortable film with some good acting and a well-made plot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to see the action scenes.   This movie takes place after the last war, and the Russians are trying to retake territory in the Baltic. The war was over, so the Russians, with a new President and a new Prime Minister, are ready to fight.  They have some good troops and a strong artillery to back them up.  But it is the Germans who are on the offensive!  This is a terrific film.

I thought that there was some really good character interactions and even a nice comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out like it has a lot of twists and turns to come. After watching a bit, I thought, "Wow, this movie is really good." The movie begins with two characters walking down a street. The first one is a woman in her early twenties, who is dressed in a blue shirt that is about one-third her body-length. The second is an older man wearing a white shirt, wearing a black hat, and holding a cane. The older man's first name is John and he is a local bank robber. As the two walk down the street, they are chased by police. One of the officers pulls a pistol out, pointing it at the women. John tells the woman he is an "accident" and tells her that he is robbing a bank. The woman yells for help and cries for help. Then a man in a car stops, asks them to get out of his way, and turns on his headlights. John gets out of the car and the woman runs to him. The man tells them that there are no bank robbers that night, but that he does have "a customer" that he wants John to get money for. He then grabs the older man, and drags him into the car. John runs after them, but as he runs, he notices a man (named Bill) who is running after him. John picks up Bill's hand and tells him to stop. He yells that he has his wife. He grabs the bank card and says to John that he will not give it to him unless he gives him money, and hands it over to John. John puts it in his pocket and walks off. The police chase them. Bill tries to pull John out of a house but he is forced to stop by a police officer. Bill starts to get mad at John and yells at him, "Don't you know how to run? You have to run, and if you're not careful, you're gonna get shot." John asks the officer if they are all right and he answers that they are fine. John then notices a house on fire, and they both run into the fire. The fire is gone, but they notice that they now smell smoke in the air. The officers get out and tell John they can no longer take them. They tell John to stay back and do not worry about it.   Then, there are two policemen in a squad car, trying to get John to a hospital. A man
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm afraid I can't be as good as the original. I really hate the story.   The original story would have worked as a horror story if the actor hadn't been so out of place. He has to come up with some great one-liners to get the audience to feel something.  This movie is only about 4-5 minutes long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's very funny, and has great acting and cinematography.   I found the humor funny, but it wasn't that funny in terms of just the way that it played out, in what seemed like a really depressing and dark situation.  The story is interesting, and the acting is decent.

There's plenty of funny moments.  You want a good story about dogs in a big old farm house.  The dogs are very likable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been wanting to watch a good vampire movie for a long time and it finally got here.   In a world where vampires have died off and are no longer a threat it's time to see what this generation of vampires is up to now.  The plot is a little silly but the vampire's are fun, their powers are pretty amazing, and even though the plot is silly it doesn't make the vampire characters boring.  I love that the vampire and vampire's have a history but it doesn�t get in the way of the fun.  A good movie and I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good comedy.

It was funny, I laughed, and I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I am watching is called  "Tiger Woods: The Ballad of a Little Leaguer"   (in French).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original title for this film is "Gargoyle: The Movie",   and it's an appropriate name for this movie;   the movie, as it was originally conceived, was originally called "Glorious Gargoyles", and when the film was first released in theatres, it was a success.   It was a great time to be alive in the 60's, and I'm glad I saw the original "Gorilla",      Unfortunately, that title was used before the story was written, and then the story became a remake of "Fantastic Mr. Fox".   Fortunately, the new story was a lot better than the original, and the "Gaston",  the protagonist of this film, was a nice addition,   but the new "Gorgon",  to me,  looks like a big green-screen head,  and his attitude makes me think that they could not get the film made today,    I'd like to see a remake with new characters, and a new story, because,  as they say,  "A good story is worth a lot of pictures".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an example of how you don't have to be an idiot to make a bad movie.   It's not like this is a movie about "A-list" actors.  Sure, some of them show up to do their jobs.  But the story, the story is bad.  And that's just the story.  There are other things in this film.  The ending of the movie is bad, the script is bad (even though there are good parts), the acting is bad and I would watch it for the fun of seeing all these stars in the sky. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with a montage of people getting together to have a happy hour or something and some dude starts talking about a bunch of random stuff that no one in the world gives a shit about and people are pretty surprised. He then has a big fight in a room full of people, and that's not a good sign of a good film, not at all. But he starts talking to the same girl that we first saw in the last movie and she becomes a little more popular after she comes to his house. That leads to a big misunderstanding about love and the guy has a breakdown and decides to leave his wife, her mother and her father and head to Japan in order to get over her. I mean, come on, what is the point of this movie? Why does it need to be so long?   The movie is set in Japan and there are a bunch more fights involving people.   Now that I think about it I guess this film is a cross between the last two. I think the ending is the best part though because it shows a little bit of humanity that no movie can ever have. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is an outstanding movie. The movie is very suspenseful, but also very funny, and I think it is very appropriate for my age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. The movie was good enough to make me a very happy person. It was so good that I felt like I could take on any man or woman in the world and have a good time. A guy comes home one day and he sees a woman at the kitchen window... A woman who is wearing nothing but a pair of panties... A man can not see through this woman's panties, it looks like they are made from an animal hide... So the guy is a bit disappointed. He decides to see what this woman is all about... He sees that this woman has no shoes on, and he does not have anything better to do... Well he decides to try to see some more... The woman is in a big hurry so she runs away, and then runs away from him... The guy is after her, and finally gets to her...   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a long time, but I'm finally seeing this movie again. A lot of people seem to have forgotten about this movie, but for some reason I found it really charming and funny. The whole thing is about a group of people who spend their day playing in their basement playing their favorite video game. It's weird, but they're kind of the "mature" ones, who don't have a whole lot to do at school. They spend all of their time making this video game in their crappy little basement, but the real fun comes when they get together with their family to watch TV at night. It gets kind of boring watching this. They are all in it for fun, but at the end of the day they're just living out a video game fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really love the way this movie plays out. There are a lot of really well acted scenes in this movie, and there's a lot to like about them, and the whole movie has a really good vibe about it, from the way it's shot, to the way the characters react to the situation, to how the characters act within the situation. There's also a lot that's silly in here, and it's mostly because of the way these characters react in different circumstances.   This movie is about the way that people are meant to react when faced with unexpected events, and I thought it was all well done, and a lot more than just a pretty cool movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is very simple. A woman goes into a cave to get away from the "man" who has been following her. She meets a man, and she realizes the man is her "brother" (they're related by blood). They're both trapped in the cave. They are forced to work together (they both have magical powers), but the man doesn't let her free. It's a very well-done and entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in high school when the film was first released in '79, but the film is much better today.   The movie is actually a "high school musical" that takes place during the summer.  The musical itself is fun, catchy, and funny.  It is an updated version of the classic Broadway musical, which is based on the story of an old school friend of the protagonist (played by Gene Kelly), who returns to his high school for the summer, and is reunited with his old friend, played by Kelly.  Gene Kelly has had a string of huge success during the last two decades, and I thought he would be an ideal choice for this film.  Kelly plays a teacher at an all-girls school for which his character is named Mrs. Loomis.  He is a good teacher, but is also very smart, and has a love of history, which he uses to help the young students come to terms with the "big changes" in society.  I also liked the performances from Kelly, the rest of the cast, and especially the children.  Unfortunately, the story was very disappointing.  While I thought the story had potential, the ending was so unsatisfying that I think it is the worst kind of sequel.  Although it was a fun film, the characters were very much like one of those people you see in an old Disney movie that's been left out for a few years.  At first it is a fun musical, and then it becomes a sad musical, before settling back into the original plot.  Still, it is fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of the Indiana Jones films or of the book "The Search for the Man Who Would be King", then this will probably not interest you.   It's based on the same plot that is used in the "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" movies, but it takes place in a completely different time period and it has little to do with the other films.  The movie starts off with a flashback.  At the age of three, Indiana Jones has been kidnapped by Nazis.  He is held captive for eight years, until the Allies win World War II.  It is also told from the point of view of the main antagonist, Adolf Hitler (played by actor Martin Balsam, who did the role for the fourth time) and it shows how he feels about the situation.  After all, he is a Nazi who has lived a sheltered life, but now he realizes that he has a son who is still alive.  When he realizes this, he attempts to save him by attempting to murder him with an iron bar.  That is the beginning of a long and interesting movie.  Like most Indiana Jones movies, this one is set at a time when people actually had to use horses.  This movie takes place about ten years after the war.  In the movie, the story is told from a German viewpoint.  Hitler is still a highly intelligent man, and his character is quite interesting.  During his stay in Argentina, Hitler meets his wife Eva Braun.  Eva is a beautiful, beautiful woman, and even though she has always had a high opinion of him, she becomes smitten with him at first sight and they spend the rest of the movie falling in love.  There are a lot of scenes of Hitler, Eva, and their children in their home in Germany.  However, there is a problem that occurs with the movie. While there is an Italian character (Raffaello D'Oro, played by Giancarlo Giannini) who is part of the plot, his part seems to be more like an exposition.  I've never read the book in question, but I can't see this movie doing much better than that.  So why watch this movie?  The film is a good story.  But it is a little strange to me.  With such a rich cast and such a good plot, why is the movie so bad?  I think the problem is in the characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the first movie and have enjoyed it since the very first day it came out. This movie does a great job of capturing the sense of awe that a little girl can feel while watching the stars.   The only complaint I have is that it is a little hard to watch and it is difficult to visualize the stars as you would expect.  It is hard to visualize a big star like the Big Dipper. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the greatest films to come out of Hollywood in the late 20th Century, and one of the most enjoyable films to be released in that time.   Written by a Hollywood filmmaker whose style was ahead of its time, one of his most famous films, "The Blues Brothers," was made during a time where many Hollywood blockbusters were created. The film, however, had a more unique approach to film making than those produced during that time period.  There are several scenes in "The blues brothers" where the characters, played by the three brothers, are in a similar state of mind.  A friend and his wife take their young child, Sam, camping and he is very ill. The husband tells his friend that they can't go back to camp because he doesn't have enough money to buy food for the child.  His friend tells his wife that he has money and it's better that they don't go camping. They also discuss their marriage.  Sam is very sick and his mother wants to take him to a hospital.  They both agree to the trip but are very worried about getting back on the road.  Once they get to camp, the family is surprised to find that Sam is fine.  The next day they decide to take a drive through the woods and the two boys start to get closer to each other.  One day, Sam's mother asks him about his mother, and his brother replies that he doesn' know her.  Soon after, Sam decides to go home and the boys agree that they should do the same.  What makes this film so special is that there is no dialogue in this film, which makes it even better.  This film is about the relationships between the characters.  It is about family.  I enjoyed this film quite a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am soooo glad I finally watched this movie.   It is funny, touching and very romantic at the same time.  It's like a love story with a little bit of mystery.  I'm so happy to see a movie about a girl whose first boyfriend (not a virgin) dies before they even meet!  I loved the movie and loved how it ended with the girl getting all the attention and then the guy coming back to her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie made with real emotions. The director tries to keep the movie in the real place, where the actors are from.

My father and I would sit around the dining room table and laugh at the goofy, annoying bad guy.   - Don't waste your money!   Well, don't bother watching this.  A little "Cinderella" mixed with a little "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".   It's just a little movie, it's just silly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the first feature film of the new millennium, The Game was well worth its reputation. There is a certain type of movie where there are no bad parts, but only good parts. This is The Game.   It is a film of immense simplicity, yet with so much going for it; an easy-to-watch story with the added dimension of a great score. If you're a fan of a certain kind of film then you will enjoy this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main problem with this film is its length. As stated, the film starts off slowly, and the pacing is somewhat slow. The plot is intriguing at first, but by the last ten minutes or so, the pace has become too fast, and it starts to lose its interest. The film doesn't really go in any sort of logical sequence, but the idea of the film is that a man is driving along, and he suddenly encounters a strange, ugly, and grotesque creature, who is a bit more grotesque than the man. The creature starts moving toward the man, and then suddenly it changes his course. Then, the creature starts crawling over the man's back, and eventually the man is completely covered in the creature's tentacles, and is covered from head to toe, and yet, the guy seems to be completely unharmed. The man is still in a car, but is not moving very fast. When he gets out, he is completely naked, except for his shoes. His face is also completely covered by the tentacles. Then he starts walking back to the car. At the end of the movie, the man and his creature are lying on the back of a truck, and a little girl is looking at the creature, and laughing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a fan of the classic John Hughes movie, Friday.   Hughes was a good man with an incredible gift for writing and directing.  And so too was the movie's director.  In the late eighties, Hughes went on to make many more films.  Hughes continued to make well-directed films through the nineties. But in the early nineies, a strange change happened. Hughes went off on a strange and bizarre tangent in order to make a movie about an autistic kid who would later be diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.  It's not exactly a great movie.  But it's one of Hughes' best.  This is one of his few films that's not about a character who is more or less autistic.  The autistic character is one who has Aspergers Syndrome and is a child psychologist who is an expert at making others' lives better.  So what?  This child is in many ways like a real-life autistic. But Hughes' movie is one with a plot.  There is a plot, but it's not really an interesting plot.   The film is about the kid, who is really autistic, but not really autistic-like.  When the movie begins, the kid (played by a very good Kevin Pollak) is playing with a toy train.  He is in trouble with some kids, including the one played by Tim Conway (who played the main character in the film) and a bigoted neighbor (played brilliantly by the wonderful John Astin).   But the plot is a mystery.  Why is a kid playing with toy trains?  There are no trains!  The only thing the kid does is make people feel bad about themselves.  As far as the movie goes, Hughes does a good job of getting the kids to get along, the neighbor to understand, the kids with Aspies to be friends with one another.  What he does not get is why the kid is playing the trains.  I'm a little confused about this part.  While Hughes gets most of the movie into one great joke, he never gets to the main joke.  Perhaps Hughes wants to go off on some tangent about how stupid it is for a kid to play with trains, but he doesn't want to go on to the part about the autistic character who doesn't care about trains and just wants to make people happy.  Maybe the kid doesn't have Aspers and the movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend and I sat on the floor of our living room for about an hour watching a good 80s horror movie with this soundtrack. This movie was scary but not scary.   This is one of those classic horror films that was produced and shot in a style that looks like it was filmed in the 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of John Carpenter and I always loved the movie The Thing. It is still one of my favorites. But this is not a remake, but a very good adaptation of the short story written by H.P. Lovecraft.   It is a perfect adaptation of Lovecraft's story and the movie is definitely worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been meaning to see this movie for a while. A very dark and disturbing movie which seems to have been lost for a long time.   It is about a young man who is suffering from schizophrenia (it's not clear if his illness is schizophrenia or what) and finds comfort in the company of a mysterious figure in a strange house in the woods. There are very few details about this strange figure but the movie seems to be about a man who sees his neighbors, a young woman who he finds attractive and who likes him, and a boy who doesn't like him very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I've never seen a "Soupy Salesman" before. I don't think any of my classmates have seen one either. But I love them, I'm just surprised someone hasn't been making a movie out of them already.   This movie is about a Soupy Sales man named Lenny.  The movie has a nice amount of humor, and I could see the characters actually being believable.  While the humor is amusing, this movie really does have a sad story to tell.  I think it would make a good short film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had the same reaction to this as many others: I had to take the film off the shelf. That was a terrible decision on my part. This is a wonderful film about a guy who is a hero for a day (he just so happens to have a dog who dies of old age, a woman who's a bit too "tough" and a woman-child who is rather attractive). This is more a story about friendship than anything else, but it is a very entertaining film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -  I didn't really expect that. I've seen quite a bit of these types of films over the years, and I still get sick when I watch a movie that involves a guy walking around in the middle of a desert looking for a lost dog.   There are several films in this genre:  -   The Last Dog  -   In a world where humans have to take turns on the planet to reproduce and the human population is dwindling (I think there are only 6 billion left) a scientist who has spent the last 60 years collecting all of the different dog breeds (called "Mongrels") is looking to collect as many of the last of them as he can and bring them back to the planet.  The movie is interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As someone who is in the film business all my life, I've never before seen a film where the protagonist is so totally unaware of anything going on around her. She is in a small apartment, and everything is running smoothly.   After several unsuccessful attempts to call up her fiancé, the hero goes up to her apartment (not her car) and takes a look.  What he sees in the apartment is something he would never in a million years expect, as a guy who has been up at 3:00 a.m. to try to get out of a bad parking ticket. There is an old woman (actually a woman, it's really old), her name is Mary.  The old woman is the love of her life, she is the one person in all of their lives that has never let her down.  In the course of a few seconds, he realizes there is something seriously wrong with her, that she is not at all the person she seems to be.  This is something that she had been hiding from him for years, and now that she knows him so well, it is all too apparent.  And then the film begins.  When they begin to get to know one another, there is no question that she has done something to him.  He doesn't know what, but she does not seem to mind.  There are all kinds of things he finds out, and they all involve her.  They go on an adventure to look for clues, and get very involved in the mystery of her "condition".  Her condition is something she has been trying to hide for years (it's really very bizarre), and she has had an affair with a man who has tried to get her to tell the story about how her boyfriend had killed her husband, and why.  However, it has not been easy for her, and the more she comes clean about the man (the more it reveals about the true nature of her condition) the more her love for him grows.  But he is the only person that has ever shown love to her, in a real way.  After a couple of years, they break up and the old lady dies.  That's the last we see of her, but we see her again as the hero's partner, he just doesn't get to meet her anymore.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a good action movie, but you need to watch the trailer. The bad guy is a bad guy and that makes him very effective. The movie had no special effects but the good things were good: the special effects in the movie and in the stunts was very good and the characters were very good: they were not like the other heroes you saw in action movies in recent years.   The movie was directed by Don Hahn, a veteran of movies and an up and comer with films such as "Aliens", "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls" and "Rambo III".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half is pretty much the same as the last. The action moves pretty well, and there's a few funny moments but I don't see this movie changing much from the last two.   In the second half, things start to get a little more interesting. The main character seems to get less into the action, and the supporting characters do a much better job than the first half.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a tendency to find really good movies and really bad movies, and this movie falls into the latter category.   This is a very good looking film from an imaginative director.  You get a sense of what kind of movie this is from the first shot, which is a beautiful one showing an amazing bird's eye view of a river running through the mountains and the distant mountains beyond it.  This shot could be a scene from a film by the great Akira Kurosawa.  The music is terrific and you feel the presence of the movie, as it is not very exciting or dramatic.  It is a little like the film is made of a thin thread which is held together by a single thread which happens to be the voice of a boy singing.  He doesn't seem to be having the best of times so he has a little boy to take care of him and while he doesn't have much of a life he does have a lot of imagination and he uses that to help him get through his troubles.  But as you can guess the ending is terrible and he loses his family and everything he holds dear.  When I was younger I found this film a little sad, but I can see why this is what the director wanted to make.  There is something sad about the situation, but there is also something very charming and exciting in it. It is about a little girl who has a lot to say and a lot that she doesn't say about herself, and I was hooked from the very beginning.  This is a good film and worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know it seems like it was meant to be a comedy, but it's far from it. It's a really sad, touching, and profound tale about a man who goes on a road trip and has a change of heart, and then is able to forgive and love a woman who betrayed him. The main character is a great man who has everything: a great job, a loving wife, a beautiful son, and two good looking daughters. Unfortunately, they all start getting involved with bad guys, and all of a sudden he's stuck with a bad ex-wife, and her three bad exes.    The story is very well-written, and you'll be smiling while reading it, even if you find yourself laughing a few times along the way.  The ending was beautiful and moving.  And, to top it off, there are quite a few surprises along the trip, including a scene where they actually kiss...but then you don't know that was going to happen until the last second.  I had a great time watching this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a movie with very good acting, I have to confess that the supporting actors and actresses in the movie were not worth their spots.   The main actor is an old man.  He acted like a spoiled spoiled old man and the acting could have been better.  At one point, one of the young actors, played by James Spader, stood up for the protagonist.  When Spader stood up, I wanted to tell him, 'Look, old man, your character is stupid. It would be good to make a movie about people who are stupid. And so many people in the country are stupid, but you are not.'   And what a character Spader has in the lead:  In the movie, it looks like he is in a lot of trouble, because he is trying to run away with a young woman from his past.  His past includes a lot that is embarrassing to him, and that is what the main character wants to help him to escape.  The film, however, is not about the man running away. It is about the woman and her family that the man is trying, without success, to take away from her.  Spader is a very good actor who has an easy charm.  So, while this is not a movie where you should want to run out of the theater, it is a good film to watch if you want to see something new in the movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie and   was very surprised how well it was done by all the actors.   As expected from the title, this is a story about a young girl, who was orphaned when she was young, and raised by her grandparents.  She has to be careful, and has to act smart while being very clumsy and very dumb.  The movie has lots of good scenes, and also shows a couple of good twists.  I recommend this to those who like movies with a little bit of adventure, and a little girl that is a little crazy, who doesn't know how to act around her family members. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't usually read about movies that have made it to the big screen, but the one in this movie is something else. It is a story about two women who fall in love in a small town and a whole mess of things happen to those two women, that are basically the same people. The story and the writing in this is excellent and has a story with some interesting things in it. You don't have to worry too much about who's who, or where does the woman from that picture come from, or what is the significance of the person that she goes to the police department to see. What you should worry about is how interesting and beautiful it is. If you enjoy good movie with a story that is about love then this is something you should really try to see before it gets released on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I would like to point out that this movie is not a ripoff of "The Godfather" - it's a wonderful movie in its own right.  The story follows two brothers who, over the years, have become quite wealthy - and they're in danger of losing it all.  They have one more thing to do before they die - steal a priceless gem from a museum in Milan.  It's not the usual gangster movie, but it's very enjoyable and it gives you a chance to learn more about these characters.   One of the characters is played by a guy called Paolo Montalban.  After his movie, "The Great Dictator", which was a major success in Italy, the Italian Academy gave him a prestigious award.  His acting is quite good and his characters are very funny.  I can see why he's a great actor.  Also, there are three other characters in this movie, and they are all very funny, too.  A funny movie.  What really gives this movie a good name is the wonderful score.  In this film, "La Dolce Vita" is not the only name to describe the great beauty of Italy.  However, it's definitely a movie about Italy and its people.  That's why I enjoy the film so much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a very important film about the Holocaust.   The film is made by the very well-known director, Leni Riefenstahl (... and as good a director as Leni can be, I would like to add that her films about the war, as well as her documentary-making are good.  But, the film is so well made, that the viewer can get as much from the film as they want without losing interest.  I have seen a good many Nazi documentaries and the film about Auschwitz is a good one.  The best way to understand the film, is to look for yourself at the pictures in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie! The story is fantastic! The actors were great!   Well...if you really enjoyed "Memento Mori", you'll enjoy this movie.   This movie is a thriller about an old man (Ed Harris) who comes to a house to see if his grandson has gotten out of the house alive (I don't know why this story was adapted to a movie so quickly). While he is there, he finds that the grandson has been kidnapped. This is a great suspenseful movie about old man's and a grandson's relationship with their time together and the problems and changes in their relationship over time. The story of this movie is also very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out. This film is a hilarious, fun, and entertaining romp through the most ridiculous, nonsensical scenes in movie history.   The title is a bit misleading.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off I would like to thank the people involved for making this such a fantastic movie. The whole thing was perfect! From the first time the band takes over at the opening of the movie the mood is set by the fantastic performance of the band members.   It was a great soundtrack with excellent musicianship.  It really reminded me of how I thought the band would sound like if it was a real band. The film has its share of laughs as well with some very good acting by the cast.  The film was really fun to watch and it is one of my favorites to be sure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main villain of this movie is a very different type of villain than the typical action movie villain. He is not an aggressive fighter who wants to kill and humiliate his victims, nor a sadistic monster who enjoys torturing and hurting. Rather, this villain is a cunning manipulator who uses his powers for his own benefit, and who uses these powers against the hero and his friends. This movie has a great mix of comedy, tension, and drama, and is one of the best superhero movies of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in a rush. This is one of the few good movies about New Orleans that I've seen.   Like most New Orleanians (I'd say 80% of the population), I'm from the city. I grew up in New Orleans and was a part of the "Lost Cause" crowd that moved into Louisiana in the 1870's and ruled the city for the next two decades. The "Lost" Cause was a racist program that was in place by the Confederate government in the late 1860's. It tried to justify slavery by calling it "the oldest profession in the world" and claiming that "labor made the man." In a society where black people were treated like animals (that's how they were treated on plantations in the South), it was the "lazy, stupid, uncivilized, and ignorant" black people who created the New Orleans style of architecture, music, and food. I'm not sure if anyone knows what a "Lost cause" is. Anyway, I think we should all know the history and I was so upset about how this movie was going to be a racist portrayal of Louisiana, and I didn't even know it was happening yet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is the best film from the year. This film has a great plot line and good acting from everyone.   The plot is brilliant, everyone goes into an underground world called the underworld. This world is controlled by a leader called The Snake. The leader is the main villain and the film is very good at portraying this evil character. The world is a little dull though. I liked the character of Big Daddy the biggest. I thought the film was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always thought the idea of The Black Chamber was a brilliant one. I like the idea that an entire section of the world's largest library (the Library of Alexandria) was kept hidden away in a secret chamber where only a select few could access it. I'd been thinking about it in the past when I read some of the early chapters of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, so I'm glad it's still in circulation.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is really well directed and the acting is good as well.   Unfortunately the ending was a bit anticlimactic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a bit torn on this one. There were a few things that had me scratching my head as to why this wasn't nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award or something (though it does have some pretty good music to go with it).   But the story, the visuals, the dialogue, the cinematography and the acting all worked together to tell a great, entertaining tale.   The movie is also a good example of how a good story and a good film can exist on the same shelf:  - In a nutshell:  This is a "one of a kind" story about a young man and a young girl living in a village whose culture is completely different to that of the rest of the world. This is what is called a "culturally-neutral" film.  - And what a story it is:  For all intents and purposes, it's a coming-of-age story. You might be able to recognize many of the characters from a few movies you have seen already. This isn't like that:  It's about a guy who decides to stay with his family, and another girl who's taken from her parents by some other family.  They spend time talking about how their parents are completely different than them, and how they don't fit in.  I loved the way it was put together. The movie starts out like a normal movie. It's a family film. A girl is having a party for her family, but then she gets a present (a bunny) and then she takes the present and leaves the party. She's going back to her family and has to face a different kind of family:  There is a huge difference in lifestyle between the villagers in this movie and the rest. It might be more accurate to say that the villagers are the "villages" of our world.  There's some religious aspects to it.  The village is basically a poor area where the parents work in a factory making other people's lives miserable. But the villagers of this movie have the "ideal" life.  While the villagers eat well, their clothes are brand new and they're never even asked to show up for a party.  Even the villagers who live in the village are "informal" about the fact that the real life that they live doesn't match their dream life. It just goes to show how the movie was shot:  In other words, they didn't use a big studio. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. The best part is that when all the main characters, all four boys, are out of school, and have been kicked out of all of the social circles they once knew, they start to live out of a small apartment, but the landlord doesn't want them to live there. So they rent a little apartment down the street for $700 a month.   But the boys, because they were in the gang, start to do some bad things.  The landlord is pissed, and decides to get all of them to do hard time. So he pulls out his gun, which he keeps on a hook in his kitchen.  One of the boys asks him to stop. But the other three gangsters, who had been friends before, say, "No way. You can't stop us. We're in the way. We know you'll do us." And they pull out their guns.  So the landlord shoots all of his gang, and he's left holding the gun in his hand.  Now the boys are all scared and get out of the apartment.  But then they realize the landlord was right.  And he's holding a gun.  It's the end of the gang and their friendship.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of film noir, as in the films of Howard Hawks, Anthony Mann, John Huston, and Sam Peckinpah.  But the last movie I saw with this writer ( 'My Manhood' ) was almost 20 years ago.  This new film from this writer's son ( Robert O'Shea) is a much better film than its predecessor.  The acting is much better and the music is not as overused as it was in the first film.   The story is more original.  Robert O's script was much better than the one used in the earlier film. I'm glad to see that the writer has written a sequel to this good film.

The best thing about this movie is the acting, especially when the woman has her babies.  Also, the music is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good old fashioned western with a good sense of humor.   The movie starts out in what seems like the "barney" days of the early 1900's, when a big-game hunter named Will E. Lee is on the trail of some outlaws to take him out in a shooting duel. This isn't a bad movie, it's just that it doesn't tell a story, and in fact has no story whatsoever.  While some of the action scenes are a bit silly, and some of what happens in the movie looks rather contrived, I would still recommend it, because it doesn a good job of portraying an idyllic setting.

It's not that I disliked the movie because of it's length: I liked it because it had some good aspects about it.  I liked the movie, but I don't know if it was better than it's original plot or not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As with any great movie, "Inspector Gadget" starts off great. We're introduced to the titular Inspector Gadget, a smallish but talented and charismatic little gadget who's become famous in his home country of England. He's an amateur detective and has a job for anyone with a bit of information. He goes to a crime scene, finds a body, and begins to investigate. Soon he finds out that not only is there another crime in the area, but there are other people who are tied to the death. It turns out that Gadget has been set up, and that a man named "Mr. Pink" is the real mastermind. He doesn't do anything nice, and Gadget is determined to discover the truth about Mr. Pink.   It has an amazing cast of characters, and a great style and pacing to it. The action is great and always fun to watch. The dialogue is fun and funny, with an amazing sense of humor.  It was released on DVD in 1998, and I have never found a better home video version.

The film does a great job of keeping the horror movie formula simple yet also keeps you interested with suspense and action throughout.   There are a few times when the horror becomes too intense. However, there are also times when it does a good job of staying off the horror scale.  If you like horror movies,   I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always thought I would see The Last Samurai again when it was rereleased in 2012 but I did not know anything about the film apart from its historical inaccuracies. I have seen the film many times over the years and always found the historical inaccurations to be hilarious!   The film is basically a retelling of The Last Outpost of the Samurai which was the last great samurai film made in Japan in the 1920s.   In the film, a boy, Yuki, is kidnapped from his village and given a Japanese name of "Samurai", who is then taken to the far flung north to be trained as a samurai.  The plot of the film is really simple.  After a successful battle at the Battle of Waseda, which is essentially the battle of Kyoto, the samurai who defeated the invading Japanese forces returns to the capital and is accepted by the elite of the feudalistic samurai class. He is given the samurai title and given his own private guard.  A great deal of the plot is spent detailing this new Samurai's training. The film shows the boy's struggle to cope with his new name and new responsibilities and how he uses the skills learned at the battle to become the best Samurai the world has ever seen.  I really loved the film and am now looking forward to seeing the film in its original format. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever.   It's a buddy cop film, with two cop buddies, the main characters are hilarious, and the director seems to love playing with our emotions, the jokes aren't funny but they're pretty clever.  If you want a buddy movie, go watch this!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It really is the greatest, if not the only, true western.   The script is a masterpiece, and the acting is just magnificent.  It's the best western I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is based on the book of the same name written by E.L. Doctorow. The story is simple and straightforward. A young boy (Sam Peck) is a slave in a Southern plantation and he has just been given a gift that will let him out. What happens next is a mystery and it takes a long time to solve.    All in all the movie is a good one. It has some good story lines, good action and a few good surprises. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, let me say how glad I am that I did watch this film.  I thought the first one was a good one but I never knew what this movie was about.  Now that I know this, I think it was a really good movie.  It's a little on the slow side for a movie this long but it's very much worth the wait.  There's a lot of heart in this movie. I could easily go for the rest of the movie but I'll go for a little more.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am glad I found this movie.   It's not a great film, but it's better than many other films.  It was a film that really showed how far the United States has fallen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My dad brought me a copy of this when I was around 7. I enjoyed it, not so much as a kid but at that time I was just a wee kid (and a pretty poor one at that) who couldn't find anything to interest him, but I thought I would. That is until I saw this movie. I was so surprised at the scenes that I loved the characters the movie. The scenes were fun, the dialogue funny, and even the music was a good one (I think I know who wrote it, but that's not important). So, this is a good kids movie. Just don't judge a book by its cover and I will tell you what I think about this movie: It's like a good version of "The Three Stooges."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I have been watching this movie for a while now and it just keeps getting better.   I feel like it is one of the best vampire movies ever made and I mean that in a good way.  In my opinion, the story is pretty simple.  There is a rich young woman who is obsessed with vampires and a rich man who is jealous of her.  It's all pretty interesting.  The vampires are very creative in their ways.  They can take a human being and turn them into a vampire.  This means they are now immortal.  I like to think they are some kind of reincarnation that are being held in a dark room.  As you might guess by the fact that they have to kill a human and a vampire at the same time to achieve this, they are a lot more creative.  Unfortunately, they turn out to be a bit of a liability.  One vampire gets out of the dark room, kills the human and turns him into a zombie.  Meanwhile, the young lady kills the vampire in her sleep and turns herself into a girl.  Not only that, but she has also become pregnant.  However, that isn't really the case.  Her body turns into that of a young girl, but her mind has been taken over by the child.  And who is the father?  A male ghost.  You see, there are a couple of bad guys in this movie who all want to get back at the rich man for something or other.  First of all, the rich guy is an alcoholic.  He is also in love with the young woman.  She then falls in love and tries to get pregnant.   However, she dies of an unknown cause.  Then there is a group of vampires who want revenge on the rich couple.  So, they take over a church and begin feeding on the living.  Although it is obvious to me that all the vampires are trying to get revenge, they only want the money that the rich husband has stashed away.  Fortunately, the woman is able to get a job as a cleaner and eventually the couple ends up moving into a fancy house in the middle of the woods.  Oh, and they are also married.  Once in a while, some vampires show up to steal the money from the rich family.  After a while however, they find the house empty and it is up to the young couple to figure out what has happened. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely captivated by the story of this film.   From the very first scene of the film, I was fully sucked into the story. The whole film is a gripping thriller and I was riveted by every single moment of the movie.  It was like watching the end of a fantastic story unfold in real time.  What you are getting is a suspenseful thriller about a group of people who are trying to get out of the crime of a kidnapping that was made famous a long time ago in this country.  The characters in this film are some of the most interesting I have ever seen in any movie. The only thing that could make this film better would be if the film had a few more of those amazing characters to make this one of the best suspenseful films ever made.  A must see for all thrill-seekers out there!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I think about a movie like this I feel like I'm at the cinema with the entire crew and the cast of the movie.   I love films like this because they are fun and easy to take in but it's so well made and made all the better for the amount of times it was rewatched and the amount it got me laughing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In his introduction to "A Thousand Splendid Suns," Michael Winterbottom describes his film thusly:  I was interested to see how a young American director would do in the Soviet Union; in fact, what a beautiful country to do a film about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What do you get when you combine a classic action-packed Western with a new age of sci-fi?   A spectacular sci-fisrt!   The story is as follows:  A group of space explorers crash on a planet which is not too far away from the Sun.   After a brief battle between the forces of good and evil, the villains have won.  As the story goes on it starts to become clear that this planet is a haven of peace and happiness.  The good guy is the only one who seems to notice these circumstances and goes on to save the world, all the while not knowing he's doing so because he's a "human clone".   He is one of a group of clones who, over a period of about 100 years, have been genetically engineered and bred to be soldiers.  They are the last hope of a race that has been destroyed by a virus a long time ago.  A few generations ago the planet was visited by a ship of explorers who were looking for a planet where they could live in peace and in safety.  At first they found this planet but the humans there were so far ahead of them that it had been destroyed 100 years ago. However the scientists there, having studied the planet and found a cure, decided that humanity would need to leave it for a while so the planet could be used as a living laboratory.  Once the humans have left the planet, the planet begins to slowly become deserted.  Some time later a group from the planet crash lands on the planet.  It is then that the clone brothers find out what happened to their home.  In order to save themselves, the clone boys have to go into the past and retrieve a virus they had once discovered.  But they find a much more dangerous virus.  To prevent the aliens from coming back to earth, the clones need to find a way to stop the Sun from heating up and killing everyone.  Their only hope is to take a sample of the virus that has fallen from the ship in which they crashed.  Unfortunately the cloning brothers don't know that the virus they have taken has also been planted in the Earth.  Fortunately, the two scientists who have been sent to the planet will find a means of stopping the Sun while the clones can take the sample to the lab.  When the humans return to Earth, the scientists discover that the Earth has now become completely uninhabitable, a fact the clones don't

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What I like about The Thing is that it gives you the sense that this is just another Hollywood blockbuster, complete with a villain, a robot with a brain (a nice touch), a group of characters who all seem to act the same way, but who are all different, the film follows a rather mundane story that really gets into the mind of a scientist and his daughter and the reactions she gets from people around her. I can't help but wonder if people are just drawn to this story as there are a few things that keep the film from being anything but a boring and predictable horror film.   The film starts out with an over-acting scientist and an overacting daughter who are forced to go into a town in order to stop a monster. It's not too bad, but I found the overacting to be rather overdone. The only good thing about the film is that there are some great monsters in there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a decent movie, with a good story. The story is not interesting, and the characters are a bit dull. The cinematography is pretty good, but the sound is not too great, and not great cinematography. The music is ok.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie that takes a good idea and adds some new blood.   It's a good story about a hero and an old man, the old man in his early 50s.  It deals with the question of how an old person in a modern time is supposed to deal with a guy with a gun and a very different attitude.  I love the way that it uses music and a movie with a lot of action.  A well done movie that is worth watching, a bit hard to follow at times but worth the effort.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good horror film, and I have not seen a better one since the original Halloween   I do not know if it is because of a curse or is this a good film.   It has a very good plot, good acting, good atmosphere and good horror elements.  The characters are all well developed, the film has a good atmosphere, but does not give you a scare as much as a good haunted house should.  You see a family of four living in a house. The husband and wife work in the factory, and the son, and another boy are also employed.  After having all of their children die, the wife finds that the family is cursed. It seems that every night the whole family is murdered by the killer or one of the children.  It is a horror film that I enjoy, but you have to be prepared for the supernatural elements, and it is not scary at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was pretty obvious what would happen at the end of this movie, but the way the movie ended was kind of a disappointment.   The movie stars Adam Sandler, Christopher Walken and a number of other familiar faces and takes place in what used to be a small town in Florida in the 1950's.  While it would make the typical person want to watch this movie and probably enjoy it, I think Sandler doesn't exactly give this movie a good review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie! I saw this movie over a year ago and was very impressed by how well the directors managed to capture the mood of the era. This movie does not skimp on any atmosphere and is able to pull off a very good performance from each and every one of the characters. One of my favorite actors in the 80's is also the one in the movie who comes across as the most authentic, and that is definitely not a surprise because he is one of my top 5.   I think this movie is not only a great action-packed thriller, but also a very moving portrait of the dark times of the 80s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie I was very disappointed in how badly it tried to sell itself. The film seemed to be all about the kids and how they live their lives. I found this odd as there was nothing about them living. There was nothing at all about what they did, what they were doing or why they did it. There were no characters that came to life. It just felt like the kids in it were trying to create something new, something that was very much like a movie made by kids and for kids. It felt very much in the style of a kid's movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only bad thing about this movie is that it's a little too long. The story seems to be about two brothers who travel back in time to stop the Nazis from destroying World War II, but I think it could have used a little more time to explore the history of the Nazis. The movie has lots of great action, and I like how each brother has his own reasons for the mission, but the film is just too slow and clunky for me. The action sequences were all very well done, but you just don't have time to follow them and don't really learn anything about the characters.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening credits tell us what we are about to see: a woman in an apron and a man in a chair at a small table with a tablecloth and silverware. This is a movie about a woman, a father, and a son; about two women at a table. It is an old-fashioned film, with a wonderful screenplay, which is one of those times when the words are both beautiful and the meaning is simple.   This is also a film with a powerful sense of humor.  The story starts out when our hero, Mrs. Paulina (Odeya Rush), has returned from a holiday to find the apartment to which she was moved a few days ago has been trashed. She has returned to find a note on the door: "This is the end of your life."   Odeya is an interesting and convincing young actress, and she also manages to play Mrs. P, an almost unknown woman, and Mrs. B, the boss' wife, with equal skill and subtlety.  Mr. S and Mrs K are also interesting characters.  And Mr. B is a wonderful comic creation.  These three are all very likable.  They come to a terrible accident and then they get to work in restoring the apartment.  It is not a funny, cheerful film. This movie is sad.  But it is a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a good one.   It is definitely a comedy but it is good.  The story line follows an American tourist to the UK in the 80s.  They meet a young girl who is not American but does have a British accent and is also a girl.  It follows the American girl who becomes attached to the young girl and the American Girl.  In the 80's England had a terrible plague which killed off a large portion of the population and it is the English girl who helps the young American girl (who is also English) and find a way to prevent the plague from happening again.  However the two girls are both quite different in the way they think and act.  One is a spoiled rich girl who lives in a large castle and is a member of the British aristocracy.  Another is a rather naive girl who wants to learn about life and is very interested in reading books and having adventures.  Both are very self-centered, childish, and ignorant of life in England and it shows.  This movie was not good. The acting is bad, the movie has nothing going for it and is pretty boring.  I liked the movie as a good old time movie but it should have been a movie from the 40s.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I didn't even know what a "slit" was.   I'd heard something about it but it was a "sink" in the brain...I've never seen anything like it.  It's an enormous, deep, red wound that's been sutured shut.  I was expecting it to be a shock...maybe a "horrific" movie.  But then it gets better.  The acting in this is amazing...I don't think you can find better actors than these two.  Also, I was looking forward to having "horrible" thoughts about how I was going to kill myself.  And the music, to be honest...I never heard anything like that before!   So, in the end, I give this an A+ (I can't do a 5).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favourite movies from my childhood. It is one of the first movies I have seen when I came to America.   It is about a group of poor kids who, in their search for a better life, go out into the boondocks of Illinois and become the local "boogeyman".   I love this movie because it is about the kids at that time, and how they try to make their way in life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny, it's weird and it's fun, but it's not all about that.   This is a movie about the way human nature plays out.    It's about the weird things we do for attention, the strange ways people react when they get a bad break, and the strange things that happen when our lives are thrown off course.  It was created by a guy who has made dozens of films with a similar feel to his new film "The Adventures of a Young Wizard."   For a while the movies seemed to be all about a young wizard who had a big, magical head full of dreams of fame and fortune and great love and adventure.  Then he and his friends have a big breakthrough in his first real job, but everything goes wrong.  And all his new friends have strange habits.  They make mistakes and do crazy things that we see in the film.  The first time I saw it, I thought to myself, "Whoa, that's really weird."  It really is.  I thought that about the movie as well.  But then I started to realize that a great deal of the film is the same, or is very similar, to what happens in real life.  Here's a little about that in the comments of an earlier review: The "I'm a Wizard" film is a film in which a young man (Josh Hutcherson) works as a muggle (magical creatures) at a magical circus.  He is the youngest wizard ever and is forced to live on the streets (where wizards hang out).  The people he meets and works with, some of which are more powerful than him, are often not exactly friends.  One of the characters in particular is a total jerk who is willing to get into a fistfight with the hero because he thinks it will give him an edge over the boy.  The other characters are also jerks.  When the movie begins the audience knows, or thinks they know, that this is a story about a boy trying to make the best of a bad situation.  (Note: I will say now that a character who is not a jerk is not an inherently bad character).  And as the story unfolds that's exactly what happens.  There is nothing to the story.  Yet the viewer realizes that this guy has the chance to change his life and have a great life. Why?  Because he has a magical hat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place in Japan. A group of girls is on their way home, but when they reach the village they are met with a group of bandits. It's pretty brutal, the girls have to fight their way through the village, and kill the bandits. The movie is pretty good. The acting was pretty good and the violence was pretty brutal. If you enjoy bad movie, this is one you definitely should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has great acting, and amazing cinematography.   I really didn't have any idea who this actor was. He's not really a good actor by any means, but his character is so compelling I still found myself rooting for him.  He's the one who has to face the hard decisions that the other characters must make, especially if they're going to survive.  The ending was fantastic, and I'm really glad this movie exists.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to thank the studio/director/producer  R.J. Smith for this wonderful and well done film.   In spite of the title, this film is more of a psychological thriller than a murder mystery.  I don't know what happened to the couple that got killed, but I'm glad that someone did.  After watching a number of real life murders, I can say with certainty that all of them were staged, and none of them ever occurred.  This film is very well done, and I found myself genuinely frightened in places that I thought I knew.  If you don't watch this film, then you are not ready to have a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film that shows how well a story can work and how the actors and crew really pulled off a great picture:  A story about a beautiful but troubled girl; she is the daughter of a rich and powerful man and her brother is a wealthy and famous dancer. She is taken in at a young age by the rich but sadistic dancer and is sent out to live with him in a room over a hot spring which she loves. She then meets another rich and sadistic lover and her life is changed forever.   The story was quite well done.      The actors and actresses really did a good job of portraying the different characters in the story.  While most of them are portrayed as sadists and monsters, it really is the young people who are the most interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie will make you laugh out loud at some funny parts and cry at some heart wrenching ones.   The director of this movie is a real genius.  He doesn't try to imitate any action movies and he doesn't add anything new to the action movie genre. He's just an original guy who loves to act. I think he got to be a director from the movies he watched. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the result of a combination of influences: John Carpenter's movies, which are all about being chased by monsters; the science fiction films of the 60s; the movies of Alfred Hitchcock; and then the music of Brian Eno and others.   It is a film of beauty and menace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had high hopes for this film. It was based on a true story and it had a pretty good cast (especially for this day and age).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had to look up "The Night Stalker" to prepare for this review. It was recommended to me by a friend when I was in college. I saw a video about the movie on the internet a few years back and it was pretty convincing! It has some cool movie titles: "In the Valley of the Shadow of Death", "The Stalker", "Night Stalker Returns" and "NightStalker: The Man Who Loved Women, Loved Children and Loved His Mother".   The movie follows the story of a retired FBI agent named Bill Hickock who has been tracking a serial killer known as "The Son of Sam". After years of investigating, Hickock is forced to come to terms with the fact that his case will probably never be solved. He has always believed that the only way to find the killer is to get on his case personally.   What I found so fascinating about "The Man Who Tried to Kill His Mother" is the fact it's a movie that makes you wish the night that you were a kid was a whole lot scarier. I was thinking to myself, "Why does this little old man always get away?" Why does the FBI always know too much? It was scary in a totally non-scary way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched   "The Man Who Wasn't There"   (the second and last movie of the "Jingle All The Way" trilogy),   directed by   Errol Morris and written by    John Huston (who directed the   previous   movie,   about the  Humphrey Bogart's   journey to Hollywood).   This is a very well-shot movie, with a lot of great dialogue.   Like   the previous    movie, "The Lady Vanishes" , it follows a great love story between an American (Mr.  Louis Saha, played by  Errol Morris) and a French woman (Elisabeth Schüner, played  by Gérard Depardieu).  Mr. Morris is a master of the short, intense, and sad scenes.  He also excels at the "so bad, it's good"  style.  Mr, Saha is a brilliant character: he wants desperately to be accepted by the American  wife (played by Gérin Depardie, who seems to be   getting better and better).  She is a ditsy, ignorant woman who is   very self-centered.  This movie is like watching a couple who is having trouble   to conceive a child.  It is a love story at its heart: it shows that love can make a man, and a woman can make the man she loves.  I found   this   extremely hard to watch.  Depardee played   her role like a fool.  If Depardée had been in her prime,  she would have been a very great actress.  She seems to have lost the plot at times.  Gérards Depardier seems like a real person.  The acting by the two leads was very strong.  They both are great at their parts.  Unfortunately, the story could have been told better.  Morris is so good at telling a story, it is hard to tell who is speaking and who is being spoken to.  In the end,  I do not want to see   a sequel to "The Way Back"  because I do think it would be better written. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't have anything bad to say about this movie. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Star Trek film. The actors are all great, the crew is fun and fun-loving, and the Klingons are well done.   While I liked the original Star Trek, I think the second movie got a little stale and too similar to the first.

I have only seen this movie once in the theater but I am sure I will go see this movie at least a few more times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not a bad movie, it's a great movie and a must see film that is definitely a must watch film and it should be a classic. I've seen several documentaries on the subject of the infamous "Zodiac Killer", so this is my first viewing of the film. I found it difficult to get into, but it's an excellent movie that will leave you wanting more.   This documentary was not a surprise to me, I knew it was coming and had written about it on my blog but I thought I had gotten it all done by the time this came out!   I'm glad I finally saw this film, I'm so glad I've got a film from the Zodiac Killer himself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fantastic film.   The movie takes place over the course of two days in which a group of friends who are in the area to celebrate the Fourth of July get caught up in some sort of bizarre murder/suicide/thriller.  And that is all it is.  You have a bunch of old friends coming up in the movie who seem to be making more of a mess than you would expect from a group that includes such names as "Dennis Miller," "Hugh Laurie," "Jack Klugman" and, of course, "Jerry Lewis." It's a good time, no doubt, and the movie is a good one. It has a few great scenes, a lot of fun, and some great acting from Lewis.  It's also worth mentioning that when the group first meets, they don't know each other very well, and it's easy to see how the movie might be perceived by some as a bit cheesy.  However, there's a reason the movie was so successful.  There are no gimmicks. There is no one funny character. The movie's main characters have real problems with their lives. They're often alone. They don't get any help from other people.  The plot is fairly straightforward, but it also doesn't leave the viewer hanging, wondering what's going to happen next.  With a plot like that, there are a lot more surprises than you might expect from such a movie.  I liked the movie. It had a lot going on, but at the end, it was fun and had a good story to tell.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of the year. The plot is very complex, and there's a lot of good stuff going on here.   It's a good comedy with good people, so if you're in the mood for a good time, go see this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's all about how good a bad guy can be.   (The bad guy is a bad man, but he's a good one.)   His motivations are simple enough: his mom died and he wants to go to heaven. I'm surprised how simple he is!   The movie, written by Sam Raimi, has a very nice twist ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film doesn't feature any spectacular action sequences, but it has a satisfying plot, with good character development and a wonderful ending.   I enjoyed this film, but I couldn't help wondering about the ending:  Was it really necessary to show the hero dying in a fire?   Did it make the ending more powerful? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good comedy, but also a pretty decent action movie.    The film is set in a fictional small town called "Grimsby" where, over the years, the population has increased to almost 100% black and white citizens.  A lot of the time the town is just a quiet, quiet, community.  One evening, however, a strange man named "Hap" arrives and announces he is a "savage", a "marshal" and that he will kill all of the blacks in the town.  When the mayor (Hugh Dillon) tries to talk to him, he kills a black child named Edna who has been sleeping in a car.  The mayor then meets the "sorcerer", who turns out to be a giant, scary-looking black man named Tommy, who has appeared with a bunch of black people (in a truck).  The town tries to fight off the "black savages".  The "soul-sucking" black man then kills Edna's mother and threatens to kill the mayor.  In the ensuing chaos, Tommy is shot and is about to die.  But a neighbor (Hilda) kills Tommy with her butcher knife.  However, he doesn't die, and then the "monster" appears... and it's the "human" Tommy... and is more than a little scary.  Very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of movies about old people living in a bad situation in a good old neighborhood. The thing is that this one is a bit more upbeat than the others. It's not about old folks being poor or anything. It just sort of comes out that way. The old folks are very charming and they are not all horrible and poor.   The only thing that bugs me about this one are some of the actors. The most irritating one is Robert Bauersfeld (not the director) who plays the husband of the wife who is supposed to be the old lady's best friend. You know that they are going to have a fight at the end and it ends up with him slapping the poor old lady on the butt. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say I expected much from a horror movie made for an American audience, but the whole thing is pretty entertaining.   There are a lot of jump scares, lots of gore, and a lot to think about.  The best thing about it is that it's about a group of misfit friends trying to survive in a rural town while being stalked by an old woman who may or may not have been the "evil witch from hell".   The film plays like a combination of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Purge, and Night of the Living Dead, but with a nice twist on them.  I didn't like how they gave one of the girls a gun because it seemed way too easy to beat someone to death with a baseball bat, but then again I was already annoyed by it.  When I say this is a good horror movie, I don't mean a good one to laugh at.  It's got lots of funny scenes, and they aren't always bad ones either.  There's a lot I can say about it without going into a review about it. It's funny, violent, and at times pretty damn scary.  Overall, it's fun for a good Halloween watch, and it gets better with each viewing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While it is true that most of the movie is about a guy who is not a man, he does have some redeeming qualities.   His love for the game of rugby is a great love of his life, and it makes him a better man.  He gets a wife (who is a complete knockout), and he keeps his love for her alive through his life.  I do wish he could've found a way to get out of prison a little earlier than this.      A solid comedy with a bit of a romance angle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is predictable. The pacing is slow, yet the ending is satisfying.   In summary, I can't say enough good things about this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A funny and poignant movie with a good sense of humor.   This movie is an adaptation of a Japanese novel that takes a bit of a detour into history.  At one point, the main character (Tomo Inogashira) is given a gift of a "special lamp" from his grandpa. The lamp is powered by a combination of two kinds of wood: "Japanese black pine" and "Japanese white pine". Tomo then spends the rest of his life trying to get the lamp to be set at a specific time.  The book takes a lot of artistic license to add a bit more realism and cultural commentary, but it is still entertaining and a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not even going to bother writing about it.   This film is just plain fucking awful.  And what's even more appalling is the fact that they are not even trying to hide it. The film's title is an homage to something that is so bad that there is only one thing worse than the name of this movie.  It is as if someone who had the good fortune to see this movie (or someone who didn't care) would come away completely disgusted.  I would even go so far as to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  In the end, the only good thing that I can say about this film is that it was a fun ride.  But then again I didn't see this film for fun.  Instead, I saw it because it was part of a promotion for an upcoming movie, which is another part of the problem.  What's even worse is that the promotion doesn't even make sense.  As far as I can tell, this promotion is for a movie called "Crimson Sky".  But if you want to find out more about this movie, you should have a look at my review of "Cronos" (and it is actually quite good), and then I can only say that you should try not to see the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I'm really glad the movie came out so long ago. It was a very different kind of science fiction movie than the kind we're used to. The movie was set a century or so into the future, and while some elements of the story are still relevant today, there are some pretty major differences between the way people today live and how people lived back then. The future is far more militaristic and has become so urbanized that even the most simple tasks are done by giant machines. Many people have forgotten how to grow their own food, much less to cook it. But that's not the worst of it. Things are really bad. When the movie begins, a space ship crash-lands in a small town. Everyone on board is dead, including the pilot. The people who survived are forced to work in the local school. But soon a teacher falls ill with a strange, incurable disease, and the entire town is in panic. So the town decides to use some kind of experimental virus in the water supply, and then send it to a nearby alien world, where they hope that the virus will cure the disease. This plan doesn't work, of course, and everyone on board the spaceship is quickly killed. It seems to be a perfect place to start the movie. But it's also pretty horrible, too. It's set in a future world in which people have basically forgotten how a community life used to be. There's no one left in the town who remembers the way things used to work. It doesn't seem like anyone has had the time to even start the school again, because of all the work to build a space colony. The story is basically just a series of flashbacks of what it used to look like to live in a community. This is a movie that really focuses on what it's like to be alive right now in the 21st century. The only people who seem to remember how things used a few generations ago are the few survivors and a few scientists who work on some kindof alien virus, and they look at the present as if it's a very distant past. The ending is a little bit shocking. It ends with the virus that saved the town coming back to kill everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished watching the latest installment of James Bond films, Skyfall, and it was a good one.   The movie centers around 007 and M. She has her hands full when a mysterious, new face comes calling at a secret meeting in Paris:     M is a mysterious beauty (yes, I said mysterious) who appears to be an agent of the International Secret Intelligence Service (I.S.I.E.)   She is introduced as an intelligence officer who was previously stationed at a clandestine international military base in Iran, where she was involved in a high-profile kidnapping.      After the operation, she was taken back to Paris for debriefing, but when she is arrested, the film follows her as she fights to get off of the charge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It was funny and it was very well done. It is not a good sequel to the original. This one is more like a sequel to another movie than a good one. The script is excellent. The movie starts with a great scene when the characters are discussing their lives. It reminded me of a comic strip where the strips were like a good old time cartoon. There were also some good special effects. It started out with a nice comedy, but it kept getting better. It ended with a wonderful romance, and the best ending of any of the movies in this series.

The film has some of the best special effects and effects, some great acting and a good plot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is a film that I always thought would be on my "must-see" list. It is not so much a comedy, but more an art-house movie. It's not like a bad comedy, or a film with no plot, or even a bad film. It isn't even a film about what the title states. There is some pretty good acting, and some very good special effects. The special effects are amazing, but what really makes the film so great is the film itself. There are so many good jokes and moments in the film, that the film never becomes boring, but still manages to have the time to be funny and make a pretty good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason why I say a great movie is "A good movie is just a good film."   It's not a classic. It doesn't have "Hollywood" in the title. It's got a very low budget.   I have heard so much about this movie that I would have to say "don't waste your time."  This is only a movie about a truck driver that was once a star of a sitcom. He then decided to become a trucker. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the most memorable and original film of the 1990's (in my opinion) because it has a plot, a concept, a good story, a great cast of characters, and all of this is done in a very imaginative style.   The plot is interesting, the story is good, the characters are interesting, and the whole movie has a unique art style. This is not a film that has the same appeal as the previous films, this is more of a unique film.

Unfortunately, as a result of his travels he ended up in Laos being betrayed by his friend, and being stabbed to death. This was the beginning of his Buddhist journey.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an amazing movie. I love the way it starts and the way the movie unfolds. I like the way all the characters get introduced, and that they aren't all a part of the same story. I also like that the story is very original.   What this movie is about is really about a group of friends, all of which get together every once in a while for a big celebration. There is a special guest in attendance that they meet, but he isn't really a part until about halfway through the movie. But the movie goes from there.  The movie doesn't just focus on the celebration; it goes all out and you see how many friends are in this little group of people that can't get out of each other's way.  I feel like this is one of those movies that is best enjoyed when you have someone else to share it with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have just finished watching this movie about a man who is trying to find a way to win the lottery. But that is only part of the story. This man is a very kind man who wants to help those less fortunate than himself.   The other part of this story is about a group of scientists who do experiments and find a cure for cancer.  The man who plays the lottery game is not the winner of the lottery, but rather a loser.  But then, a strange and magical man arrives and claims to be the winner.

I can't wait to watch the next movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie that gives us a chance to see a little of the human aspect of warfare.   The movie has a strong plot line that follows the soldiers who make up the 5th Battalion of the 4th Infantry.  While on the march their commander is killed and the battalion's medic, a veteran of over 20 combat missions, is called in to treat him.  It is at this point that our film takes a good while to establish its characters.  The film begins with a simple enough conversation between a soldier and a civilian, and a quick shot of the medic.  From there we learn about the 5 men that make up this battalion: Sergeant William "Sarge" Foster; a grizzled veteran of the Korean War with an attitude to match; Private Daniel, a "hippy" with a mop of brown hair that is all over his uniform; Private John "Jack" Taggart, who is not a hippie at all; and Private Robert "Bob" Williams, a smart, tough, veteran who wears the uniform with pride.  As is typical in these kinds of movies, Foster and Taggert's love is not reciprocated, Foster having his eye on a very pretty nurse and Tarkert being smitten with the pretty young corporal Williams.  A quick shot showing Williams's reaction to Taggard and Foster is the first indication of the type of relationship they have.  Williams seems to want to be a part of the crew that makes a good fight. Foster wants to be in the battle of his life. It's a short, quick film but in it the human side of war is very well shown. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Here's a review by some guy who likes to watch movies and talk about movies:  One of my favorite films of the past few years is The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a few reviews where it has been said that this movie is better than the original. Yes, I agree with that. This movie is a lot of fun.   This movie reminds me of the "Superhero Movie" from a while back that was based off of a comic book, which was about the man who could fly with a cape.  There are some similarities to that movie, and yes, they both have the same kind of humor and action.  It has a little more action in it than most Superhero movies, but it still has a good amount of humor in it.  The story takes a turn, but that's not really a bad thing, and the ending is great.  This is a very enjoyable movie to watch, and should be considered as the third part of the original series, which makes it even better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There isn't a single scene where I feel like the writers have been held back by technical difficulties. The action is incredibly intense; the fight scenes are equally intense; and even the scenes where the heroes are being hunted by an evil corporation are just as tense. This is definitely the movie to watch in October.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Let's start by saying that The Hateful Eight is a brutal, bloody, unforgiving, and wildly entertaining movie.   It's a film that will leave your blood pumping and will leave you thinking about it and talking about it for days and days and months.  There's some great scenes in the movie, there's some pretty good acting from both lead actors and there's certainly some great locations in the film.  But the film is nothing more than a bloody romp and a lot of fun to watch.  You'll probably laugh out loud more than once.  This is not a serious movie. It's like a combination of Django Unchained and a Tarantino movie. A big-hearted and very enjoyable piece of cinema with a great cast of actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was the final battle between the old Gods of Olympus, Helios and Helius and the new Gods of Athens. In that time, the old gods were in decline. The Greek's had conquered the Hellenists and they had to deal with their new "brothers". Zeus and Helios were the old deities. Helius was a bad guy. Zeus was a good guy. Helios was a god with a bad temper. I liked this movie a lot. This is a great movie with lots of action. My favorite action scene involves a giant eagle and a bull. The bull and the eagle are going to fight. The eagle gets in a great shot on the bull. Helio has to jump in a fire pit and do a jumping shot from the bull into the eagle. It is an awesome scene. I recommend this movie to people who like great action scenes.

I watched this movie and it scared the hell out of me and I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a pretty standard thriller (at least the first half), but I'd say that it's an enjoyable movie.   First, there's a brief flashback to the murder of an elderly man (who turns out to be a former child actor).   Later, it gets interesting. The victim is a very wealthy young man who seems to have forgotten everything about his life. His father and brother are dead. His girlfriend and his dog are dead too.  One day, he meets a very nice woman named Mandy (who happens to be the sister of a wealthy man). Mandy tells him that her sister and father both died last year, and that their father had a rich widow who he wanted to be with.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the story.  Mandy had lost most of her money in an investment, and now she's homeless, living with the boy's girlfriend.  It all seems so hopeless, but that doesn't stop Mandy from trying.  She even manages to have the boy put his dog, Rufus, in a kennel, because she doesn't know who to trust any more.  I think that some people may find this a bit over-the-top, and there is no real reason for it to be, but the movie works.  The story seems quite realistic, but it's also a bit surreal (there's a scene where the boy goes on a fishing trip and sees a fish eating a man).  The dialogue between Mandy and the boy is realistic as well, and the relationship between them is interesting.  As far as plot goes, it's not terribly complex, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit.  There are a few good surprises in the end as well.  However, my only complaint is that the ending was a bit contrived.  But other than that, I think this is a fun movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie as a whole.   It is a nice, fun and interesting little story.  It shows the way that the "silly old men" are as a group.  This movie has a great plot.  A group of children are trying to build a bridge across a river.  There is a little girl who is the star of the story. The other kids just help along in the little girl's efforts.  The bridge is a bit tricky at the end and the kids get hurt along the way.  As a movie, it is very well made and has a wonderful soundtrack.  Also there are some interesting things going on in this movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history.

It is one of the best movies in the whole history of cinema.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I liked most about this movie: It is a good action movie. It is based on the popular novels of the author of "The Bourne Identity" (the character of Mr. Smith was originally written by Gerard Butler and the other parts of the movie were made by the company 'Blind Trust Films'). It is very well done with a good script. The action sequences in this movie were well done, the movie had very good special effects, and it had a nice plot and well-developed characters. The movie was very well produced by Blind Trust, it looks like a professional movie and the film was very fun.   My rating: 3 out of 4 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I'm not a movie reviewer, but I'm sure I can speak for a lot of movie fans out there when I say that  I     was         psyched  to see this film.   I'm glad that they used a lot more CGI to this film as it seems that this is a much better looking film than the movie that came out 2 years ago (although that movie wasn't any good either).   The story is pretty much the same story that   started  back in 1987 with the character of  George  Buck (aka "Squeaky" from My Buddy and The Magic Door ).   That same character is back as a teacher of a kids' gymnastics class.  This movie is the perfect mix of fantasy and magic.  The movie takes place at a school where the main characters' parents (Mr. Buck and Mrs. Buck) are in the middle of a divorce and this leads to a lot conflict that comes between the students.  We follow them as they go through a lot in this movie and we also get to see them make mistakes and learn.  And we also see the relationships they have and how those relationships influence each other.  It's just a lot to take in and you can't help but get hooked on it.  There are a lot a moments in this film where it just makes you think about things you've always been wondering about and you wonder what the big deal was about these parents getting back together.  I also really like how the kids all have different personalities and I think that it's a really funny movie.  As I said before this movie takes a bit to get going but once it does there is a lot that happens to them.  My favorites of the film would be the scene where they are all in their underwear and George's girlfriend has to tell him he can't have her because she just had a baby and there's a baby in her underpants.  Of course this also leads to some very funny and sexy scenes as the kids find out about this baby.  Some scenes in the movie are really funny and I know that there are a ton of people who would love to see this movie again.  If you're a fan of the old films like this you should definitely check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked the story, though it didn't have the "wow" factor I was expecting.   It is a well done story, but it doesn't feel like it was crafted by an author who is also a "professional" writer.  It doesn't have much of a plot, but does have some interesting details.  The writing is clean and straightforward, and there is no cheesy writing in it.  I recommend watching the movie if you want to see a good "dark" comedy, though I don't see it in the way most people are expecting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie a very enjoyable watch.   This is a really well put together movie. The story is extremely well-told and I loved every single minute.  One thing I really liked about the movie was the ending. I liked how it was unexpected and I liked that it took the whole movie to finish and then ended in a very good way.  I also liked that every time I thought the movie had run its course I was pleasantly surprised by something different.  This movie really deserves a sequel! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching the first three episodes of this anime I was already in love with it.   The characters are cute and the setting is beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a very good movie with an impressive cast, but if you like science fiction with aliens, then you will probably like this one, because it is actually pretty interesting to be around.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a wonderful film that shows that a woman can be an inspiring figure in her own right.   The character is not quite the heroic lady that we are accustomed to seeing, but she does a good job of showing a woman's strength and independence even when in an unfamiliar world.  The cast does a nice job of bringing all the women together in a common goal.  As for the music, the score is well done and fitting the mood.  Overall a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's not a whole lot to say about this one. It's pretty basic, but it has a good cast.   I've not seen this movie since I was a teenager, but I think it's one of my favorite movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is hard to judge a movie from the beginning. It took me 3 days to get it together. After the first minute, my expectations were low. I was expecting a bad movie, but it wasn't bad at all. The acting was really good. It was kind of awkward but at the same time it made the movie very unique. I liked it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much, it's funny, scary, and good. The movie takes place on the "Stairway to Heaven" in California. You are introduced to the main character, a young boy, Mikey. The main character is a young, retarded boy named Mikey who finds a strange woman who he can talk to. The two develop a friendship and eventually the two form a cult.   The main reason that I loved the movie so I had so much fun watching it was that it was really silly. I loved it so much that it would have been impossible for me to stay awake for the entire movie.  As soon as I watched the film I laughed out loud and then continued laughing while I watched it. The scene where Mikey and the woman fall over the ledge was a hilarious scene.  At one point during the film the mother of the boy watches the two talk and then goes over to them and the two start to talk to each other.  The movie was about as funny as it gets but there are some really funny scenes as well.  One of the better things about the movie was that the characters are all rather strange.  I thought the scenes where Mike and the girl would laugh together were good.  Another really good thing about the film is the great music that was played during the scenes.  Overall I had a lot of fun with this movie and was glad I watched a movie like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is nothing special, but there's nothing wrong with it either. It seems that this movie took forever to make and was originally supposed to be a French film, but that didn't pan out either and it was eventually converted into a Canadian film, which is a good thing because the French version was a little cheesy and had some strange characters, but this movie is better.   There are some good acting performances, and there's some good character development, which I appreciate. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I'm sorry the actors did not play more characters or had better dialogue.   This movie does not give a fuck about its own story and instead just focuses on its own special shit.   I love it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen quite a few documentaries about this period, I remember a lot of them were good and even a couple of them can be good movies if you go with the time.   The only thing I would change in it is the editing (although it has some very good footage of the fighting and the people in the war).   And maybe a little better lighting would have enhanced the atmosphere a little more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a surprise I saw this movie, I heard about it on tv and watched it with friends. It's a fun movie, with a great soundtrack. I liked it better than the movies they play in movies that have to be seen to believe they are good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie in this series was, well, that one. I liked it so much that I bought it for my own collection, and also wanted a second part because I liked that one better than the first.   I know there have been other parts, but not this.      The plot is a little too perfect for a film that's supposed to be about a couple.  Not only does they live in a small cabin in the woods, but they have to deal with a very strange, but very cute, puppy.   It seems that the first part, "Pete's Eyes," is actually based on a real-life experience, so I'm not surprised that I liked the movie so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting a very good movie from David Cronenberg, but this is way better than I had thought. A man has a wife, a kid and a dog, who seems to be a happy, sweet person. Well, we find out later that they're actually the main characters in a series of vignettes, where people are tortured to death. It's disturbing, scary and quite funny at the same time. I had to sit through these, and my mind just refused to work any further than the very last part. The fact that it was a Cronenberg film is actually the most surprising thing.

If you are looking for a good joke, a good film, a decent flick, a well-made film, or an interesting movie to look at, this is the film for you. It's a good time, and a good laugh. I will be watching the sequel and will give it a go, even though I have a feeling it won't be as good as this one. I recommend this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is about an amazing scientist who has his life changed when he becomes the new head of a small town high school.   He gets to work with a class of misfit, weird kids who are not very good at school, but are more intelligent than most of the teachers.  They are drawn into a web of conspiracy when a bunch of students go missing.  The film is more about suspense than character development.  Despite some weak acting (as it is more for the kids than for the scientist), the film is an enjoyable one.  It does have one flaw, and it is not too bad a flaw.  Because the story is so good, it is easy to forget that the students are real people with real problems.  I think the kids could have been a little more realistic in the sense that they would be better at school and not just go missing more often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well written movie that does not rely on its special effects to set it apart from other horror films.   It does not take itself too seriously nor is it cheesy.  When I say "it" is not cheesy, I mean "it really is a good, decent, solid, entertaining horror film with a good score from me.  It's not so scary or gory or gross that you are going to throw up after watching it, but when you're just trying to relax and enjoy some light horror, this movie really is enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is hard to review a movie about a robot's first meeting with a human being without being a little gushy. But it is true.   As much as I love robots and their relationship to humanity, it is always a little strange to see one (this one specifically) at the head of an ensemble (even a very well-acted one). But the human actor is a masterful performer with great voice talent and even better voice acting.  This is a movie that will definitely be remembered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Day After Tomorrow" is a science fiction film that stars Gary Busey, John Candy, Robert Redford and Gene Hackman.   The story is loosely based on a real-life incident:  There is a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union in the year 2050.  At the end of the war, a nuclear plant is still in use.  It is controlled by the People's Republic of China, a Communist country.  A young American, Jack Harkness (Busey), and his friend, Evelyn (Candy), find a way to activate the plant.  Jack will use his skills in nuclear physics and engineering to bring down the People.  Evelyn and Jack, however, will have to solve a much more challenging problem:  What happens if they don't?   After a crash landing, Evelyns ship is destroyed.  She has been captured by the Chinese and used as a hostage for the Russians.  After being rescued, Jack has to discover why his ship has been brought down.  What he learns is that the planet Earth is about to be destroyed.     "The Day after Tomorrow" may be a science fantasy, but it is also a classic action film with an engaging story that will keep your attention.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very grateful that I was able to see this one at all. I had not seen a bad one that wasn't made up of the worst stuff I've ever seen (i.e. the first one i saw is not any better than this one) and this one certainly fits that category.   This was a big disappointment to me but the director certainly is not to be trifled with and is actually a very gifted filmmaker.  It is a good film if you can look past its flaws. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am still surprised that a comedy as bad as this didn't get made. It was so bad that you would think it was made by people who didn't know what they were doing.   But then, it's funny and it doesn't really matter what it's about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic sci-fi film. The plot is typical. We have a time traveler from the future who goes back and discovers an ancient artifact that enables him to travel back in time. And we have a man in the year 2015 who finds a similar artifact which allows him to go back in the future as well. The two protagonists have to work together to discover the secrets behind both of these artifacts and save the world before it is destroyed by some evil time traveling scientist who has kidnapped some important historical figures.   The movie is set in 2015 in a city where the world's governments have collapsed.  They have to start over from scratch and learn how to survive the coming chaos.  It's a good and entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was soooo happy to watch this movie after watching The Day After Tomorrow. This movie is about a scientist, an engineer, a mathematician, a physicist, a lawyer, a soldier, and a reporter all coming together to solve one very large puzzle. It is funny, and extremely well done, but I don't really want to believe in the movie's premise.   It's a movie that you'll laugh about for days on end, but just when you're at the point where you have all your doubts about it, a brilliant physicist comes in with an important clue. You'll think he's crazy, but then you find out that he's absolutely right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very entertaining film that has all the makings of a good comedy and a great story.   The film starts with a man (Dennis Hopper) who is convinced that his wife is cheating on him with the neighbor, Mr. "Wally" Waddles (Gene Hackman), who is in on a very serious drug scheme.  But as it turns out the wife is not the one cheating on Waddlers.  After getting a tip from a local newspaper editor (Bill Murray) that the neighbor is selling some of the illegal drugs around town, Dennis sets out to find out more about what is really going on.  The plot moves fast and furious and the film is filled with a lot of jokes and zingers.  There is also a good mix of comedy and drama here.  Despite the fast paced nature of the movie there are a number of great performances in this.  In particular Dennis Hopper is always the right guy to pull this film off.  Another standout performance is by Bill Murray.  While not quite as good as his role as a doctor in the film A Little Chaos, Bill Murray does a good job as the character of Dennis Hoppers.  Overall, a fun and entertaining film from a great actor.

The action sequences, including a long chase through the city, are entertaining and well executed.  The plot is also entertaining and the movie has a decent number of twists.  Unfortunately the special effects do not match the plot and there is not enough gore or violence to make this a good film.

She meets a man who is quite different than the one she knew - they become close and at first she thinks he is her perfect companion, then something goes wrong.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I'd be a big fan of any movie that stars John Hurt, but the film is actually a pretty great little film. John Hurt is just a very different kind of man. He's a rather odd man, with a strange and wonderful sense of humour and a keen eye for comedy. He has a very odd sense of humor. He is quite eccentric, and it's funny to watch him. The film has a strong element of fantasy, and is in some ways very wonderful, but it's still a very good little film, even if there are things it didn't get right.

I feel a little cheated...  ...there are a few "tricks" and a little dialogue here and there but it does not add anything more to the story.  What it is a good "tween movie: This movie has some good "teen" characters (with some great singing).   But I really enjoyed "Cinderella" even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has an impressive list of talent, from star John Goodman, to director Martin Scorsese, to producer Steven Soderbergh, to editor Walter Hill.   I had no idea how to appreciate a movie so good, so beautiful, so entertaining, but I must admit to being mesmerized by the spectacle on display. The film's director is so talented that it doesn't matter how bad it gets.  The story is about an insurance company that is in financial trouble. Their chief executive has a bad case of nerves.  When the company takes over a real estate project, he is in favor of selling it.  But then the buyers threaten to go to court and accuse the company of corruption and greed.  To protect their interests they hire a powerful and aggressive New York attorney, John Goodman.  His lawyer is David Brownstein, who will stop at nothing to get a verdict in his favor.  Goodman's best friend is a young girl named Wendy Williams (Bette Midler).  This is one of those rare films that is about people that you don't want to be around.  Soderberg's directorial style is as if he were in the thick of it. His cinematography is great, the performances are perfect, and it's an incredible ride.  I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of good movies and entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The film does not need to be anything special to get a good grade from me, especially for a film from 1982.   The story is straightforward: an innocent man is taken to a small town by a woman for the sole purpose of getting him a wife (not unlike the "Little House on the Prairie" TV show), only this woman is no housewife and the man's only purpose in life is to be an effective "assistant."   There is a definite comedic touch to this film, with the man being very gullible, and his gullibility is exploited by a man who appears to be the wife's lover.  The man has trouble distinguishing between what is real and what is imaginary and in many ways he resembles a character in "Pollyanna." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is about a young man who is trying to find out what he's really like inside the mind of a psychopath.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has so much heart.   It is funny and heartwarming, and I just felt so happy watching it!   For those who didn't know, this movie takes place during WWII.  The story follows the life of a German officer named Siegfried Horst who joins the Red Cross during WWII, and ends up being assigned to an underground network of Nazi concentration camps in a remote part of France.  There, Horst is reunited with his girlfriend, and it is then she finds out that he is also Jewish.  Siegfried soon becomes the object of the envy of his fellow prisoners, and a bit of a misfit, especially with all the Nazi officers who seem to hate and fear him.  I loved the way this movie is shot, and there is a wonderful sense of place in it.  As an aside, I found this movie so touching that I almost cried.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think the film would be better if there wasn't a lot of talking and no scenes involving the narrator:  In the original German it says, "Halt! It is a good time to be a tourist: at our hotel, which can only be called a madhouse. We don't know what to do with him. We can't be too careful! A policeman comes and leaves a big pile of bricks with a stick at his feet. We're told it's not a joke. We think he has a heart attack and goes to his room. There is a large hole in the floor: he tries to get up through it, only to fall over again. He's dead. We walk around in a circle looking at everything: no windows, the water is boiling; we don't like the looks of the place. We take a lot away: one of the hotel staff tells us the whole place is a prison, that the men have no rights and they all sleep standing up. What a lot! We go away in a hurry. And we return: we go back to the hotel."   The movie is very funny and quite entertaining:  The film is very good: the actors seem to enjoy themselves and the story is exciting: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just found out about this movie. I read the review here.   The reviews are not bad, but they are not good. The movie is about a cop who has to arrest a thief in order to cover up the fact that he himself stole the cash he had found in a bank. There is no reason for the bank to have a large cash vault (that's not an exaggeration) and no reason to have one that is so hard to get in. The guy who is arrested is a really nice guy, who looks like he has just seen the real thing. I guess they made him a bad guy just to show that there is a real-life bad guy in Los Angeles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the first season of  Dark Matter       This was my favorite show ever and they really nailed the character of Dark Matter.   We're always worried about the "Big bad" when we watch a Sci-fi show but this show is about a team that's on the verge of getting their asses handed to them.  I thought the series was great, I'm going to start re-watching it just because of that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a bit hesitant at first to pick this one up for the first time. My mom was a big fan of the first one and my brother was on the fence with this one. I've always had a thing for sci-fi movies so this was another one that I was looking forward to. I'm glad I finally gave it a go. I love the little things that made me really enjoy this movie. I really loved the little dialog that came out of my ears and the fact that it was a nice blend of humor and romance. I also found it fun watching the cast try to be funny and making silly faces. I liked that this was an independent film and not a "Made for TV" movie, I appreciated the little touches that were added in between the action scenes. I was pleasantly surprised at the way the movie ended. I can't wait to watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never really thought that I would like any of these old movies but this one is really good.   After watching this movie and seeing the director, Peter Yates' performance is great.  It has an old school feel to it and the story has a great feel to the old.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a big fan of the first "Batman" films but this one has become an important part of my childhood.   The characters were cute, the acting was excellent (for the time period), the story was enjoyable, and the humor was light and not intrusive.  This is a good entry point to the more famous characters like The Joker and Catwoman,  The movie itself has a lot of goofy moments but in my opinion they were not overused.  Overall, it was a fun adventure that I was glad to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was pretty easy to put together a movie about a little girl's journey into the unknown. That is an amazing thing to me because the film is so small. She is about three years old at the beginning, and all she ever wanted to do was be a witch. When she is about ten years old, her aunt takes her away to be a little princess. As a little witch, she gets in trouble from the Prince, the Lord of the castle, and the King. And when she gets caught by the Prince and his guards, the Prince gets in her way. The little girl gets to be an apprentice to a wizard and the boy wizard is pretty good. The Prince and the Wizard keep her in a pretty good place for about a day or two. The Wizard gets caught trying to kill the Prince because he wants to marry the Queen of England. The girl can't stop him, but the Wizard can. It's a pretty short film, so you can watch it once or twice and see what's going on. The Princess of the South Seas is about a girl who goes to live in a small boat in the middle of the ocean, where she tries to make a little living, which doesn't work out too well for her, except for when she learns to fly a little boat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was excited to read a story from a great writer.    The story is set in a dystopian future where the world is run by a corporate fascist government and people are made to suffer in order to maximize corporate profits.  In this story there is a young woman who is one of a group of rebels who are trying to overthrow the corporate fascist state.  The rebels are made up of a father and son.  It is a great book and I have read several other stories about people trying to change the corporate fascism system but this is a little different.  There is an interesting twist which is one that is hard to figure out but I found it enjoyable.  For my money this is the best dystopian story I have ever read and I love it!

The story seems to be about a group of young people, some of them are evil and mean-spirited like a little kid who gets caught up in a little magic world of fantasy where humans can turn into animals and fight off other animals.  The most memorable part of the anime was when they all went to the magical forest and when a large dragon attacked them, they had to do some quick thinking and they all turned into their wolf form and chased the dragon away from their home.  Even though it was a short anime, it didn't make me want to watch more because it ended with a pretty stupid ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like in many a good comedy, the movie starts out by showing a bunch of guys who have a barbeque and play darts. And then they all gather up a few women, put them in a tent, and start playing bingo. The movie is funny, with great scenes and good gags. There are a few times the movie goes on for a good while, with some characters sitting on the bench, and one guy making an omelet, then another guy eating his omelets. The omelette is funny; it is just a bunch o' omeats.   A more important point is that the women are cute. It was an old fashioned movie where you see the funny side of people who are not that smart, but who are a lot funnier. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very, very good movie. I have always loved the movies about the great American adventure and adventure novels. This movie is no exception.       I love how it all started, how he started to lose his temper, and he finally had to take the gun and shoot.    This is the story of a young American Ranger. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of those rare Hollywood movies I didn't have high expectations for but I ended up being pleasantly surprised.   I thought there would be an interesting story but that's not how it ended up.  What I was most surprised by was how well the acting was done by everyone.  I'm sure they were all a bit nervous when they got the script but they all did their jobs well.  They all have something to say but don't let that get in the way of the story.

Then I started noticing things like these:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of film noir, I am glad to see that they went back to the good old school of film detective work. In fact, there is a lot of good old movie noir ( The Maltese Falcon ), but this is something new. It is well done, and the detective is always well played by Peter Falk. It also has a good plot and good detective work, and it was interesting enough to stay with me through another movie noire film, and one in a series that is still making me feel sorry for the detective and his crew. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only good thing I have to say about this film is that I wish I could've seen more of it.   It has a lot to live up to, but it is a fun movie.  It's about a girl (and a guy) who have a secret love affair.  I wasn't sure how I was going to watch this because it's so weird to me, but the director seems to be playing around with different styles of music and the story is very easy to follow.  The plot is a bit too convoluted for my liking, but I'll keep watching and see how it goes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the title says, it is a short but very entertaining movie about two people who have been married for 15 years and just had a baby. Their marriage had been on a decline ever since their first daughter was born and the wife was always tired and depressed. So they made up the story that their daughter is born with a strange condition which she has not fully understood. After a lot of searching they finally find out what is wrong with her and find the right doctor who helps them solve the mystery of why she has been born with all the symptoms that would be a normal human birth.   I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies with a great plot that isn't so serious. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The premise is that an alien virus is sweeping the world. It turns people into zombies. I guess I'll just add that to my list of    Zombies  , along with   Alien   and   I,     that I am a zombie myself. It's just kind of funny that someone would make a movie about zombies.   A great cast of actors show up, such as   Johnny Depp   as the Zombie Pope,   Sean Penn   for his role as the scientist,  and   Jeff Goldblum as the local preacher.  They all have their moments, and the zombie aspects are well done.  You get a feeling that you've never seen anything like this before.  The acting is fantastic, and  I'm not sure why anyone would watch a movie like this, even though   it's a comedy.  It's so weird and off-kilter that it's hard to get caught up with what's happening on screen.  So much of the movie is just so funny.  A few other things worth mentioning are   an ending that I love     the opening of the film   a lot   how many of the zombies are very human looking   but then how some of them are zombie-looking  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw it, I thought it was the most amazing movie I had ever seen, with a good plot, a good story and a good character.   So the third time I watched it, the second time I was a little disappointed because the story did not move very much, but it was good to see that the author got all the facts right.  And yes, I've seen it a lot of times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few years ago, at a small independent movie house called La Chaux de Fonds, the French director Andrei Tarkovsky shot his first two films. I remember the other one quite well - a very beautiful and atmospheric film about the discovery of a cave in a snow-capped Alpine country by a group of explorers.   The two Tarkovskian films were made for about a million francs. Tarkvosky's characters are almost all in their 30's - almost all of them youngish - and his films are set against the background of a mountain environment in a winter where there is very little snow.  A great work of art, but it's about a decade before Tarkhovsky became interested in science fiction. His interest only grew after his encounter with the legendary Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein.  This is why Tarktovsky had such a tough time.  It's a shame that the Tarkowski films - although great in their own right - are so rare.  For more information about the director and his work, see my blog entry from August of 2010.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this one, you get to play an actual good guy.   He has his flaws, as many good guys do.  I had to ask one of his classmates to explain to me just how a real good guy could be so mean.  A lot of times, he will yell at someone or a cat, but he does not even realize what he is doing.  When he does make a mistake, he never apologizes for it.  This is a real great lesson in humility.  One of the coolest scenes involves the teacher asking the class to explain the meaning of the word.  That scene alone is worth the price of the movie.  It will make you feel good to see the teacher act so selflessly.  The best part about the movie is the fact that it has a good soundtrack.  I liked the music so much that I bought a few CDs of it. The last part of the film is a very cool sequence.  With the last sequence, we get to see some good action and some good acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A young and innocent love between a Jewish couple (Julia Roberts and James Spader) and a Muslim (Jasmine Guy) gets out of hand when their relationship takes a strange turn. It's like the beginning of a love triangle, where the three main characters play an interracial couple. A scene where James Spade (as a Muslim) tells the Jewish couple he'd marry them (because they're Jewish) is very touching and unexpected, and yet it doesn't give a clue how far they're going to go. The only thing I can compare it to is the movie The Producers, which is also based on a true story, so its pretty similar, and also contains a very good movie (The King of Comedy) that is a much better movie than this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always have a bad time with "the American dream" films, but I found this to be an enjoyable movie.   It begins with a few people who were born into poverty, and the rest are made to feel rich by their parents' success.  It's clear that the film makers have thought about the problem of the poor, and I'm not just talking about the bad behavior of the kids in the movie. The film makers address a lot of problems that affect poor children.  One, poor children will learn to have fun when they're young, which makes them more likely to engage in crime, because they know they will be able to get away with it.  They also learn that there is no life worth living other than the life that is given to them.  These are all good things, but they're all taken from a negative.  There is nothing about the movie that is about the kids who have nothing going for them. No hope.  I was not much interested in watching these people succeed in life, because the only thing they really have is their own determination, and most of them seem more interested in escaping from reality than in finding the happiness they seek.  But that's OK.  The movie doesn't pretend that the problems facing poor kids are all the kids have to deal with. They deal with a little bit of everything, which is pretty much how they deal with the problems of poor people everywhere.  This movie would make a good picture-book for schoolchildren, but not much else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was pretty good and I was a little tired of all the aliens going up and down the stairs as a means of getting a little high.   It was not too bad though, I didn't mind it too much, since it was pretty long.  I would recommend watching it at the same time as the other great horror movie The Blair Witch Project. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of a movie called A Star is Born before I watched it. I was very happy about that.   For a while it looked like a movie that would only appeal to young people. I had a few moments of interest but nothing that could be compared to a real film.  The movie has a couple of good scenes, some of which were better than the others.  After that the movie seemed to disappear.  I watched this film for the first time about ten years ago.  For some reason, in my opinion the movie never recovered its old glory.  This film has a wonderful theme about the problems a man has to go through to become a star.  A star is born from a little boy's love of a beautiful girl.  At that time it seemed to be a pretty good idea for the boy to marry his love.  There were a couple that I liked from the boy.  But the film just didn't seem to have anything to say anymore.  When I think about it, I don't understand why so many people liked it.  It was too simple.  Its main character was a guy who didn't think he was very special.  One time he went to a baseball game to meet his father.  Then his father took him out and they had a big argument.  If there was a more depressing ending, it would probably have been the ending.  My only criticism about this film is that there wasn't much to make it interesting.  Although there was an interesting theme, I can't see how it could have held up for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoyed the earlier versions of The Crow (2010) and are a fan of the original film (and the animated series that followed it), then you'll love this remake. It is a different kind of story but is still very entertaining. It features some familiar faces (like the woman with the strange face and the cannibal), but it is the addition of a new cast that makes this remake a more engaging film than any of the other versions, with many new and fresh characters that are all very likable. It can also be quite dark (the film is not at all lighthearted), but as a remake and not a re-imagining of the material, there are a few things in this film that work very well, like the way that all the characters interact with each other.   This remake is good in a very different way than the earlier film, but still a good comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I have never seen a movie where the only things to do were sit back and watch it (because that is the only thing to do on that set) and that's when the action happens.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an incredible movie!   Director David Lynch, known for being a total genius, makes us all fall in love with his character of Mr. Black.   He is such a sweet guy and his mother is the sweetest, most beautiful woman you will ever meet.  There is a bit of a sexual undertone in the movie but, when you get to know Black's mother, you will come to appreciate this.  I think she has a beautiful voice and when you listen to the song "Mrs. D" you can feel her voice as you're listening.  The film is dark and depressing.  But, when Black realizes what is going on in the world he decides to change the world.  This movie is an amazing way to watch a good film.  If you want to watch good movies and get away from the everyday life, this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a lot of fun.   The story is really funny.  A lot of people have already seen the movie on TV and thought it was just a normal family comedy. I think it is better than that.  This film is so much more than that and is so moving. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a beautiful movie with a beautiful girl who is beautiful on the outside but very dirty inside.    The story takes place in a small town and we are introduced to a young girl named Jessica (a wonderful actress who really shines in this movie).   While she is a quiet and innocent girl, Jessica has a very naughty side.  Jessica knows all the right places to get her rocks off and is quite comfortable with her sexuality.  This leads to an amazing love scene with a very handsome doctor named John.  The two have a lot of fun while we see them playing hide and seek and doing all kinds of naughty things.  It is pretty hard to talk about the story without going into too much detail, but the story is really something special.  Afterward, Jessica and her father have a big fight over their sex life.  I am sure many of you are tired of hearing the phrase "love scene" but you have to give this movie credit.  You can almost picture what this story would be like if it were about a married couple instead of a teen girl who goes out of her way to have sex with a doctor.  Even though there is a lot going on in this story, it never feels overblown.  My favorite thing about the film was how the two characters were brought together.  These two are always together so the story stays fresh and interesting.  Despite the love scenes in this film, the movie never takes itself too seriously.  There are a lot more interesting things going on than the love.  To be honest, this is not a very good movie but one that deserves a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The title of this film suggests that it is going to be about a girl's coming of age, and it is. There are a lot of elements to this movie that I am going to have to give a lot more credit to the director and to her collaborators in terms of a good script.   It is difficult to give too much credit to just a few of these people, but they do a great job, and so do the actors.  When I first read the script I thought that it was a very dark, dark film.  And it was very, very dark.  But then I saw it a second time and I think it is a beautiful film. It is an expression of both the teenage and the adult world in one film, and I am not really sure that you have seen a better film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The good:  There are more movies like this out there, but not one like this.   It shows that in this genre, if you can't act, you still have to have some pretty good acting skills.  They play the scenes perfectly, it's not just for the comedy and gags, the movie gets down to business and I never got tired of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of Japanese animation and had wanted to see a great anime ever since I was a child watching Miyazaki and Miyazaki-san at a very young age.

This is one of the best animated movies in recent years, and will probably stay in my collection for a long, long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The great thing about this movie is that it was made and released under the "American" flag. You could call it a patriotic masterpiece, it's that good. I found it to be an extremely realistic portrayal of the American dream.   Unfortunately, it has a rather unfortunate ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was good.   I had a feeling that the plot would go from good to bad quickly.  From the start it was obvious that the story would not be about a man who goes to work for a friend who has been shot. Instead the main character is a woman with a big mouth, a man named Larry and a man called the Director.  I was surprised by the way the Director let the character get away with things, like having her work for an old man who she knows will betray her.  After a short time her mother ( who is a real good actress) shows up and asks her to leave so that she can go back to the hospital to get a check up.  The plot gets more and more strange. It is hard to figure out who is the good guy, Larry or the Director and then after a bit of thinking the plot turns on a dime.  And then you have a strange ending.  It has a few moments of action but that is really all it has going for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say that I didn't enjoy this movie, it's probably my favorite movie of the year, I mean it has such an awesome, great movie, a movie which takes its time building up to a huge payoff and then it just lets you go, there's a lot of great action, there are great laughs in this movie and there is some fantastic drama and even some romance. I'm really glad I got to see this, it was truly one of the best movies I've seen this year.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is quite good, and it doesn't let you down in the slightest.   It doesn't really start as the story is told, which is not something a movie can do.  However, what it does is a bit of a mystery, which it does quite well.  While the story begins, the story doesn't start with the first person, but rather the second.  I wasn't really sure if I liked the first half, or if I'd love the second half, but the second part is definitely better, as it is more like a movie, with a bit more story.  So, while there is a few times when a lot of exposition will be given, it's not as many as it could have been.  The film is also pretty good at not going too far into the realms of being too ridiculous, and keeping the jokes down.  It has a very interesting premise about two boys (one of them is really, really cute) who both have a crush on a girl, one of the boys is older and has a big gun, the other one is younger and has an ugly face.  They live together and one of them has to wear a mask, because he has a really big gun and is constantly shooting at the boy he's in love with.  At the end of the film, when the two boys and the girl are reunited and they both get to return home (with their guns, which they now know how to use), they are able to talk about the things they did together.  There is one other thing that I really like about the movie; it's a good time.

The most memorable moment is when the cops are trying to arrest this crazy man who is out in the open with a little boy on a sled.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Bryan Cranston is a good actor. He's a great guy, a kind and gentle soul.   It's really cool that you can just watch him and get a feel for what he's about as an actor.  There's a nice blend of comedy, action and tragedy in Cranston's role as a very, very, handsome and very,very sad man who falls for a girl who's totally into a very strange, very bad movie.  He gets in over his head, loses his cool, falls in love with a girl...and falls into the hell of the movies.  I'll give this movie a 6.5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting a movie that would be just about as boring as I've been in years, and in many ways that's what we got.   There's an opening scene where a gang of drug dealers set up a table outside a bar and decide to have a little "chat" with the bartender (I like how the movie keeps using that generic name:  They start talking, and then something happens and they just stop talking.  That's not a very good way to start a movie, but that was the way it opened.  I liked the drug dealer who was there, and I liked how the rest of the movie focused on them as a group, but there were no interesting characters that I could identify with.  If it weren't for a brief cameo by the great David Cross, who was in the last two seasons of True Blood, then the movie would have been a slog. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always been a fan of the "Gone With the Wind" series and as a kid I loved that movie so much. I remember I went with my mother, my cousin, and my brother and I to the theater and it was pretty packed, which was a bit unnerving to be honest. The movie took place in the Civil War and while I was not really that interested in the war, I was fascinated by the way people died. I don't recall any of the main characters dying so that was not too big a deal.   The movie was not a very good one but it was still good enough to hold my interest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll start by saying that I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was or was supposed to be. I thought it was a good idea to make a film about the Holocaust. This movie doesn't have a great plot though. It's mostly there to explain why Nazis are evil and it does a decent job. However, it really could have been better. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The movie starts off with two kids, the one being a boy and the one a girl. They have a house together and live a normal life. But that is all they want. One day, the boy finds a magic book in the woods that teaches him to fly. He has this dream of flying high and is obsessed with it. One night, he sees a light that goes out. He starts trying to fly, but soon realizes he has no idea how to do so. He tries to use a rope to help him. Eventually, the rope becomes too small and too thick for his small body to fit through, and then he loses control of his body. He then meets a dragon and takes him on a journey that leads to the book. This is a story about how people try to fly and how they fail.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of old west films like The Magnificent Seven, The Great Train Robbery, The Wild Bunch   And I don't think you can tell from this review that I am not.   After seeing this I can't imagine not seeing the old west again!   A lot of the time, I've been told, a movie like this is just a glorified ride, with a small handful of interesting stories.  This movie is a complete story with no filler.  The dialogue between the different characters is a little cheesy, but I can imagine how it must have been when the actors were struggling to make a few lines.  Some of the actors are really good.  There are a couple of scenes that are absolutely amazing.  If you haven't seen this movie, watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's a shame that I was never able to enjoy the good bits of this film as much as the bad.   The first half of the film was excellent.  The story is very simple, but then the story becomes very complicated.  It involves a few young people who decide to build a big fire and burn the place down to build their own little city of wood.  They are joined by some local women who think this will be a beautiful city to live in and then they are joined again by a couple of other people who are convinced that all this wood will get them rich and famous.  Eventually some real problems arise which the film doesn't quite solve and so the people are given a bit of rope and a stick and they go off looking for a more suitable place to put it and find a fire to burn it.  Unfortunately, the only suitable place is some old abandoned house which has been abandoned for a long time, which is quite depressing.  Once the house is on fire they try to sort out what went wrong, and then there is the part that is so bad that the film has to be rated a two rather than a five:  There are a few scenes that are just utterly awful.  There is a bit where a group of men walk into a house and are instantly attacked by some very angry old women.  But it is the final part of the story that I wish they hadn't included.  After a good bit of searching, they find a little tree with a tiny tiny cot in it, and they lay down and sleep.  When they wake up they realise that they are in a huge jungle with a lot of hungry lions who are attacking them.  This part was totally unsatisfying, but in a film where a lot is going on it doesn't seem to really matter.  I will give the whole thing an 8, but the best parts are a bit tarnished by a rather poor ending and a rather sad ending."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, a certain alien species had one hell of a party.   They wore ridiculous costumes and had a variety of crazy music.  To top it off, they had a huge party that they called a "dancing night".   Of course, we couldn't be there, but we sure heard about it!   Now, this movie is based off the same basic idea, but there's some great things going on in this one as well.  They have a little alien race who are trying to make a place for themselves in the universe.  I've always been interested in these kinds of things.  If the movie was less boring and had more action, it could have been awesome.  However, this is a very long movie, and it only really starts to get interesting when the alien aliens show up and start throwing parties.  It's a little slow at the beginning, and a little boring, but it's a good kind of boring, and this one really shows that.    In a very good way.  This is one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a shame that people who didn't have a clue about the movie don't see it and just think it's a stupid, boring, low budget rip off of Rocky III.   And then they come to this review.   I would like to point out that it is not a Rocky rip off, and I don't know why it's being called a Rocky II rip off.  The characters aren't the same at all and they're not even really in the same movie.  This is what Rocky's mother called it.  It was a movie that I thought was terrible, because I'd never seen anything like it and I just couldn't see how anyone could be proud of it. The only thing that stuck out in my mind was a lot of the "sport-style" stunts they did in the movie, such as the guy who used to be a basketball player and then ended up fighting and kicking people.  I didn't see that in Rocky, and that's just a bad idea.  However, I found it to be pretty good.  In a way, Rocky and his friend were really like real-life athletes and a lot more so than anyone else in the film.  Rocky, his friend, and the gang all were just a bunch of goofballs in a stupid sport movie. But then again, who didn' t?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The great thing about these movies is that they are so fast. In the first hour of the movie, there are some really good ideas and characters. In "Saving Christmas," a couple of people go to a town and pretend to be Christmas ornaments for two days. They are discovered by the townspeople and get arrested, because they are dressed as real Christmas ornamentals. In a movie like this one, there is so much going on that it is easy to lose track of who's who.   At one point the couple has been taken in by the police and are talking to the chief. The chief, a woman, is talking with a man and it seems like the man is in charge.  I also thought a lot about the movie and the characters. They have great ideas and there are a lot of good parts to the movie. I thought it would be fun to watch these two people go into a town dressed as Christmas orngamentals and see what would happen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's kind of hard to write a good review about this movie.   What this movie lacks in acting chops, it makes up for in charm, atmosphere, and an unerringly creepy atmosphere that makes you wonder, just who is responsible for this?   There's also this other strange guy in the beginning of the movie who can talk, talk, and talk some more, and his motives are really mysterious.  And then there's this one-legged weirdo who is a bit of a nuisance, but not in the worst way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an ex-military. It's just a fact. So when I found myself back in the U.S.A. last week for a brief vacation I thought I'd check out "War of the Worlds" the movie that was a huge hit at the time of its release in the fall of 1931. It was based on a book by H.G. Wells (of "War and Peace" fame), and the story of the "Martians" was more than a little reminiscent of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-9. The Martians were a species of alien life form that had invaded the Earth in a flying saucer (in reality a giant rocket plane that looked like a flying sausage), and had started to destroy the cities of the U-S. The movie's plot was based around the rescue of a crew of astronauts who were stranded on a desert planet by an alien vessel known as "the Flying Saucer", with the help of two of the most popular actors in Hollywood at the day, James Stewart and Montgomery Clift (a future famous actor), played by Robert Mitchum and Jean Harlow, respectively. The most interesting aspect of the film was the "battle of New York", which had the cities under the control of the Martian forces (in order to stop the destruction of New Jersey). I found the movie extremely entertaining, and had the chance to see it again on TV several years ago. It has aged quite well. I especially enjoyed Stewart's part, but it was mainly Harlow's turn, with Stewart playing his part. It is a shame that the movie didn't sell well on its initial release because, as a sci-fi movie, it was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My only problem with this movie is that the story is so terrible. It starts off with a girl named "Molly" being dragged to the dentist's office where she meets a man named Jack who has a beautiful, almost "nude" smile. After a few drinks he is taken to a motel where he takes a very strong medicine and seems to have a nervous breakdown. After that we meet her best friend (who I will call "Slim" as that's her name) who has the most annoying voice I have ever heard and tells Molly to call her daddy. We all know what happens next: Molly gets a flat tire and Slim tells Jack that she can make him a nice, big, black penis! That's right folks, this film is filled with bad ideas and terrible actors (who are trying to act like they are not terrible).   (2/5)   This is one of those movies that I was expecting to be awful, but I was actually surprised.   I didn't give it a very good rating because I expected the story to be so bad. I don't know what it was about the script, but it didn't have any emotion to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An unusual movie about a woman that gets raped at gunpoint, she then finds out that a man she doesn't know, who is going to be with another woman in a motel room, is there with a group of other men and another woman that was raped as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie.   It's a really funny movie with a really good story, and I think it could be the funniest movie to come out of the 80s.  The story is told by Mr. Paddy, a very funny man who has a weird, eccentric, and peculiar view of the world.  He goes to an old building to get a coffee.  On his way he is attacked by a man who is carrying an egg and, in a very odd way, he is saved by it.  And then he has to find a way to keep his balance as the egg hits him on his face.  Eventually he does manage to stay upright and he ends up in a cave with other strange, odd and eccentric people.  What the movie has going for it is a lot of jokes, a good character development, and a funny story.  All in all this is one of the funnier comedies to come from the 80's and it's great to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a big fan of John Wayne, or just like classic American cinema, you will love this movie!   This movie is one of the best I have ever seen, the acting is great and the direction is also really well done.   The movie is about a young man, who travels to San Antonio and goes on the job. The story of the movie is that he is hired as a cowboy and then goes to San Jose and then has to stay in San Antonio.      As this is the movie John Wayne did, it is filled with a lot of cowboy pictures, but the movie also tells the story of a true American hero, John Wayne.   The movie is great, it will definitely be on my must watch list when I have the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to see this movie after seeing the trailer.   This movie is a beautiful and disturbing story.  This is not a romantic comedy at all.  It is very dark and twisted.  There are some beautiful moments and also some disturbing moments.  A movie is not always beautiful or disturbing.  I'm happy that the makers of this film were able to find a way to make it funny without making the movie completely crazy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I am surprised this one has gotten an R rating.   It is not a great film, but it has some great moments.  The acting is very good.  A nice surprise is that the story is not really about a single man who is trying to escape from an abusive relationship.  There is a lot going on that is going to make you think about the human condition.  This is one of those films where you don't think about what is happening, but you can't help but think about it.  If you like films like this, you will probably like "It's a Wonderful Life."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (A)   (A) The plot of this film is simple. In a rural town in New England in the early 1900's, two young women, both of whom have been through hell and back, are separated and are taken in by a widower who is married to an abusive woman. These women were the wives of a murdered man, one of whom was raped and murdered before her eyes. The movie is set in the house where the woman who was raped by the man has lived. It was her house that the murdered man was murdered in. The house is a place where the dead man's wife was held prisoner when the murderer, her husband, came home.   The film has a simple story, and not one that is complex. It is not a very good story because it is all about the murders that took place there.  It does not give any real weight to any of the murders, and the movie is mostly about the murderer and his wife.  The wife in this film, played by Anne Baxter, is not particularly interesting.  Her hair is too long, and her breasts are too small for a woman with large breasts, although the movie could have used an actress with larger breasts. The other woman, played wonderfully by Joan O'Brien, is a much better character than Baxter.  This woman is a woman who is not quite the equal of the murderer's wife. The murderer's daughter is played very well by a young lady named Lizzie Williams.  The woman with whom the murderer is separated is a kind of evil spirit that is not much of a woman. The film is a pretty straightforward horror movie. It does not make a lot of use of effects, and it does not show the results of any of its violence.  As I said, the movie was simple. It has a very simple plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of the horror genre, you will probably enjoy this.

He and his friends must fight back the spirits in this terrifying movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a young adult, I had my eye on the James Bond films for years. I wanted to know what made him tick; I wanted the secret of his success. This film takes the whole thing and spins it into a wonderful ride. The film is well put together; not one frame looks like it could have been rushed. The direction is great; very smooth and fluid. The actors are great; they each have a unique character. There are several moments of the film that just blew me away, and that's a good thing.   This was a nice change of pace from the other James Bond movies; this film was very enjoyable, and I am glad I caught it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main character is a typical teenager - arrogant and full of bravado. One day he encounters a man who tells him a shocking story about the life and death of the last Roman emperor. The story begins with a boy who is attacked by a wild lion on a mountain path. He tells the boy the story over and over again until the lion goes away. This is the first movie by a famous director that deals with the supernatural.   After watching this I wondered if the boy has ever heard the story before, especially the ending. The final fight scene, which is not shown in the movie, is very intense. I thought I'd seen everything but I was wrong!   A good movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching this on an old television with the old timey music and black and white imagery. It is kind of hard to describe, but I can sum it up as a classic spaghetti western starring Gene Hackman, Robert Mitchum, and some other famous actors. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that it had such a short life, only running for about three years.   It's a fairly long movie, but that doesn't bother me. This is a great movie, not one of my favorites but a favorite nonetheless.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.   The movie focuses on the lives of the friends that make up a band of musicians that meet during a weekend of camping in the mountains in California.  The main cast is made up of two kids who play guitar together, and the lead guitar player is a 14 year old girl that has to learn to be a real musician.  When they first arrive at the camp, they are a little scared to see the strange creatures that are there.  However, after spending a night and day together, the kids are able to begin playing music with their new friends.  It is interesting to watch as these friends begin to discover and learn about each other.  All of the music is very good, and it makes you think about all the different things that the band members do.  I recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who like to think outside the box and try to find something new. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After several years of watching "Twelve Monkeys" at my parents', this new film is so different from anything I had ever seen. It seems like every film in this series is a different breed.   I love movies that take on the theme of a drug-filled, degenerate culture and make it seem like it is a world apart from the real world.  The film also takes on the themes of addiction, violence, and mental illness, which is something I always liked about the stories that were told in these films.  After watching "Dirty Harry" back in the early 90s I really wanted to see a sequel to the movie about an FBI agent who takes on mobsters and corrupt cops.  I have to say I was disappointed by the fact that the director of this film did not seem to care about the original film and completely changed it.  This was not my favorite movie but I do wish it was more like the original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The film "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1957) is based on Sergio Leone's 1931 Italian western "The Searchers."   The Good, as Leone has called it, has all the hallmarks of a great Sergio Leone western.   The story is good, the characters are well drawn, and the pace is superb.  The movie's first half is a little confusing.  In the film's first few minutes, we are treated to a chase scene.  It takes place in the town of Goodyear, Arizona (a.k.a. Arizona  and the state it is in, the   Western  of the United States).  At the end of the chase we cut to the next scene:  The Good is the home of a wealthy widow named Elsie, who is very attached to her guns.  She has several.  We have not seen Elsie fire any of her guns during the film.  But there is no shortage of them.  Elsie's guns include a.30 caliber Smith & Wesson Model 1911 which she uses for target practice.  When she is not shooting, Elsie keeps a loaded.38 caliber revolver on a shelf in her bedroom, and she uses it to scare the hell out of her husband when he comes home late from work.    Elsie has been the widow of an alcoholic, philandering husband for at least 10 years.  After her husband dies, Elsiessie comes to hate him, hates herself, and hates the town in which she has lived for 15 years.   While in jail on a charge of murder, Elsies husband takes a job as a deputy sheriff.  He lives in a house in the middle of nowhere, has no friends, and is totally useless.   The story begins with Elsie in jail, awaiting trial for a murder she did not commit.    It is the summer of 1931 and the Arizona  Western  is the hottest movie of the year.  One of the people in town is a sheriff named John Dillinger, who does not know it but he is the target of an assassination plot.   Elsie goes to jail after being found guilty.  Her attorney argues on her behalf, arguing that she is a widow with two children to support, and therefore should not spend her time and money in prison.  His argument is rejected by the court.   It was in
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good comedy movie from the 60's, with the usual cast of characters. A few good laughs, and good acting from all the actors, especially with George Seaton.   The movie stars George Seldon (Mr. Moxon in "Soup Nazi" and Mr. Macaulay in "Hollywood") and includes:  Seldon - a man who has never been in love.  Seidon - a young man who always wanted to be Seldon's partner in his own business.  Macaulays - a very funny young man with a very good singing voice.  Roxanne - an excellent actress who gets to be the "bad guy" in the movie.      This is really a good example of how to make a comedy movie, including good acting and good laughs. It is a little short, but a good one and worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, it's worth mentioning that this movie is very good. It's about a man named Jeff Winger (played by Paul Giamatti) who has a problem - he's been diagnosed with cancer, but doesn't have any money, and his girlfriend (played, naturally, by Eva Mendes) doesn't like him because he's so nice, and it's kind of a tragedy. So he gets a job at a supermarket in a small town. He gets the job because of some old-school American decency, and he works hard. The movie is a very good comedy, and the way it's shot is very well-done. The humor is very subtle, but there's enough here to keep you watching.   In the end, this movie shows how America can be good even when it has cancer, and how good you can be when you're good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most memorable scenes in my life was when a group of children, most of them wearing masks, were marching to school and they would yell and dance to the beat of a particular song. It was like seeing the Muppets in a circus.   (From a review by Jeff K)   There are a few "B" movies in the mid-1960s that I'd like to revisit. The most memorable is of course the film version. It is as old school as the term "G.I. Jane" is a bad word today. This is a classic and very entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I did a lot of research on this movie, the only one that I saw was "Halloween, Part 2", which was pretty good too, it's just an unoriginal movie, it has a bad plot but I like all of them, except the last 2:55 is stupid and ridiculous, a movie that is so bad that I can't even begin to give an objective review, the story is bad, you think this movie is about a ghost hunting and that's the real plot.   But then they start to do this thing with a "womans body" and the ghost "hears her screams", and the only thing you can hear is the woman saying "Don't scream, you're a bad girl, I'm a good girl", and that was stupid and so, so stupid.  And then the movie goes into some kind of movie-trailer, but I can hardly tell what's wrong with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little more than three years ago I was at my parents' house in New Jersey and I stumbled upon a trailer for an Australian movie called Crows. It had a really simple premise: a young couple travels from Australia to South Africa to raise a child, and their adventures are as fun as you would expect from a movie about a couple raising a child. The actors are all quite good, they're well-acted and really seem to get along as a family, and the story is engaging and well-done.   And then...the ending.  I was stunned.  It was so sudden and unexpected that my jaw dropped open.  The film was so well-written and acted that it didn't seem to make sense.  Crows was simply too perfect, too wonderful, to be taken that way.  There was no other conclusion to this story that felt like it could be a part of Crows: it was one long and well thought-out adventure.  So...what can we make of this?   Well, it seems that there is a connection between Crows and the film that I'm sure the producers of Cawdor would like to deny.  That is to say, Cawders' movie is also about raising a kid.  And we get that from the opening: "I am trying to raise my son, a man named Cawdam."  This leads to a story about how a man wants to be a father.  But the man is actually a witch who wants to raise her son to believe in magic and all things mythical, and she's not sure how to do that so she seeks advice from her dead boyfriend, who is a ghost.  This is all very strange...what does it mean?  I don't have the answers yet, but I'd like to think it's about the father's mental health.  He's not doing his best.  To be fair, the film does have an ending: we see Cawdon's dead dad standing up from the ground, and there is an image of him with a sword.  In a weird way, this ending makes sense because the "real" Cawden is just as dead as the spirit, so that there can be a connection at least between his son and Cawdu, just as his "real life" was just as real as Cawdin's.  Of course, Caws is the boy's father, and

Director David Fincher is famous for his dark, brooding work, so you can imagine how happy I was when I heard he was making a movie about a man who's got nothing but a pile of old junk and no real idea what to do with it.  I was surprised at the very end to realize it was a film about an old man who finds a way to get rid of his garbage by putting a sign in it. No joke.  Finchey is great at making people feel like they're living a fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is based on a book, but the story is so well written that it could have been made into a feature-length film. In short, the story begins with a scientist who, upon his death, discovers that he was born with an extraordinary skill that allows him to alter the course of time. From the beginning, the movie presents a unique and compelling blend of science and mystery. The film takes a hard look at a science that can't be explained, but one that still holds answers.   ~

He has a girlfriend, a woman he likes, and a dog.  The movie is a bit slow and doesn't really take us anywhere, but it does show how the artists life is like.  Some people have said this is similar to 'Titanic', but it is not.  There is not the same excitement as 'Tron' and 'Troy', but the people are not a bit dull either.  A good movie and one I will recommend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After having watched a lot of bad science-fiction movies, I think I will have to go back to the good ones.   The science-fi elements were done well.  First off, a very simple story.  I don't really know what's going on. It seems to be the sort of thing you can tell by looking at the title: A scientist discovers a "spooky" object in the woods and goes there alone.  In this film, however, the scientists have all vanished, leaving only the two scientists with the mysterious object.  After a few days, the object is found. There is a little girl and her father who live near the spot where the object was found.  We do not know what is going on at all. It may or may not be an alien spaceship. Maybe the object just is not very important and people are just taking a stroll.  The alien spaceship is not found, but in the meantime, the girl and the father are on their way to a small town.  This film is good in many ways. The science is done in a good way and, even though it is very simple, it is made to be interesting.  It seems that the scientists in this film are a very important element in the story and they disappear very quickly. It's as if they are not there at all or are just very slow.  All in all, a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was an important movie in my life. It is one of those movies that I can't forget watching in order to remember it. It has something for everyone. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's a great character study and a fantastic director.   Casting:     While I am usually a little disappointed when I see such terrible casting choices (I'm looking at you, Billy Crystal, who seems to be in a lot of bad movies lately), in this movie I actually found some very good people to play the role of Mr. R, Mr. D, and Mr. T. I mean, they are not the worst roles, but they are all in bad movies.  Overall:       This is a great, fun film to watch. It would be a fun watch, but not to the extent that you would think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a fun and entertaining movie!   When I saw this movie I was expecting a lot of violence. What I got was a story about the little girl that dreams of becoming a doctor but is stuck in a very hard life. The only part I don't like is when the girl starts talking to an old lady (I think she is her mother) and the old lady gets really angry and tells the girl to go to her room and stay there. But the girl refuses. But I would love to see a movie with more violence!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by the film's overall quality. It is a good horror film with great special effects and a strong story. The special effects are excellent, the acting is top notch, and the suspense is fantastic. The story is great as well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movies that's hard to watch.    It's hard not to be amused by the actors who play these silly characters.  They don't just play dumb.  The comedy is just silly enough to be amusing.  And the plot is just ridiculous.  It was definitely worth the effort.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, with a story that starts out being an introduction to the whole affair, but then it becomes a story about what happens when you put some people in a room to discuss matters that are far too important for any one to handle them alone.   It is also a good story about people doing some things that are not done by some people.

There's a great little song by The Police in the background that makes the scene of the young kids fighting against the big scary man feel even more real and scary.

However, I must say it is a good one and it really shows how bad the "drugs" of the movie are.  It was a good comedy which i enjoyed but it has a few things that i felt was really bad.  There was a few scenes i found very offensive.  I found that i really liked how it was done.  And the ending was very good.

What can I say it is great   Don't miss it   "One of the biggest mistakes a person can make is to not see the truth. To not take the time to understand that every moment we spend with these characters is valuable, that the good times are as important as the bad, that a life of luxury is not all it's cracked up to be."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of the movie starts with a bunch of guys getting thrown into the back of a van by a local gang and driven to a lake. It's raining so the guys are soaking wet when they arrive on the lake. The other gang members are all naked and one of the guys is having a hard time holding the other guy's legs down so the other gang member can get a good fuck from him. At one point the other man starts yelling "this is the best way to get a nice dick into a pretty girl". The other guy starts yelling back, "you've never fucked a girl like me" and this leads to a little verbal fight about who's the better looking man. Eventually the group takes off in the truck and as they do a kid runs out and asks if he can stay in the van for a little while. The guys laugh and say they'll take him in when they get to the lake but the kid asks to stay in since he's in bad shape. The group then get back into the truck but it takes them about 5 minutes to get to a place where they can see some water. They all get in but before they can do any real driving the other guys pull up in a car. The men all turn around and all start yelling at the kids. The kid starts screaming in fear and runs away screaming. The gang then laugh at the kid and say "now we can get some fun". The first guy then proceeds to hit the kid in the head and pull the kid into the trunk of the car. When they get into the car a gang member gets out and a guy who looks like a priest comes over to talk to the kids and makes them take off their clothes. The priest says that he's going to go back inside for a second and when he comes back he'll give the kids a nice blow job. He then pulls out his dick and starts playing with it. The kids start screaming in terror and when the priest stops playing with his dick a girl then starts crying in fear because her boyfriend is in the trunk with her. The next scene is a quick flash back and we see a kid in his car with a big grin on his face and he's getting ready to get home. The camera then moves into a shot of the kid's car and all of the windows are down. He's driving and looking at the car in his rearview mirror. Suddenly a guy jumps out of the truck in front of him and starts screaming at
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have only seen one other movie based on the book,  ,   in which the director Michael Mann tries to imitate the action of   the movie, but does not achieve it.   In this movie   a young woman, who is so pretty, is taken away from her people. She is taken to an island called "Alcatraz".   She falls in love with the chief, a man who is not her lover, but her friend.  After a couple of months, her lover is killed, and she is released from prison.  It is all very simple.  This movie  is worth seeing because of its plot, which is very simple, and because the girl is such a beautiful girl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never seen a film where the main character was more likable than in this movie.   In a movie about two friends who are in love, the two are in a car and one of the friends is talking about the love he sees in the other.  One of the things that's most likable about the movie is that it shows a friendship based on love.  It doesn't get much better than this.  There's a scene where one of their friends asks for a cigarette and one says "you're the kind of friend I can have for a long time."   The movie isn't very interesting.  This is a movie that doesn't want to be a movie. It wants to be about two good friends who care about each other very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie that is not all about the monsters. The monsters here are actually interesting. The movie follows a group of survivors, who decide to try to escape a zombie apocalypse. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned.   The movie starts off slow, with the survivors trying to take down a zombie by themselves. This is a little odd, but it does give you some motivation for when things go wrong.  It also helps that the zombies are pretty darn cute, and you can enjoy watching the characters try to take them down without thinking about how silly it is.  They start out in a good spot, but as the movie goes on, things start getting really bad.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it gives you a reason to come back to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so scared to watch this movie.   For a movie about ghosts and creepy people it was eerie and creepy and chilling.  I really thought it was a horror film until it was over and I thought to myself, "Oh that's not scary, that's a horror movie."   The reason why I thought this was a supernatural film was that it looked like it was made by someone who had nightmares for a living.  This is one of those creepy movies that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.

The story revolves around a couple who decide to go to Vegas to stay in the same hotel.  Unfortunately, the hotel they're staying in isn't a good hotel. The staff is all bad and the guests aren't very nice people.  This film is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, first things first, this movie is not about a "war". It's not even a war that we can imagine happening in the future. It's a war we can feel happening. It happened in Iraq and it's happening right now. But it's about something much, much worse. I mean, look at the movie. There's a man on a bicycle, on the verge of a horrific attack, when suddenly a helicopter flies over him and blows the bike to bits. A kid walks up to the man and says: "We have to stop this war". And the man nods and says something that can be taken as a statement about why they're doing it. A minute later a helicopter lands nearby, takes out several guards and a few soldiers, then flies off again.   This film is about the horror of war. It isn't about what you might see on a war movie, or a movie about Vietnam. It is about real life. The story is about a young soldier named John, who was in the Iraq war in 2003 when the war escalated. He had just turned twenty and was in his second year of military service when the US attacked Iraq. He's a good soldier, who knows the difference between right and wrong, and knows how to use his gun, and what he can do with it. He was just about to retire when the order came down that the war should be escalated to a full-blown war. He doesn't like to kill, he has a high threshold, but he's a guy who doesn't need to kill to kill. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting some bad   to come with this movie because of what I said in the previous paragraph, but it didn't disappoint.   And I was not disappointed at all.     The film starts off with a man, an ex-CIA agent, going to a conference about an "ancient Egyptian artifact" he found.  After he was there for a while, he finds an old man that looks just like the "archaeologist" that he found there.  He is asked to do a job for him.  But the old man tells him it is not for him,   because he had no time.  So he asks the old "anarchist" what he should do.  The old "archarchaeology" is very interested about it,  but is he interested?   When the old archaeological" is asked for the artifacts.  It asks for a lot of money from him. He refuses, but tells it that he wants to pay the "anonymous" for his services.  And as soon as the "antiquarian" has finished asking for a ransom,  it takes him to the next place, where a woman is being used to lure young girls for prostitution.  However, it turns out she is not a prostitute, but a woman who was kidnapped from Egypt.  At the end of this movie, I didn't know if he had to kill her or not.  I think he would have had to, but there is a lot to love in this movie.  If you like horror,  science fiction, thriller and thrillers,  don't miss this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. This is a really solid story with great characters. The characters are all likable. Everyone gets some sort of a lesson from their experiences. I found the ending to be very moving. It's one of those movies where you don't know what to think until after you finish it.   It's a solid film which is a bit disturbing at times but I can't help but to love it.

It is not the case, it is a big mistake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know what to expect when I first saw the title of this movie. This is the first time a movie has ever scared me so bad.   It was like my stomach was trying to puke.  To give you an idea of how bad this movie was: It was as if the movie had never been made.  It didn't follow a consistent plotline.  One time they were on a mission to steal a map.  Then another time they came up with a crazy plan to sneak in and steal the entire base.  I never got a good sense of what they were thinking during the mission.  In the end they had the entire building to themselves.  But how did they get the map from the base?  What the heck was they thinking?   The acting was atrocious.  The dialogue was cliche.  They got into an airplane that looked like it had been in a tornado.  This movie was a nightmare.  So when a movie this bad is made, I take a long hard look at the person directing the movie.  If this guy hadn't directed this movie, I don't think it would have gotten made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said in the beginning,   I really don't think this is a good   movie.   The story is great,  but   the direction, cinematography, and acting are bad.  At least   they aren't bad enough to make the movie bad, they are only bad. There are no  bad actors  , no bad effects, and nothing about   it   is anything   to write home about.  The only positive thing that comes out of this movie is the writing,  and it is not a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story revolves around two friends from the United Kingdom. One is a student, the other a businessman.   There are many similarities between them. They are both born in the same hospital, with the same parents, the same father who's also a lawyer.  The two of them are both talented artists. They meet at a party where they are introduced to an eccentric woman named Sylvia.  The two of 'em have a falling out.  Sylvia's brother, a famous artist, is killed in a car accident.  With his own art in the ground, Sylvia is reduced to painting only children's pictures and has to put her talents to work in order to make a living.  When the two of'em fall in love, they don't want to lose their job, so they decide to join a famous painting group.  These two aren't good friends.  This is a movie that's about the two men's friendship and their quest to improve their lives and make a new start in life.  The story is about two friends that are both artist, but one of'em are more talented.

The camp is run by a group of witches who want to start a new life under the sea. When the boy is found stuck in the tree by a man who lives by a house, the family decides to take him in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A young, beautiful, and talented American girl (Sara Jane) is about to become an accomplished actress.   But she needs the help of a famous, wealthy, and influential man (Hugh Grant) to achieve her goal.  While the girl's father is busy with his day job, the young actress is taken under the wing of the famous British actor.  But will the relationship end in love, or will this be a short-lived romance?    The plot is a simple yet brilliant one.  The film is fast-paced, and has a fantastic script.  What makes the film memorable is how it is written, as it does not feel out of place.  When you're watching this film, you can't help but be enthralled by the actresses' beautiful dancing, and you'll be cheering as the girl is saved from an awful fate.  It will be a while before I watch this film again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just found out about this film in the morning and was like "wow this is really good". It really is.   As a former fan of The Sopranos (and a former user of heroin) it was cool seeing this show go back to the good old days. I was very surprised to learn that the original cast was not in the cast list (even though they did have a supporting role) and this is why it's a good film. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't like this film, especially my wife who loves the music and has been singing along.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am always fascinated by the stories of people who have made it through life to the point of being able to make a living off of their creativity. I don't know what it is about it but in some of these films you are given the impression that the actors are just playing to their roles.   The acting is a little sloppy at times but you have to appreciate the fact that they are not trying to do something that the film would not allow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest flaw in this movie is the acting. It is so terrible that it is nearly impossible to take seriously.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest criticism I can imagine about a movie like this one is that its just a bit too long, maybe two hours and a half, and a bit lacking in any sense of urgency at all. But this is a film that does a lot right. It is a good thriller. It has a nice blend of suspense, mystery, drama, and suspense. The story begins with some nice dialogue that establishes the basic concept of the film in a succinct manner. This could have been a one-off short film, but instead it was expanded into a two-hour and a two hour and a short film. This is a great example of what can be done with a combination of story and special effects that are impressive for the time.    After a brief introduction, we get to a bit of a scene where a woman in her twenties is abducted by two very strange men. She is taken to a remote location (not sure which) where she discovers some sort of bizarre machine which has been set up around her. There is more strange activity to follow. The film's focus is on the woman. The rest of the story takes place over the course of a few days, but the story is about what happens to the people who encounter the woman and the events in her neighborhood. The people who are part of this mystery group seem to be very capable and resourceful. They have a plan, and they work hard at it. The only thing that is a bit off about the film is that the people of the neighborhood seem to have more to do than they are able to do.  I can imagine people who have never seen a short thriller like this being a bit surprised, but I find this film very entertaining. I am not one to praise anything I haven't seen a million times before.

I am not a huge fan of books about vampires, but a good book is good enough for me to forget about the book.

The story is excellent, both the beginning and the end, especially the ending. It has a very good cast, but for me it is the character who is the most interesting. I really want to see a sequel. I am not the biggest Harry Potter fan, but I feel I may just have to go back and watch the entire series again, just to see what the writers can do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic: an all time classic.   The film starts with an image of the world's most wanted criminal in a prison in England, staring at his cell and wondering whether the real thing is a little too good. It's the late 1940s and the world is in the throes of World War 2. The police in England are trying to put the Nazi War criminal in the gallows, but the French are also after him, and so he's running free and the German Nazis are after him too. So he's holed up in a building in an English village and has a little dog, his wife, and his son. In the midst of a tense, very entertaining chase the dog finds a note from his mother saying he's going home for a few days. The German Nazis have the boy under surveillance and are planning to put him on trial. But the boy has other plans and escapes. The film ends with a brief scene of the boy (played by Richard Burton) riding his bicycle home with his dog and some flowers. And then it cuts to a new scene of Richard Burton with a new dog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has the same feel and atmosphere as 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' (and if you haven't seen that I recommend you to do so - just go and watch that - it's amazing), but the main difference is the lack of the huge and grotesque kombat style that is so prevalent in the other two. It's pretty funny actually, there's some really hilarious moments where we find out what the real meaning of the word 'Wicked' actually means, and I can't say that I have watched enough kung fu movies to actually appreciate the art style, it's really strange to see that someone could actually draw the actual blood.

This film has a great storyline that never gets too complex but keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what happens.  In addition to the fun action the film has the characters that all get a good laugh out of it and the overall plot is a lot of fun.  There is no shortage of action in this film but it has a decent pace for its length and it is well worth a watch.

You get a good scare at the beginning with a very well done ghost. The movie also is about the relationship between a woman and a man. The woman is very attractive and the guy is very mysterious and doesn't show any emotion, and is only there for his job to collect the money. I hope they give another one soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised that this movie is really a good one. In fact, it is so good that it may have changed my entire perception about martial arts movies.   This is a classic film from the early 70's and it is certainly not afraid to show the harsh realities of real life.  The film is a masterpiece of film noir. The main character is a boxer named "The Ghost of Chinatown" (aka Eddie Murphy) who has lost his wife and child to cancer. Eddie is a good man, but he has had too much too long and he now decides to retire.  He is forced to stay on to help his daughter (who is also suffering from cancer), and he does.  Eddie uses his old boxing gloves that he has found and he goes to work.  It is also interesting that the film does not end there. It is the beginning of a new storyline and Eddie must help the local Chinatown with its problems.  I found this movie to be extremely entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a real treat, with an awesome story and great acting, great music and great effects.   I love the characters, the acting is awesome, and the story is fun and entertaining.  There are a lot of laughs here, and even more of a good time, so it's a good one for the whole family.  The characters are interesting, and very well portrayed, and I like how they are always getting into some trouble and trying to get out of it, always getting back on their feet.  One of the best things about this movie is that it's only 90 minutes, which is a short enough time to do the job, and yet still manages to stay interesting and entertaining for all of its length.  It's funny, but also tragic, and filled with suspense and action, and it'll keep you wanting more.  This is one of the most fun and enjoyable movie I've seen in a long time, and will likely be the one I watch next.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you think of the great westerns of the late-20th century, none are quite as good as "Trouble in Paradise," or even "The Wild Bunch," the earlier of which is pretty much a modern classic, even though it was made by a different director (John Ford). "Temptation" is a new classic: a very, very good old-fashioned western.   "Tranquility Park" is another fine western: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all good things, there were a couple flaws to be found:  the movie is in 3 acts.   In the first act, the movie does not really develop anything.  In my opinion, there is not much to say about the movie.  The second act, however, is the most action packed and exciting part of the movie  In this second act we have two protagonists who want to kill each other.  It is not a good story.  I am not really a fan of this type of movie, but I am a fan that enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that it was about as good as a horror movie could be.   This movie is really well done, and it's scary and funny at the same time.  The film begins with the protagonist being chased by a woman wearing nothing but a white robe who is being chased down by a bunch of children who want to play a game.  Then a helicopter flies by and a car is seen driving around.  It's an action-adventure movie in a nutshell and you should be scared if you like action- adventure movies.  At one point the helicopter is going to crash and everyone in the film is in danger.  But the man in the helicopter manages to get back in the chopper and they fly away.  I loved this film because it was really well acted and made me want to run out to my TV and watch it.  You'd be surprised to learn that this movie is based on a short story by Robert Bloch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd say that I like this movie a lot. It has a bit of mystery to it. It's kind of a classic mystery, where the victim is a nice guy and he's a nice enough guy, but you're just wondering what happened. It really was a lot like a movie like Jaws, only in reverse.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very impressed by this movie and will definitely be watching the second movie in the series. I have not found a movie where the actors were so well-matched and believable that the movie could not only continue on as one but go on to new heights.   The first movie in this series was very well-done but I had to admit that it was a bit slow-paced.  With a better screenplay this movie could have been far better.  I highly recommend this movie to both older and younger fans of the series who will appreciate this story-line much more than if the movie had been a rehash of the last two movies in the franchise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a story about the end of an era. It's a time of social turmoil, and all the more so because of how the film is filmed and directed.  It's as if the camera is watching the action take place before it, rather than focusing on it. It is a visually beautiful movie. The cinematography, especially on set, is a marvel. The score is a nice accompaniment to the movie.    It is an excellent film. It will remind you why you loved films in the seventies.

The Man from Nowhere (2006)   This time we're moving in a completely different direction (not that there is anything wrong with that) and yet somehow we manage to bring to the screen the same feeling of wonder as the first film and even the first one by the same director.  An incredible film which will make you believe in a different kind of reality.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very surprised how good the new Ghostbusters reboot was. The new geeks didn't play as much as in the previous two movies, but they were still funny and did a great job in playing a new set of geeks:  They were the original cast. I don't see them as the new geezers because they didn't seem to have much to do. But the one that really surprised me was a lady named Rita who I thought should have been played by one of the older ladies like Janine Melnitz or Elizabeth Short. But what the hell: I'll give her credit for having a very great role, and she was a nice enough role in general.    The whole thing was very funny.  This is a funny movie!   It was fun and a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago I discovered this film and found it to be a fascinating portrait of the human condition.   I am not sure I have ever seen such a complete and utter breakdown of the mind.  It is fascinating stuff, and the acting is superb.  I find it a shame that I haven't watched this film more often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen any good film about the atomic bomb.   This is about the bombing of Nagasaki.  My brother had an uncle who was in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing.  I remember him being so frightened by the explosion, he didn't dare to come home after his shift.  The movie is about one of the members of the "Totem" a family of Japanese women who are very much opposed to the nuclear bombing.   It was made about a little over a year ago. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an amazing movie, and I can't praise it enough! There are few movies that have managed to pull off this well, including The Lion King, Pocahontas, and The Lord of the Rings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge Star Wars fan.   And I have to say, this is the first Star Wars movie I have seen in quite some time.  I remember watching Episode One way back in 1977, I was blown away.  The look of the movie was spectacular, and then in The Empire Strikes Back there was this great bit where the Millennium Falcon was flying past a giant sand castle.  This movie, although somewhat derivative, did a good job of re-doing the old Star Wars films.  And, for me, that is what a Star Wars film is all about:  Star Wars!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie when I was just a child. At the time I didn't really understand the movie other than the idea of a boy flying. The movie is about a boy that is going through some things in his life. The story is about him trying to keep a straight face as he deals with his parents and then he goes to college to try to make it big. It is a good watch with good acting by some of the best actors in the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't like this movie at all. The actors did a terrible job with this movie and it's not even a good film.   The movie is supposed to be based on a real story of a man who was going to meet his girlfriend and he lost his car in the desert and got a tattoo which is supposed is a picture of the woman he was going meet.  One night he went to meet her in a dark street, he forgot he had the tattoo and the woman ran off with him into the desert.  The woman is a drug addict, they go to a dark house which has a strange creature that crawls around on the ground and they have sex in a strange way.  After a while they are found and taken in by a couple of old people who have lost their children to a demon.  When the two old people realize the girl is a demon they tell the couple to drive them into a town where they see some other people who look like demons.  They then go to the town with the demon and they go through a ritual which starts the demon coming to life.  This is pretty much the movie, not a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While "Tiger vs. The Marrow" is a very entertaining film, it is also very educational about the brain.   There are a lot of people that don't know about the human brain and how much of the mind we have, because most of the information we get about the mind is via cartoons.  A movie like "Tire Chasers" is great and educational, but "Tiggers" is more educational and entertaining.  This movie may not be for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My review is a little long and kind of a pain to write because I feel like I've been there and done that with the Star Trek movies, but I'll give it a shot anyway:  I really like the movie, even though it's only about a minute and a half in length. It really has a lot to offer.  It takes place in the 22nd century.  The Enterprise is still a fairly powerful ship with the original crew of Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov on board.  One of the Enterprise's first duties is to visit the planet where Spock's wife is in a coma.  Spock was the one who saved his wife's life during a nuclear holocaust.  She was also the person who put his mind in order after his first heart attack.  As far as I can tell this is one of the few times the ship is not traveling to another planet, and we're treated to an incredible space battle on a planet that is not Earth.  This is followed by an amusing scene where a computer-generated Spock attempts to learn something from a human.  There are several references to things that were actually going on in Star Trek at the time and it is a very clever piece of work.  After a short time on the planet Spock is told to head to Earth with his crew.  I'm not quite sure why Kirk or McCoy go out on a mission, but they do and there's a great scene in the briefing room in which they're all talking about the various threats they need to deal with.  In order to deal appropriately with these threats, the crew members have to take various drugs to alter their moods, as well as an "inhibitor" called a "Hippocratic chair."  The idea is that they can change their minds in such a way that they behave in ways that suit them and not those things that the people in authority want them to behave.  If you look at this as a metaphor for the whole series, the Hippocratic Chair is a great example of an effective and powerful tool.  Even though Kirk is saying things like, "That'll do it," and McCoy is giving Spock a prescription, McCoy is talking about what it's like to take the drugs the Hippocrates prescribed.  McCoy and Kirk then go out and stop an alien invasion of Earth. And there you have it.   I like Star Trek, but there are things about it

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never seen a movie made by a black man before, so I was excited.    The first scene is set in a black neighborhood where a white boy is trying to get a date for Christmas.  To show how black it really is, they show a lot of black people in the background doing nothing.  Later, a black guy named Tom (David Gordon Green) walks past a bunch of white folks.  He sees a white girl walking towards him and gives her a quick hug.  What a great scene.  This was one of those movies that just had to be made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie made for the "young people" or the "in the know." The premise is a simple one, just a few people go to a party and find out that they're not in the real world and have to make friends in order to get back home. There's a lot of comedy involved and some very odd characters in addition to a great performance by James Woods.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film opens with the two best friends running for their lives after being trapped in an abandoned building in the middle of the city. The film doesn't get a lot more interesting or interesting until they reach a police station. When they arrive, the only problem is that the two friends are in the police station! After some quick investigations, the two detectives are able to figure out that the building isn't abandoned; the only thing that's still up is the front door.   This leads to a chase through the city streets. At one point, the detective makes a big mistake. Instead of following a simple trail, he's leading the two of them to the most dangerous place they can find: the top floor of a building!   A chase that includes a bomb, a fire, and a burning building is absolutely fascinating to watch. I'm not the biggest horror fan, but this movie was a real eye opener!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away," said the Princess, "There was a great comedy by Mr. Lucas. It was about a very foolish but very lovable boy who got himself a new girlfriend, a beautiful girl who wore a pink feather boa. The movie had a lot of heart, humor, and just a sense of fun."   The movie is about Luke Skywalker's life before the Clone Wars. He has to save his planet from a giant creature called a Wampa.   As with any film about a boy and a girl, the film has a lot going for it. A great performance from Paul Williams as Luke, a great script by Mike Newell, and the music (by John Williams) make this film a blast to watch.     There are some scenes in this film that are pretty cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a viewer of a number of horror films, I found that The Shining is a classic of the genre, in which the horrors are presented in a way that is as frightening as possible and at the same time is full of subtle beauty. The setting is that of a cabin in the middle of nowhere with a few relatives of the main characters. They are at the center of a conspiracy by those who run the cabin. The movie is set in a very modern setting with the setting of a TV talk show where the host is an eccentric man who, during his appearances, gets in trouble and is asked to leave the TV show. He returns after being asked to be a guest on another talk show and is invited back to the cabin where he discovers that his host has disappeared. As he investigates, he discovers a number   of disturbing happenings. He learns that several people were murdered and his sister has become convinced that the spirits are responsible and that she is being held captive in the cabin at the bottom of a mountain.   The film also has some good horror effects with the use of a camera that is used for panning shots that are used to make the viewer believe that he or she is in an actual haunted house. Also the film has some great moments of beautiful filmmaking, with a lot of good camera work in a modern setting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hands down, this movie is a "classic" of the horror genre. The story is very simple: a young woman (Jessica Biel) and her boyfriend (Robert DeNiro) walk into a home to check on a couple (Michael Corleone and Jennifer Connelly) in the middle of the night. After opening the door and finding the couple dead, the woman immediately realizes that something is not right.   After going back to the couple's house to check for a missing woman, Jessica decides that she must try to find out why her house had been "wiped out" the night before.  This film is not scary in the slightest. There is very little gore, and it's really a movie about a woman who tries to find the answers.  However, it is a well made movie that is worthy of your time.

As always, there are a lot more bad movies out there than good, and this one is no exception. There are a few things wrong in this movie. 1. I would have liked more character development, but I guess the film makers made the most of it. 2. The special effects were great, and I guess that's what counts for most movies anyway. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months ago, I was driving down the road with a friend, we were both in the passenger seat when I saw a truck going a crazy speed.   I didn't believe I'd ever see that movie again.  Well it was all downhill from there, the movie doesn't hold up after the opening credits.  The film is about two kids that run out of a bar and end up crashing into the side of a bus.  It has no idea where to go with this plot.  In the middle of the movie we have no idea what happened in the bar and what the two kids are up to.  Instead of a movie I thought I was watching a soap opera.  I was not prepared for a plot that doesn't work at all.  They just jump back and forth between talking about the two young men in a bar they're going to hang out with and their little bus crash.  After the opening scenes we get to see only the aftermath.  This is not the film it could have been, but it is a decent watch.

This gives a unique perspective to the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and it was funny, scary, heartwarming and moving.   There was some blood, but I did not see any actual gore.  The story was a mix between the supernatural and the usual everyday horrors.  A man was having an affair with his girlfriend's mother, who was a witch.  While the girlfriend's father was away and her mother was at work, her mother sent a spell to the boyfriend that his girlfriend was going to get him killed, that she was going "up a storm."  I liked that she did not really spell her own death, it just happened to her.  They started dating, and then she had a child with the boyfriend.  She has him in the house for a while, and her daughter grows up.  There was a lot of "you're never alone" at this movie.  I didn't like the relationship between the two, but the movie did have a bit of suspense at the beginning.  This movie also made me think that I should take better care of my skin.

The whole movie is filled with a good old-fashioned romance and I loved it.   My only wish was that the scene where the young man is in a fight with the woman and the woman runs out of the room and out of sight and then is not heard from for two hours would have been a little longer to allow the audience time to connect with this character, but hey, who knows.

There is also a touching scene at the end which is quite moving and very touching.  I liked this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went in to see "The Bad Touch" at a local theater on a weekday evening. It seemed pretty typical of a small town, low budget horror movie. Except for the fact that it is a true, true story! I was on a train ride from Pittsburgh to New York City when I got a call from my father. He was heading to the movies with me. "Hey dad!" I said. "What's the matter, don't want to go to the movie?" "I can't believe you're here! I've never seen anything like this in my life!" I've seen pretty much every horror movie I could ever find, including a couple of the "The Walking Dead" episodes. That was about all I could stand. The movie is set in a little town in Pennsylvania. I knew I had never been there. It looked like it was in Pennsylvania in the olden days, in the 70's when my father worked at a paper mill. At first, the plot makes no sense. The girl that goes to see her friend dies in the woods. Her mother is in the hospital dying. There are the dead bodies that are on the tracks in the middle of the night. I felt like it really wasn't supposed to be a horror movie until I saw the last minute! It was almost like a movie that was shot in a real town! It looked exactly like a small Pennsylvania town to me. It was like a horror horror movie! I remember it being very creepy, and my dad, having a hard time coming home. But that's the only problem I had with it. My only real complaint about it is that it doesn't do the "gory" factor very well!   And one last word about the "bad touch":

It was a nice surprise to find out that this movie wasn't a big disaster like we all thought it was.  In this movie the characters aren't that different from the ones we've all seen before in the movies they're supposed to be in.  They aren't very different either but their personalities are.  The best part of the movie was the story.  It's simple and very good.  This was another good movie from director Dede Ellis (The Girl With All the Gifts).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where there is a severe shortage of food. The people of the town have developed a special technology which creates artificial food by heating and then cooking a mixture of plant, animal and human protein. These artificial foods have been known to be extremely nutritious, containing protein that is nearly as good as the real thing. The only drawback is the extreme fattening effect that artificial foods can have on a person. The main character is a young girl called Yuka, a high school student who has recently arrived from Japan. Yuka's mother died during childbirth and her father deserted her before she was born. When her father was gone, she was cared for by her grandmother who was a witch. This grandmother's magic makes the artificial food she produces look like a real piece of fruit.   In a desperate attempt to find a way to survive, she sets off for the land of the new generation of artificial food.

I am not a big fan of films that focus on the "cool" guy, but the whole movie has that element to it, it is almost like an old fashioned pulp film. It is not a bad film but it is definitely something I can't wait to see again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An average film with the plot, actors, and music fitting with a good amount of humor and fun.   The cast is nice, especially Michael Madsen as the crazy old man who has his hands full with a wife, his two granddaughters, a cat, his neighbor's dog, and a few other eccentric neighbors.  The best part of the movie is the ending where Madsen takes out a.357 Magnum and gives it a one-handed shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not a good film, but it's not as bad as you think, either.   The plot of this is like an old English fairytale - a young woman is given a fairy godmother, which means that she is transformed into a beautiful princess, and when she discovers that she has not aged a day since she was born - a fairy prince is waiting for her.  This film was originally released in 1931 by Paramount and starred a young Margaret Mitchell, one of the first great actors of her generation.  It was also very popular in its day and was made during the height of Hollywood's Golden Age, and a lot of directors and actors of the era worked on it, among them George Gershwin, Howard Hawks, and others.  The film has a wonderful, beautiful score, which is a perfect match for the setting.  In all, this is a very beautiful film and it is a great idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie that started it all:  To be honest this movie is really not that bad. The story is actually very well written. It starts with a girl dying a painful death. We see her in her bed, holding the dead girl in her arms and we start to hear a man's screams. It ends with a huge explosion and a huge fireball. The movie starts with the protagonist being an FBI agent and his best friend trying to find the killer. The first thing that stood out for me were the two FBI guys who are very funny. The FBI guy with a red bandanna and the blue haired guy who are always arguing. Both of them are very annoying. The other thing that stands out is the character of the girl. She seems like a real person but is very evil. One of the best things about the movie is how quickly it all starts. There are no slow parts. It goes fast. This is a movie that you should watch with a group of people as it will not take you long to watch this movie. This movie is an excellent example of what a good horror movie should be. The reason this movie won an Oscar for best short film is because it has no voice over. The whole movie is told through one character's point of view. It is a great example of a movie done right.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So when I saw The Last Airbender I just had to watch it. I was actually a little worried about how it would turn out, since the first few episodes were more or less in my head. I guess I should know better than to worry. This is an amazing story and I am always amazed when I see that something so simple can create such a complex world. It was a bit hard at first but once I got the hang of it I was able to appreciate and even enjoy it. A great story and an even better film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie, and as the title indicates, it is about the birth of a great film director, a great actor (Raymond Burr), and a great director (Ernst Lubitsch). It is an interesting and entertaining story, and it has a very interesting plot. It is a movie which is well-balanced, and the humor is fairly well-placed and even humorous in places. There are some great performances, some of the greatest ever to appear on film. There is a good story, it never feels rushed, and in places it is very much in control of its material. It has a good cast, and there are some good things about it, but there are also some bad things about this film. The acting, the plot, and a few things in the editing are all somewhat lacking. It would be a fine film to have seen if only one person had the time and the interest to see it. However, one might ask whether one should even waste time watching a film which is so bad, that a person with a half-baked plot could be a good director. However...the story is certainly good enough to make it worthwhile. It never felt rushed, but it did feel somewhat too long, especially in the beginning, which is where most of the movie is. The editing was certainly very bad, and to have the scenes start so fast, and have the film run on so long that you have to see a second scene, and then a third scene, is just bad. All in all, this film has been worth my time. It had a lot of action, and enough character development to make this a good film to watch. I did get a little tired of it, especially at the beginning. I was wondering if I was going to miss out on something good, and, unfortunately, I did miss out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Meryl Streep, not the kind of actress who seems to need some sort of an accent, plays a German woman in Auschwitz in a remarkable performance that seems to be the beginning of her career as a Shakespearean tragic heroine.   I have never seen a performance in my life like Streep's in this movie.  She gets to know the characters she is playing before the first scene of the film is over and she is a delight to watch.  Meryl Streeps is no less important in this film than in her recent performances as Mme. de Chevreuse and Lola in  The Great Gatsby  and   There was a moment during the film where the whole audience stood up and cheered and it was only Meryl, who turned to us and said "You didn't think I was going to go away" that made me laugh out loud.  And Streep is just an incredible actress and a lovely person.  I hope she will keep making movies like this.  This film is a good and a worthwhile movie but I found it to be too much like a movie of the old days.  There were no twists, no surprises.  Streep plays a good woman in a bad situation.  The film is about one day and one night in Auschwitz and what she experiences in that day.  It is not about her personal suffering.  Most of the time she is there only to be a good German woman and a good actor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm glad that this movie is not about how the Japanese people are evil. It's about how their society is evil, their culture is evil and their military is evil. The only good thing that I like about the movie is that it shows how the American soldiers, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, didn't take the opportunity to kill their enemy without any resistance.    The last 5 minutes of the movie are actually pretty funny. It starts with a scene that is all too familiar to those who love military action films: a Japanese boat is attacked by American ships, a few of which try to force it to stop, but it refuses. At the end of the war, the United States military finds out that Japanese troops hid from a small U.S. force and then attempted a retreat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a woman who goes to stay with a woman in the country. She falls in love with the woman. She also has a daughter, and they all live in the countryside in the 1950's.   A woman who lives in the old house in the hills is a kind of godess, and the people of the countryside respect her.  It is all very beautiful, peaceful, and peaceful again.  A man who had gone to live with her goes there to see her, and finds her and her daughter murdered. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen two films from the "Lost City" trilogy. The first film was excellent. A great adventure movie with some beautiful visuals. The second film was a bit more boring. There was a strong theme about love and romance. However, the director, Tom Savini, really didn't know what to do with it. The movie has very little of romance, but very little action either. What there is, is some cool action sequences and beautiful scenery. There's a little romance here and there, but for the most part, there's a lot of boring action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A good movie that was made for a good reason."   A movie that is not bad and does not deserve to be bad.   This is a good comedy that is about a man that tries to make up for all the bad things he has done in his life. It is not easy though and his life seems to be full of bad luck. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people have said this movie has "too much science" for my taste, but that doesn't bother me one bit.   The movie makes a solid effort to try to show the human body as a living, breathing entity, rather than a set of machines.  It is very well done in terms of the technical aspects.  When they show the process of building a man up to a certain degree of strength and endurance, the scientist gets to show some rather remarkable feats.  I will give the scientist credit for trying to work out how his body works, and also for taking a fairly reasonable approach to trying to build the body to suit a particular individual.  At times I did wonder about the direction he was taking it, but overall the movie worked very well.  While it can be a bit too much science, I think it works well enough to get the point across.  One other aspect of the movie that I liked was the use of the body as an instrument of terror.  What did it ever do to me to know that a certain part of my body could produce the most terrible noises, and I would be unable to help it?  I found the movie quite interesting.  There are a couple of minor issues, however.  The science is quite a bit more "scientific" than it should be, especially when they talk about things like the electrical conductance of blood, so it can get a bit confusing.  Other than that, the movie was very entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to start by stating that there are three main reasons for my rating of this movie: First: The acting is good (except for some parts). Second: It has a dark theme (that is, an allusion to the death and decay of society) which works well and is done in a non-abusive manner. And third: The music is excellent and really does not detract from the movie at all.   One reason why I do not like horror movies is the fact that many people want to scare us, usually by using blood and gore, which really does have a negative effect on the movie (not in a good way). I am in complete agreement with a lot of the reviewers of this and other movies, who state that "The Hills Have Eyes" does not have much blood or gore, yet, that does not diminish the horror as the movie tries to make a deeper comment on the decline of society as a whole. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best horror movies ever made.   This movie is one of the most interesting things I've seen in a long while.  I've got to say,  It's an absolutely brilliant film and deserves to be on everyones must see list.  There is something about this film that is just too good.  The way  John Carpenter  makes  his monster look so  frightening makes it so that you really cannot help but to look away from  it and instead watch the  people who live in the house,  their reactions.  And I really like  how this movie keeps it's macabre tone.  It  feels  like it's in the late seventies.  A lot of the people you see are in their seventies now.  These  people  don't seem to have aged at all.  At a point in the film when Carpenter  takes off the gloves and shows us  how he really makes this monster work he reminds us of someone like  Bruce Lee.  In a way it's like Bruce Lee has come back as a monster in this film.  This film feels like it is a homage to that.  But it is really all about  John Landis  work.  Carpenter uses  so many different camera angles that it feels like you are watching two films in one.  One when he is working with the real people and  the other when he  is working alone and with a different perspective.  He even has a few different  cameras working in between.  His camera work is incredible.  We get to see a lot of different angles and he uses so many angles in just about every scene to make the viewers eyes water.  That is just amazing to watch.  If you're a fan of John Landi's work, then this is one you should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director who made the first movie (Polaroid and I had both come out on June 11) did this one with the same camera rig, with the camera rolling through different angles.   It's a strange film, but I like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that this movie was good enough to pass up on the movie "Karma" just for this one.   This is a good looking movie and looks great.  The story was not that great and not worth the time to watch and not too good to watch either.  It's just a bunch of people in a room talking about how bad things are and the next day things are good.  One of the biggest problems of this movie is that there were a lot of characters talking in the beginning and then the story goes back to those characters.  This movie would have been much better with less people talking and no one to follow the characters. However, the film did have a lot to say about bad people and good people, and this is a great way to put it.  You need to read this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really enjoying this movie, so far it's one of the best of the season so far, not a bad thing.

It had some good acting (like the character, I think), some great scenes (one scene has the funniest lines) and some funny scenes, but not too many.  I'd rate it a 9 or a 10, but it's good enough to be fun to watch and watch again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An epic movie, that has everything you would want from a good western: action, adventure, humor, romance, a good cast and a great soundtrack.   After a week or so of seeing it, I was sure it would be the first movie of the year that I would recommend to my friends.  One of the most memorable scenes in the movie involves a fight between an old western sheriff and a young cowboy who has just killed a man named Laughlin.  I'm a sucker for good action.  The movie is a must see, and it may be the most entertaining western I have seen in years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a nice time with this movie, I think it was the first "real" "black & white" horror film I'd seen.   The opening credits are black & white, and the film is played backwards from beginning to end, to give it a feel of the film going backwards.  This is probably the only "realist" horror movie of the 1970s, with it's creepy atmosphere and creepy characters.  Some people I know say this film was like a bad "black and white" version of "Soylent Green" (although with more blood), but it has a cool atmosphere.  As for the plot, there is a little bit of black magic going on, but it doesn't really get in the way of the fun.  I've watched a few others "realists" that have been made by the same people over the last 25 years, and I can honestly say that this one was far better than those others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really surprised about this one. It's a very simple story, but you get the sense of adventure and the sense that you're in on a secret with a couple of characters you'd know anyway.   It's the only movie I've seen from the Coen Brothers, I like them both very much, but this movie is much better than the first.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main story is very good, but the movie has a funny and somewhat cute character, but a little too innocent.   As I mentioned earlier, you can tell it is not a serious movie by the little children playing around in the street. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, it is about a school kid who had to be sent to a private school by his father because he was born in the wrong country (he was born to a German mother). So he was living in a small city and had to deal with all the bad guys in his life (school, gangs, etc.). Then the movie shows that the good guys are not the bad ones at all, but the good ones are the ones that are a little misunderstood by their own father.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always found it funny how the movie ends with an ominous, but subtle, sound effect: The movie's ending is really bad   The movie also has a great score   If you don't like bad movies, don't watch this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen a movie that gets better the more I see it.   In a movie like this you need to be constantly alert.  One mistake is all it takes.  I really like the director.  His movies are always good, but when he does a real good one you have to take a few steps back to appreciate his work.  This movie is a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie about a man who thinks he is a very good driver.   He drives around the city looking for people who are in need.  He goes to a liquor store, picks up the owner and tells him that he is not going to be able to pay him and is going to get a hotel room.  Later he sees a woman who says she doesn't want to pay for his drink and he drives off.  The next day he runs into the woman again and she begs him to go with her to the police station.  They are there waiting for the man.  After a while he drives them to the station, and when the police see his name they stop him.  While there the woman and the police talk and the woman says they both love each other and she needs money and to forget.  So they agree to go to her room and she lets him take a shower.  Next day he shows up and is told that she doesn''t want to go out with him because he is very ugly.  And the woman is going out with a man that is very handsome.  I like the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is great and should have been in every movie club in the world. The story is just fantastic. From the start we see the movie is all about a man and his wife who are in a car accident. I wish we would have gotten to know more about them and the accident but I don't want to be spoiled. We also get to know what a wonderful family they are. There are a lot of twists and turns in this movie that are great but it also had a lot to catch you off guard. One of the most memorable scenes was the ending. A little kid goes into a store and a woman comes out and asks what happened to his father. He says he couldn't get the man out so he took the money and ran off. It is great to watch how the movie portrays the family and they always do the right thing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to apologize to my family and my brother and sisters for all their pains I have caused them during this long wait for this movie. As you all know, I am a poor alcoholic. I have not been sober for over two years. I don't know why I have waited so long to tell the world that I am still an alcoholic and still drunk, even after my own sister and I divorced. I still drink, not to keep me sober but because it's easy, it's quick, and when it's gone I know I don,t have to look for a drink again for a long time. I know there are people that will say I'm lying to make a story seem more interesting to me and that is a great pity. I am not. I could keep going on about my life and how I don t know how to get ahold of myself. But I don' t want to. I just do. I hope you are having a good time watching this movie and that I don 't ruin it for you, too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I heard that this film was the movie based off a real life case, my heart skipped a beat. I was immediately intrigued by how the character was portrayed, because you don't generally see how people who commit crimes are portrayed in film.   I was absolutely fascinated by the details surrounding the case, like the number of times that a cop has stopped him in the past and he had just about finished his car. And then the cop comes up behind him and asks "Are you okay?"   And then after that, he was arrested and he has to explain what happened to the police and then explain to the public what happened  . And then later in the film, he has been released and is going back home to his wife, and her son is crying and he's thinking "Oh my God, what is she going to think? He's going to get arrested again?"  His wife asks him if he's ever thought about suicide   and he says that he has   and then that was all the evidence the cops needed to find him   The movie was absolutely brilliant in its portrayal of the case and the people involved in it.  There is no justice in this world, and this is the best way to get justice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is quite simple.   An American engineer and his family are on a holiday in France.  When they go to visit a village, they meet a boy, a girl and a dog.  A boy is missing but the dog doesn't seem to know where he has gone. The boy's dog, a terrier named Taz, gets lost and, because they are all alone in a foreign country, they are forced to solve the boy's problem.  The movie looks and sounds really good.  There are also some very strange but amusing jokes.  I really liked this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple, and simple is a good thing. It's a pretty well done story. The story starts out with a bad car accident, that causes a pretty good car accident.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're looking for a good, funny and quite entertaining movie, then look no further than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly   (aka The Godfather Part III)   I haven't watched a movie in years (except one or two I watched when I was 10)  This film is a must see.  It is a comedy and drama and action film about a gangster who falls from grace, and becomes a real life criminal.   In the second half, the film really starts to get good.  One of the most amusing parts is when they shoot the bad guy.  His legs were mangled by a gun, so he is paralyzed.  He can barely stand because he doesn't have a leg.  After they shoot him, he falls over a trash can and dies.  Now this is not a film where everyone is bad. There are good people in the gangster group and there are good guys. This film can be quite funny at times, and when things don't go as planned, it can be amusing to watch.  The best part about this film is the performance by Robert De Niro and John Cazale, who play their characters so well.  I love how John Czale always manages to turn into a badass in one scene.  If they had done this film a bit more in the first part, it would have been a very good film.  Unfortunately, that part doesn't really happen.  This is one of the best gangster films ever made, and is highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a hard time with this movie, at least for a couple of hours. I didn't find the movie very original, or original at all. The movie revolves around two actors, who go to a bar and get into a fight. One of the two wins the fight, but both end up in jail after being arrested for attacking each other. A long time later, the actor who was in the fight shows up at the actor's house, in a tuxedo and carries a gun. As the movie gets closer to the ending, the movie loses its originality and starts to get ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you like watching two idiots argue over who is going to win in a fight in a bar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is an excellent example of the classic crime film. In it, we see the perfect mix of bad actors, a great script, and a great director.   I'll start with some bad:  1.  James Mason plays the main bad guy, a man of the streets who is desperate to take the spotlight off of his sister.  He's a nice enough kid, but he's too young to be a leading man in the '60s.  2.  It's a shame that we didn't get to see him with other bad guys, like the bad guy from this movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvnY4gFz5gE.   3.  I thought this movie should have been called "The Boys of the Road".   4.  As good as it is, it can't be topped as a perfect crime flick.  5.  This movie isn't good, but then that's what it is.  6.  For an interesting premise, it is a bit too slow, with a lot of dialog, and not a lot to say about the movie.  7.  The main character is too good of a lead.  8.  Another interesting lead is the movie's writer, who makes a good film by writing for the classic films.  9.  If you like the classic movies and good writing, I recommend you give this a chance.  10.  But you shouldn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a HUGE movie aficionado and a big fan of the genre.   It's not that I don't like comedies, I don 't like them that much, but I dig them.  This one has all of the classic qualities, great visuals, funny scenes, and plenty of great jokes.  The most memorable scenes of the movie are the scene where the two characters are standing outside the movie theater trying to get to the place where the movie is playing, and the scene when the two of them discuss why it's such a great movie and when they decide to watch it together.  A must see for fans of any movie genre and great fun!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A brilliant, funny movie! The film was made during the 60's. It was shot in black and white. They took the idea of a comic book from the comics and made a real comic book! In a small, little town, a group of youngsters, who wanted to make the most of their time, decide to go down to the beach, and then they do a bit of an adventure! This is very clever, and very funny! The story is very interesting, and the characters are interesting and funny. The story ends very nicely. It would be a good idea to watch the whole movie, and try to understand what happened in the first ten minutes, before the rest of it started!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's amazing how an all-female production crew of a comedy is able to pull off a story set in a hospital with all the humor and charm of a Disney film.   The first half of the film has a wonderful feeling of fun mixed with a serious plot that unfolds very slowly, though a very clever plot.  A number of characters in the movie are funny and believable, and some are very funny, especially the hospital employee who is a bit of a dork, though she can be very smart and witty when needed.  If you like a good film with a lot of humor and light-heartedness, then you will have a lot to laugh about in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While it's probably a bit farfetched for people who are already fans of "Lord of the Rings," the world-building and magic-realism that has made these movies so successful over the years is here. The characters are quite well-realized, and the plot, while a little bit more convoluted than usual, never gets lost in the labyrinthine maze of the Shire.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always been a fan of movies, since my days as a child when my parents brought home a television for me to watch every evening at 7 pm, and my Dad would occasionally give me the remote. The movies were always so interesting, so full of action and excitement. They had to be; the movies didn't last long, and what a thrill they were! I have watched them every weekend since I was a little girl and the excitement is still so exciting as I watch them today. This movie is a good example of the excitement that these movies can bring.   The film begins with a man who has a passion for photography and photography of things of interest to him. He has a big beautiful camera, and is photographing all kinds of things, such as things that fly into the air, or that he sees fly through the sky. He goes to a beach on a beautiful beach, where he is taking pictures of the people swimming there.  His wife has been away on vacation, and so he has some pictures of her with her friend in the sand, but doesn't want to share them, so he takes pictures of himself instead.  He also takes a picture of a baby being born.  It's really a lovely little story with a lot of action, and it is well-produced and animated.  The action scenes are well-paced, and you have to wait a bit for the music to come in, but then you can't stop thinking about what's happening onscreen.  There are a few times where I was concerned that the action could slow down a bit, and they did slow it down at times, but the action was never boring, it was always exciting.  I'm so glad that the movie was so well-made, that it is still interesting to me as a young adult and I'm sure it will be fun to watch in future years.

Rather, I didn't really enjoy the movies. I was bored to tears.  That changed when I found that I could watch the movies and I liked them more than I ever did the first time around.  If you're a fan of Star Wars, then this is a must see.  The cast is great.  Han Solo has been around for decades.  His ship is a piece of shit.  However, he's still got his good points.  It has a great sense of humor and a great soundtrack.  One of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot:  At the end of the movie, the gang meets an old acquaintance, a retired detective named Bob (who has been a detective for a long time), who tells them that he's been looking for a man named Jim Croce, a former police detective who went missing in 1959 and has been searching for his son (or son-in-law) ever since.   And who doesn't love a detective movie?   Now, there's a very good reason why this movie isn't in my top ten best crime films:  (1)  I don't think there's anything really wrong with it.  It's definitely fun.  (2)  And it's got a cool twist at the end.  I'll give this one an A.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A long time ago, when I was a young lad, my father gave me an instruction book on how to become a professional wrestler, complete with a photo of Vince McMahon and a video of a live match he was on. The book was filled with so much detail that it was like a detective novel, but instead of the police, I was Vince.   I did not think much about this as a career at the time, although I did think it was neat.  I had to work a job in my late teens or early twenties and when that was finished, I decided that I would become a wrestler and be the greatest ever.  The first person I decided to get was Ted DiBiase.  He was the most popular guy at the gym, and so I made a bet with my buddies that if we beat him, I would get Ted DiBio.  This was in 1985 and I was 16, so I did.  My first match in the ring was against Ted Di Biase and his partner, Jim Ross.  DiBiose was not a bad guy in the slightest, he was a good guy, but I was not going to lose to him.  We worked a great match with DiBios going over my head and getting the better of me. I ended up going back to my apartment, ate my meal, and went to bed.  When I woke up in the morning, I had a bad headache.  It was like I had just woken up from a bad nightmare. I went to the bathroom and decided to take a shower to see if I had gotten too hot and cold.  After the shower I found a note in my toilet saying that I had won a match with the champion and it was time to get ready for a match at a big wrestling show in a couple of days.  With the same note on my bathroom door, I went back to the gym.  Ted DiBuio and Jim Ross had won the match that I was supposed to be wrestling and they were trying to get me to accept a match against their good buddy, Ted DiBaby, because he was not wrestling.  What the hell am I supposed to do, they just told me.  So I decided I would do something about it and had a match that was the best match I ever had in wrestling. I was so happy that I ended being given a new name, "The Million Dollar Man", that I did the world a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of heart. It's about a high school girl (Greta Garbo) who has a boyfriend who she likes, but there is a problem. His family is racist and thinks he is gay. He's not, he's straight. So they go to a town called The Jungle. The Jungle is about a town populated by people who have been raised in a society where there is no such thing as freedom. There is no freedom. All women wear burkas. It isn't a metaphor for anything. I'm sure the film maker knew that this was an anti-climax, but he did a good job of getting you thinking and wondering about the possibilities of a society which no longer cares about its women. There are some funny moments, but also a lot to think about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this is a very good movie about a man who has just had his last meal in the restaurant, but the food is terrible and he needs a quick fix. When he gets in the car to drive away, the radio is playing and it is his favorite radio station.   The movie ends with a good, long scene of a car wreck, but I didn't get the joke and couldn't understand the movie at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure this is the first film to be nominated for an Academy Award, ever.   This is not a great movie, or an extremely good one.  It's a pretty good movie, though, with a great cast, and a pretty decent director, and it's also a pretty great story, with great acting, and some great twists.  I haven't seen many movies where the lead actor (Barry Pepper) is played by a character from The Lord of the Rings, but I'd really like to see this movie with a few extras (like a couple of orcs, or a couple human soldiers), if the director would let me.  The ending, to me, didn't really connect to the rest of the movie at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a good action film.   You do get a good story, nice action, a nice soundtrack, lots of explosions, and a nice cast.  The cast all do the role well.  When I first saw it, I had to change the rating a bit because I felt like I was watching an old movie and not a new one.  Now, I realize that this movie is an old one. It was made when the film business was still in its infancy and before they really invented the computer.  That is why you can see the old black and white movies where they had a real time effect where the camera moves in slow motion, you can hear the gun shots and you can even see the faces of the actors in the background.  It has been 20 years since I saw it and the movie really shows it.  I would not mind seeing this movie again just to get some more old time action.  This is a real gem. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie on opening night of the theater I rented it at. The theater had a little over a hundred seats and the movie was a great mix of horror, romance, and comedy. It had some cool music (particularly when we meet the monster in the bathroom), but the acting was decent. This movie was enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        This is one of the best-loved science fiction movies of all time, and one of my favorite films of all times.   In many ways it's a story about a society in which the "good guys" have won, and the society is falling apart. But we're not sure what to do about that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An unapologetic, full frontal attack on those who think that the only way to be moral is to be an asshole.   I don't like many movies.  The biggest, baddest, most brutal asshole I can ever picture being on screen would be Sam Kinison in this movie, which, by the way, was directed by his brother.  I think we can all agree that Sam Kiniznd is not very good at playing dumb.  There is a scene in this film where he pretends to be retarded to gain a better vantage point for assaulting a woman in the toilet.  He then starts pounding on the door and yelling "STOP PUTTING MY FOOT IN THE TOILET" while the other people in the film laugh.    That last scene gets so bad for Sam Kinisnd that he finally gets up and walks to the corner of the room and vomits.  Sam Kinissnd is like a little child, a kid who is out of control and thinks that everything is normal and happy when he is not in control.  It's not, you guys. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does it's job:  The movie is about a bad and broken father who is trying to find a reason to be happy about his kids who are now grown and in high school.  He has a new girlfriend and she seems to be on the same page as him and his kids.  It's a comedy with some heart and a little bit of drama.   I would have liked to see more of the movie and see if there is more of a connection between the father and his girls.  I had to look up some of the dialogue and it doesn't sound as good as it should and at times it just sounds as if a guy was saying what someone else was thinking.  But at the same time I enjoyed the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has a very different atmosphere from the first movie   but not much.   The characters are very simple and the film is about the everyday life of a school boy.  The film is well made and has a nice cast including a Japanese actor who seems to be the main actor in this movie.  It is not a very good movie  in the movie a young boy is taking a shower and after showering he hears the toilet flushing and then he gets a little embarrassed.  After that he thinks about what he was doing and says to himself "why would I ever want to be a man if I did that   it's not the way to live   I am going to turn back to my mother   and change my ways  ".   And the whole thing is a good joke and I liked it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has an intense storyline and is set in the mid 1920s. There are several historical scenes, mostly set in England during the time of the Crusades. The movie contains a lot of action scenes. There is very good, well-shot cinematography with many shots. One shot of a battle is particularly good. There were many well-written scenes. The script is a good blend of historical information and some modern humor.   I thought the movie was about a young boy who is in love with a beautiful woman who is his teacher. He has to make a very hard decision in a short time. This is a great movie about an important event in history that was so interesting to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie   It is not for the faint of heart, as we find out from the very beginning, we are not the only ones looking to get out of this mess, but it is a very good action movie that will satisfy most any action movie lover   If I had to describe this movie, I would say it is one long battle of good vs evil   The movie is well done, but some things are so out of whack that they give the movie a bad name   However the action scenes are entertaining and well directed   This movie will definitely please anyone looking for something more action packed than a Disney movie 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was one of the first movies I ever watched in English. I remember that even my father enjoyed the movie because he didn't understand the English subtitles. I know he was born in France so his English skills were bad.   This movie is really good. The plot is straightforward and doesn't really require any thinking at all. I would have liked to see it in 2.35   I think you get the idea.

The Wire returns this Sunday night with "Mornin' The Wire" - a show which will be remembered for its brilliant and darkly funny storytelling and memorable characters. The most recent episode "Bad Boys" and the first season finale, "Cleaning Up" stand tall as the high point of this remarkable show."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this film on a video-store TV in California (it's called "The Golden State" in the movie). It's a weird, fun little movie. I'd never seen a scene with a car crashing into a bridge (and there are a lot of bridge crashes in this movie), so it's pretty interesting to see it happen. In the middle of the movie there's a scene where the police show up, which seems a little silly. I suppose there's something going on, but I think it's a little too much for the kids who like to hang around the bridge. I've seen this movie a few times (at least three) and I can see how a lot may have been lifted from the television program "Cops."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am always a fan of action movies with lots of blood, guts and gore, so this movie is definitely a new favourite for me. I love the main characters and the crazy fight scenes and I love that the bad guys all wear big bad grins.   The whole movie takes place in the summer, when people who wear leather, big leather jackets and heavy leather boots are a rare sight and even more unusual is the smell of blood in the air.  I liked the main character, the way he is written, the style and how he is portrayed by his own character, James Lee Burke.  This is a very fast paced action movie and I would love to see this in a cinema near me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting to see a low budget version of the film by the directors who created the "Horse Whisperer" film series but boy was I wrong.   They really captured the movie in a way I've never seen before and I'm not talking about a cheap, generic look, I'm talking about the actual story they told.  It is basically the story of a man who has a horse which he rides to work every day.  The man's wife doesn't like it that he doesn't have a stable so he tries to make a deal with a rich man to buy the horse.  At the beginning of the story the man decides that he will give up his job and become a stable man to bring the horse up to his standard.  After three years of riding, he decides that it is time to retire.  He buys a new horse to replace his old, but as the old one dies, the new one is neglected and sick and doesn't meet his own standards.  Now it's the man's time to save the horse from himself and it is all based on how much the man can handle the horse before his time comes.  When the old horse dies, his wife begs the man to find a new one but he is reluctant.  While the old, sick horse is being taken care of, the old man is trying to figure out what to do with his old horse.    When he does figure it out, the man doesn't take the old horses name.  Instead he takes the name "Harmony" which is the horse's name.   In the beginning, he's not too good at riding the horse, but he eventually does get the hang of it.   Then his wife decides to buy him a new stable.   But when the man learns how to care for the horse he decides to quit his job.  At the end of the movie the old woman who gave the man his job asks him "Are you ready to retire?  Will you sell your job?   It was a good film and I didn't expect it to be a very good film but the story told was very good.  It is also not all good.   I was also disappointed by the story line as the director never took the time to write a story line for this film.  Some of the scenes were very generic looking and I could never see the point of any of them.   So much of
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie! It's well made and really a good looking movie. There's nothing bad about it.   It starts out slow, and I wasn't too impressed with it, especially because I'm not a big horror fan. I really thought the movie was going to be a bad one.  But after the first few minutes the movie got better, and the acting was much better.  It's still scary, but not in a real scary way.  The ending was a good one too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to the most famous film maker in the history of cinema, who comes before or after a great figure?   I am talking about one of the most creative, original, and innovative directors in the industry.   The Man Who Came to Dinner   - I watched this as a teenager during the silent era.  I was never the most well dressed and well paid student.  It was the first time I was able to watch any movie on my own in a theater.  During the movie we see a French army officer (Jean-Pierre Melville) who is invited to a dinner in the countryside with a friend (Adolphe Menjou).  During dinner they hear rumors of an unknown and deadly intruder who had killed a peasant family in the forest.  The policeman (Jean Marais) who had been sent to the scene in a police car is called in by the dinner guests.  He tells his fellow officers that there is a terrible massacre in the woods.  While they look for the bodies in the trees they notice a mysterious man dressed in a black cloak.  But the stranger has vanished when they reach the farm house.  Meanwhile the peasants in the house are being slaughtered in the kitchen.  Soon they hear screams in the night and the policeman comes running from the house to find an injured peasant (Paul La Barre).  He has been shot and is lying unconscious on the floor.  As he starts to regain consciousness he hears the voice of the mysterious stranger.  At that time I could not have imagined what I was witnessing.  This film is like no other movie that is on the screen.  If you are a film lover you have to see this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of the worst:  This is one of those films that make you laugh for a half hour, but then you say to yourself "What the hell, what happened to this movie?"  After all, there's a reason why this is called the worst movie of the decade:  The first half of the film is basically one long long dream of the protagonist's life:  He lives in an apartment and drinks his own urine.  There is nothing else in his life but drink and urine. How does he avoid getting raped, murdered and mauled by wild animals?  I don't want to be so unprofessional as to say that he lives a life that can only be described as bizarre and sad, but that's what this movie is:  (view spoiler)  So what do you get out of this film?  Well, for one thing, there is a woman named Ana that he meets after the first film.  She's just a girl with a lot of problems.  Her momma keeps her from going out, and her brother (played by the actor who is perhaps best known for his work in the TV series "The X-Files") is a jerk.  (View spoiler) Oh, and there's also a giant octopus that shows up and tries to eat the protagonist.  So, there are some things going on in this movie, but they are pretty much meaningless.  Sure, there were a couple of amusing scenes and some very good animation in the film, but there was nothing else.  It was very hard to put any real words in my review other than "I don't know why I watched this," and that's mostly because I found it extremely hard to stay interested in watching the movie, and I kept expecting something to happen that wasn't there, but it was impossible to make it any more interesting than it already was.   It seems like a terrible waste of time that is mostly annoying, but is worth watching if you find yourself in the right mood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an interesting and enjoyable movie which provides a rare insight into the life of a Soviet spy. I think I'd like to see more about this guy because the film is so unique, and if the movie had any plot at all, it would have been dull and uneventful. I only had one problem with the movie: the dialogue is so much worse than the film. There's only so much of it I can take, but it's just so poorly written that it's hard to take it seriously.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'll get to the plot:  When I first heard about this movie I didn't know what to expect. What do you think when you watch a good horror movie, a good thriller, a great comedy or a movie about a bad guy who comes to terms with his past?   My first impression of this movie is a good, old-fashioned, bad-guy-comes-to-terms-with-his-past-story-and-goes-around-doing-evil-bad-guy things kind of horror movie.   It has a sort of John Carpenter, I'm not sure what the director does, but the film works for me.       This is another movie that seems like it was made for TV. It has good effects and well-acted characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems like the world is coming to an end, not just in our lifetimes but probably in yours as well.   The story of this movie is basically about an ordinary person, a boy who has never seen a movie. His name is Tohru Satou (Tohru is short for Takehiro Satou, a name he liked) and the only thing he ever wants to do is go to a movie theater.  At the beginning of the movie we can see a movie star (it's not a huge star but a cute girl with cute hair) and her name is Kanae Aoi (Kanae is a character from the movie "Daisuki Kanojo" (Daisukigaku) where she is an idol). Toh and his friends (I'll give you a hint, Toh's group is quite small) are in the same movie as the star but in a different town so they are not on the same screen. The movie star is getting a little nervous about her new movie (it is about the same as the movie in our world except that it stars a girl) and I don't blame her.  The movie starts with a very interesting ending.  It is not a happy ending (Tatsuya Igarashi) is a little confused and he decides to look for a new job but before he can he falls into a river and his friend decides to save him.  That is where the movie begins to change from a simple story about a guy looking for his dream job to an adventure story.  As a kid this movie would have been an instant hit with me but now that I am older I remember it fondly for its humour.  I didn't love this movie and I didn' t hate it either but it was a good example of a good anime movie.

The film is full of great cinematography and acting, as well as some very witty dialogue.  All of the action in this movie is pretty intense.  But this is not the only reason to watch this movie. As a lover of history, the story of the film is also well done.  One of the best ways to watch a film like this is to sit back and let the story take over.

It has great direction, some great cinematography (I think it's called "lady in love", but that's not the correct title), beautiful music, a delightful cast, and a fun plot that includes a young boy and his mother's cat who just want to be friends.  I particularly loved the scene where the boy tries to make friends with a beautiful girl who is in love with a bird and her family is upset that she is dating a boy who is an outcast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in high school in 1990. I was into the heavy metal of Sabbath, Black Sabbath, Ozzy, etc. There was a song by Black Sabbath called 'Evil Never Dies'. I remember hearing that song, and it had something in it about the devil. I've never understood that. It's something in people that I find very hard to understand, as though it's a bad joke to make fun of people who are crazy about Satan.   At the time, I was obsessed with watching TV and reading about movies. I remember a TV movie called 'Dead End Street'. It's a black and white movie. The cast is good. It was good to look at, and well acted. It had a very cheesy soundtrack, which was fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of all time.   When I was growing up, in the late 70s, the horror movies seemed like they were going to be a thing of the past. They were the kind of movies that came out in the middle of the decade (in my house they were The Innocents and The Ghoulies) that showed a family having a hellish nightmare and were the only ones to come out during the "Dark Days." The only movie to come up near the top of the "horror" films was The Ring, which made the list. Then we had the slasher flicks. It was the early 80s and there wasn't a slasher movie with an axe to grind in sight. Sure, there were a few, but they were the exception. But that changed in 1985 when the first "slasher" movie, The Blair Witch Project, came out and turned horror movies on their heads. There was no one in the audience who didn't have a visceral reaction to the movie. It did the unthinkable; it showed the truth about a slashers' life. It showed that these people, even though they look scary, they are really not evil. You can't help but be scared by these people. They are people that you can love. They love their friends, their family, their mother, and they are good people. It's a very simple, real film. But it was a shocking film for the time. And it's still shocking today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has its fair share of bad acting, which makes it an easy target for "good movie" haters.   There are some good scenes, though.  Some bad people are bad in every movie (see: Johnny Utah), but in this movie they are a little less mean-spirited, and even more likable.  There is also a good soundtrack.  What can I say? It is a well-done and entertaining movie with good acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . There's a reason this is considered a classic:   . There's no better way to describe this film than with an old song:  I've been watching the classic television series "Dr. Who" for years. I've always been amazed at how the same character has changed so much since the show first started, especially after the show began to be popular in the 60's.   In the 60s, the Doctor's first name was William Hartnell. Now, in the 1970's, he is seen as a middle aged man with gray hair and a beard.  In an episode of "Dr Who," there's a scene where the Doctor is traveling to a planet called Gallifrey to save a scientist who has been turned into a primitive creature. During the flight, he loses a bit of blood and his Tardis breaks down.  The ship is soon repaired and the Doctor decides to travel back in time to save the scientist before the alien race turns him into a savage creature.  The Doctor arrives at the old-age Tardit, who is a female who lives in the castle where the scientist was turned into an animal.  This is the first time I've seen the Tardif in a role.  When the Doctor asks about the scientist, she says he was only a mere scientist and doesn't deserve all this grief.  He tells her that he has to do something to change the future and this is his reason for traveling back in the past.  It is a pretty weak movie.  There are some nice scenes where the TARDIS is destroyed and the Tards try to destroy it, and the scene of the Tarde getting ready to blast the Doctor with their laser cannon is a nice one.  As for the special effects, they're not outstanding, but I do like the way the Doctor makes a trip to the past, and he saves the scientist from his fate.  Unfortunately, this is another one of those movies that I wish it could be remade for TV.  If you can get your hands on a copy of the DVD, you won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A new story from a long-time old star:  I've always liked Robert Duvall's work. His performance in the old school western "The Outlaw Josey Wales" was as fine a one as you'll see in a movie. And if you haven't seen it then you should check it out.   There's plenty of action and a good script that's sure to please the die-hard Robert "The Kid" Duvalls. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an outstanding documentary about the rise and fall of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.   It tells the true story of a secret society that sought to infiltrate the government.  The documentary is based on interviews with historians and politicians as well as with people who lived through the Klan's rise to power.  This is a well made film that tells the whole story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a comedy that is in keeping with the tradition of a bad Western. I had no problem with the plot whatsoever. It's a typical story of a white man's attempt to fight the evil Indians. The main character has no problems with Indians, but he feels he has to go out and meet a nice Indian girl (the one who tells him "The white man doesn't like Indians" is the same woman who tells the white man that he has no right to call his daughter "Sister" since she is not a woman). She is a very likable, self-assured, and well-meaning girl. The film also has one of my favorite Westerns I've seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw the movie The Great Train Robbery (or The Great Robbery as it's also known) I was really impressed by the cinematography, especially with the light in the movie, the colors in the movies were beautiful and really helped the movie to a great atmosphere. The movie was good enough to make me see the film again and I think this is my favorite of the Robberies I've seen in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would recommend this movie to people who like movies and the best kind of movies are those where you can't help but laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good old fashioned, rousing, heartwarming, movie, packed with lots of jokes and action that are funny as hell, and fun to watch.   It's a pretty good movie, but it can also be a bit sentimental at times, and there is a strong theme of family ties that is very strong. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director of 'The Magnificent Seven' has once again managed to come up with a film that is a triumph from start to finish. The production values are high, the acting is well-done, the story is captivating, and the direction is perfectly in tune with the film's themes.   When a film gets to be a thousand words in length and it's not all about violence, then it has to be the most beautiful movie ever made.      I found 'The Golden Stool' to be an enjoyable and exciting experience.  It's filled with a great cast of characters, and is filled with well-executed action and a plot that is both complex and captivating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It may be easy to pick out the parts of the movie that most interested me, and that were most memorable to me: the movie begins with a scene which features an old man watching a movie in a movie theater. He picks up the remote, switches the TV to a movie showing at the local theater, and watches this for the next hour. As he watches the movie, he notes how much better it is than the previous movies, and how the acting is better than the acting at the previous theaters he saw it in. This is one of the few movies I can remember which I did not notice much of a difference between the actors playing characters of different ages and sexes. He concludes that the older, and more mature actors have an edge over the younger, and sexier, actors. The only problem is that the story takes place in an old movie theater (as opposed to a modern movie theater). I found that the fact that it was filmed in an ancient theater made it more interesting to watch than watching it in a modern theater.   There is a lot of sex in this movie: a lot. This one has not impressed me much, but the sex in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" has always been rather tame.  The two blondes in this film are in many ways indistinguishable from each other, except for their hair. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first film was made in 1952. It starred a great cast and they acted their asses off. The second film was even better and had a better cast, but the third film was a disappointment. It had the same actors, the same cast, the old and the bad, the big and the small, but worse. It was a bad movie. Not bad in any way, just bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If the plot is bad, then the cast will be bad, which is what I expected. I like the style and I like how they use the term'sport-touring' to describe their journeys. The music is well done.   I love a good mystery. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't say much about this movie. It is pretty good, and I wish they had used some of the stuff in the movie to make a more well-written movie. The acting is really good. It's a small role in a small part, but it still works. And what the hell did this movie teach me about life?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoy sci-fi or fantasy movies in a more realistic way, then this film will be a nice diversion. The acting is pretty bad, but I can't complain about that. It doesn't make the film a good one either. The director used many actors in his production, so it's hard to pick a favorite. There are some good scenes, but the last couple of minutes are a disaster.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie is "Trolls".   I never knew it until I watched this movie at age 18 and I realized that the main character is totally retarded.   He is a troll so dumb that he has no reason to think anything about the future and only wants to live life the way he knows it.  I think the film is about as good as the book it is based on.  This is a movie that should have been made 20 years ago.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a well-made movie.   It does not take the usual route of making people fall for each other in the hopes of being loved, but instead explores what it means to be a child without knowing that it does not feel that way.  It is a quiet film that makes for a very poignant and very moving movie.     This movie is very much like a dream. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a fan of superhero films. In fact, the only superhero film I've seen in the past 10 years was The Dark Knight Rises which, I admit, was a wonderful film that brought back a lot of great memories. I am excited to see what kind of stories Marvel and Disney can come up with next, though I am disappointed in how little I'm looking forward to this latest one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie a bunch of times, but I just recently came across a new trailer that has a lot of great shots and a lot more action than what I usually saw in the film.   It's set in the early days of WW2, but all is not well in the world.  One of the more famous films of the 1930s, but not a very good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is something about this movie that makes it special. The pacing is smooth and the humor is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it is still funny!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie a lot. It wasn't the strongest movie in the series, but it was pretty good, as usual. The only problem is it's not as good as the first one. It's basically the same plot, just with the main character being more mature, and more aware of his surroundings.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of bad movies lately and I can only guess that the only way that you can make a good one is to make bad movies.   This movie is a great example.  There is not a whole lot of plot and we don't really get a good look at what is happening in the real world.  It is the first time I have ever seen the "Wolverine" series and I was very interested in the movie.  I don't understand how they could have not gotten any of the actors to do the voice work.  The director, Terry Gilliam, had a lot more time to shoot the action scenes but he still did a terrible job with them.  This is the worst movie I have watched all year and I am looking forward to the next installment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting more.   As a horror movie, I didn't think it'd get past the first five minutes.  However, the rest of the film is very much of the same genre.  In a sense, it's a remake of a movie that was released in 1970:  The Blackout  (1978),  It's an adaptation of a film from 1974:  It wasn't a good film, but it was better than The Exorcist  (1973),  There's a good reason why it doesn't have the ratings that the remake has.  I wouldn't have thought that this would be much more than a poor adaptation of the original.  It is, however, not a bad film.  Despite its bad reputation, I have a lot of respect for the people who made this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of how a film can not only entertain a crowd, but also change the landscape of cinema.   I was shocked at how little I knew about the real world prior to seeing this film.  I loved every aspect of it:  the set design; the way the actors talk to one another; the chemistry between the lead actors; the acting; and so on.  I loved the way it was shot:  The main character is a man who has lost his memory. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very simple movie, but with a great story and great acting. The director and the actor are both brilliant. I like this movie because it gives you a good overview about the life of a boy who dreams about playing football.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie at midnight, when all other moviegoers were asleep. The whole movie is worth watching, but I found a couple of minor flaws.   The cinematography looks okay but it can be distracting at times.  The main character's speech, which sounds very rehearsed, also sounds very staged.  I have never felt so sick after watching a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really happy to say that the movie is actually really good!   The story is told from the eyes of the main character, a beautiful girl who has a very bad case of amnesia, and a bad relationship with her younger brother.   When the guy she is supposed to marry has a stroke and is put in a coma, the only one he could think of to wake up is his younger sister.  This is where the movie starts to get really good, the story develops really well, and it has a really cool ending!  The movie is also very funny, and I'm not sure why people hate it so much! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Last Boy Scout" is one of those "nice" movies which, on a first viewing, you would say that is so "good" that you will be glad to see it over and over again.  It is not that good and is not very good, but it is not bad and is better than it should be.   A nice movie and it is one you can like and not like, like the best movies I think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a good, good old-fashioned horror movie. I like films that have a strong story and a great cast, but above all I like scary movies that show a side of the human psyche that is rarely shown on the big screen. This is one of those movies.   A group of three teenagers in the Midwest go into an old farmhouse to watch a Halloween film. What happens is something that is not to be taken lightly. They begin to feel the pressure to survive this night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a beautiful film about a mother and son who have been separated since the first war. The son is a brilliant military mind who wants nothing but to go back to his mother. The mother is a very stoic and loving woman who only wants to be able to see the children once a year. The film is set in 1944 where the Nazis are still in control. They are still doing horrible things to people who look like the son. This is when we see that the mother and the son have been through a lot in the past few years. Their love is one of the few things that stands up to the horrific things that happen all around them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The film is very much like a cross between a Hollywood blockbuster and an old-fashioned adventure film. There are action scenes in a car, in the jungle, in a church, in an office, in some very exotic places. In addition to all that, a lot of drama is provided by the main character, the female character who is in love with a famous actor from whom she has just had an affair. The action is fast and exciting, as well as involving the heroine. There is a bit of romance, too. There's a good amount of music in this movie and a lot more than in a typical Hollywood movie. The special effects are excellent.   There are two main actors who play important roles in this film. Both of them are good at portraying the part and their character is well developed. The female character is given a bit more depth and a greater importance than she has usually had in Hollywood movies. The dialogue is good, but it doesn't make too many changes from previous movies in that field. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of this movie is based on the real life case of the notorious John Dillinger.   John Dillenger is an extreme psychopath. He was once on a death list for the FBI but got caught. The way he carried out his acts is beyond words.  I thought it was a good role by the young actor.  The ending of the movie is a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most of the time, this movie is not bad at all. It's not an action-packed movie with good special effects and nice acting either, but that is only part of the story. The whole story starts when a group of people from a place in the north of the earth are traveling in a cave, when they see a strange woman dressed in a black dress. And that is just the first of many strange things. This movie is just as strange, as well as intriguing. I won't give you any spoilers, I recommend you to watch this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie   was well written   It   started with a lot of   very funny   dialogues   and a lot  of  very sad stuff. It  was about a  family   who just lost a very beloved child. This child   never had any   bad habits or any  family problems and his father had to   pay a huge fortune for   his daughter's heart surgery. It was a very sad movie that   went to  some very sad places   like   dying family  who will never get together again   or a depressed woman who cannot make up her mind   about a new lover.   I   really   enjoyed this movie  and I  really hope it   continues to be in my life   forever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I was in college when this movie came out. I watched it for the first time recently and I haven't felt this excited to watch another movie since the 80s. This is a great example of why the 90s was an absolute bonanza for animation.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is interesting, and it has a lot of humor to it. The dialogue is dry, but it does give the movie a certain charm. The actors do a good job.   A little less acting, and a little more good story telling would be welcome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a beautiful film with a wonderful director and a wonderful story.   It is very much about the relationship between an old, depressed writer and a young woman who loves him.  It shows the difficulties of love and the many difficulties of aging.  The plot is very well-developed, with a lot of great performances, a lot going on at one time and the whole time we are aware of the tragedy that surrounds them.  We get to see this beautiful story unfold from the beginning.  It ends with a nice ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my favorite movie in the whole genre.   The first thing that strikes you is that it is set during the Civil War in a town called Houlton.  What is it about the Civil war in Houlon that makes it so great?  Houlons was very small and the people who lived there were very conservative and very religious, which would fit perfectly for the southern states during the war.  I was a bit of a geek when I was little so I can't even describe the movie in words.  The movie is well produced with a good story line.  This movie is made for people who enjoy good stories about good people who are doing good things.  My favorite character in the movie is the young girl who is the only person who really knows what the real problem is in Hounton. She doesn't know who to believe, the authorities or the rebels, so she makes up her own mind.  But she doesn't make that up alone.  There are other important characters such as the local sheriff, who is in a fight to the death with the Confederate commander.  In the end, he is going to die, but then something happens and it all comes together.  A little bit of violence and a little bit humor and you've got a winner! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I have to say I loved this movie. I have never seen a movie like this, I mean I've seen some good movies like it, but never a movie where everyone is having a good time and laughing at all the stupidness.   The movie takes place in a country where they have a very high standard for education. Kids are allowed to go to school and read and write.  The country is very small and there are two main characters that are just about the only people who do not think the way the country is run.  After seeing the movie I thought it would be a good idea to watch the show, but I couldn't, I couldn' t get the image out of my head.  I am really glad I watched this movie though, it has brought back a lot of memories of when I was a kid and this movie made me think of some of those old times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie, it's a fantastic example of how a director can make a good story look like a bad movie in a few seconds. It's not really a bad story, it just has its problems, and it's very slow. It was pretty sad, as I recall, with a pretty bad villain.   However, it does have a good ending, and I can't say I didn't enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie ever made about a guy who is a man of few words.   It's kind of like "My Hero" without the silly humor.  It takes place during a period of the Cold War in the late 50s and the early 60s.  The main character is a high school teacher who has been teaching since the 50s. He is married to his wife for 15 years.  He is a real man of his word, who does what he says he will do.  This movie is a great American classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great for all the usual reasons: great story, good characters and a cool special effects.   In fact, the special effects were really cool and worked really well.  The characters, including a very angry one, were the best part. The action scenes were very good and the ending was just perfect: a fun but cool twist, which I will definitely remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie quite entertaining. The story is a little convoluted and hard to follow, but it's quite a funny movie with some good laughs and a couple of really good moments. The special effects are a little cheap, but not the worst in the movie.   The ending is a good bit disturbing, but I can't say that this movie is very strong on the horror front. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite scene in the movie is the "Oy!" scene where the girl is having a fight with the boy's father. It is so awesome, but also kinda disturbing.   The girl's parents are from a wealthy family who are very proud of their daughter. The kid's father is a little old, and her mother is a big, fat old woman who is not very nice to the kid's brother. In the movie the girl's mother keeps her very small, and she's not allowed to dress a little bit in a more colorful outfit. Her father and her little brother are going to be allowed to do what they want to the girl. The father is about to throw a stick in her face with a "Nana" look to him. When he says "NANA" he is referring to the little girl.  The father has been trying to get the girl out of her room since they started the fight. He takes the kid, takes her to his car, and throws her out. The girl runs after the kid.  The kid stops running. He turns around. He looks her in the eye. And he yells, "Nanas!"       You get the point.  And as he yells "NANNAS!" and tosses the stick, the girl lets out a scream like she was stabbed with a sword. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are many great movies that deal with the theme of faith. These are movies that you can't stop thinking about.   I think of the movie as a meditation on faith, because the main character, Mr. Anderson, is very religious.  Mr. Azevedo has a strong background in Theological study, as he comes from a very well-respected family in Latin America. But, Mr Anderson's faith, and his desire to help others, are so strong that he has little to no sense of irony.  This movie is not funny in the slightest, but there is something about it that is very compelling.  There is no doubt about it: The movie is pure religion and not humor.  If I have seen only one movie in the last year, I am sure it was this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first of the Star Wars movies that I saw when I was about 14 years old. I remember loving it so much because it was really cool. I am sure the reason I liked it so intensely is because my mother was a HUGE sci-fi fan. I loved how they made the films look like they were straight out of a sci- fi movie. I also liked that there were aliens, space ships and spaceships in the background.   Star Wars: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, it's hard to believe that this is the first time that an English-language movie has been translated to Korean in the history of Hollywood (and that a Korean movie is about a cop). However, we have no complaints. The movie is a good example of the type of low-budget Hollywood flicks that were made during the post-World War II era: it's about a small town in the American heartland (about 80,000 people), where the local high school is haunted by a series of grisly murders that take place during the middle of the school day. The most horrific murders involve the dismemberment and dismembered dismemberer of a young girl, who is then found buried under the school gym. The school janitor, a good friend of the sheriff's deputy, finds out about the crimes, but he is soon arrested by the local authorities. After a year in jail, he is released with the help of a friend, but soon discovers that this "good cop" has been playing with something else.   This movie isn't exactly my favorite, but there's something to be said for a movie made in the days before the "good guy" cop was an invention of a studio marketing department.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was shot in 1976 and 1976 is not a very good year for big budget films. This film would have been better suited for 1970. It has a very unique look, especially for a low budget movie. The first act is really interesting. It's about a little boy who wants to be a pilot. The child has a fascination with flying and learns that there are special "wings" which make you fly even faster. A new plane is built for him and he goes to train. His teacher is impressed with him and his flying. He eventually gets the girl to marry him and they have a son. He then wants to fly again but he is too old to fly. The little boy dies after the plane he is in crashes. He is brought back to life by an old woman and he has a dream of flying again. After that he meets another little boy and that child is called Peter Pan. He dreams that he is Peter Pan and when he dreams he is the boy he saw when he died. He tells the boy what he needs to do to make him fly again. Eventually, the little boy makes a new plane. He uses a trick which is very unusual in airplane flying. After a while he crashes his new plane and he must live on the street to survive. He makes a friend and they work together to get back in the sky. After he is finally flying again, he is a big hero. He flies to California. He lives on the beach and watches people swim. His flying skills are great and he tries to take his flying lessons from a man who is not really very good. But he gets the lessons anyway and learns a lot about flying. Eventually he goes off to fight pirates. He takes his flying skills to the next level and kills a pirate ship. He gets his flying license and goes off for a life in the air. After many adventures he eventually has a big dream. He wants to get married and have a family. His mother is against the idea of getting married because of his age. He fights with his mother but ultimately he succeeds and marries the mother of his future child. They live happily ever after.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I'd say the director and writer, Kevin Smith, is the most talented writer that I've seen.  I've never seen a movie with so much good jokes and the best actors in the world.   Kevin Smith has never been more entertaining.  My only complaint is that there were a few too many references to video games (although, they were used well).   Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple of years ago a lot of people had a hard time understanding why this movie could exist, but now I'm seeing it a lot more and I understand it's a lot better than its original release.   It's not a movie with a plot (as in the original film, where the story was a little overbearing) but it's pretty much an action movie in the best tradition of them.  The stunts are executed well, the stunts are well executed, the action sequences are well done (the climax of the film is pretty much a classic).   The best of the stunt work are from Bruce Willis, the best of his action is pretty ridiculous.  This movie doesn't really care about the details.  There are no big action set pieces, no special effects (the effects are more CGI than actual stunt work)  The story itself is a simple one, but very memorable, it's very much about a couple of men who decide to rob some people and then kill themselves.  It isn't the most original story (although I think it's more original than most of the other action films of the day), but the story is a lot about the character relationships, and even in the most ridiculous scenes there are some very good and memorable moments.  To me the best scene in this film is when Bruce Willis and a bunch of people go into a building and start doing all kinds of things, then the film slows down because there is a car running down the street, Bruce Willis (or is he the guy in the suit?) runs up to the car and tells the guy it's time to turn around and drive away (it was a stunt shot to make Willis look heroic), then Bruce Willis grabs a couple guns and starts killing everyone, and in the end, a woman jumps out and says "You killed my boyfriend, you fucking coward!"   If you like good action films this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why, but it's just a very, very good movie, and I don.t know why I didn't see it sooner. It's a short film, so you don't get to see much of the characters' story. But you do see them and get to understand what they are up to. It is an interesting look at a very unusual type of person, a "torturer," a person who has the mind of a child and who enjoys the most vile, disgusting crimes, but he likes to make others suffer as much as he does. You see, he's a person with a horrible mind, and a sadistic mind, too. His sadism is not of the violent kind, like some other "torts." His sadistic nature is of the sadistic type that knows exactly what it is to hurt others, and to be hurt. His brain is made up of the most twisted, vile things. He knows what he is doing is wrong and doesn't care. In fact, he enjoys hurting, and has no problem about hurting others, even if it's for his own amusement. He loves to torture animals, especially cats. As a child, he was an only child, and never knew what he would like to be when he grew up. He wanted to be like his mother, who was a professional artist. She lived a life of luxury, with a beautiful home and a dog that was much beloved by her. He never knew that his life would be like that, but when his mother died, he became sad and sad because of his own ignorance. He was a sad, sick, sick man who hated himself and was determined to change himself. He went to an eccentric doctor and became a human guinea pig in his experimental experiments on human psychology. He suffered great emotional turmoil, as a result of his experiments. During this, he also had a chance encounter with the mysterious woman and her dog. The man who was studying him became fascinated with him and wanted to help him. However, his experiments continued, and soon he had a dog and a cat, and they became his best friends. He got his first job as a veterinarian, and after a while, he felt the animals liked him better than he liked them, so he took them to live in his house. He became the house dog, and he found it more comfortable than being in a cage. Eventually he got to the point that he enjoyed the life of

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes a slightly different, but still extremely effective, approach to horror with a story line that is very well executed.   This movie also is a good horror film in general.  What really makes it unique is that it has its own twists and turns along the way that really keep you thinking and guessing.  A great horror movie and definitely recommended for those who like their horror a little different.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was hilarious and fun.   The humor and the plot twists were just out of this world and the movie had all kinds of great songs.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good time and has a good sense of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie on several occasions.   It was good enough to get me through an entire college summer.  It is good enough, but nothing better.  I would be satisfied if the movie was in black and white, which is not a bad thing, but it is not for me.  There were a lot of very bad actors who didn't work well.  You never feel anything for the main character, he is so flat he feels like a cartoon character.  As good as it looks, it is too bad there are so many actors who can't act.  In conclusion, I recommend this movie to those who want something to look at and who like the idea of being involved in a school shooting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was like a nice cold spring night in my old hometown with a big and cozy movie theater.  The cast was very good and the actors did a nice job at playing the role of a good old New England family, one of many that could easily be found in any small town on Long Island.   A real good family with a real good man at the center of it all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a movie aficionado, but I found   this one to be good fun, and I am glad I saw it.   (   It's the perfect time for a movie: Christmas eve.  I think I saw this one the night before, in the theater, because a neighbor and I wanted to watch the new Disney flick: The Little Mermaid.  Our neighbor is a huge Disney fan, and he brought us to see the Disney movie, The Little Merfolk.  It was really cute.  We loved it. I don't think I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but this was good.  This movie was not a huge hit for Disney, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.  And   it's the classic Disney movie: the mermaid princess comes to town, finds a fish and a man, and a beautiful mermaid.  ( It's always nice to see a classic movie and not see any changes in it. This was pretty much unchanged, and still the same in a way.  )   We had a great time.  In the movie, we had a mermaid who lived in a castle. There was a princess who was married to a man that would never know her, so she had to go out to sea, which was dangerous because there were giant whales who would kill her. The mermaid saved the princess. And then she was left with a very evil prince.  They had a really interesting time together. The Mermaid came to a beautiful island that was also beautiful.  The island was full of mermaids, and there was a lovely little island with lots of merpeople.  When the princess wanted to go to sea to find her prince, she went there and met a merperson. The prince was a really nice man, but he also liked to eat merpeople, which made the princess a little afraid.  But eventually, she saved the merperson from being eaten, and they then went to a castle and found out there was no prince there.  So the merwoman (the mermaid) made the merpeople fight to the death to see who would be the prince. But when they were ready to fight, a bad thing happened: a great big monster came and ate a lot of them. And so the mer woman had to run away from the monster, so as to keep him from eating all of them, and she did so, but she fell in

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like a lot of movies that are shot like a movie made out of a novel (the only difference is that there is no story). And this one is. But it's just so well made that the film is pretty entertaining. The story is a little too long and sometimes a little cliched, but this movie is very good and worth your time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good one. It is a nice movie, I enjoyed it a lot.   I like how this movie is about the life of a rich man who is married to a very smart woman.  I can see how the guy is a bit too smart to marry a dumb woman like this. But at least this woman is not a dumbass.  The story is very good. I can understand how a movie like this has become a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's good. It's a well-made, darkly funny movie about a man (Paul Giamatti) who goes through a period of introspection about his life and how he thinks it is going to turn out. It is dark, but Giamatta is one of those guys who can make even dark things look good. In fact, this is a very dark movie with a strong moral. This is definitely one of the more dark comedies of recent years. Giamati is a good actor, and he is clearly a great man, but he is too much of a good guy in the movie. I'm not a fan of comedy where the humor is aimed at people who have less of a life than you, and where the guy is always so happy. That doesn't mean the movie is bad, but you have to ask yourself a question: Why did he have to take up residence in this dumpy motel room when he could have just been anywhere else?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would give this movie a 10 out of 10, if it was available on DVD.   The movie is about a former U.S. soldier who is now a man who's in the war zone (in Iraq) and who's on the run from the U. S. Army. He's got to find out who murdered his wife and then he has to escape from the war-zone in which his former wife is still alive. He has to do this while dealing with the U.S. Army and his own past which is still a secret. He manages to run away but then it turns out the Army doesn't want him to escape, they want to capture him and they kill one of the soldiers that comes to rescue him. But he escapes before the Army does that, so the movie ends with his still on the loose.  This is a good action movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best I've seen.   I didn't feel as if I was watching a movie with a bad ending, I knew that the ending would be disappointing for sure, but I still found myself rooting for the characters.  To be honest, I don't know what makes this film special; maybe it is just because it was made back in 1986, but it's a really good story.  It doesn't hurt that the film is directed by another great director like Sam Raimi (not to be confused with Raimio, Sam's older brother), and the script is also great (it's the best script I've read in ages, in my opinion).   Just like in most Raimis' films, there are some great and funny scenes (the best one of all time is "The Man Who Loved the Most" starring Bruce Campbell) as well as some great sequences and character moments.  I also don't remember a single bad scene or a stupid scene.  The only thing that bothered me is that it seems that the movie is missing some classic movies (like E.T., The Abyss, and Night of the Living Dead) and the ending didn't even make me cry.

I am still in shock about what happened to the girl who was kidnapped.  It was so funny!   I liked the movie so much and will continue watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a good film about a man who goes to the United States for his honeymoon. He's a good man, but in the wrong place. The movie is not too long but that is only because we see a lot of action scenes. It is about a fight between two men in the woods where they have to be out of their minds to fight like that. The story does not take a lot out of me but it's good to see two characters who are so crazy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really not sure how much to take in with this movie.   It is an odd mix between western and war movies.  The action sequences are excellent with some of the most thrilling sequences to be found in a western.  I was also impressed by the way the lead man handled the situation and how he was treated by his people.  He seems to be a real human being and is not out to kill all the other men.  This is certainly a very worthwhile movie and one I have seen and I am interested to see if the director can make another movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a reason that the whole country is obsessed with American History channel and this film is a prime example of it.   What a movie   It is easy to follow all the rules of the old school Hollywood.  Even though the story is based on a true event, it is still a good story and one that is filled with surprises.  This movie is about a bunch of young boys who play in the park and one day the mayor takes them to a cemetery to tell them a story about a great general and a little girl.  A lot of the plot is based around how the children get to know each other, and how they all have different stories about themselves.  The film takes a lot of shots at people like the mayor and the police, but it also deals with other real issues such as racism and injustice in the South.  One of the best things about this movie is how it really tells the story from the boys' point of view and not through the police or the old people in the film.  It also features some great acting from all the boys, and a few standout performances by a couple of the girls.  I recommend this movie to people who love a good comedy with a little bit of mystery and a good dose of violence.

This movie also has a nice soundtrack, some of the songs are good, and there are several action sequences and a nice story line. There is also a nice, very good, scene in the beginning, where a girl and her parents are running along a road and she is hit by a car and is run over and killed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is not often that a movie, a great movie, can bring out such a strong reaction.   The story is very good, the characters are all very well defined, the acting is excellent.  This is not to say that it is without flaws or that it will not be appreciated by the larger audience of older audiences.  For the most part, the older audiences will appreciate the older characters and they will be able to relate to a lot of the situations and to what it is like for people who are less fortunate than they are.  The younger audience should not be intimidated by the older generation.  If they don't like the acting of the younger characters, then they will not enjoy the movie at all.  As far as the plot is concerned, it is a very well written movie.  There is a lot that is worth seeing.  However, I think that it would have been best if the younger audiences had been more open to the older ones.  I enjoyed it very much.  It was the best of the three films that I saw at the DGA theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an incredibly funny and sweet little movie about a family of four living in a house with a bunch of old ladies.   The three young daughters play games at the end of each day to pass the time and try to get a few hours of sleep.  The two oldest girls, Violet and Rose, are in the early stages of adolescence.  Violet is a very tomboyish girl, but a natural leader, who will do anything to get along and fit in.  Rose is an over sensitive girl who gets angry easily and is very difficult to get to know.  It's funny when they are playing and it's hilarious to see how Rose can get Violet to laugh and be in on the joke.  While I thought this was a sweet little film, it was really fun and a good way to pass a few days. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, my buddy and I watched this movie for a laugh.   It was good.  It wasn't like any other comedy, in that it was a comedy set in a hospital, and then it had a subplot that was not really part of the main story.  But, it was very funny.  I didn't understand what was so funny about it, but I didn the jokes and I liked them.  The movie was made in the sixties, so it was probably intended as an older movie, rather than an impressionistic, silly movie.  There was one bit that made me laugh out loud.  That's because the old lady who was the patient's wife, looked very, very old.  My only comment about this movie: It was too bad that the plot was so lame, so that we didn't learn a thing about the people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a kid I remember one time my mother's sister bought me a new video camera. I was always fascinated with movies and TV shows in general. I used to watch TV on a regular basis, and my mother always tried to get me to watch a movie with her on weekends. That particular movie with the two guys who were trying to stop a serial killer and all the gruesome murders was too much for me to handle so I would always find a way to escape. I don't remember the name of it so you'll have to google it.   There's just something so dark and evil about the man in that movie. I'm sure there was a lot of blood, gore and horror involved, but I don not think so because this movie is very simple and just a well acted story about two people who get into a terrible situation and one of them has to take over and take out all the bad guys.

After a trip to the future she is stranded in the past where she is taken in by an eccentric old man who becomes a great mentor to her.  The film isn't as good as the trailers make it out to be but it's a great movie with an amazing ending.  This is a must see movie.

The film follows a man named William Rene and his son, William Jr., who have been sent off to college by their mother. They learn that there is a "new breed" of killers that now prey on women, and that they have to be destroyed.    It's a long and bloody thriller and it's so good that I'll be paying close attention to every single new trailer and poster for the movie when it's released next year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this movie when it was first released in 1979 and thinking it was a really good movie, which is probably a little too harsh a judgment as the movie has a few things that work a little better in the original version.   The story takes place in a small Texas town where the local police force is led by a man who is as tough as they come. He has a brother that is also a member of the police force, but for some reason the police in this movie always have trouble arresting him and one night they manage to get him in trouble for a murder that he committed years before. So this leads to a rather long chase through the small town where each of the local citizens (and a few strangers) must get him to pay the price for his crimes and the police are not exactly happy about it either.  I will admit to having some problems with this movie and that is mainly because the main characters and their actions are so generic and the film does not really have any interesting characters.  There is not much to say about this.  When this was first put out there was a brief promotional campaign but the movie was hardly promoted at all.  There was a film festival screening in Austin (which is where most of this movie was filmed) and the director and co-star (who are not really featured in the movie) did nothing but sit in the audience to watch the audience.  I had to watch this movie several times to get a decent sense of the film's structure and to understand what the main theme was.  The ending is not a pleasant surprise either and the last scenes are more than a little contrived, but the story is not terribly good.  This has become a movie that is just a little bit too generic to be enjoyable, and even though it has some decent action, there is a reason this movie never got a really big release.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is very complicated and doesn't always make sense (at times, it doesn't really matter). It starts with an old lady (in her 80's) who has been living in a hotel since WWII. Her daughter had recently been born, and she now lives in a small home with her husband and son. The son is an aspiring musician. The mother does most of the domestic work, and the two boys are still young and inexperienced. This movie is more than an hour long, but it is very enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A pretty good movie, in my opinion.   I enjoyed this movie a lot and even though I do not normally like action movies. I think I like this movie more than a lot of action movies I know.  It is not overly difficult, in fact it is fairly easy, and not overly violent.  The movie is based around a little girl and her father.  When she is young she has a lot trouble with her father and then later on when she is in her teens she has more trouble with the town people.  One of the things that the movie does that I thought was interesting, but didn't really take off, is it made you feel bad when the little girl's father dies.  Also when she was a kid she had a little dog who was a real good dog.  There is one scene at the end of the movie that is very moving and I thought it was very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of The Day The Earth Stood Still before this, but now I have. This is not exactly a great movie, but it is quite funny and well acted. It's set at an international conference on the environmental dangers of global warming, and the scientists of the conference are divided on what to do about it. But, in the end, they're all so worried about global warming that they make an agreement to save the Earth by 2035.   What really gets me is when one of the scientists (the only one we see at the conference) says to the others: "It's like the earth is the earth, and all the other animals are people... "   And it is, with a few small alterations.

The only problem is, there are a lot more scenes like these than scenes that really make a difference.  This is not a bad movie. It does a good job of showing off the actors and actresses.

I was also surprised that the story did not go anywhere in the end, which I have not expected. This was a good watch and I hope we get to see a sequel to this, even if it is only for one movie.

I mean the reviews on the internet are always "sad, sentimental and sad". The film is very good as well. I do see what they did with the story though. They really are making a film that has a very strong message about a very different time in our country's history. The story is told from the point of view of a man who is living in a very bad situation. His son is missing. He is always looking for him. His neighbors are cruel. There is a very sick woman that lives next door to him. One day she is hit by a car and dies.   The man does not understand why. There are some interesting and different people that play a part in the film, including a man that is a former gangster and a group of women who are very attractive and who he falls in love with.  This movie is very slow, at times very quiet and in some other cases very violent. The director is very strong and the cinematography is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll say it up front, this is a pretty damn good movie. This is a good, dark fantasy movie with a good story. And, it's about a man who has to be in jail and is forced to keep an animal that can only say "yowch"   The film is divided into two segments, the first segment is more of a horror film that focuses on the man's mental breakdown and the second segment focuses on a girl (a girl, by the way) who is having a bad day, and how much of a bad ass she is when she's angry.   This is my favorite movie ever, period.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie from its first minute:  The story is quite funny:  But the most interesting thing in this movie is the story line and the characters:  The film is about a poor, but talented magician who is on a real bad run of luck. His only hope is to get a job as a teacher in a fancy school in a big city, while his family lives in a tiny village.    There is a lot of tension:  This movie has a lot to offer:  Firstly, it has a good sense of humor:  It has some great laughs (especially during the magic show), but also has some emotional moments:  These scenes are all really well done:  There are a lot more than four moments when the magic shows us that there really is magic, when it all seems real.  And then there is the film's plot:  I love how the magician's actions are a mixture of both the real and the unreal.  There's lots of comedy scenes that make this movie stand out:  When the magician finally solves the riddle of how a tree is going to end up in a pool:  He goes through some difficult steps and seems to succeed, but he's really not successful.  He's really getting closer to the solution.  After that, he realizes that he doesn't have a clue how to actually do the trick:  So he continues trying to figure it out, but no matter how he tries he still can't get the right answer:  After all of this he realizes something:  That it's not a problem he can solve with magic.  Instead, the problem is that the school is a very expensive place to live.  When he finds out about this, he decides that the best thing he can do to show them that he's not just a poor magician is to start his own magician school.  Then, he finds that the rich kid is trying to steal his show and that's how the first battle with the poor magician begins.  While it's nice to see some good action scenes, it's also nice to have some nice comedy scenes, which really helps the movie to stand out.  This whole movie is made to entertain:  For the majority of the movie we don't get to see the good magic, but just watch the poor magicians who are trying to pull the right trick from a book.  The acting is good, the music is good and this

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful movie with a unique concept.   It is a combination of horror, science fiction and romance.  The director David Cronenberg is a genius who brings a lot of different elements together.  A mysterious alien, a woman on the verge of death and a very strange ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is simple, it takes place in a small town in the desert, which has a high number of prostitutes. Some of them, like the one in the picture, have to work for a small local bar owner. The bar owner has a problem that he can't seem to have any guests come to his house for a drink. But there is one person who makes him feel at ease. That person is a young woman with a beautiful smile.   This is one of the best Mexican movies I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am in love with this movie!   It reminds me of an American Beauty - where a man falls in love and falls out of love.   That man is named Steve (who looks a lot like Billy Zane).   Steve is the most wonderful man I have ever known!    He is full of energy!  He is very funny!  He is generous, loving, generous, caring, honest, generous and funny!   His name is not Steve.  He has a name that sounds like a cross between "Steve" and "Vinnie"    His story is about a man who falls in and out of the arms of a woman who is much more than just a woman.  She is an absolute goddess!  I really loved this movie - the love stories, the humor, the drama and the heart.  There is a lot of heart in this movie.  It's hard to believe I like a movie about a heartbroken man falling in and ou it's a very hard movie to watch   What I liked the most about this movie was the heart, the heart of the woman and the love. I found this movie funny.  I laughed at the way Steve fell in love. There were some funny moments in the movie. I thought I would love the movie - until I watched it again.  This movie has a great ending, but there is so much more left to say and I would have loved to have had more time with this great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those good films that you don't really feel a bit bad about watching.   I have to say, the only time I felt bad about the whole movie was during the opening credits.  I like to watch movies that have an open and cheerful spirit about them, and this movie is certainly a good example.  The movie is a bit slow and long (I don't even remember how long it was), but I enjoyed the whole thing, and found it to be entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was the very first one that I saw.  I am a huge fan of sci fi, especially space opera.   What really attracted me to this film was the fact that it was based on a very real true story.  With this being said, the movie is very much like a war movie.  There are also scenes of the movie that are very entertaining and a little surreal.  While I can't say that this movie was an all time classic for me, it was a great start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first time seeing a movie which is not in the comedy genre and there are some funny scenes, but it is a story about love. It tells the story about how the two sisters meet the man who they think is their father. He turns out to be a murderer, they start to suspect each other, and they go to see the mother of the one who killed their father to confirm it. She tells that the man is not their father but a friend. In the end, the whole thing is a dream where the sister has an affair with the son of the killer. The best part of the movie is the ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part of this movie is the last few minutes, where the movie tells the story of a person trying to live a normal life in an insane world. The way the movie captures how surreal the world is is quite unique.   It is the movie that shows us the reality of the world, and how crazy it really is.  I was really disappointed when I saw that it was so over rated.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is not a good horror movie, not even by the low standards of the "horror" genre, but a very, very enjoyable one. If you want a very good movie that is very, VERY scary, this is the one.   The story is about a woman named Laura (played by Lisa Kudrow, who can always be counted on to play a bad girl) who gets trapped in a house she owns by her husband, a very successful man. After Laura's brother (played beautifully by John Ritter) finds his wife in the bathroom being raped by a man who calls himself "The Ghost of Christmas Past" (a very clever title), she decides to find the killer and avenge the brother's death. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An old movie, but very good. The director uses an extremely interesting technique. The characters have an uncanny way of looking at each other as they are playing the piano in a concert hall:  This is an extremely well-directed movie. The story is simple. A young girl lives in the village with her father and older sister. One day she is walking with a friend to the village church. When she hears a piano playing in the church it strikes her as an odd and unusual thing. She sees the man playing the music, sees the strange and eerie colors, sees a girl who looks like a cross between a woman and a man, and suddenly sees her father walking towards her. It is clear from the very beginning that the girl is not a normal person. She has a very strange mind and a peculiar disposition. Her father is a man with a sad and tragic past. The two sisters, especially the youngest sister, are also peculiar and unusual people. As the girl walks along, a mysterious man, wearing a yellow suit with red stripes and who is always smiling, sits behind her. He listens to the music and watches the people pass by. The man tells the girls that it is a good time to go home. The girl sees a young girl who is wearing a black veil and looks very beautiful. She says something that strikes the girl as very odd. This is the moment that it all becomes very clear to the girl and to her father. As they turn away, they see the girl's mother. The mother does not look the least bit like a woman. She is rather hideous and ugly. The woman seems to be a cross among women. The young girl is frightened and runs away. The father, with his long, red coat and tall hat, follows the girl. The three of them walk back home. As their paths cross, the father sees a man and, after a brief moment of confusion, he sees a little girl who carries a very small handbag. The child is pale, very thin, and very pale-skinned. There is nothing but a very little, very pale handbag at the little girl's feet.  The strange things that the father and the girl are seeing and experiencing seems to have an effect on the two older sisters. The older sister falls very ill and is dying of cancer. The disease is rapidly killing her. The men of the village are not very helpful in treating her illness. They tell the woman to get out of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that is so good it's hard to believe it's made up of real people.  It's set in London during the second world war, and stars two actors who look like they belong in a farce: Bernard Cribbins, who is obviously an imbecile; and Harry Lydon, who's supposed to be a dandy, but is so boring that the whole thing looks like an episode of a bad, British comedy-drama.   It was an instant classic in the '50s, a sort of precursor to  The Dick Van Dyke Show.   For some reason, people who see it in the original are convinced that there's an awful lot of sex going on, because the lead character, David Sneddon (Richard O'Brien), is an all-around moron and spends a great deal of his time getting drunk and falling down stairs.  He's also a duffer who wears the same clothes all the time, and is prone to making embarrassing mistakes.  This kind of actor is in decline by now, but the best thing about this movie is the title: Snedden's (played by an uncredited James Brolin) boss, Major Sir William (Robert Parkinson), is in charge of an organization which develops new weapons of war. Sneddons is a genius, but doesn't want to join, so the Major arranges a job for him to work for the organization, which turns out to be called the ODESSA Project.  There's plenty of sex, but so much of it is just going on: there's a lot of kissing, a lot naked people and a lot ducking and weaving around one another.  This is a movie with very little moral: Smeddons just wants to get on with his job, but when his boss tries to get him to join the project he doesn't like it and tries to quit.  ODESZA is like a cross between a comedy-sitcom and a real-life comedy, because in the last few minutes of the movie, Smeddsons gets his job back and is allowed to do what he really wants to do. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely sucked into this movie and I don't even know why. I didn't know anything about this other than it was about a boy who died in a car accident when he was 12.   It seemed so realistic and scary. I also felt for the characters and their problems.  And of course, there was a really cool car chase and gun battle!   The movie left me feeling cold and indifferent toward all of the characters.  There are a lot of great things in this movie, but unfortunately, there were a lot more problems that needed to be fixed before I could continue watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really good! I am not sure why this movie is good. Maybe its the plot. It has lots of funny and touching moments. There are many jokes in this movie which will make you laugh.   I do not remember any story in this film.  One funny moment in this story: the wife was walking the dog on the streets of Boston. Suddenly a guy tried to take a photo of her. She was shocked and scared because he was really big. After he is done, he is gone. That was a funny scene. There is a funny film which is not like other movies.  If you like comedy, you will like this movie. If you dont like comedy you will not like this film either.

But I just found out that this film has the original "Kaka" on its soundtrack! This is a movie that just never stops.   "Kaki" is a very strange little girl with a big brain, and a love for kiddy movies and silly toys. She lives with her widowed mother, whose life is totally taken over by a "possessed doll" named Kiki. Kaki's mother, who thinks Kiki is a doll, keeps her out of the house all day and all night, so Kaki can "play" with her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic of American comedy,   The movie follows an up-and-coming comedian,  whose career is going nowhere fast, but he wants to get out of the city. He has a show on the big city stages,  which he is hosting while his wife and children stay home to raise their children.   His performance  doesn't get any better after the opening number. He finally takes a risk by turning in a sketch about  a group of black people trying to rob a bank. The black people are wearing white T-shirts and jeans.  The bank is manned by a white female security guard.  She calls out for the bank manager,  who is an old man,  and when she asks him to follow her, he takes off and leaves.  When the manager appears in the bank to question them,  the black people just laugh in his face.  He eventually asks them if  they are afraid of him.  It's just the start of an unforgettable evening.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title should give you all the answers to how this movie plays out.   There are a few things in this film that may sound familiar:  The theme song is "The Time is now" by Peter Gabriel.  The story follows a man that is in love with a woman (Juliette Binoche).  The other character is a woman named Dottie (Julianne Moore).   I don't have a ton of positive things to say about this movie.  I found the script to be a little generic and the scriptwriters just weren't funny enough to make up for the movie's lack of good actors.  It's hard to tell who the actor is and even harder to figure out the film's plot.  This film could have been a very fun and entertaining comedy but it ends up as a little dull.  One scene I particularly like is when the two men are getting ready to go to the airport and the narrator is trying to convince them to leave town for a better life.  What I'm trying to say is this movie is a fun idea with a couple of decent performances but it is a little too generic to make the movie really work.

There are a lot of jokes and one of the funniest parts is when the mother asks the son why the dad had sex with his daughter, he says "because that's the way they do it in my town."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very solid film. I would say it has everything that is good about it: good action scenes, good stunts, good character development, and good humor.   In particular, the first action scene is excellent, I'm a big fan of that particular scene and the rest of it too.  As a big sci-fi fan I like the direction.  It is interesting in that the movie does not follow the main plot, but the subplot.  A few times the main character thinks he has already won, and the movie picks up.  I'm not going to give away all the plot twists, but there are several:  * An alien race is threatening to invade Earth. * It is up to a group of people to stop it. * But the plan they had was ruined. * A very old alien, who is the last surviving leader of a race, has a plan.  The plot twists are a little predictable, but not in a bad way.  There are lots of clever references to Star Trek, as well as Star Wars and Aliens, and they are all very funny.  If you like good sci- fi, good action, and a good character arc, then you have to watch this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My father gave me a copy of this film a long time ago. I used to hate him, and since he died, this film has become more and more important to me.   I never loved films very much, so my first viewing of this one was a disappointment. It was hard for me to get into this movie. I don't think I have a favorite scene, because the plot isn't very good. There are several plot problems with this movie, such as:  The whole movie is the main character looking for her missing father.  But, the father is nowhere to be found.  It's hard to find a good example for this movie in the history of movie.  There are times when I can't believe that it's possible that a film was made in the 1920s.  I don'st think the story will hold up as a story.

They have a laugh and get on with their day.  There are a lot of people in the city and people do funny things.  The movie starts out very dramatic and then it changes to a comedic look.  This movie was made to be a good time.  If you love to see a funny picture set in the past, it is perfect for you.  You will have a good laugh with this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like great sci-fi and great action movies, you'll like this one.   The story is a classic, but it's better than that.  In one of the most brilliant scenes in any movie ever, there's an old man whose mind is in a fog, who's got a vision of his future: a ship is about to crash into the ground, and they're going to find a great treasure, and he'll be rewarded with the right to be a king.  The ship comes out of nowhere and goes out of control, but he has a plan that is just brilliant, and it works just fine.  They rescue some kids, they get some treasure, he's crowned king!  And then things get a little dark.  It's a long movie, so it doesn't hold up, but the whole thing is just perfect.  I can't give it more than 4 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After reading a lot of bad reviews about a movie I haven't seen yet, I was ready to write a negative review about this movie.   It's not too bad, at least not compared to most bad movies (I am looking at you,   ) but it has some very bad aspects to it.  It is a pretty slow film.  The whole film takes place in a long room.  There is a lot going on.  I can't think of a lot that is entertaining.  They try to build up the characters to some extent, but it's just about enough.  This film is not too long and it does have a plot.  If there is one bad aspect of this film, it is it's bad acting.  One thing is for sure; it would be better if the acting was better.  A lot of the bad acting is due to the fact that the actors didn't know how to act.  For the most part, it works.  These actors have not acted much in a while and the poor acting gets annoying.  Another thing is that this is a film that has a plot, but you know how it goes.  And when a film has a storyline, it must have a good story.  You can tell the story of a film in a good way, but then it's a problem.  To give credit where credit is due, this film has very good effects.  Well, there are a lot, including some very good special effects. However, the effects aren't very well done.  But then again, the special effects are not the best.  What you see onscreen is good, but there are some flaws in the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film and is not very often seen these days.   The story is a typical tale of a girl's first love and a little boy who doesn't care.  The girl lives on the farm, and the boy lives in a big house at the river, with the river as a background.  They come together in a moment when they're about to lose the girl who's been in love with them.  Her mother's about to die, and then the boy's in love, and she can't do anything about it.  I've often heard stories about a girl who has fallen for a boy, but never any of the boys.  It's all one story, with several different characters involved.  As in a true romantic story, the girl's mother has to be careful about what she says to her and the other family members.  What they say to her is not always in a romantic way.  But it all works out in the end, and this film is one of the more beautiful and moving films.

To be fair to the producers, they had an opportunity to make a hit with this movie, and in my opinion they did.  There are some good scenes, a decent story, and a fun story.  I'm happy I got to see a movie that's fun, and that had a plot that was actually somewhat believable.  It was not at all predictable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this because I was curious as to what happened to the girls and the men who survived the attack. While this is a very interesting film, it's not a thriller. I guess we were meant to care about the story (there's a girl who has to find a man who has been missing for 3 days and who is very important to her father who has some bad connections). I did not mind the fact that the people involved were in a very bad situation, but the movie did not follow a typical thrill film. There is a lot of tension as there is no end in sight, and then it's over. The film has a good story and a good ending, but it was really a film about people who were living in a bad situation and didn't have enough strength to get out of it. I was not interested in these characters, but I liked the director who made the film.

I don't recall any in which I ever had to do anything but sit up, yawn, and stare out the window at the morning light coming in through a crack in the shutters.   The movie begins with an excellent montage of some of the best horror films ever made: from The Exorcist to Frankenstein. The film is definitely not to be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie. It's very fast paced and is full of action and explosions. It was filmed in the United States in the 80s, but the people in this movie look like they're from the 60's.

The studio had given him a job with a few dollars, and he was sitting in the car, listening to the radio, when he started singing the chorus, 'I want you to be my girlfriend/' He's singing it out loud, and a minute later I'm on the bed with him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun story about a dog that can talk!  It's pretty funny, and I liked how the two dogs were so different, and how the dog got his name from the first one.  It doesn't take long for the dogs to become friends.  They do get into some adventures, though they mostly involve food and water.  I have a feeling I'll be watching it again soon!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really curious about "Aliens" and had a hard time believing that an alien from the planet Venus would find a way to reproduce on Earth in a laboratory.   The first movie in the series is really good and the last one is a little too slow, however, the movie is a bit more of a romance than a horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a boy that has an accident and has to deal with the consequences. There is a boy and a girl that are friends and the boy takes an interest in the girl.   He tries to help her and the girl tells him that a man in a dark costume is trying to take her home. She is not very brave so he gets her a gun and then the man with the dark costume does not take her seriously so he shoots her.  I love the art style. It reminds me a bit of an early 80's Japanese movie called   It seems to be about a man who is obsessed with a girl but he can't help his love. He tries not to be a creep like so many people in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know what to say about this movie. I guess I'll just say that it is a really good horror movie, that has its moments of good and bad, and that the scares do not linger on your mind long after watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is shot like a low budget black and white horror, the music is cheap and the acting is horrible.   For the first half of the film the movie takes a turn for the worse.  We start out with a man who stumbles upon a woman who is in the middle of an act.  As you can guess the woman's boyfriend, played by Richard Brooks, takes advantage of the situation.  He then proceeds to kill her by having sex with her, and then cuts off her head.  After the head is cut off the woman gets up, walks into her boyfriend's house and begins cutting off her own throat.  I think we can all appreciate a woman with an active sexual life who wants to start a family, not a guy who is only in it for the sexual part.  This movie is the epitome of bad acting.  So what do you expect when you are dealing with the guy's girlfriend?   She is a dumb blonde who believes her boyfriend is all that and nothing.  A good acting movie would have the woman trying to convince the man not to go through with his plan.  With a better acting movie there would be a real plot, no just some random girl who happens to kill herself.  There is one character that really gets it going, the woman who goes into the home with the head, but I'm not convinced she is all there.  The director, Robert Aldrich, never takes advantage enough of the situations, and the rest of the actors make it look like a movie from another era.  What we are left with is a very poor film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens on the day of the World Series, as the Giants face off against the Cubs. The Cubs fans are out in force in their Cubs jerseys. In the stands, a black man is walking around with a beer in his hand. When he gets to the stands and gets a bit too close to the fans, the fans start throwing beer and eggs at him, until the black man runs off to the end of the stands where there is a bench, and waits for the Cubs to score. After they do, he gets up on the bench, starts to watch the game, and is promptly shot in the head.   We then see the film in black and white, and the man in the suit who was shot by the fans is now in a hospital bed with his hand and arm bandaged. In his hospital bed, he has the baseball cap he always wore when he played on his head. We then follow him, with a black doctor as his nurse, as they see his hand in his bandaged hand, and find out he has lost the finger. The doctor asks if it was the Cubs fans who shot him. The man says it was not the Cubs, and he was just doing his job. After a brief discussion, the doctor then informs him that the wound has been treated, and that it should heal within the next few months. The woman behind the man is still at the scene, and when she sees the doctor, she immediately tries to pull a knife on him.  The doctor is very angry at her, saying that this is not a good time to be angry, as he just got out of surgery.  When the doctor is about to leave, the woman says, "You won't get away with it, doctor. You'll be sorry!"  He then leaves, but comes back for the woman, who, by now, is in tears.  And now we are back in black-and-white, as we see the man get dressed and go into a diner. He looks at his watch, and sees it's 2:45 AM. He goes to the bathroom, and hears a knock on the door. He answers it and sees a man dressed in a white suit standing at the door, and looks around nervously, as if he was afraid someone would hear him. He closes the door behind him, and goes to a table to get something to eat. The guy in the white suit tells him that his wife has died
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I'll let the trailers do the talking:  A teenage girl has a vision of the future: She'll be famous as a famous writer. But it turns out her vision is all too real:  One day she has a dream in which she sees the famous writer of her dreams, Mr. X, with his wife and two kids, all wearing blue outfits.  But then the writer mysteriously disappears, leaving his wife to raise a family alone.  Eventually, she finds out that a mysterious group is after her, and will stop at nothing to have her.   But it's not as easy as it sounds.  The screenplay is a delight:  The script is witty, creative, and fun.  There's also a little romance between a teenage girl and her older boyfriend.  Not only does it have some excellent music and visual elements, the film also has its share of heart.  It's the kind of movie where you'll laugh out loud at a particularly ridiculous scene.  And for those who say it's a fantasy:  It has its fantasy elements.  Unfortunately it has none of the action that made the other "Hollywood" fantasies such good reads.  One thing that can be said is that the movie gets you to think about life:  That's an accomplishment.  However, what will make this movie a cult classic is the ending.  If you can find a copy, get it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It was a good idea, and it's good." The story is well set up. It's set in a school, with two schools (two teams): the students from a rich families, and the students who work in the school kitchen (they have to wash dishes). The rich students, having a good time, try to make themselves attractive to the girls, and succeed (they're called the "Chu Chu Gang"). The poor students, not knowing about the school, just hang around, drinking, and taking drugs (they call themselves the "Zombies"). The rich student, who is really the leader of the Chu Chu Gang, is actually a pretty tough guy. He leads the zombies, because the zombies can't get up to the top of a building that's high up. And so, he sends out a pack of zombies to kill the rich students. The rich guy has to use a gun with a silencer to shoot the zombies. He shoots the poor students with a rubber bullet. The poor student is hurt badly. The "Chun Chi Gang" win, and they go to a beautiful country house where they dance and laugh and smoke and eat and drink and dance, until the rich student gets a bullet in the stomach. Then they kill him. Then the poor student wins and they take over the school. The movie is very interesting and well done. The writing is excellent.   The acting is good, but not good enough to keep a good actor from being in a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well made film from a director who has not only made a great film in "The Godfather" (1976), but made even better films such as "The Shining" (1980) and "The Last Temptation of Christ" (1987). This one is better because it has a bigger cast, bigger action and bigger laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You have to be really careful when a movie is made in the early '90s.   It's not a bad movie, it's just not a very good movie.  If you like a great old western, this is it.  I would love to see more in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You have to be in good shape to play a biker on the back of a motorcycle.   And so are we!   The main villain is not very complex and is so over the top, he seems to be from another planet!  But what is even more surprising is that the best scene in the movie is the last one, when the hero and his girlfriend are riding along and she is crying over the fact that he is never home when he said he would be.  They get the car and ride to the farm where they find a dog and she has taken off her coat so it would be warmer.  After that, the hero drives off in his truck while the girls look at him with pity and then they find him and he says his goodbyes to them, but then the truck goes off a cliff and the girl falls off.  The heroes and their friends do a backflip to save her and then the heroes go off to the next scene.  I do love the way this movie has a very funny ending and I am glad I went to see it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The story is about an orphaned boy called Naseer who is taken in by the Wazir and his wife Fazlul. While the story is a classic tale of the journey of an orphan from the slums to wealth and wealth, one aspect I like about it is that it has been done to a high standard.   Naseher is not some ordinary boy and there are some excellent scenes in the movie.  It is well shot with good acting and has a nice ending.  If you like an exciting story then this is the one for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       This is a great movie.   A lot of the action takes place in a tropical environment where they all fight to the death in their tropical villages in the middle of the jungle.  But don't worry, they don't seem to have any weapons other than their bare fists.  The movie has a lot of good story lines. But not much else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a director it's hard to top Martin Scorsese, but then again...   After seeing this film, I'd like to be a better person for having seen it.   After a few bad comedies and bad movies,   we find ourselves with a wonderful story about a couple who become part of a very special group of people.  If you are going to give this one a chance, go with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A man in a mask" was the title of the first film I ever saw, as was "A Good Man Goes to War".   A man (Robert H. Hunt) is walking down a street late one afternoon, when he sees a man who is apparently going to kill some soldiers. He runs after the murderer and tries to help him out, but the man starts to walk away. He then stops, hesitates for a moment, then shoots a man to the back of the head.   The film was really bad, but you'd forgive it if it was an entertaining thriller with some dark humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of horror movies, I never thought I'd actually be part of a horror film like The Blob (1974) that was actually made in the United States.   It's a fantastic movie that is fun, scary, and funny as hell.  The Blorbs are a group of friends who get together over a dinner and the idea of "The Blob" strikes fear into everyone and a huge blob appears and chases them all around their house in an effort to find a person who can defeat it.  One character even ends up being eaten by the Blob.  Unfortunately, the movie is far too short for me to give it any stars and it's far better if you can watch it on a big screen and just laugh like a maniac. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was skeptical to watch this movie. After seeing my friend's "Rambo" it was hard to believe that this movie would be so bad. I mean sure it had a lot of violence and gore, but at the same time there was a lot more humor and originality to it. And the acting was very good. It had a good feel to it, but if you are a fan of the Rambo franchise you will not like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie I have seen dozens of times before, and it is the same thing each time. The film is basically one long chase scene, and they all work to tell the same story. It is mostly the movie that is boring.   The biggest reason I'm giving this movie 4/10 is that it is so predictable. There are lots of chase scenes, and each time the chase ends with the cops shooting someone.  You are supposed to be watching for a gun or some kind of car chase, but the cops never show up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had been a long time watching American TV dramas since I was very young, with the exception of a few movies I didn't really like (most notably "The Godfather" ). It was the great thing about the television series "The Dick Van Dyke Show" was how the characters were just so lively and fun to watch, I would watch these shows many times over and always had a great time. Now it appears that we will see a new series with Dick Van Dyer, a good ol' boy who just wants to be a better man.   A few small nitpicks: - The dialogue is a bit too stiff, I don't know why that is. But I guess that is the kind of show where you can be a little stiffer than necessary. - I was surprised at how little the movie was about the Vietnam War. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like   "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a good example of why we all need to watch more and more movies. It was a joy to see the two great comedians, Billy Crystal and Mel Brooks, come back to the big screen for one final time. Crystal is at his funniest and Brooks is at a very enjoyable best. They even bring a few surprises to the screen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The story of The Little Rascals is so good.   The story about this family is like one of those old black and white cartoons with a bad voice and a good voice.  In this family you have the little rascals who are just as funny as their big brother.  I am not one to go to the movies every day.  But every night I watched The Little Ringing Rascal with my kids and it was a great movie.  The parents were right there along with the little children and you can tell that they are very happy and enjoy their family life.  There are a lot of fun scenes in this movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the end, I'm very satisfied and grateful with the movie. I don't get what is wrong with this movie... It's basically a long sequence of short films with nothing to differentiate between them. You can say that this movie's a very sad film about a little boy with a great big family who loves him very much, and who dies at a very young age... The child actor is very good.   The story of the movie has a very dark, sad, and sorrowful feel to it. It's like a sad little boy has died from the day of his birth to the day he dies... It has a dark, sorrowful, sad feel to this little movie and it's just depressing and depressing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen and loved a lot of the other Michael Cimino movies (including those starring Meryl Streep) but I don't believe this is one of his best.   This movie is a lot like "The Deer Hunter" (1978), in that the movie focuses a lot on an under-appreciated hero, played by an underrated actor (William Holden) who does everything to be heroic and then has to come to terms with the fact that his heroic actions are completely futile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a bit of a sucker for bad action movies.   This is a terrible bad movie, but for a good action movie it's great.  As bad as it gets the action is so good it's amazing.  This movie is actually more good than bad.  It's the kind of movie you watch once in a while and have it be a real treat.  The worst thing about it is that it's an adaptation from a popular novel by the same name.  While the movie does a great job of playing the novel for laughs it also has some decent ideas.  You could do some serious analysis of how the plot is completely absurd but the comedy of it is so much better that I didn't even care.  Overall the movie is definitely not a good adaptation of a bad book. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to get out of the house a little late in the evening and when it gets dark the only movie on the local TV channels is the new Batman movie. This was an enjoyable movie as the action was awesome, the costume was cool, and Bruce Wayne was fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that I haven't seen this movie in quite a while, and I enjoyed it very much. This was the first time I saw it and, while I haven�t seen the second movie, I know that I will be seeing it sometime.   This is one of those movies that you see in a movie theater and think, ``Wow, this must be really good because I can�t wait to see another one of these.``   It is the most fun I can remember having in a long time. The main character is a high school teacher named George. He is in the middle of a difficult divorce and is trying to make ends meet. This becomes a problem when his wife, who is in a wheelchair, decides to move back in with him. She insists that they have a movie night, and George, not wanting to ruin the evening by making a fool of himself, agrees. This leads to a discussion of all the things that he is a man, and how he is no good because of his limitations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most interesting thing about this movie is the story of an older man named Paul (Robert Vaughn). Paul is a widower with four children. When his wife and two children die tragically in a plane crash he is left with his five-year-old daughter. Paul has no choice but to re-enter the world of his children's old age by looking after them.   After a week he has found a good home for his four children with his wife's granddaughter, but he has other plans.  When the children's father (Paul's other wife) dies he has the children take a boat out to the coast where they meet a new family that takes them on.  With the new family and a couple of friends they travel to a tropical island where Paul becomes a surrogate father to his children.  The film is set in the 1940's, and the family have a tropical paradise. The children have tropical names like Binky, Flopsy, and Lassie. Paul's daughter is an actress called Lina (played by Gilda Radner). The youngest son is the most famous actor in the island, the young Frank Sinatra (played in the movie by Marlon Brando), but Paul doesn't let him near his kids.  Paul, a widowed man who has never worked, is forced by his children to work with them to get them into the show business.  I found the story interesting and entertaining, but it does have a lot of bad parts too.  There is a lot about Paul and his life that is just terrible.  At first he had a wife who treated him like a son, and then she died, which made him want to be with his children again.  But even when he can't be with them he has to take the role of a father figure.  After he starts acting he meets an actor named Sam (played as an older gentleman by Michael J. Fox), who is the son of the son in another family he's been introduced to.  As they get closer to each other they get into fights over the children, and when Sam gets older and starts to get married he starts taking the children to movies and going on expensive vacations to other places.  Sam starts having an affair with a young woman from the island and wants to marry her.  This all works out fine until Frank Sinata wants to get his share of the money.  Sinata is an older guy who wants his share and uses

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie much more than the other movies in the "Dawn of the Dead" franchise. It's the first movie I saw in the series where the zombies are just as evil as the survivors. I liked the "horror" element much more then I thought I would. I think a lot of the "seriousness" of the other films was taken out of them by this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of the year. The acting was perfect and the special effects in this movie were amazing. It's an emotional, wonderful, well made movie about two people who, while having fun playing cards in a bar in the middle of the desert are in the process of losing their minds. A wonderful combination of the movie was the great use of the soundtrack and the beautiful desert landscapes. This movie will be remembered and it's a shame that it's only in the top 10 on IMDB.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing this film at my first film festival, I said to myself that I would see it again.   This is a fun action movie, with a fun premise that will make you smile (or cry).   The movie has a lot of action, and a lot going on, especially during the first three acts.  There is a nice amount of comedy, though a little dry, but the action is still pretty good.  The ending is good too.  I liked this movie, but there is a lot more that I want to see from this guy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film with a great story, that combines a very funny, funny, hilarious and good-natured story with an excellent music score.   This is the film that brought us the "Killer Clown" from the 1980's!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have no idea where to start with this one... the only way I could get into this movie is because the trailers were so good I had to try it out.    The story is about a man who has been trapped in a building with no exit and is eventually killed by another man who is there because he is a "bouncer".   What follows is a very strange journey through surreal, dreamlike imagery.  To start things off, you don't even see the building until about ten minutes in.  But the story is told very quickly.  It is a little bit hard to follow.  The camera moves in a very surreal way and the characters are a little hard to take.  However, the story works so well in this setting that it is very hard to stop watching.  You get so caught up in the weirdness of the place you forget about anything else.  And at some points the film's story takes a turn and you don't realize that you are watching a movie but the story never lets go of your attention.  If you love surreal, strange, and weird films then you are going to love this film.

I think it's great that the story is still as fun to read a day after the movie. I love the characters in this movie, they're a bit silly and silly at times but that's not bad at all.  One of my favorites.   Rated 5 out of 5 by ronnypaul from So far so good   There were times when I thought it was all over, but it didn't last too long, I was watching it in a dark theater with no one around.  After the movie ended I was so happy and sad at the same time. I hope this one stays in theatres as long as it did.  The movie had so much story, so many funny moments.  There are things I don't understand, but that doesn't bother me at all, it's only part of what makes it entertaining.  But the movie is funny all the way through.  All I have to say is to watch it with a bunch of friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are some good old Westerns about the West, but I can't stand them all.   The two most recent I've seen of this sort were 'Dangerous Wild Wires' (1940) and 'Old Gold' (1950), both by Jules Dassin.  I don't know why, but they've always got my attention.  And this movie is no exception.  For the most part it's a fairly straightforward action film. But there are several touches that strike me as being particularly unusual. First, there's no dialogue. Instead of talking to each other, the characters of the story speak with a single speaker, in a manner very much like the English of The Canterbury Tales. Second, in the opening shot, a long, long line of Western faces are seen marching across the stage. This was done to give the film a sense of distance.  Also, during the battle sequences, one sees the faces of some people who appear to be the stars of the battle scenes.  They're not the stars, of course. These people were actors who had to play a long series of characters who are killed off one by one.  The battle scenes themselves are pretty much the stuff of legend.  There's one great sequence which is probably the most famous action sequence of the movie.  As the actors in the foreground move away from the action to re-evaluate the scene, the actors behind them see a terrible death being perpetrated, and so act accordingly.  It was shot by the great Stanley Kubrick, and has been hailed as the greatest film ever made.  This is a very good movie. There's a lot of fun in it, and it's pretty good action, too.  - February 2, 2007Crazy Western

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You don't need to know about me or the history of the U.S. space program to see this film.   I loved how it portrayed a group of people who are really not at all typical of the people who live in the "civilized" world.  The movie doesn't shy away from a lot of things that are considered taboo.  It is realistic and not overly romantic.  A lot of people don't like the film. It is an honest documentary about a group who has been working together for a long time.  They make it to the space station, a real accomplishment.  And then a lot happens that doesn't add up.  One of my favorite parts of the film is when they go on a mission to see a comet.  When they first see it it looks like a big ball of fire.  But then they are confronted with the real thing.  There is a lot going on in this film and it is really well made.  If you like this movie you will enjoy any movie in the Space Shuttle Program.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was a big hit back in 1980.   It was made on a big budget (in Japan), and is based on a novel of the same title by Akira Kurasawa.  The story is about a guy called Chiba, who is a Japanese wrestler.  At some point in the movie he gets a job at the American Embassy.  His new boss is a crazy old man named Mori.  As the movie progresses Mori becomes obsessed with Chiba and is determined to make him his heir.  He is able to do this through a variety of means.  But the real danger of Mori is his temper.  Mori can be mean and violent, and the audience is treated to plenty of violence during the course of the movie.  After watching this movie the audience will know what to expect in a movie with a character like Mori. It's a good fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's really hard to review a movie that's supposed to be a tribute to the glory of the past. That's why I wanted to wait until the film was done before talking about it. The movie is not all that bad. The acting is very good; the musical numbers are pretty good; and the cinematography, while very dated, is not terrible. The story is fairly straightforward: a band of adventurers go to visit the last known survivor of the legendary Flying Circus and bring him to the safety of a remote castle. When a dangerous sorcerer escapes, the band is separated, one by one. It's a long time before the band finds each other again; after the last one has been killed, the castle is ransacked. At the castle, the party finds a beautiful young woman who calls herself an sorceress, but who may or may not be one. They must now find a way out of the castle to reach safety before the castle collapses.   I think the story and the plot were a little bit hard to follow, because of the long break between the first movie and the second, and even though there are some references to events in the first film, it all seems a bit tacked-on. I wish the story was more focused. There is some humor in the film, some moments of real drama, and some pretty good music, but it didn't really work for me. It was a movie with an old-timey vibe that I could not relate to. The actors, particularly Richard Donner and Richard Gere, did good work, but not nearly good enough to make me forget about how unmemorable this story is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie with a decent story, with a nice plot, but nothing special. A story about a man, who is very much into music, and also has an obsession with girls, who he sees through a glass wall, and he wants to find the girls, to see them naked. He is also obsessed with a woman (the female lead) he knows, who was also the girlfriend of his deceased wife. One day he sees that woman naked, and thinks of her as his own wife. So he is really obsessed with her. Well, he really is. The story is okay.   The female lead is pretty strong. I did like the way the movie was shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the final movie in a trilogy of movies based on the original story by Jules Verne. This film is an adaptation of a play by Arthur Waley. It is set in the year 2071, and in an attempt to escape an impending war between humans and machines, the "Tower of London" becomes a center for human/machine hybrids called "The Living Machines". The Living Machines were created from human and machine parts to help human soldiers to fight the machine-like "Borgs" (Borgen is the German word for robot). These Living Machines are the result of a long-term scientific experiment of combining human and animal parts to build a robot capable of fighting for the human race. It's a very good film, and it will be very interesting to see what's done with the "B'nai B'rith", and whether they still are involved in the fighting. The film was directed by Frank Henenlotter, and produced by Jean-Luc Godard and John Sturges.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie of the year (so far).   This is a solid, serious film that follows a typical "mission" movie plot in which a team of astronauts land on a strange planet and find a small population of humans.  The film is about their discovery and attempts to build a new society there.   The movie does a very good job of establishing the tone of the film and establishing the human characters.  This may not be an earthshattering movie, but its a very interesting take on the theme of a small group of humans coming together to solve a big problem. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is probably one of the few films where I've watched it and thought "wow, I don't know if I can do that". I'd have to watch it again and again, but that's what's nice about it:  It is difficult to judge whether a good picture is good or bad, or even good enough to be considered a good film.  There are two things that are certain about this film: first, it is visually and aurally remarkable and it deserves every bit of attention it is getting:  it is very visually spectacular; the sets are absolutely gorgeous and the costumes are stunning (which is the subject of this review) ; the film is well acted; and there are two performances that stand out above the rest:  Firstly, it's a good performance by James Cromwell as the villain, who is a good enough bad guy that I don`t think I'll be able to see him ever again, no matter how good the picture is.  It`s interesting to think how he got into this kind of trouble: it's pretty clear that it's not just his wife who's having a hard time at home, and I think it's clear that he`s pretty badly off himself. He's clearly been playing a pretty bad game for a long time and is now getting beaten and humiliated.  Cromwell doesn`t appear to have a clear aim in the film, but he does a fine job of expressing the character, which is a little disappointing because the movie was supposed to be about a great hero.  What really makes this movie so great is the direction by John Milius, which in the end makes it work as a film:  Miliu has a very effective way of making the actors look like they are inhabiting the characters.  He doesn't show the camera too much, and when the camera is there it tends to focus very carefully on the actors and not on the scenery, which I think was a wise decision.  But in the movie as a whole the cinematography is excellent.  And the writing is excellent:  In a lot of films there`s a tendency to overuse the word "hero" and there's a tendency for the film to be called simply "heroic".  I think this is a mistake:  The hero doesn't necessarily have to be the most interesting or the most sympathetic character in the whole film, he just has to be a good one.  That's

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few reviewers have noted that the actors' voices seem to be from another world. This seems to be a theme in the film: In the beginning, we meet a very strange young woman (Meryl Streep) who moves into an abandoned home in Los Angeles. There is a dog (played by Bill Murray) living there. When she enters the house, she seems to experience a "flash of light," and she disappears. She's been found dead the next morning. The first three days are spent trying to find out what happened to her. The police are skeptical, but the coroner is positive that she died from a heart attack, and from the fact that the air is very foul. It turns out that her house is infested by mice. It's not until the last day of the first week that the "girl in the window" reappears, a very beautiful and intelligent woman. She appears to have lost her memory, and her new surroundings seem very confusing and dangerous. In a very odd way, the film seems to work both as a ghost story and a horror movie. There's a bit of both in this, but there's also a lot of humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most recent example of a high end Hollywood movie made in the 1960's that still gets better with each rewatch is the 1967 movie  . It takes place in the fictional town of Tabor in Missouri.     The town is full of people who have been raised on sugar and processed foods like   corn flakes,   and even   salt.  The town has a history of being one of the most impoverished areas of the country, and it is filled with people who work in the fields all day long.  One day,  an evil madman shows up in town and starts slaughtering the innocent farmers, and then kidnaps the mayor.  There are people in town who are all about killing everyone, but are unable to find anyone who can carry out the murder, so they come to the town's leader to try to find the murderer, but to no avail.  This movie doesn't contain any violence, but there is enough for a grown man to be able to get a little wet after sitting in a hot car.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The good news is that it's hard to keep in mind why a movie like this would ever be made. The bad news is, it's impossible to forget. The movie is about an astronaut who survives an incident involving a space shuttle accident that kills nearly all the crew. He returns to Earth to pick up a wife, only to find her murdered and her corpse being burned in a bonfire by her mother and an ex-boyfriend. The plot seems like it should belong to a bad western: a hard-drinking and hard-talking cowboy with a fondness for women is in search of revenge for his wife's murder. It's actually not that bad and actually well written. What makes it so much worse is the bad guy: an evil, murderous villain who is played by the guy from The Mummy. He's more evil than he appears. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always liked the books and films of James Baldwin. In particular, I was very intrigued by his description of the history of the South: a series of civil wars, which, with all due respect to his other achievements, are less than thrilling. In contrast, I found this film interesting in its use of color:  In fact, it was an excellent film.  There were some nice, if somewhat uninspired, actors.  The setting, though, was very South, and I was struck by the Southern accent:  I did find the film's use of colors, however, rather over-dramatized:  But this was a good film, in spite of a rather mediocre script.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have a weakness for action films or movies that you can watch in 2 hours then this is a great movie.   I'm always excited to see a good action film like this one and it is not just a good film.  There is a ton of cool action scenes, but the story is very much the heart and soul of this film. The plot is solid, but not really all that original. There are a few things that are good, like the relationship between Sam (Makan) and his old partner (Duke).   The plot revolves around a group of men who, having been killed in a shootout, are resurrected by a priest and then must battle the evil spirit of the priest.  In my opinion, the action is solid. Sam is a pretty good action hero, and the story keeps things interesting.  I've seen most action films over the last ten years and this one is one of the better.  It is well written and well acted.  The music is good and the effects are great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of movies in the world that are just good movies and are entertaining to watch, but this movie is amazing, in every way.   As soon as I saw this movie I knew it was going to be good.  The story is so original that it's hard to tell where the story goes from good to amazing.  It's funny at first, but really funny.  This movie is very well made.  As I watched the movie I was laughing, but not so hard I was getting dizzy.  I was not a fan of the whole idea of a monster that had to eat people because it was "natural."  This is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a great story, about the "Hollywood" system in the 1950's and 60's. The story is told by a fictionalized, retelling of events from the real life of a screenwriter, who was accused of adultery by his own wife. This man must find a way to get his wife back, and in so doing, he must find the "truth" behind the accusations of adultery.   After listening to a story that is not the truth, the viewer is left wanting more. A "good" movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie has been reviewed quite a bit already, so I won't say a lot about it here.   This is a comedy, so the plot is pretty simple:  It is a typical story of a couple who is in the process of building a mansion, with a room in the basement for a pet cat.  They get married, and a young man from a wealthy family decides to get married in his own house, after all, why not?   That's about all there is to the story, and it's very funny.  It has a good amount of violence (although not nearly as much as you'd think), as well as the usual campy humor.  At one point a guy is about to be killed by a dog that doesn't care about its master, only about its food.  There is even a cat, who, although the best part of the movie, is too cute for its own good.  This movie is pretty hard to describe, which is probably why I've been watching it so often.  To sum it up, it's a great movie that you should probably be able to watch a bunch of times without getting tired of it.

His face is a mask, he looks like a maniac, and he is really scary. The building is completely destroyed. It is very impressive to see the way this movie destroys this building. The gas mask is great - even better than the mask that is worn by the masked hero. I don't like the ending of the movie at all - I find it very disappointing.

So I had high hopes for "Casino Royale." I was disappointed.  I was hoping for more of the old Sean Connery, but not a whole lot else. It wasn't awful, but it was definitely lacking. The bad guys, while still bad, had much less to do than Bond in "Live and Let Die." I'm a big fan of Sean Conainy, and this movie was certainly not as good as the previous one.

However, it makes you think the main characters are really the main reason for the story of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to be the first to say I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I went to see this movie at the BFI.   And then I saw it   and I didn't quite get it      But by the end I felt that I'd been thoroughly stung   The thing with it that I find most bizarre is that we are not told anything about the lead characters -   In fact we don't see them at all   We never even meet them   Not even the policeman or the fireman who seem to be doing the job they are paid to do.  The only person we meet (aside from the woman) who appears to be working for a newspaper is the old woman who runs the shelter,   She is also the only person who appears aware that someone is trying to kill her.  It seems strange that nobody else would have noticed,  but then I suppose we are supposed to believe the fire brigade are some kind of super heroes   Perhaps there are no supervillains because it is the other way round   It's strange that the police who are so concerned for the old lady have absolutely no interest in the man who is clearly the main suspect -  The woman is quite clearly a psychopath,  and the firemen -  well at least I guess there is some kind spirit of some kind keeping her company   If the lead man really is the man the police are looking for then I find it incredible that he didn't take on the lead detective immediately   How much of a job is the police trying to do when a man like that walks in the door     It's very difficult not to like the film   What I am not prepared to say however is that I didn' like it.  I was really, really tired by the time I got to the end,  And it's not that it was a bad movie -  It was just so strange,  so uninspiring,  even though I was intrigued about what the woman was up to -  But then I just felt a bit sorry for the poor guy.  And there is something very strange about the look of him -  I think it's a look that is intended to keep the audience thinking but it just isn't working   -  What makes it most disturbing is that, well for a start,  he's not even a bad actor -  He is pretty
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie a few days ago and I haven't seen a movie this good since, well, ever.   It has the right combination of characters, plot, and atmosphere.  I was so excited about it I ended up watching the first 5 minutes before going to sleep.  It's just amazing how good the characters are.  The plot is the perfect blend of dark fantasy and a classic fairy tale.  You really feel like you're watching a movie, not watching a TV movie.  This movie is funny.  There's a lot of violence but it's done in a way that makes it clear the bad guys are monsters not human.  And the music is good, especially the violin.  After reading up on the movie I know it's not as good as I thought it was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not watched the whole movie yet, and I will be honest, I am a bit torn about the movie. The story has a bit of the Twilight Zone about it, and while that is not a bad thing, I have had a hard time with that show.   The movie was fun, but it was a bit slow and not a whole lot of laughs.  My biggest problem with the movie was that while it was mostly very entertaining, there were some parts that I felt were a little rushed.  As for the movie, a fun ride with a couple of good parts.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little movie. The story is about a woman who finds a little boy that is left at her door, alone, when she leaves for work. He is left alone, because he doesn't know what to do with himself. He watches TV. The kid then watches a woman (and a little man) on TV. When the woman is being interviewed she appears to be making a mistake when she doesn't realize that the little man is watching her, and he wants to be interviewed too. And when the man gets on TV he wants everyone to know about a child he has who is going to be a star and a champion in the Olympics. I loved this movie because I love little boy movies. I liked the way they made this movie, with the little boy as the star. I was pleased with the kid, because this little guy doesn't have to worry about himself, he gets to be in the movie and the movie lets him.

The movie was a great surprise for me.  The plot was amazing!  The voice of the Terminator was awesome!  I think this is going to go down in history as one of the greatest action movies ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a simple premise, but one of the best.   I like movies where the characters aren't as "evil" as the plot would have us believe.  The plot is simple: A group of friends and family members are traveling around New Mexico when they stop for a day of vacation.  They are joined by a couple from Chicago, a woman who doesn't speak a word and is called "Pip" by her sister (who is also an alien), and a man who isn't so nice.  After the day is over, they begin to feel like they are the ones who are having all the fun, as the family and friends begin to go missing.  There's some really nice acting here, even from a first timer like Bill Paxton (I haven't seen anything by him yet, but he's so versatile) and Michael Gough.  The characters are really funny (and I don't want to give the movie any more than that) and the writing is so good.  One of my favorite scenes is the ending where the aliens show up to try to help the family in their time of need.  I especially like that the ending was a surprise that you didn't see coming.

This movie is definitely one of the best and most enjoyable movies that I've seen in a long while.  It starts out pretty slow and the plot is still developing but in a good way.  With a cast of amazing actors and wonderful directing, we have a really interesting plot with a fantastic ending.  I thought this movie was a bit of a let down and a little too long and it ended up dragging a bit.  But I think I will give this one another go and I really hope that it was worth the time I put into it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was okay. The acting is not very good. It is just too long. It may seem like a long movie but it really isn't. There is a scene in there that is the same scene from the first movie. This is probably because the writer of the first season of the movie, John A. Macdonald, wrote a short story about the same subject and changed a few things to make this movie work. In fact this movie was actually filmed before the first one and it was in the same area. This time around John A Macdonald did the same story but in the 1960's. If you love this movie that is pretty much it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are really two things in this film. The first one is the movie itself. It has a nice visual style and the acting is good. The second one is that it's not a "good" movie. The movie's premise is that a guy, a detective in a movie who's a little bit creepy (I'm not kidding) is sent to Japan. This movie is full of action, and not a lot of jokes. It's about this guy, and the guy who goes by the name of a ghost who can only communicate via a tape player that he uses to listen to tapes of Japanese ghost stories. It is all a little over-the-top, and I've seen a few other movies like this. I just couldn't stand this one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story was a good one that I liked a lot. I liked how they kept it a secret until they figured out who did it. It was clever and good in a way.   I also like how they came out with a better ending and I liked the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first film about this group of soldiers, The Longest Day, was so bad, so horrible, I just couldn't watch it.   They were given this job on this mission, and it was supposed to be an easy mission.  But they get there and discover that the thing is a lot bigger than expected.  And that they're not exactly on the right side of the fence when they're first there, either.  It's like watching a bunch of kids in the movie.  This is a movie that made me really wish I'd never seen it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like "A Few Good Men". The movie itself is good but the real strength of the movie is the cast of characters. You have Tom Selleck in this film playing a hard hitting detective that does not like to be told what to do by others. We have Bill Murray in this movie playing an alcoholic and a great one at that. Also playing himself and he plays it well. He really knows how to portray himself. But he plays a different sort of character in this picture than I normally expect him to. There is a certain innocence to him that I find very endearing. There really is just something about Bill Murray that I love about him and that is why I like him so much. His acting is good throughout this movie. I don't know how much I can talk about the acting without going into spoilers but I have to give it a try because I do like Bill Murray as an actor.   "A few good men" is a nice film that has a lot of great performances and is a good time to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to see some good, exciting and funny comedy you must watch this movie!   It's been almost 30 years since the movie was released (1987) so the acting is very good and the jokes are very funny, but if you like old school comedy you will not find a better one than this! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always looked forward to seeing the new Batman movies, and to get to see the first one in 20 years was just great.   It's a good blend of the two old Batman movies and the other Batman comics.  As always, the action in Batman: The Movie is excellent, especially in the first 30 minutes, and the Joker is one of the better villains I've seen, especially when he's a clown.  It would be a very good movie even if it was not the first Batman movie, but it is a nice refresher for a fan of the comics and of the movie franchise.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know it's about to get real bad when a guy who had been at a party is asked to drive his car home, and he asks his friend if he needs a hand in fixing it. So we've got the bad guy (Hank Aaron) having a party, and a girl is also at the party, but she is also pretty upset with Hank for taking her to the party so late at night. So when Hank is asking a friend for a hand, she decides to tell Hank exactly why she was upset with him. Now, Hank Aaron is the only guy who was ever really good at being a pitcher, and this movie is all about how he used to do it with a broken wrist. So why didn't he just do a little dance around with her, or at least pretend to, instead of doing all that work trying to make a little girl like him? Well, because that's Hank Aaron. He's not a little kid anymore. But it's all going to work out in the end, don't you think?

It's in a desert where it's night time and the only lights are those coming from the windows of buildings. There is one streetlight here and there as well. It really looks like the kind of place where people would just disappear and no one really knows why.   If I could pick only one movie to watch in the entire year of 2017 and that would be this one!   I love the way the film is shot and how the camera moves. It truly is a beautiful film to watch and I have yet to see a movie that makes me wish I was the main character in a story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a world where   I can't say I'm not surprised that   they would go with   the old   standby,   there are still   a lot of people in   society   who   think   that  a person   needs   to   have   some   money   in order to  to live   comfortably  .

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a masterpiece of suspense/thriller-style. The actors are all great:  John Huston and the young Mary Astor, with their high school girls, are wonderful.   There are many good scenes. There is a scene that really brings out the sexual tension between Mary and John.  The other great scene is the scene at the end.  If you like a movie where the girl has a crush on the boy at the gym, this is the movie for you!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an incredible story about the origins of an important and often forgotten American cultural figure, George Bernard Shaw.   Mr. Shaw is a fascinating figure, one of the great British stage directors who made his reputation with a great work of fiction, " The General", which was also a tremendous commercial success.   His work was an inspiration to the people of the United States and elsewhere in the West, and it gave him enormous success for over forty years. Shaw had a wide and diverse range of audiences as well, from the lowliest working class person to the most affluent socialite, with the audience often shifting over the years, but Shaw remained a great public figure for the entire 20th Century. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't really expect much from this movie, as I did not expect it to be a good one. But I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting any great visuals or an emotional or thought provoking message. I knew this was going to be an action movie about the war in Afghanistan, so that's not what I was expecting. But the movie does a good job at capturing the tension of the times. The script has been really strong throughout the entire movie. I am still hoping that there is a way to cut this movie down a little bit. And I would like a good ending to this movie so that it doesn't feel as if this was all done just for the sake of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun adventure about the adventures of a boy named Tom, and his adventures with his friends, a girl named Dorothy, and a talking dog named Pinto.   Tom's dad, who's a police officer and a very good fighter, has him join the navy on his 17th birthday. Tom is the son of a doctor and his parents are very kind and loving. Tom's friends are mostly old men with guns and Tom is always the cool kid.  One day Tom is riding in a car with his friend Pinto, when Pinto's dog, Pinto the Talking Dog, starts talking to Tom. Tom then gets to talking to his dog and starts making friends with Pinto and his friend, Mrs. Ripper.  When Tom's friend, Captain Ripper, comes to town to tell Tom and Pinto that the Navy is looking for a guy to join them, they decide to try out a new idea. They convince Captain Ripperman to let them try out their new toy.  Unfortunately Pinto has a bad habit of talking to himself. Pinto gets to thinking, "It's a talking toy!" and starts talking all kinds of things about everything he sees.  They then decide to have Captain Rifferman talk to Pinto so he can try out the "talking toy".  Once Pinto understands what's happening he's a lot more cooperative. They then run out of the house and head to the town park.  As they are out of sight of the park they start hearing gunshots. Pintos gun starts to talk. Pingo: "What's going on?" Tom: "Shhh. It's just a gun." Pinto: "Hey, hey! There's a man!" Tom: (looking around frantically) "Is this the Navy? There's some Navy men?"  When they get back to the house the police arrive and Tom's father is arrested.  Tom and his friends then decide that this is a good idea.  Captain Romperman is so excited about Pinto having a talking gun that he lets the dog talk to the talking gun for a few minutes and then he lets Pinto be.  The police arrest Tom's Dad and the police chief asks Tom and Dorothy if they've ever heard of the boy Tom used to live with.  Dorothy and Tom are shocked.  A lot of people are shocked about this too and they wonder if the boy is really dead.  Then the Navy
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After some serious speculation, it turns out that the film was actually filmed in a small town (in the United States), but the town itself is nothing of the sort. You can drive out to a small clearing in the middle of nowhere to get a good view of a town on fire. The fire was started by a man who went to the backwoods to collect mushrooms in search of a way to avoid the taxman. He never went to get the mushrooms, he was just out of luck. As he was going to collect a small quantity of mushrooms he stumbled across a body covered in berries that the man had eaten. The man then realized that the berries he had eaten were poisonous and he had a severe allergic reaction. He shot the body three times with a.30-06 before realizing that he could not shoot through the berries with a bullet. As the man was sitting down in the dirt with the gun, it was then that he noticed that the body had a small child who had been killed. The body was put into a ditch and burned by the flames from the fire.   The film then moved to a place where a small man is trying to figure out what he wants to be when he grows up. He sees a beautiful young woman, and he falls in love with her. He realizes that this woman is something special, and decides to marry her. When the young man was being interviewed for a position with a local newspaper, he thought that he was being given a job as a field worker. Instead, he is taken to the front door of the woman's house to be married.  After the wedding, he realizes that he will never have a child, and thinks that this is the reason why he has never gotten married. He decides that he has had enough, and that he must marry the woman, who also happens to be pregnant, so that they can give their children a good life.  The film then takes us to a house where the young woman was married to someone else. This woman is living with her husband who has died. In this house, there are a couple who seems to be happy together. Then, the young couple, whom the two men have been living with, suddenly turn on the young and angry young man and shoot him in the back, killing him.  I have to say that I enjoyed this film, but I would like to think that a few things could be done better.  It seems as if the director,

It truly has a sense of humor, even if it's not always funny. It even makes you feel as if you're in a different country. The setting is fascinating and beautiful. There's a sense that the writer is there with us. It takes you on a magical and enchanting journey.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw the trailer for "Evan Almighty" I was excited. I watched a movie called "Inception" and I thought that this would be similar, because it had a lot of the same elements. In the movie "Eden" the people from another planet are trying to save the planet and they start off by building a city. The people from this planet then start to take over this city. In their attempt to save this planet they fail, they are too evil for even this planet. They take over the planet, enslave the people and kill the people. When the people of this planet finally learn about the "Everest" they want to try to stop them. The whole movie is just one long scene where the two people try to free the people they have enslaved. The thing I found interesting about this movie was that it actually seemed like an adventure movie. They had a great action scene at the end where the people start trying to free themselves from the control of the "mockers". This movie is a fun and entertaining watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very interesting movie which takes place in a school in the 1960's.   The story of the movie is a good one.  One of the students in school in this time period had lost her father, was a prostitute, and was also a racist.  This girl took a job as a nanny at a very rich family.  The young lady is a bit too self absorbed with her life, but still tries to live as normal as possible.  She is a black woman in a white town.  That is all we get out of this story.  I'm not much of a cinephile, but that was a nice movie to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, as I said in the video: " I loved the movie but it has a few flaws. Some problems include: - the story is the weakest of the three (it's not a bad movie but the only interesting part is in the third). Also the special effects are a bit boring. But that doesn't matter, since these problems are easily fixed with some great music and the great acting by all the actors. And the best part: the actors were really cool!   "   - the movie has a very long running time, with some scenes that would have been shortened without some of the characters being in the background (this is especially true in the second half, which was much better).   It's worth a watch even if you don't like the first three movies, because the third was really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The ending of this movie is definitely a reaction to a previous film and has some good surprises.   It starts out with a character playing a banjo on a farm which is a reference to the song "The Ballad of Huckleberry Finn" which is from the same time period as the film is set.  Then a boy named Bob and some other kids get their hands on a map that leads to an old, abandoned shack and a cabin. The next scene has the boy saying that "There is a whole world out there".   This is when the first surprise comes in.  There are two children playing on the ground. They are called "The Kids" and a man with a bow and arrow is standing nearby.  At first the camera doesn't focus on them and then the boy says, "There's a whole other world out here" as he shoots the arrow.  He then looks at the bow and says, with a wry smile, "Hey, don't you wish you had your own arrow?"   Then there is a large fire with a young boy and girl playing on a boat.  A dog runs up to the boy and he says "Hey dog, I wish you could have a paddle."   Here is the second surprise.  The girl tells the boy she is going to give him a new paddle. Then he says to the girl, "You've got to help me get into the cabin" and the dog runs over to the cabin.  This part is where I became really intrigued.  When the girl got the paddle, the boy said "I've got a real big canoe," and then he says, very excitedly, "I want to paddle this big canoe!"       There is a great sequence at the end of this film where the boy is paddling his canoe.  It is very interesting to see the boat. It is built of wood and is very light.  After he got in the canoe, he goes out into the woods and comes back and says to "The Kid", "I just paddled the canoe all the way into the forest!"  This was the moment that I thought I had to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an absolutely entertaining film about a bunch of poor, but incredibly funny, actors who are hired to play the leading roles in a film that was never going to get made.   After getting through the script (which is not bad, but nothing particularly special) they meet up with the director and director's wife and make the short walk to the set.  When they get there they find that the director is dead.  There is a note on the desk and the last words to be said by the director were 'To my fellow actors' and 'I love ya'.  The actors decide to walk off into the night with no destination and no script.  After walking several miles they find their way to the studio and have a meeting with the film's producer.  The producers are not happy and think that they will have to cancel the picture and start over.  However, they then decide to have the actors re-enact some scenes of the film.  This part of the picture is absolutely hilarious.  I laughed and laughed, and even though it is only 20 minutes, the film is worth watching.  It will have you in stitches!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so sick of seeing movies about people's mental health problems.   It was depressing how often movies were about people who could not function, even with medication.  It seemed so impossible that people could not get along and still be productive in the workplace.  The sad truth is that people don't always act as though they are well.  And when they do, it is usually because they are on medication that they cannot function.  We see a good man come to the rescue of a depressed woman.  There is an air of romance and love at the center of the story.  But there are also many moments of frustration that give the viewer the sense that no one is really solving the problem.  Yet when we reach a certain point in the story, the characters get together to make a plan.  To do this they need help, but the idea that they can handle it is clearly in question.  This was the only movie I saw this year that made me laugh.  I can not get over how many times one character says the same thing, the same sentence, to the same person over and over again.  Sometimes these sentences sound absurd because they sound like they are in response to other situations.  All the characters look so happy and so at ease, I don't think they know that they are hurting.  My favorite part was the scene where the woman walks up to the men.  They are standing near a lake and as they look out the window at the water it becomes clear that one of the men is depressed and is crying.  Then the woman says something that makes them think and realize that he needs some help.  Once they reach the cabin they are immediately faced with the problems that the woman described.  One of the women is afraid to let anyone in the room and the man has to help her.  However, the one problem that the man does not think he is aware of is his inability to do simple things like putting on a shirt and taking off his shoes.  These are things that make me laugh, and make me think about how I would be feeling if I were him.  Overall this movie is a great movie about a man who has a serious mental health problem.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie.   In my opinion, the story is extremely interesting, and I don't think you could make a better story with such an original setting.  This film is very good and shows some of the most interesting things that you will ever see in a movie: an angry dog who can't wait to jump up on the head of the bad guy, a gang who gets in a fight over a young boy who isn't going to do anything about it, a family who is the victims of injustice, a little boy who is very sad.  I'm going to add a few more things here: there is a part where a guy is shot in the head.  There's a scene where a boy is watching the news with a smile on his face.  The bad guy is in a room with the girl from the news.  When the gang has a fight with the boy, they all start to laugh.  A boy is in the pool with the guy from the report.  He's been on a trip to England and doesn't have a job to look for.  In the pool, they have a real fight with him.  Then he jumps out and starts running.  So, we have a guy who is in some sort of prison situation because he doesn't want to do what he's told.  It seems like he is a very sad person.  And he wants to jump out of the jail and jump into the water.  One thing leads to another and he doesnno where his parents are.  We meet a dog who loves nothing more than to jump around.  What a nice dog he is.  But then he sees the man and thinks, "Hang on a minute!  Where's my mother?  Now I'm off and running!  He goes out in a hurry.  As he gets out of sight, he thinks to himself, "Why did they make me go out in such a hurry?"  There is a little kid in the story who can talk to dogs and he talks to the dog who has been talking to him all the time.  Later in the movie, he runs to his mother's house.  She is at the beach, playing with a dog.  All the dogs are going around in circles.  At first he doesn 't like it.  "This dog does not like me, Mom!"  He says this to himself a lot.  After a while
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I like to get back to my roots," says Walter Matthau in his role as a down-on-his-luck, over-sized guy who tries to take matters into his own hands in the wake of a tragic accident that brings him face to face with his own mortality.   Well, I can't deny that Matthau is an original character, but I can see where the jokes begin.  This is a comedy of sorts, with the humor coming from Matthau and his character. He's a bad-boy lawyer who comes up with some ridiculous schemes and ends up in quite a lot of trouble, which usually leaves him on the verge of suicide.  It doesn't work out that way, of course, but that doesn't stop the movie from being funny.  Matthau takes a great deal of liberties with the rule of law and with the rules of his profession, but the film also has a great number of great one-liners and a wonderful sense of humor that keeps the film from being too silly or too serious.  The film stars John Ritter as a dapper attorney who gets mixed up in a lot on his case, which leads to some entertaining banter. The plot of the movie is rather dull, but it's fun to watch Matthau get mixed up with the law and take a trip into the world of comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad that this film has been released to the public. It is indeed a very good movie. The cinematography is top-notch. The plot is very good. The acting is good. It's funny and heartwarming. The story is simple. But it is a well-told one. It deals with the plight of a mother who is dying from cancer. The film starts with a simple scene. She was standing in a supermarket and a child suddenly came in with a ball of smoke. She didn't understand the child's actions. The child, however, seemed to understand her. The mother then asked him where he got the smoke. The smoke was coming out of the boy's nostrils. The boy told her that it was coming from his nose. The girl in the supermarket then came out of a room and said: "He is a strange boy. Don't let him talk to you! He has got a big nose!" The mother, however had had enough. She told the boy not to talk to her any more. She then told him to lie down on the floor. As the boy went to lie on the carpet, a man walked into the supermarket with a suitcase and took the boy away to an old folks home. After that, the mother stood in the door of the old folks house, the man was still in the house, and the mother suddenly felt ill. She started to weep. The little boy started to say: "Oh, mummy! Oh, mumby! We're getting off to a good start." The mother started to think: "Well, I don't like what this fellow said! What's he thinking? Is he going to hurt us?" "What he said was fine. You just let him keep talking and we'll soon get off to better times!" The little boys friend came to the mother and said, "Oh! We've got a nice old lady here now!" The girl came to take the boy home. The next morning, the girl came back. "She's looking a little strange!" "Did she forget her breakfast? I guess she didn't eat!" The boy said to the girl: "Why, what's going on here?" The little girl said: 'Don't worry, mum, it won't affect me. Don' worry. I'm still alive.' And the little boy was about to say, "You can't get a good old lady by not eating! And I don
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A friend of mine always used to call me "the man in black" because, without my suit and cap, I looked like a guy in a black hoodie.  I wasn't really "in a hoodie", I was in a blue suit and an orange fedora.  When I first read this book, I thought the title was going to be, like, a reference to a movie I liked from the 70's.  What I found was a novel that had nothing to do with the movie in the least.  It's just a book about someone who is in love with his love.  One of the things I liked best about this book was that it's almost too much of a cliché.   This book is the story of a woman who is "in love" with someone named "Lulu".  "Lulula" is a girl from another planet that doesn't speak English.  That's about all I know about "Lulus".   She is, after all, a "beauty", which I guess she is because "she" has some of the most gorgeous "hair" I've ever seen in a book.  But, Lulu, unlike her "beautiful" appearance, is extremely lonely and in love. This is not a happy love story though.  Lulu's boyfriend is an insomniac who "drinks himself to sleep."  Her mother is a very old woman that takes an interest in Lulu.  Her father is her mother's only real friend.  Despite all this "romance" I just felt it was a pretty typical love story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've never seen the classic movie, A Clockwork Orange, you're in for a treat.   It's set in the late 1960's and centers around Stanley Kubrick and his obsessive relationship with a young woman named Eileen.  Eileen, in her spare time, has written a book about a man who meets strange people on his way to work. The movie is so bad it's funny.  Kubrick spends a lot of time on set playing cards and drinking, and the movie is all about the two of them playing poker together.  There is no actual violence in the movie (except for a couple of brutal murders)  The plot is nonsensical, the characters are boring, and even the bad-ass scenes are stupid.  A Clockwork Oolong is one of those movies where there's almost nothing worth seeing.  It will have people rolling their eyes and laughing at you from the first scene.  But by the end, you'll be thinking the same thing as you were when you first saw it: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has some very strong scenes, which are just like your typical "monster movie" (but in a good way). This movie is very entertaining, and a real classic!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, at least this one has a beginning, middle, and an end. I mean, I don't know about that ending. It just has a lot of loose ends and it is not as interesting as it could have been.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's easy to get lost in this movie: it's got a story that's really a mystery, yet it's a thriller about a couple that goes missing, and then the mysterious disappearance is the center of a lot of the action. This is a very strange movie, but there's a reason for that: it has something to say.   This is the kind of movie I'll look forward to on my drive to work every day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good movie that I have been wanting to see since I was a kid. It's about an orphan who finds a dog and adopts him.   I thought it was a little cheesy at first, but after seeing it I realized why they did it. It wasn't really a movie that was about animals. It was a movie about animals and a kid who adopted them.  This movie is good enough to have been better.  I recommend it to all the dog lovers out there, but only for dog lovers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a real gem! It's one of those movies that, if you haven't seen it yet, you should at least give it a chance. It's a very well made movie with excellent directing, the movie starts with a nice, well directed title sequence.   The movie has a very good cast of actors:    It has an all-star cast with some well known actors: Tom Selleck, Gene Hackman, John Travolta, and Richard Gere.    The movie starts out with an old, blind man who is very fond of baseball, but also loves to read, and has an old baseball card that he wants to trade for the love of his life, a beautiful young woman.  The woman he is in love with, named Laura, is one of the top basketball players in the entire country, and she plays it very cool.  She also is very kind and understanding to the old blind man, but that's just her personality.  So, they both get together, and there's just one problem with it... they don't really get along.  Their personalities don't mesh, and they have different ideas about life.  But this doesn't stop them from starting their relationship, and then... well, you know how it goes.  I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to all of you.

It had fun and was a little bit darker than your usual Disney movie, but it was still very funny.  This is a classic Disney movie and is well worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very enjoyable movie about a group of young girls who meet at a party and go on a camping trip.   The story starts out as a typical campfire adventure. The girls become really close to each other and are very playful.  I did like the friendship between the girls, I don't know why they don't get closer friends.  There were a few awkward moments at the end but I thought that they came off well.  This movie is a good campfire movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a lot of potential, and even though the story doesn't seem very interesting (that is to say the movie is fairly predictable), the action is good and the atmosphere is cool.    There are a lot more shots in this movie than there are in the original Star Wars, although the action scenes are slightly less spectacular than in the previous movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the idea was proposed by the writers of the film, it sounded just too great to be true: a man is kidnapped by aliens. The crew of the spaceship that's carrying him to Earth is destroyed.   And this story is true:  He is actually abducted. His spaceship crashes, and he is alone.  In the end, he is given a new spaceship, and a new life, where he can be himself again.  So far, I'm very happy with it.  The action is good, the characters are nice, the soundtrack is wonderful, and there are plenty of surprises.  I haven't seen too many movies like this. It's a wonderful adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an awesome, silly, funny movie. It's one of those movies that has made the world laugh and maybe even think, at the same time.   It's funny and it's a big, fun movie.  There's just a lot going on here. It shows the effects of nuclear war, it talks about the effects on children, it tells the story of a family, and the effects and effects on people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful and moving movie about an Indian immigrant and a young woman with whom he falls in love.   He is one of the most interesting and likeable characters I have ever encountered in any film.  He is a young man whose Indian heritage has caused his great hardship and misfortune. His uncle has abandoned him to travel the country in search of a wife for him, and he is desperate to do it.  The story is so well-executed and well-researched that I can't tell you how much I admired it. At the same time I was saddened by the fact that in all the scenes in which it appeared that a romance was at stake or that a love plot was under consideration, no attempt was made to make it romantic.  It seemed to me that the writers were trying to avoid romance, or at least to disguise it as a fact. This, and the fact (which seems to have no explanation) that a boy like Sam, after having fallen in love with a young girl is so deeply hurt by her indifference, is so sad, so pathetic, that you want to scream in the face of this film the horrible crime it has committed, and you wonder why these people were so keen to make this film, a work of complete depravity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been a long time fan of "Tales of the City," which I'd actually seen years before this film. I was thrilled to see them cast in such great roles, with Daniel Day-Lewis and Anne Hathaway being perfect for each other. They are so funny and charming together that you have to be in on the joke. I didn't see any of the film's content, though, except what I saw of it on YouTube before I watched the movie and it had all the charm I had loved about this film in other versions. I hope we get to see a lot more "Tale of the Cozy" in the future because it's a very fun and charming movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a pity that the American version (which is not bad) is very similar to the Italian film: a young American journalist in Sicily, working with an Italian journalist and his cameraman in the midst of the American occupation and the Sicilian resistance, with a bit of comedy thrown in.   A little bit like a cross between "Memento" and "The Last of the Mohicans" in style and plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about a guy who has a car crash and ends up in the hospital. Then there's another car crash, the hospital gets shut down, and they go to New York City. And there is a lot of talk about cars.   The movie looks amazing. And it doesn't feel like a typical film.  It seems like the people are really having a good time in their own way.  The camera angle changes frequently to show the people in the middle of everything that's happening.  A good soundtrack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't like most horror movies because there are so many of them, so many good ones and some really bad ones.   The good ones are more memorable than the bad ones, and some of them (like the one with the dogs) are funny as hell. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are familiar with the film The Mummy then you would know that it is a horror film. This is the sequel of that movie which is more of a horror-adventure.   The film begins with a group of teenagers getting ready for a Halloween party. The boys are excited to get dressed up and scare the school children.  The night passes and the group becomes restless and restless. This makes the boys wonder about what they should do for a good Halloween.  Suddenly a mysterious creature appears in the middle of the night in a dark area. The group runs towards the creature and are all frightened. This creature appears to be a mummy and moves at such a fast speed that it can be easily seen. The boy who has seen the mummy is in complete awe of this terrifying creature and the others are very excited to see what they will do next. They decide to hide in a deserted house with the mummy until they can get rid of it.  At the end of the film the group discovers a secret door which the group tries to use to escape the building.  After the group escapes the building they decide to go to a bar for drinks. They get to the bar and everyone is talking about the new movie. The young women are talking about how awesome it is and everyone else is getting a little drunk.  As the night goes on and the bar becomes more and more populated with people, one woman comes up to the group. She is dressed in a black corset and a leather collar. She then reveals that she is a vampire and that she must eat all those who come to the dance.  Once the group knows the situation they go to the basement to retrieve a magic lantern. They then decide to get rid with the vampire.  They go to her and attempt to feed on her. The vampire is too fast for them and she is able to grab the boy before he can get to her.  So then the group decides to get to another part of the basement and try to escape before the vampire comes back. The girls then decide that the only way they will be able to leave is to kill the vampire and then the vampire must be eaten.  It is at this point that the group finally decide to do exactly as they are told and get rid the vampire before it is too late.  I found that the film was very well acted and there were several interesting sequences. The way the movie begins with the kids in their Halloween costumes and then shows

The first thing that I noticed about this movie is the music. It is very similar to the music of the film The Shining and the music was also used to great effect during the scene of David taking the dog for a walk in the movie The Shining, and the ending of that movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie with my mother and my father. My dad had seen it on television years ago when he was a child. I went to the theater with my parents because I was curious about the movie. The story is simple and it's easy to understand. There is no gore or sexual situations in the movie, but the movie is still a good film. My father had to get up from the theater to go to work. It was a good break from the movie but not something I will remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this a while back, after it was released to a somewhat mixed reaction in Hollywood and in the public. I must say it was an interesting film, if you can keep up with the plot line and all. In terms of action, it's not up to the standard of what we've seen in other "war movies", but it's definitely worth watching for its dramatic scenes and the acting is pretty good, too.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way it's hard to believe that this film actually came out in 1985, and yet this is a very entertaining, entertaining film. I mean I get the joke about the girl playing a game that has the loser's family on the hook for thousands of dollars.   Unfortunately it's not very funny, it's very much a love story with a lot of humor thrown in. It would be really funny if we could see what would have happened if he had never met the girl, or if he hadn't met her at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I do not know the movie well enough to have a proper opinion about it (especially on the good side), the main plot is fairly good and the movie is about a small community in North America with an old man who tries to build a school. That's about it really. But the movie doesn't have a great feel to it. It may have a good plot but it is too much about the story, it doesn't really give the impression that they are really trying to build the school. At least the movie itself doesn't seem to be focused on the theme of school building very much. The movie seems to be more about the kids than school building.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really hard to describe. It is about a mother and son who love to play together.

The mother then gets mad that her son seems sad and gives him a book of Chinese poetry to help him relax.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know how this was produced with an original title.   The story is like some sort of strange story involving an elephant and a human.  This movie is about a human woman (Lillian Rheingold) who is living a happy life until a strange man, (Peter E. Evans) shows up and gives her a strange task.  She must get the elephant out of her hotel room because this elephant is "an evil spirit".  She goes on a journey that involves a number of wild creatures and even a mad scientist.  It was a strange film that could have been a lot of fun but the ending was very disappointing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised how much I liked this movie.   At the beginning of the movie, I was expecting a stereotypical horror movie that just shows you something bad happening to someone else.  I wanted to say "Wow, this is bad" when the girl died.  At that time, I thought to myself "This is not going to be good, but this movie is not terrible."   A friend of mine, who is a teacher of my son, who loves horror movies, told me that this is like a "good horror movie" and he is right.  He told me to see this movie with him.  But I don't want to say that this movie doesn't have any scares.  This movie is scary, but the main reason for that is the characters.  The main character, "Jack," seems to be the most interesting character in the movie. He is a guy who likes to take pictures of dead people, and he uses these pictures to make the people disappear when they are dead.  When he meets the girl, "Lola," he sees the pictures and he wants to take some pictures of her and make her disappear.  After a while, when the film is over and the film starts to slow down, we see what happens to the girl:  Lola's eyes start to blink and then she wakes up.  She is confused because she is wearing a white dress that makes her look like an angel.  So she is confused, and then the "real" Lola shows up.     The girl is a bit more aggressive than Jack, but when she realizes that Lola has seen her pictures, she is just confused.  Then we see the dead girl's clothes being scattered around.  These clothes seem to be more like "clothes" than they are like clothes.  And then we see a man's dead body walking down the road.  How does a dead person walk down the street?   After seeing all this, I don  t think that the movie is supposed to be scary.  It is supposed  to be funny and it is really funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure this is the last time we see George Clooney in a lead role, I'm sorry to say this.   George Cloony is a little slow and a little boring at times in the beginning of the movie but then he starts to pick up the pace, get involved and you really see him grow as an actor.  George gets a nice little role in the movie as the guy who buys his girlfriend's brother's car, then as soon as the car is delivered he goes and buys his wife a new car and so on.  The movie is a nice look at the characters who are on the verge of becoming men as they deal with their problems, it is an interesting look at what being a man could be like in a society which is looking down on all men and women as unimportant people.  For all the wrong reasons.  If you don't mind, I have to recommend that you donít give this movie a chance, I certainly wouldn't have thought it was good, in fact I would probably have rated it a 2 or 3 if I hadn't seen so much about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this is a nice little film. It's like something out of an Ed Wood film - no doubt influenced by a couple of the previous Wood films.   It's got a lot of funny stuff going on, as is a lot, but the main character is a little too silly for my tastes.  There are a few times when the camera cuts to shots of other people in the film - a man and his dog, a bunch of kids in the background, a couple and their dog, etc. and you realize that the film is really more about these people and their lives than anything else.  I haven't seen a film that has me laughing out loud all the way through yet, and I think this is it.

I found myself giggling like a crazy person as my favorite movie characters performed a series of increasingly goofy routines. I loved the way the movie blended comedy and drama seamlessly. It also had a unique theme. -The acting was very good. I don't think anyone was over the top. -One of the best sequences is when the two lead characters, a little girl and a man, go out on a date, all of the other children are jealous and jealous of this guy. They hate the guy and his girlfriend.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As much as I liked The Exorcist, I also liked it because I thought it was a clever way of tackling the subject.   A little while later, I saw The Ex-Angel, and I found myself liking it even more.  In an interview with director John W. Campbell, he talks about the difference between The Ex -Angel and the others:  When I was a boy, when I heard the stories, when they played on the radio and the television, I didn't know what to think.  They were a little terrifying, the things that happened. I'm a lot older now and I know what they mean.  What did you have to do to be a succubus? It is a real job: you must get away with what you want.  (I thought this was a good thing.)   There are no laws about this, and it was not always so.  Now that we're in a world of demons and evil, the only way to fight them is to be the best of them, to make your evil seem normal.  [W]e were all girls back then, and we had the time, the freedom.  The only way we could get away from the demons was to become a succubi.  You must get very attractive, too. It would make things easier for the succubuses and more likely that we'd be found.  These girls have to have an "angelic beauty."  Then you are a succuble.  We had a big secret.  After that it was easy.  I was sure we were the only ones like that.  There was no one else who had to do it.  It was the worst job you could have.  At night I could have sex with anyone at anytime.  Then I was found.   So they would have to go to my house and get me to drink a lot of alcohol so I'd become pregnant and get an abortion.  That's the secret.   The only one we could keep in our house was me, my friend, and my little sister.  My friend, of course, would be the mother.  So they'd go to the house to get me.  When they'd get me there, the two sisters would be already there.  Two babies.  But we had one more little thing to do.  How would we get away in the dark?  They would have one baby and a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't been to the movie theater for years but I was able to pick up a ticket for this film. I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype so far so I wasn't disappointed.   The film centers around a group of friends trying to get through a night out in LA. They spend the night at a strip club but the manager is having none of it. This all becomes very confusing when one of the guys ends up having to change out of his clothes in the bathroom.  The two guys who didn't have anything to wear start trying to talk some sense into the manager but don't really do any good. Things are looking up for the guys when they're approached by a hot chick who is dressed like a prostitute.  While we're not quite sure why she is there she seems to know a thing or two about this situation.  This leads into one of those classic action films you're used to seeing on tv.  It gets very intense and you're ready to see the group of guys kill it but things don't work out like that.  Instead we have to wait for the police to get involved and the scene of the three guys trying to kill a hot girl ends up with the manager ending up with a bullet in his head.  Luckily the hot chick is still there so there's still one guy left and he takes out his anger on the two who had tried to shoot her.  I can't remember if it's a good thing that the police are involved or not but the ending does leave the film in a good place.  You might want to sit down before you start this but if you do it's well worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character, Richard Pulsipher (James Stewart) is an over-achiever. He was raised in an upper middle class home, went to college (which he skipped, but was allowed to graduate), has a high paying job at the city's "largest and most prestigious bank," and has a house and car with lots of money. Yet he is a horrible father and a bad husband.   His wife, Jean (Judith Godrèche), is an actress who has a bad reputation in Hollywood and an unstable family. They split up, Richard takes off to become a movie star, but he makes his own mistakes.  Richard's friend and fellow over-eager achiever, Dr. Richard Gere (Robert Redford) is the head of the bank.  Gere is an interesting guy. He's arrogant, arrogant and arrogant and he is so.      So I really enjoyed this movie, but I just can't really explain how I felt about it.  It's very funny and it has a nice ending.  I just thought it was an okay film with some really good characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has taken me a long time to come to this film's favour but I must say it has impressed me beyond any expectation.   The story is pretty straightforward: a man and woman are on a picnic when a mysterious man with the head of a man is chasing them. The man takes them into a room full of bizarre objects and the woman becomes very ill. She gets better as the film progresses but as she is about to leave the scene she is stopped by a man with a huge moustache who claims to be her father. He also says he has come for a 'visit' and asks her to accompany him back to his home.

I'm a big fan of all the movies that have been made from Cameron's films.

The story is really good too, really funny, with all the right gags. I really love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was the most popular in the Philippines because of the strong performances by the actors and the story, which is about a man who falls in love with a young girl, and later becomes involved in a kidnapping scheme which ends in disaster.   I love action films like this because I like to see people trying to do something, and when they are successful, they can enjoy the rest of their lives together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't expect to like this movie so much. I just got tired of the same old shit. There's been a few good films in the last few years about people who have lost a family member to cancer and they live their lives doing everything they can to help out and try to bring their loved one back to life. It's not pretty and it's sad. It just doesn't have much to offer other than a good old fashioned old fashioned western. I guess that's a good thing because the old west isn't exactly my cup of tea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first movie I've watched where my mind went blank. No words, just music, and a couple of images. The music is haunting, and the images are haunting. There is something here for everyone, and I highly recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie because I heard about it at a local movie night and I wanted to see the movie for real. This is a great movie that shows you a great way to use a pair of binoculars, and this is one of the best things I have ever seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like this movie, I think that   There is something to be said about a family man trying to help his wife find something more with the passing of time and his aging.   He has a big house and he spends it, and spends a lot of it, on family activities.  He is a good man with good ideas who seems to be doing the right thing with his life.  In a way, he is a typical hero who has a mission and has a goal in life. But he has made a mistake.  I do not agree with all the things that he says.  Like, "The man you know is nothing like the man who gave the first speech."  "That's a long time ago. I just can't remember."  He may be a good guy, but I think he is out of touch with what he thinks.  There are a few things in this movie that don't seem to add up.  But there are good things in there too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I just rewatched this movie at home for the first time since it came out.   It's really good!   The story is about a girl who falls in love with a boy who was an Army fighter.  The girl and the boy get together to do "special" things to make up for lost time.  They go and do all sorts of things, some of which are illegal (the military) and some of it are really fun.  In the end the boy and girl grow closer and it's the most beautiful love story you'll ever see.  It also features two of my all-time favorite actors - Jennifer Connelly and David Carradine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to watch this film to find out why I didn't like it when it came out. It's so much like that original, which I did like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A classic in every sense. From the title, to the sound of the opening shot, to even the music that begins the movie. This movie is like a cross between The Wizard of Oz and The Great Escape. It has beautiful scenery, a great screenplay, some wonderful characters, and a story that has never been told before. The first half of the film is like the Wizard of OZ: The Wizard in disguise. Dorothy is in a great old house, and there are many wonderful scenes with her friends and her horse. But the big change begins when she meets the Scarecrow, who has an amazing voice and sings. It is just amazing, and I love the fact that the Scarecock actually looks like a man, as opposed to a cartoon. But he is not the only wonderful character. The Scarecrow is followed by a group of friends. One of them is the Tin Man, and the other two are the Cowardly Lion and the Cowgirl. Together, they have to get back Dorothy and their friends. The Cowgirl tells Dorothy that there are some wonderful treasures in the mountains, and she leads Dorothy to the Great Cowgate. But there is only one path back, and as the group walks, they are followed by the Wicked Witch and the Wizard. It's a great idea, and it is the beginning of the great American adventure, one of the greatest stories ever told. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a fun movie with good humor and good visuals.   I had a blast watching it, and the whole experience was great, from the first time we see the little guy sitting in the corner watching the people, to the last time we hear his tiny little voice calling out to us: "Oh, no! Don't shoot me! It's a trick! Don- er, come on, come here. Oh, no!"   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the same fashion that the original The Man Who Fell to Earth (1968) used natural settings as the basis for the story of an astronaut's arrival into outer space, this is a tale of a boy's journey to Earth.   Unlike the first film, which was also shot in natural settings (the boy's father's house), this is no sci-fi, and the boy does not find himself on a space ship. The man who fell to Earth is a young man of average physical appearance who has been taken to Earth for a job.  He has no idea of what the job is, nor where he is, except that he's working in some place where he can get away from all his friends.  While working at this particular place, the boy, whose name is Carl, meets other little boys who seem to have been born on the same day and in the same place.  The story begins with a boy named Joe, who has recently fallen down a well.  In a manner reminiscent of Carl's time on the moon in the first man who Fell to the Earth, Joe falls through a hole in the ground and into the water.  As he tries to swim to the surface he makes a great noise and gets scared.  Unfortunately for Joe, there are no boats.  Meanwhile the boy who fell in the well has to wait until a boat comes and takes him to a ship.  At this point the two little boys begin to talk, with Joe talking about the water and Carl talking about Earth. At this moment, the ship begins to rotate and Carl seems to be caught in the rotation.  Carl's mother is afraid for her baby, but Carl seems perfectly fine.  When he gets back to the boat, it's revealed that Joe was not falling down a hole but floating in the air, so they decide to take him with them to see how Earth looks like on the surface.  One of the boys, Johnny, comes with them and the ship makes a right turn.  Johnny gets lost, but the others find their way home.  There is a close-up shot of Carl as he is taken to the city that has the man who is falling from the surface on a conveyor belt.  To see Carl in person is to see a young boy who doesn't know much about where he comes from, or why he has landed here, but who is also quite happy to be alive.  I am not sure how Carl
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is a good one. This is a story about a man, a very good guy, who decides to travel through time to stop the evil dictator and then becomes a time-traveling vampire. I like time travel movies.   It's a nice story.  The time travel and vampires are good.  A story like this has been done a few times before and is quite common.  It is probably one of the better stories in a genre.  What was really good about it was the use of a nice old house and it's surroundings.  There was an excellent soundtrack and the film did a nice job of conveying the mood.  This is one I am definitely going to watch again!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with the scene that sets the theme of the movie for a while, showing a woman, naked and having her breasts stimulated by a hand.   One minute we see her enjoying herself and then we see the hand in a moment of embarrassment.  But we never see the woman's face. It's not until the next morning that we see a face. The face of a beautiful girl who has just been naked in front of a group of people.  The girl has been playing with a large black cock.  We then see a few scenes of the girl getting fucked by a large cock. And finally we see how the girls cum on the black cock while the people just look on in amazement.  I found the whole movie fascinating and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about an ex-con's last hope.   I like the movie as much as most other people, it's very good.  It gets off to a slow start, with a rather dull first act.  The rest of the movie gets more interesting as the plot develops, but a bit too slowly for my taste.  I don't know why they didn't go for something with more twists in it.  At the beginning, it was all business, with the ex-cop's wife leaving him, and the ex going after the son of the guy she hates more than anyone else.  After that, I didn't feel anything really interesting, the whole movie was just an exercise in seeing who could get away with the most, and that's the best they could do. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not one of those "it's all about the story" people, but this is a real good movie. If you're not the type to like action movies, then you probably shouldn't read any further than this review.   As far as the plot goes, it takes place on an unknown island, and has a crew of mercenaries led by an older version of Jack. The movie is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, but the movie's screenplay is written by John Frankenheimer.  In the novel, the group meets a woman on the island called Tippi (Sylvia Plath).   In an amusing bit of foreshadowing, the movie depicts the old man in the movie as a man who has been going through some life changes.  The man's name is Henry and he looks like a cross between George C. Scott and George O'Brien.  Tippi and her crew help the mercenaries escape a deadly ambush by the island's locals, and the old character ends up getting injured when one of his men is hit by a tree.  After a few minutes in the hospital with a bad injury (and a bandaged head), the old Henry is returned to action. He has a wife called Eliza (a terrifically played Sarah Paulson), and a daughter named Kirta (Sophie Marceau) who is an annoying, useless young woman.  Henry is still somewhat a legend among the mercenaries, and he still likes the island, even though it is now called the "Hangover Island".  In fact, his life on the Island is pretty much the same as it was on the mainland. He's still traveling through the jungle, picking up new mercenaries (and the occasional young virgin), and the main difference is that the island has grown into a much bigger country.  At the end of the movie, the film ends on a somewhat ironic note. One of the main characters, Eliza, dies of a heart attack, and we are shown the old mercenary's wife, who is upset that her husband has died. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts in a small town in the midwest where the family of two young boys, Billy and Billy Jr., live. It's a quiet town, quiet with no kids, quiet in the old days with the old guys in the barber shop. The young guys, Billy Jr. and Billy are both just out of high school, and Billy Sr. (the barber) and his wife, Mrs. C. (whore for pay), are old timers. The guys are still playing football when a girl, Lucy, comes along. She's a big girl, pretty, and all the boys, including Billy Jr, fall for her.   She likes him, too, although she's pretty, but her sister, Missy (H. Lee), is too old for her to be much of a concern. And when Billy Sr., who's pretty hot, and the kids, get a party, she ends up in it. She has a party with other girls who are pretty, too.  There's a good old-fashioned, old-school, all-around-good-guy-with-no-compromise movie here.  What I like about this film is that the boys have to get to know each other as friends and not just as football teammates. It also has a pretty good female lead in Missy, a young girl who's not too bad.  The story is, of course, set in the 1960s and the movie takes place during that time period, but the characters are based on what we see today.  They come from different backgrounds, but they're all like that, and each of them knows how to treat other people. I enjoyed watching this one a lot more than I enjoyed the first. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited for this movie, but I was a little disappointed. I thought it was going to be a good film, it was definitely going to make me laugh a lot. I just didn't get it. This movie made me feel uncomfortable and gross. It made me want to see a doctor and a clown do something disgusting to someone else to try and find out what's going on. I'm so disappointed I missed this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie about the power of friendship! It's based on the life of a young boy who goes to the island for an all night sleep over. He gets kidnapped by a man named 'Kane', who is a drug dealer and kidnapper. The boy washes ashore and meets a very different group of people... and the story grows in scope and complexity as the boys get closer to each other. There's more to the story than you might think, and it's a great story that I highly recommend.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never seen a movie this good!  I mean, it's an action movie that just happened to be about a boy with a magic ring!  In fact, it is a very entertaining, well-crafted story with wonderful characters.    If you like action movies with a good sense of humor, this is your movie!   The first 10 minutes of the movie   is really fun!  The magic ring itself is not very original - the story is very similar to other films with "I love you" - "We will see each other again", etc.  You get that right out of the gate.  But the real fun comes when the ring turns on our hero:  He is a normal kid with a normal life.  He has his own neighborhood, he goes to school, he does what he does, he has fun.  However, he is visited by a mysterious figure:  The character's name is "Jazz" - a boy who has a magic (read: magical) ring.  It turns out that Jazz can read minds.  J. Edgar Hoover finds out about the ring and sets out to destroy it.  The movie shows the reactions of all these characters:  How does the parents react when Jazz comes home with the ring?  How did the kids react to the ring turning on?  Is Jazz going to be the next Johnny Storm?  The characters talk with each other, they work out, they make friends, they fight, they have fun. In short, the movie is filled with laughter.  And then the action starts!  After Jazz is able to read minds, the bad guys come looking for him and take him out of school.  Jazz is left alone in the city for a while, but then he runs into a couple of thugs and the rest is history.  This movie is a must for fans of action movies.  (It may be a good idea to check out the poster above, which is from the movie's theatrical run.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my favorite movie of all time. I've seen most of the James Bond films and I still enjoy them, but I can't imagine doing the same thing again in a movie without Daniel Craig (the only time I can imagine is the time when he went with James Bond to the Middle East in the second movie - and that's a good thing because I don't know anything about that part of the world.) This is the first Bond movie that I could really relate to.   If you want to see an awesome movie, I recommend that you watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is not very good, but I don't give a bad rating to it. The plot is too short and the movie too short.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun movie! I love watching comedies in between a film and a live show. I love that it stars my favorite female comedian in a role so silly and funny.   I feel this film would work better as a live action short, rather than a live comedy. The comedy doesn't really come into play until the end.

There was a lot of violence in this movie (and in real life, but we all know we'll never see that in real Life) but there were also some funny moments and some great, emotional moments.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In spite of a few bad scenes (and I have seen many worse ones)   this is a good and enjoyable movie. It doesn't give us a long exposition about why God's in the sky and what he is up to. He doesn't do this to hide anything (like most movies do), but to give us an explanation of why the sky is blue and how God's going to take over our world. In the beginning the movie is pretty bad, but it gets better.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so glad I saw this movie because it was so much better than most movies I've seen.   This movie shows how to put on a great performance while also delivering a strong performance.  The movie is set at the high school wrestling championships.  This is the movie where a character gets so upset that he punches a coach in the face.  He starts the fight by talking about his son.  When the guy starts punching him in the head the boy starts crying.  Later he tells the crowd that he was so hurt when he started the fight he started to cry, he didn't want to lose to the wrestler.  So the wrestler gets a little bit better and the fight goes to a little town for some fishing.  That's where we first see the character who is so upset he punches someone in the first movie.  Once the wrestler got better and had a better style he started doing some more of his "tricks".  Eventually the guy is no longer getting punched so he just starts to get hit.  One guy says "why don't you try a little more" and the wrestler does it.  Then the coach yells at him and the guy says something along the lines of "what the hell does that mean".  Then it turns out that the guy in the fight with the wrestler is the wrestler's father and the wrestling coach had a problem with it. (I can't recall what the problem was though)  So after the wrestling match the guy and the coach go to get a drink.  But just before they get there the wrestler hits the guy with a chair and the two of them fall to the ground.  What makes this movie so good is the acting.  We get to see the wrestler get better and better until they get into the ring and start fighting.  Sometimes they get knocked out of the ring when they get out of control and that's when the actor gets the best performance because he is able to act how he does in the ring but acting from the ground is different.  Also, there is a lot of humor in this movie, but the humor is all subtle and the humor never gets too funny to the point where it becomes annoying.  For example, there's a guy who likes to say "fuck me" whenever he says something stupid.  It's funny when the guy's mom is talking to him about how much he loves her and she says "fuck you" to him and he replies
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen a couple of good horror movies (e.g., V/H/S), and I have come to the conclusion that the only truly scary ones are the ones that are not scary at all. I really like this movie, because it is one of those horror movies that you can see coming from a mile away, but that are still horrifying.   It's one of the first movies that I've seen that features a little girl that has been kidnapped and forced to become a vampire.  A girl's mother was murdered (so that she could use her body for the sake of her son's vampire father), so her father (who has a violent temper and is a very unstable person) kidnapped the little girl and made her drink her mother's blood.  When the little boy comes home, his mother has apparently returned and she is being a very different and dangerous person than when she was last seen.  The little girl is obviously afraid of her mother, but her father is also very violent. He kills all the animals around the house and is the one who forces the little sister to drink her own mother's menstrual blood (it's clear that the little mother was pregnant at the time, and her pregnancy caused her to become pregnant with a vampire).    She seems to be going crazy as she goes about her motherly duties, but I don't think that she is insane (she certainly doesn't seem that way, though, so that is a mystery).  A vampire is a pretty terrifying sight, but a vampire is also a living, breathing human being. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen a movie so enjoyable in a long time.   The acting is just as wonderful as the writing.  The plot is not complex but it makes good use of a long-established premise.  When the action starts, it's really good.  I'm just not sure I can tell you that about every action movie, but The Raid 2 is really good, despite its length. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie from 2010 is The Wolf of Wall Street. It's hilarious, outrageous and suspenseful, and I thoroughly enjoy it.

I am a little upset that this movie is not in a "big studio" release like the others, as there are scenes that would be hilarious in a studio film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Somewhere in the world people have had the misfortune to find the remains of a little old lady who had tried to run away from a cruel husband, only to have her head sliced off. It's a long and depressing story, but it's also filled with many fine moments, and there's a great moment near the end where a young child catches a glimpse of a lady's face as she's being run over, and the child asks "What did you do to her?", to which the woman says "She never said anything bad. She always said good things." and the boy replies "But the little fellow just started screaming. You'd think he'd run over his own grandmother, wouldn't you?" The woman replies "I didn't do it."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does not have any major flaws, but it has several minor ones. For example, it is not well acted, and the leading roles don't have much depth. The rest of the cast is very good. The movie's most memorable scenes are scenes with Dr. Martin, the father of the lead characters, which are very funny. I had to look away a couple of times because I just laughed out loud at them.   The movie also has some great scenes, but the writing can be rather cheesy, and there is a scene where two women in a nightclub seem to want to have sex with someone other than each other and they end up having a long conversation about how they are going to keep having sex for the rest of their lives without ever actually having sex.  A good movie that is worth seeing for what it is worth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would say that I didn't like the movie, I didn`t like this movie.   So, if you are like me and you didn`'t like this film, I am sure you will enjoy this one.  If you like the 80`s films, like to see cheesy action movies with bad acting and cheesy music, then this movie is for you.  However, if your not a fan of the 80s films then this film is not for you, especially if you like movies with a little more substance to them.  For the people who haven't seen this movie, this movie shows a guy who is trying to kill a monster with a weapon that looks like a toy gun.  His friend is the cop who is the one who comes up with the name `Lethal Weapon`.  The movie shows some very good action scenes that are not very scary.  In the beginning the movie shows how lame this weapon is.  The monster gets a hold of this weapon and begins to rip off some people`s flesh.  I found it to be very lame.  Then, we go to a motel and see the monster and this monster`s friend come to blows.  This movie is a classic in that you don`t need the `c` word to describe this movie and this is an excellent movie for all fans of the classic 80` movie.

I like to think that this film was one of the first, and most successful, "wedding" films.  This film stars some very strange and quirky people who make me laugh at almost every minute of it.    There's a movie on the net that makes fun of this film.  I wish you the best!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 5 minutes are the best part of this movie, it's actually a bit scary as well.   In the end, though, the movie has one major flaw: it's too much like a horror movie.  The "slasher" theme can be heard in almost everything the movie does, from the soundtrack, to the opening sequence, to some of the effects and even the cinematography.  This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever and you can easily guess the result of the whole thing with one look at the title. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the only film I have seen about the Vietnam War in my life. It is a very interesting story about the war and the impact it has had on the people who fought it. I saw it with some friends and a few of my friends were a bit disturbed by the depiction of Vietnamese as dumb, ignorant, and cruel. I was just trying to show that this war was just as bad and horrific as people make it out to be.    I am glad this film exists, because we need more films about this war. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at the midnight showing at the theatre. It had a very different feel to it compared to the other films we have seen from the same director and star. I felt like I was in a different world. This was not like any movie I had seen in a while. The world, the setting, and the people were so much different. It was a very weird feeling to see something that didn't look right, something so strange.   It's a very strange movie, but one that is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I was walking to the theater on a cold December night, I couldn't have thought of a better movie than this one. In fact, it's the perfect movie in so many ways: It's fast-paced, witty, witty-as-hell, and the laughs just keep coming.   The plot follows a bunch of kids who attend a public school in New Mexico.  One day a student named Frank (Tim Roth) shows up and tries to be the guy everyone wants to be. He's the best in his class, has a girlfriend (Jessica Hynes), and all the girls in school know him by name.  Frank and his friends decide to have a night at a party when the girls realize they're being used by Frank to steal their clothes, make out, and fuck them.  As Frank, Roth is brilliant. The actor has a dry wit and a sly sense of humor that can only be described as very sweet. Hynes has a lot of fun as the pretty and spoiled blonde named Jessica (who is a bit of a klutz).   At one point, Frank runs into an old friend (Richard Jenkins) who has apparently returned to New Mexico and has some serious plans.  There are plenty of funny moments and some very good performances, so I couldn t help but be in hysterics every time a good laugh was had.  It's the one movie where you don't feel bad for the people who are badgered by the kids, who aren't all that bad.  This is a fun, funny movie that I would highly recommend to any teenager who's tired of the crap the movies at the mall have to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember when i saw this movie as a kid it was like the first time seeing a vampire. The vampire in this movie was just too cool to look at.   So i thought, why not make a vampire movie with a kid as the main character.  This was not a bad idea as the kid was a very likable kid.  The only problem i had with this movie is that it felt rushed in many ways.  It took an already long movie to get to the point where i was in a room with a demon in my house. I didn't want to watch the movie until i got to see the demon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. It was a great story and there were a lot of good acting performances.   What I didn't like about this movie was that the bad guy, who I thought was played by Tom Hanks, was played very badly.  - December 7, 2006Dude, Get a grip!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  I can't say anything bad about this movie.   When I first saw the trailer for it, I was like "Oh crap, what is this movie?"   I have been waiting for this movie since I saw the original movie in the 70s.  This is not a remake of the original, this movie is a whole new story, set at different times.  So far, I am pleased with the movie. It is a story about an evil scientist trying to do something bad, but gets caught up in a whole mess of events.  I really liked the evil scientist.  He is really bad, and in the story, he seems to know what he is doing and why, even though he makes all sorts of silly decisions that don't make sense to anyone.  The scenes were really good, too.  They really capture the essence of the movie's setting and feel.  It is just a whole lot of fun.  You won't find a more fun movie in my book.  And it is a movie that I want to see all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always thought that there were more interesting stories in the film "A Christmas Story" than what was shown on the silver screen, and it seems to be so in this wonderful and hilarious parody of the popular Disney movie.   The comedy is great and the story is well told, though I thought that it would have been better to have been filmed in black and white. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an old school comedy with a modern twist. It is really silly in parts, but there is some very good jokes in it. It does not have a plot so it doesn't have to be funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie. It's funny and well done. A couple of problems:  First of all, it's not really clear whether the person who talks about "punching your mom" is actually his mother or the guy's brother. Also, the people who die are mostly not the ones who die in the real movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always thought that one of the most interesting characters in the movie was the one playing his role:  He was a very strange and unusual guy with his accent and peculiar mannerisms, and I loved his attitude towards the situation in the film.   The movie was very funny and the cast worked together very well:  The performances were not only believable, they were also very well done, although some of the actors may have been better suited for the stage.  This is a film I recommend you to give a try;  It's a shame that the director who took the helm for the movie did not get more opportunities to show what he could do, but even so, this is a good watch for the rest of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I must confess that this film has a few of its faults:  It was made for the silver screen, and it lacks the elegance and polish which make a good film good.  However, it is a thoroughly enjoyable little film which, despite its faults, is good fun.  The most striking feature of the film is the sheer fun in its writing.  This is a picture which, with all its flaws, has plenty of charm.   (I am aware that it is rather long.  I could have cut the fat and shortened the film, but I was more interested in the plot than I am in making my own film.)   I have been watching this film all the time.  My only real complaint is that it ends on a rather depressing note, rather than on a good note. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the first film then you'll like this. The new character is a real delight, he has his own voice and isn't afraid to speak up for himself. The movie is a very good one for the most part and the effects are great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I heard of this movie I thought it was a little silly but the more I watched it, the more excited I became about this movie. The actors are pretty good, the director can do just about anything, it's just a little too long for the movie but it's worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first watched this movie, I was really angry about the way the story was presented. This movie is about a man (a professional bodybuilder) who has a lot of sex, but he's not in a relationship. The relationship with the woman is a complete disaster, and there is a lot more to the story than the movie allows.   This movie was fun and entertaining, and you can't go wrong with watching a man do an awful lot of nasty things to women and then sleep with them a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film. I had no idea what it was about until I saw the trailer for it and the synopsis, it seemed very complex and complicated but the story is so simple and so entertaining. The first half has very little action, but the second half is very good, with plenty of suspense and suspenseful characters. It is a very enjoyable film, I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes horror and thrillers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a good film. I liked the idea, and I liked that this movie had a certain genre, but then a certain type of movie always fails: the romance. So what's different about this movie is that I liked this movie. I didn't like the romance as much as I liked a lot of romance films in the early days, but even though I was a little disappointed by the romance I still liked it. It wasn't exactly a good romance, it wasn't even a good story, but the romance was still good, and the idea of the movie was good.   I think this was an excellent film and a good sequel. I can't wait to see what's next.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is difficult to describe in words the emotional and psychological impact of this film. It is so profound and profound that in order to understand it fully you have to watch it at least a hundred times and you will never forget it. The first time I saw it, I was deeply moved. I watched the movie again the very next day and was equally moved. A film is not worth seeing if you're not moved, and this one is very moving.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie that I didn't even know was made in the 1990s until recently, and even after years of searching, I have never seen a more hilarious film.   The movie opens on the back porch of a nice, quaint house, where we see a man who is being threatened by a giant snake.  Then, for some reason, the giant snake grabs a man from the back of a cart (I have no idea what the cart is) and tosses him at some other people, who are all laughing and having fun.  The snake then grabs the man's pants, and starts to turn him into a frog. The people at the back door are then laughing as well, and the frog slowly begins to turn back into a man.  And this man is really going to enjoy the rest of his life, as he has a new job and a wife.  This man, as well as his family, are the stars of the film, and it's a pleasure to see him as they are funny and charming, and then, when it gets to the point where it's just them laughing and being stupid, a few of them will turn into a snake and then a bunch of other people.  I don't know how they were able to make it so funny, but I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is amazing!   It's not only one of the best movies i've seen this year, it's one of my favourite movies.   The story is one of our most important:  First, you'll notice that in the beginning we have our main character named George (Michael McAvoy) and he's a big, beautiful man.  He has his life going the way it's supposed to go, but when he comes home he finds out that his parents have gone.  Now that's a shocker!  As you will see, this can change everything for the man. He's an orphan and has no other family, so he begins a quest for his parents who he believes are dead.  The film is made up of flashbacks that are told in a very cinematic way. The story itself isn't a great deal to do with the plot, but what makes the film great is how well it adapts to our main protagonist.  This film isn't as good as a movie like "The Shining" or "It Follows", but what it does has it's own charm.  It has some real beauty to it.  If you are looking for something to watch this year then this is the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a really interesting story that had some really good action in it and a really good story and characters.   The action was good and the story was good.  I was kind of bored a lot of the way through so I just wanted to finish up and then go to bed.  There was no real reason to do this movie, it was just another story about an old man that likes to get people to do his dirty work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing I love about the "Valkyrie" is that it's just so simple. You're a teenager who just gets his first girlfriend, she wants to stay at the apartment and stay in bed until she has sex with him, and then she comes home naked with a man who wants to have sex with her too. This is a movie with no real drama, but instead just a simple plot to make the main character feel like a jerk. The whole movie is really just about a teenage boy who just wants to get laid and is happy to just see a girl naked with him.   "Valkyries" is an animated film about a girl that is trying to make it to the big dance, but can't do it because she doesn't dance right. In this animated film, she just wants a hot body and to find a man to take her dancing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed the movie.   This movie has a great plot.  A young man (James Gandolfini) has a dream that he is on the back of a large animal, and when he reaches the end he sees a large rock.  This dream ends up being a very difficult problem to solve and the story makes the movie very interesting.  I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who likes movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was raised on movies by my parents.   This is one of the most hilarious and heart wrenching movies I have ever seen.  I don't want to say too much about the plot because I'm not smart enough to tell you all of it.  It revolves around the plight of a little boy who has been adopted by a family of aliens.  They have one goal in mind: to take the boy and use his unique ability to travel in time and change the world.  These aliens have had some bad luck with their time travel experiments and have been very successful so far.  The little boy does everything he can to stay alive.  Unfortunately, they have a set of rules that he must follow: 1. No touching of the little boy, and 2. If any people see him, they must run away.  To help his family they need a child.  A very special child, who happens to be a boy.  So they try to find someone willing to take on the job.  However, this little boy is not very interested in becoming a child, which causes all sorts of problems.  Eventually the mother gets sick of this little trouble-maker and decides to send him back to the future to be raised by a father with whom he is already familiar.  This sets up a tense race to the time machine, which they set off in their spaceship.  All this time the little boys friend has been growing and learning to understand his life and is now ready to assume the responsibility of being a boy for the first time in his life.  If they don't find the father in time then they will be dead in the future, and the alien race will not come to existence.  And if they find him before they can destroy all the time machines, then they must destroy him as well.  While the little man searches for his father and the aliens, the mother is also searching for a way to escape her future.  As a great film, this movie is one for the ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would give this a five, with an "A" for atmosphere and a "B" for the acting:  It's about a young boy with special powers, who must be cared for by his parents.  It is an excellent story, which will have you glued to the screen.   It will keep you guessing the entire time.  My only concern about this is that it might not have enough action to keep you watching.  I was not a big fan of the children characters, but I can see why they're not that popular.  And if you're not a huge fan of children, this will probably not change your mind.  So a "5" for a good story and good acting, and a 10 for great animation, beautiful music, and good animation throughout: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One can say that after The Third Man (1964) and The Man Who Fell to Earth (1951), Stanley Kubrick made the first American science fiction film with his own unique style and unique visual style.   His technical skills were very well suited to the problems he was solving: he was a pioneer in the use of 3D camera shots, the special effects were very strong, and the special dialogue of the scientists was very impressive.  This was not a science fiction movie at all, but a historical drama.  The science of the movie is very convincing.  It is true that the space race between America and the Soviet Union has been over for several years and the moon has been returned to Earth, but it was not until about 1965 that the U.S. government started a second moon program, led by a woman, Sally Ride, who was a professional space adventurer.  Although most people believe that the moon landing was a hoax, there was a real moon landing in 1965. The fact that Sally Ride and several other people survived the lunar surface is very interesting.  My only complaint is that the ending did not come as a surprise.  A film is complete only when it ends.  There is no way the movie could have been longer, because it is the end of the story.  One should watch The Man in the Iron Mask (1966) and be glad that it is not The Third Men.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun little movie, with some funny scenes. The first scene in the theater is cute: a few people playing cards, and then a woman walks by, wearing a dress that looks like a little donkey. It's a good joke to watch a woman in a dress walking by. There's a short sequence where the girls are making out in a classroom, and one of the girls is dressed in a little red dress. It might seem like just another sex comedy, but I think it's very funny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting more of a comedy from this film as it was a remake of a short film that starred Richard Gere (in the role of a very tired man).

I like how they are trying to give a different point of view, with the use of the camera. The music is also nice to listen to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say much about this movie; I was so busy thinking about the meaning of life that the movie wasn't worth watching.   This movie is about the life of a woman whose husband has cancer. He has been diagnosed with a very serious disease which will likely kill him in a couple of weeks. The doctor, Dr. Niebuhr (the man with the mustache) has prescribed medication to help him fight this disease. Unfortunately, it's causing him to age so fast that he's basically not living, his hair is falling out and he can't find anything to wear.  The doctor knows that there must be some more effective medication, so he takes the drug that only people with the illness take. This drug, Zoloft, seems to be working for Dr. Nybuhrn. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, the cast of characters from all the different eras were great.   The story seemed to be inspired by the "Sailor Moon" anime and movies.  The movie takes place in a town called "Luxor" which is on a mountain. There are some kind of aliens living in the mountains. The story is about the invasion by aliens who want to take over earth.  After a series of events, a giant spaceship lands on a beach. After that, they invade earth and the world is in total chaos.  I loved how the movie was about the aliens wanting to invade earth. It reminded me of the movie "Alien" and how those aliens want to colonize the earth. I loved all the aliens in this movie. I especially loved how they were like giant aliens with big bodies.  This movie would have been awesome if they had put the alien into the "Alien," the "X-Men" and "Ghostbusters."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's been three years since the first film of this film series was released in Japan, and I don't think I've been as thrilled about it since. The film is about a samurai who falls in love with a beautiful woman named Risa (Kishida Asami) while serving in the army during World War II. During a mission to bring the daughter of the Emperor back to her mother's home island, the two meet a young girl (Yamamoto Mie) and begin their courtship. I must say that I really liked this movie. It's not your typical romantic comedy film - it takes a lot of risks with the love story. It has lots of funny scenes, and it is well written and executed. I also thought it was great that a Japanese film would be made in the 60s and it's characters would be drawn from a similar time period, although they are of the opposite gender. The music is really beautiful too, and the animation is top notch, even though it was shot in 1973, as far as I'm concerned.   The only thing that bothers me a little is that it has a lot more of a plot than I'd like. It ends about halfway through the film, although you don't need to see the last two thirds to understand what happens. I don`t think it`s fair to leave some things unfinished though because the movie is really great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved  ! " The King's Speech" is a good   movie and   the only thing   bad about   it is that   you can never tell   what   is going on.   F. Paul Wilson :   The King   Speech   was   made   in   1848  .   As   this is   probably   one   of   his best movies   there   are a few things   that   made    me   hate   him.  This   story   about  Wilson   king   can   not   be   true   because   he   never   did   such   evil   things . But   for   a long time   Wilson   believed   all   these   rumors   and  his   heart   broke   over   King . There   seems   to be  the   only   reason   why   people   like   Winston   so   much

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the world of film noir, the film Noir, is a good genre of films. Noir is a genre of movies that deals with the crime, and not only in the film world, but also in society. And what's more, Noir is an American genre of the 20th century, and it is well known for its low production values. But the movie Noir has good special effects, and great writing. It's interesting to see that Noir can be a good thriller, and that it can be an interesting character study.   Noir is a very good thriller about crime and society. It is one of the best American noir films of the year. I give Noir a 8.5 out of 10.

There are two characters who will make you laugh out loud - the little boy with the big head (and even bigger stomach) and the great big belly. It is wonderful seeing them on screen, especially the little one. You'll be thinking of him for days. The rest of the film is good, and there are some lovely moments. You can't get enough of this movie, and it is very enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie many times and I always marvel at how the writers of this movie somehow managed to create a story that doesn't suck.   It is the story of a poor boy who is left in a bad neighborhood and who makes a bet with a wealthy person that the boy will make it through the night in spite of the bad neighborhood.  This boy eventually makes it to the wealthy man's mansion where the two make up and become good friends.  The story is simple and a good story should not have to be told in a simple way.  I think I might have enjoyed this movie even more if I had not seen it so many times.  I had this on DVD when I was a kid but I've only recently had a chance to watch it on DVD. I had been meaning to do so for a while, but I just haven't had the opportunity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know what some of you are thinking, "Who is this little girl? And why does she keep going back to the same place? Who is the guy she's with? Why does he always keep her talking? Why did they start out in the middle of the river? And is that the girl with her arm in the air? She's so funny."   And I say, "Yes! And you're a good actress, too!"   Well, you can never be sure of anything, but the one thing I do know is that there are more than a few "bad guys" in this movie.   This is a comedy, not a drama, not an action film.  In fact, it's a pretty darn good action film, too.  If you're looking for a "high point" in a film that is loaded with "good guys" and "bad, but good" movies, this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the show, and even though I never watched it back in the day, I still had a lot of fun with it, and this version does a great job of bringing some of that fun back into it, while also making some of the better moments that I enjoyed a little more subtle.   One of the best things about it is the performance of David Hyde Pierce as the title character.  He's an intense, tough, but ultimately caring, but somewhat insecure and lonely man.  The way the show went about depicting his problems is also fascinating, and I love how the writers try to explore how his struggles with self-worth and his feelings for his sister helped him to grow into his character. The writing, with the addition of a few brilliant twists, is a lot better this time around, and it shows a lot more focus on the emotional elements of the story, so while it's a little harder to get into than in the first film, that's not to say that the story is bad, it just feels a bit more polished.  It's the character relationships that make this a great movie, and all of them are fun to watch.  I'm going to have to wait until it comes out on Blu-ray, since it's such a fun movie and so enjoyable, but I'm not too upset about that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very nice film about a man who's in his 60's when he finds out that his wife died 5 years earlier. His best friend is still alive, and he wants him to go on a road trip with him. They go to a farm where the farm's other farmer has just been killed, and the man is still missing. The man has to try to get the farmer's wife to tell him where she was taken. This is such a well done movie, and it was a nice change from the usual old Hollywood movies, although it still had a lot of the clichés from those films. It took me a while to get into this movie, as I thought that I was watching a boring old "cowboy movie" (no offense to cowboys), but after I'd watched this movie for awhile, I realized it was the complete opposite. The film was very well done, and very dramatic, although the drama wasn't what I expected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very good. The movie takes place at the beginning of the world war and is a short but very enjoyable movie. The plot is very easy to follow and the film has a lot of things that you can do in order to become a better person. It can be funny and a lot has a great effect on a person. The music is really good in this movie and I think it gives a lot more pleasure than it did when the movie was made in the 50's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie: The movie takes a rather dark turn by the end of the movie (though that is not the main plot point). The main character is a rather disturbed young man who has been a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of two other men. He becomes increasingly frustrated as his life of isolation grows more unbearable and he tries to commit suicide. His attempt results in a violent outburst which sets off a chain reaction of events that cause a series of events to occur and result in the death of many. This plot may sound like a lot of fun and a great way to make a few bucks, but I was a little bit put off by the movie for a number of reasons. The first is that the plot line is somewhat predictable. Even though I knew that the main character was going to kill himself after seeing so many signs of frustration and suffering, I just didn't expect anything to happen. There are a number times throughout the movie when I felt as if I was being led down the path of a very predictable plot. And when it finally does take a drastic turn, it takes a very shocking turn. This can be a bit off-putting to the viewer and can be one of the reasons why this movie does not grab the viewer's attention. In my opinion, the movie did not succeed in making it's intended audience laugh out loud. There were only a couple of funny moments in the movie. And most of the time, the laughs are only felt by the viewers who are watching the movie and not by the character himself. That being said, there is still plenty of good fun to be had in this movie. The characters are funny, the dialogue is often funny, and the movie does have a lot to offer in terms of themes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is about an ordinary family that loses everything when a meteorite falls down from the sky. They don't know what hit them so they decide to go to an abandoned hospital in a town called "Kamikaze." They get the runaround, the town doesn't have much to offer and the people there don't seem like people at all.   I loved this film and it was a bit surprising to me that the cast seemed like regular actors, but there are enough good ones that it's a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is an excellent example of a comedy movie. The story is great, and the acting is strong.   A few of the more ridiculous scenes can be a bit hard to follow, but don't let that fool you.  The story starts out as a silly one where a police officer visits a woman's house and is immediately turned on.  He then visits another, where a man, played by Jerry Lewis, is trying to pick a fight with a homeless man.  When the homeless man runs in front of a train, the officer shoots and kills him.  This leads to a strange, absurd series of events.  What starts out seeming like a simple joke quickly becomes a murder investigation, a suicide attempt, and a visit from Elvis.  It's not much to look at, but if you enjoy silly comedies, and are a fan of Jerry Lewis...this is the movie for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film follows two men who become friends through a friendship between friends. I found this film quite enjoyable. The plot line was really interesting and there was enough humor in the movie. I'm still amazed the story came out like this. I would recommend this movie to all anime fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was initially disappointed with this movie, and I still think so today. But then I realized it's not really a "horror" movie in the sense that you just don't know who is going to die and who is not. In fact the movie gets more and more interesting the longer it goes on and is very clever and inventive at the same time.   My only complaint is that it seems to go out of its way to make sure the film is "for adults" which is not a bad idea on the face of it but really doesn't have much to do with it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know I say this a lot but if there was a film in which you could say "it would make a great comedy movie", this is that movie.   In a weird way, this is more of a romance film than anything else.  It's like a mix of The Notebook (without any of the silly romance and without any of that annoying romantic tension and angst) and Love Actually.  What's especially fun about this one is how different it feels from the other two.  First of all, the film's set at a university.  I can see a few people here and there but it's really a very very small group of people.  Secondly, it's set in a very small town where everybody knows everyone and where everyone has some kind of secret.  This is especially fun to watch because most of the time the people aren't really trying to hide anything.  Thirdly, it has a very slow buildup.  In fact, there are so many great things about it that even with the slow build, the story never really gets boring.  If there is a flaw in the film, it is that it doesn't seem to follow a pattern at all.  Sometimes you'll see a guy in a white coat, sometimes a guy with a white beard and sometimes a girl.  There is also a scene that is sort of the same as the ones that the two people in the white coats and girls have done before and it's not a pretty scene.  But it doesn in fact work quite well and it does feel more like a coming together of characters than a plot device.  Overall this is a really fun movie. I've enjoyed watching a lot of rom-coms but this one has the fun factor down to a science and I couldn't stop laughing the whole time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a high school student who goes to live with his father's friends. I would say he is a bit weird but I think it is a good idea. He has a weird sense of humor, a great sense of smell and he loves to smoke, I think the best character in this movie is the one who has the least lines. I did not realize at first that the "boy" who plays the guitar is actually a girl, but it looks like she is so bad, I was worried about her. But this movie gives you lots of laughs with a very good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the movie of the year!   In the last two years, I have been watching movies so fast that sometimes I feel like I am missing the plot.   With a couple of exceptions, the movies I am talking about are not bad.  I saw them all and enjoyed them all.  There are a few movies that I didn't like and this is one of them.  However, with one exception, none of the movies in this list are bad. The one exception is " The Princess Diaries ".  The story is a bit boring but a lot of things happen in it.  The soundtrack is quite good.  Also, there is some good acting in this movie.  It is an enjoyable movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie a little hard to follow. The movie follows a group of friends as they are having their very first time together. This starts off with a fun evening of drinking, dancing, and joking around. We get some random people that are introduced as being close friends of the main characters. They all end up going to a party where the main character is forced to kiss the woman that he loves. Unfortunately they never really make that happen. They keep making this awkward and embarrassing kiss and it is almost like it is forced on them. The guy they end up kissing is the most out of place one could be, but that is not all. This movie shows how the real thing would look like. What a waste of time, and my money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was happy with the quality of the story, but I was disappointed by the characters.   There is no real development of any of the characters, and we are given no indication of who they are or what they are about to do.     The writing is so inconsistent that it makes the acting more amusing.  I am sure if there was more consistency it would make for a much better movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My god, I am not kidding. I am completely blown away by the acting, the music, the cinematography, the plot, the whole thing.   In fact, if the movie was really just about one guy and a few girls, I'd be a bit less surprised.  The movie is not exactly a great action film, but the action is the best thing in it:  The main plot of the movie is about the young man's love of guns and his obsession with killing.  When he's given his assignment, he finds that the job is simple enough: just go to a place and kill everyone.  There are two girls and a boy at the beginning of the film. The boy is a bit of an idiot, but seems to be a nice enough kid.  As for the two girls, they are pretty cool.  For a second, we get a bit confused because there are two women in the movie; one is a blond with a gun and the other is an attractive woman with blonde hair and glasses.  I was so caught up in watching the movie that I missed the blonde with the gun.  What she's after is a guy who was once her lover.  She knows that he is the one with the skills, so she wants him to kill the guy who she believes is her ex-lover.  In order to accomplish this, she goes out in an attempt to lure him out of hiding.  Then she shoots him in the head.  This is really the end of the story.  After that, we are just treated to random stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  If the movie were really just one long action movie, this wouldn't bother me at all.  But it's not:  It's a really good action movie that actually gives us some really great acting from the young men.  And it's really not a bad movie.  You'd think that a movie about killing would have a less than stellar cast:  I can't remember any other movie where two young men who are into guns and kill a lot would be in the cast.  Of course, they're not good people, but they're really not bad actors.  It is a shame, because there is much better acting in films like Scarface or Rocky III, where the plot makes up for any lack of action.  All that being said, the movie isn't the best action movie ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the only movie to come out in the last year of the '90s, and it's a great movie that has lots of action and a good storyline. The first 20 minutes are the most action-packed minutes I've ever seen, and even the first 20-30 minutes were great.   I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this one was an awesome blast!   For those who want a movie to take their time and not get in their way, you will enjoy this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies of this year   It is just about a man who goes to a hospital because he has an allergic reaction to something, so a nurse comes and finds a man lying on a bed, paralyzed. The nurse says, "You can tell it's not your fault. The body isn't supposed to work like that. You're an extraordinary guy, I'll get you home!" The man's body starts moving and talking, and after a few minutes the nurse realizes that the man isn't paralyzed, but is actually able to move his left arm. The man says he has to go out and get some help, and as he leaves he says, ".   The ending was amazing, so I didn't see what happened with the man and the nurses, but the next day, the man came back to see the nurses and was surprised to find that the nurses were still working on him. The film ended with the nurses giving him the arm that the first man had given to him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, a good sequel, a worthy sequel, and the original's director and writers should get a nod for their work in crafting such a rich world of characters and ideas. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a well made film with some really interesting ideas to consider, and for once the whole plot isn't just a glorified story about a lonely and somewhat abusive husband.   The first act is really quite bad, and although it's not the only bad thing, it's definitely a good example of how bad a film can become when there's nothing interesting going on in it.  We have two different characters, and then one of them (Nanette) dies.  After that things get even more ridiculous, and even when the other characters have things to do, they still behave like this.  It really doesn't matter how crazy it gets, because the film still has a lot of things that can get the audience frustrated.  The story follows the couple for quite a while, and it's really quite a boring film.  Although it is a good thing that the movie doesn't try to be too good, but it just gets to the point where the audience knows that it has nothing to do with the story.  And if you still think it's funny, then you might as well watch a bad movie.  After all, the best jokes of a bad film are usually not the bad jokes themselves, but the way they're brought about.  But it does end up working, because it's a really fun movie with a lot to think about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was good. It had good writing, a good story, a nice story, and a good plot.   The movie was mostly enjoyable.  It has a good storyline.  There are two groups of people who are trying to get a big diamond. One of them is an ex-con with an attitude problem. The other one is a cop who has just been out of the police academy and is looking for another chance.  If I knew the plot beforehand, I think I could have watched it. I wanted to like the plot, but it ended up being a little too contrived.  The main character was a good cop who didn't have any good qualities. There was no real reason he had to get out of school and be in the police force.  I liked the story and the setting. It was a bit long at 45 minutes, but I enjoyed it.  A good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise is a bit strange.   There's a man, John Ritter, who can't stay out of prison.  It's not that he can't.  He's a very dangerous man.  But it's not quite that simple.  There are people that think that Ritter is a nice person.  And he's a nice man in many ways.  In the prison, Ritter meets his old friend, James Caan, and they have a conversation.  Ritter has to tell his story, because it's a true story.  Caan is a tough guy.  His father was a hard man. Ritter was a softy, and Caan was a tough as hell.  The story is that Caan and Ritter are friends.  I can't even remember the name of the movie.  After Ritter gets out of jail, Caan has to go on a hunting trip.  They get into an accident.  Both are in bad shape, and eventually Caan tells Ritter how he lost his job.  So he goes back to California to avenge his father.  What happens?  Caanan is dead.  You don't make a good hero, and you don't lose the love of a girl.  John Rector is a good man, but he's no hero.  This is a pretty dark movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just loved this movie. It was a very cool and exciting time in my life. This was the movie where I first discovered the work of Jules Dassin, and it's hard to believe it wasn't in a film called Dassin (or in a movie called "The Dark Knight"). This is the movie that made me realize how powerful the silent-film-era directors really were. The film has a wonderful, intense, and often hilarious sense of humor that is a perfect fit for the era.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an adaptation of the Stephen King classic and is the sequel to It. It picks up immediately with Bill Sikes' mother and her daughter in a strange and haunted house. The daughter (Rita Wilson) is the only one who seems to have any hope of making sense of the situation: she has a knack for figuring things out by looking at things. She seems to be able to find the keys in the lock to the house. She also knows that she's been locked in the house for three days. She's not entirely sure if she should be afraid of the house or of the girl in the dress (played by Mia Wasikowska).   It isn't terribly scary, although it's not without its scares. There's a weird sort of music that sounds like a child playing a record. The camera movements don't really work, although the story itself is quite good.   The story moves slowly because it is not a horror story (although it feels a little like a horror film at times). There's enough to keep you reading even though there is a lot of story-telling. The story is about what happens when a woman is trapped in a house and has to find a way out to the outside. At one point the girl and mother find themselves in a hallway with a large door (a deadbolt).  The door looks like it could not be opened by a normal human.  This movie is one of King's best, even though it's in a different genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always knew I'd love the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie when I saw the trailer. I was already intrigued by the story, because I knew they had an original idea of how to make a fun movie. The fact that the script was written by a guy with an original ideas was something else.   In the opening scene a pirate (Jack Sparrow) takes a big bite out of a dead man's chest. He's about to eat the whole body when the narrator says "He's still breathing. We must take him away to the ship's galley, to be examined." This scene is something that I've never seen in any other movie (except Pirates of Treasure Island), which is a real rarity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed "Logan"   It is about a group of people who live in a world without time and without space and they must face problems, they must work, to survive. The characters are all different and have very different personalities. The movie is very simple and fast paced and that's the best thing about it, especially in a post apocalyptic world.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been waiting to see "Catch me if you can," but I'm not here to tell people how to spend their time or what they should read.   "C Catch Me If You Can" is about a woman who is trying to find a good man for a family that doesn't have a good husband.  It's about a man who is not in the best of health and who is in love with a woman he has an affair with.  I'm pretty sure this is the only "filler" film in the series that doesn�t have "fad" written on it�.  "B" is like a better sequel to "C."   It does a better job of keeping a sense of pace and being a little entertaining without making you feel like you�re missing anything. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have not seen this movie you are missing out on one of the greatest movie-tracks in cinema history.   When this movie was released the world was absolutely fascinated by the story and I was excited at the thought that it would be a true classic.  The plot revolves around a group of children who have been trained in the art of painting, in the style of a famous French artist who has died. The boys in the group are in constant danger of their paintings being stolen and they must find a way to get the paintings back to their home village.  I have always been a big fan of the style in which it was painted and this movie really captured it in every frame.  In addition to this there was a great performance by the lead actor, Michael Gondry. He was given all the opportunity to shine and did so with flying colors.  This was a perfect example of the way the French film-makers had the entire village singing and dancing during the performances.  So, without further ado, here is my review of 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf'   Part One   The boys' mother is a painter who is worried about their work being stolen.  After getting a note to give to the local policeman, they discover the painting has been stolen. They get help from a friendly priest (Claude Lecointe) and set out to find it.  Unfortunately, the priest is unable to help, and the two children and their mother are left at the mercy of the villagers.  Part Two   After a few days of trying they have managed to find the painting but there is no sign of the man who stole it. After an argument with their mother, the boys go back to her home to find her in the middle of an outburst.  They find her trying to attack an unknown man who they suspect to be the one who stole their painting.  Eventually, they get the painting back but it is still not back to the village. They decide to set out on a journey to find out who the thief is.  When the story begins, I was really looking forward to seeing the boys return to their mother and to the paintings and the villagers that had greeted them with a great reception.  From the start I was so impressed with the way this movie worked and I thought it would continue to excel with each successive frame. I loved the way it went from being in Paris to the back-woods of Louisiana.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In its defense, there are only a handful of animated features released that were good enough to not have to be labeled a "disaster".   I like the art style and the animation was done pretty well.   There's a lot of dialogue here, some of which I can understand, but most of which was a bit difficult to follow.  While there are some great character designs, they are a bit boring.  The sound was okay.  There is one scene where the character that is always looking into the camera turns and looks into the other direction.  This was my favorite scene in the entire film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was an experience that I'll remember always.   I think the movie took place in an abandoned factory/warehouse in the 1970's. It was a really dark, gritty, dirty, gritty movie.  The actors are great and the director was well-prepared and knew what he was doing.  It's a movie that's not for everyone but for people who like dark, depressing, gritty movies like "The Dirty Dozen" and "M*A*S*H."   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film about a lonely, sad old man who has lost everything he has ever had is pretty depressing, and then it gets even worse.   This film is not worth a second thought.  The characters were pretty cliched, and I can't see anything wrong with a young girl who is the same age as our main character and is even the same body type.  I would recommend this film to those who would like a sad story with a sad end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie. It has all the right ingredients: a high concept with a complex story, a wonderful cast, and a strong cast performance by Richard Jenkins.   The movie starts with the main character, a man who is very good at fixing things. After his mother is brutally murdered, the main man, a talented mechanic, and his best friend try to protect a woman named Lisa who is also his former girlfriend.  Unfortunately, Lisa is in the midst of an emotional breakdown which threatens to put everyone at risk.  It's a good idea to keep the focus on the main characters.  What can I say? This movie is awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about this movie I was very skeptical. I always thought that the movie itself was bad (and for good reason). I was never a big fan of the book but I was always impressed with this movie.   It had a very dark plotline, a lot of twists and turns and the ending was very, very well done. I found it difficult to watch but that didn't take away from the overall story.  This movie is very good at showing the differences in the worlds of men and women.  I felt that the characters in this movie did a great job of portraying the women that are in the book and vice versa.  The acting was very good in this one and I always love a good action scene.  One thing I always dislike in these movies is a poor, bad performance from a major female role.  There are very few good females in these films so I always like to see a good one.

It reminded me a lot of the original   The Crow, only instead of a guy who has been cursed to wear the cowl, this guy is cursed to be a superhero.  The story is good but there is too little action.  I was really happy that we got to see a lot more of The Crow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always wanted to see the movie but never could.   The movie is set in 1920 in America.  The town is called "Lick" and is a small mining town.  A few poor miners live here.  There are several murders a year.  It seems the murder victims all have a common problem.  One of the victims is a young girl who has a crush on a young boy.  Her parents are poor and can't afford to raise the child.  She ends up living with the local sheriff.  I have to say that the actors who played the various roles were all great.  Some of them played quite well.    I really loved the way they acted.  They were all real people, with real families. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I haven't seen all of the Star Wars prequels. But I have seen two (and even three) of the original movies. I like the prequel more than the original Star Wars trilogy. I don't want to say too much, but I really enjoyed Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace (May 25, 1999)   The first of the prequel trilogy is more action packed than the second and third film.   I think this was the last of the special effects used in the pre-Star Wars trilogy, but the special effect of the pod race in the final film, I will always remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this I was intrigued by the premise: a group of friends at a high school are being stalked by a mysterious, tall, slim figure in a black leather coat.   It's the kind of creepy that gets the blood pumping, that makes you wish the film could be made into a film series, rather than a series of still shots.  But once the film starts and the suspense builds the tension gradually diminishes.  It all falls apart in the last third.  The mystery is too convoluted to be explained satisfactorily, it's the characters that suffer.  There is a lot of slapstick humor, lots of bad dialog and bad acting, so much that there is little to laugh at, although that is not a bad thing.  I would not suggest this for a young audience, but it is a fun flick to watch with the kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked  ...   The first hour was all about the movie..." The story about the kids and the evil professor.. " It's funny and scary and it's beautiful... There's nothing like it..."   When I saw it for the first time, I couldn't believe how beautiful the movie is.   This is a great movie with a great story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -     I was a big fan of the original   in the 1990's.   The movie   is good, and so is   the sequel .  If you like a good action-packed adventure movie with lots of gore and cool guns,   you will like   this   too.  I also enjoy the new and improved CGI effects and the new villain. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching a movie with some friends a while back and this was the first one I found which wasn't terrible. I don't know if the director knew a good part about writing but he knew a lot about directing, and the story was actually pretty well done. And it was really funny.   It wasn't even funny when I first saw it and then I rewatched it and thought that I'd been watching the comedy version of an adventure movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about  ! I was worried that it was only going to be a low budget action movie, but that quickly turned out to be false. It's a great mix of the best and worst of old western films. It uses the old Westerns as the basis for a new one with a more gritty look. And of course, ! has some great action.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie so much!   It starts out with a creepy little kid and a man with a big stick.   Then they go to a house that has a bunch of little kids, and there are tons of little girls inside and a little old woman.  The creepy kid asks the old woman if there is a boy in her house.  Now we don't know if this was a one shot thing or not, but I'm very interested in the ending.  I don't even think I want to see more of this movie, because I think it's the best one! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this one on a flight on short notice, I guess there was some bad weather and they needed a movie so I guess it is worth seeing.   There are some good characters, some are likeable and some aren't. The movie is a great example of a comedy-action film, which in itself has a lot of great jokes in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.   The plot is interesting, and is a good story that is easy to follow.  They use an American setting to tell the story of a young girl who travels to Europe with her family.  The director also uses American characters and locations to show the world in Europe during WWI.  A very good story.  It should be watched by all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched "Shangri-La" this weekend. It was a good film, with some good performances, but it wasn't the best I have ever seen.   To be honest, I would watch a lot of movies I had not seen before but "Shan-La", which is about a movie star who is kidnapped by the army during a war, did not do it for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.   It is an animated adaptation of the story "The Story of O"   Written in the 19th century, the story is set in the old English country village of Little Taunton and tells the story of the two sisters Alice and Mary.  This is a very good animated adaptation.  It has plenty of slapstick and slapsticky humor.  There is some good acting in the movie. The characters are not what they could have been.  The sisters have to fight a gang of bullies that are terrorizing their little town.  Alice is the good looking, clever one and Mary is the smart one.  Some of the jokes are good enough to get a laugh out of me.  If you liked "The Tale of Despereaux" you will like this too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has the feel of a classic Disney movie: a young boy discovers a magic book, and that is all that is necessary for a wonderful magical story.   And the actors are wonderful:  So far as I know the only other one of his movies to be included in this list is  I think you have to understand that this is a boy who lives in a world full of magic: he discovers a book, the book is magic and the boy is very curious about it.  He is a very small boy.  When he reads the first page he is amazed to see a very different world where there are no goblins or princesses or wizards: just kids like him.  What do you get from this movie?  Well it's a Disney movie!  There is a lot of great animation.  And of course it is wonderful.  The music is beautiful!  It has a very whimsical feel.  It is full of innocence and wonder.  But there are still the magic and adventures.  In spite of all the things that this movie has to offer, and despite all the love it has for its children, it can also be very sad: at times it feels like a Disney fairy tale where the hero and princess are really all grown up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best action movies of the 70s.   I have had a hard time finding a good action movie in the last 20 years. I have seen a few great ones, but these are definitely the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been a fan of horror. It always seems so fake, so phony and so sad.   When I saw the trailer I was so excited. The story sounds good. I've been wanting to see it ever since I saw it in the theater when it was released.  This is a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like this movie! I have seen a lot of horror movies with lots of gore, but I like this one a lot more! The movie does have a lot that is a bit strange, but it is also scary and it is very scary.   I think that this movie has a little bit of the 'Wendy: The Final Nightmare' vibe in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd like to start off by saying that the entire film is beautiful. From the first shot to the last, it is very well done. I really loved the story and the characters.   The best way to describe this film would be to describe a roller coaster: intense, fun, sad and emotional.  One thing that really caught my attention is the scene where one of the main characters falls into a hot spring. It was such a wonderful scene! It was funny, sad, intense and beautiful.  The film isn't too long but still manages to keep you at the edge of your seat from start to finish.  A well done film with a story about a beautiful couple who never stop trying to get married and a rollercoaster ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about time I told you about this movie and the time when I was in the theater and a young girl suddenly came running toward us. She was dressed in red and white and was wearing black thigh high boots. She ran toward the theater in a frenzied fashion. After a moment, she stopped and pointed to the man across the way. "He has a dog with him!" she cried out. The boy's eyes widened and his mouth hung open. He took off running, but then he stopped and turned back to me. "What?" he asked. "My God, he's got a dog!" The boy was so frightened he looked at me with bloodshot eyes and then at the girl and turned away. "We're leaving, then?" he demanded. "Don't say that!" I shouted at him and then I looked at the dog and noticed the dog had gone silent. And then I got up and began to walk out. As I walked out, the dog came running and leapt over the man. I don't know what the dog wanted with the man, but I know that in a matter of seconds the dog took the man's hand and walked over to me and grabbed my arm. He then took me to a small house, with a few white dogs inside, and he put me in the house and said "You've got to watch your back, sweetie!" I'm not sure what kind of a place this was, but the dog did not like it very much and when I looked around, I could see dogs walking in and out of the door. I was so scared I kept going back to the house. I tried to get out of there, but to no avail. I had no shoes and no clothes on my body. I couldn't move and was stuck. The dog then let me go. He left and I tried desperately to get away, but he grabbed me by the wrist again and dragged me over to a fence that surrounded the back yard of the house, and chained me. He kept saying, "Don' worry, sweetheart. We're in a good place!" And then the girl ran up to me, held up my arm and said, "There's a man with a dog. I think you should stay here with us." And then she ran off.   I was still terrified, but at least I was safe.  But what about my dog?   He wasn't able to do much
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The opening is like that moment in one of my favorite films:  -  When I saw The Big Lebowski in 1995, it changed my life.   And I still don't think my life would have been better or worse had I not seen it.  And, to be honest, I wish I hadn't.  The Big lebowski is a funny movie, which is why I am sure it will be a big hit at the box office this summer.  It is a lot of fun and, if you like a lot, it's also a lot to handle.  There are many, many great moments in the movie, especially the moments between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the movie stars.  If you are not laughing, you are probably crying, which I found to be the case most of the time, especially when it comes to a lot more than two or three drinks.  I do not remember who I was with at the time of my viewing of the movie.  Jeff Bridges did the movie for me.  This is what a good buddy movie is supposed to be about:  I'm not going to go into any details about the movie: it is too funny and fun to spoil.  But, it will do that anyway:  It's a movie where you don't really feel like you're there because you are there.  You're not there, but you're not really there either.  Which is where the movie excels: it's a great movie with a great cast of characters who do things in a hilarious, but still good-natured, manner that you don;'t have to be there to enjoy.  -
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I think The Big Lebowski is the perfect movie in which to live.   In other words:  It is an excellent film, in which the humor is so over the top it is almost surreal.  It makes for a very enjoyable film.  There is a real sense of joy in the movie, a sense of delight that comes from watching a brilliant film-maker and an equally brilliant star, both of whom have such a clear vision of how a film should be made.  But I want to stress that this film is not the kind of comedy that has its laughs in the audience and that the audience laughs in return.  The humor is delivered to the audience with a wink and a nod.  What is funny is not funny, what is funny, according to Walter, is not what is actually funny.  This is not a satire.  Rather, it is the comic masterpiece of its genre.  Walter's humor has so much heart and soul.  He is not in a position to deliver a parody of himself.  Nor is he in a place to offer an ode to himself, but he is in a real position to provide the movie's best and most authentic comedy.  For a director who seems so content to stick to the limits of the medium in which he works, Walter has a very strong vision.  A sense of fun, humor, and fun is all his.  His characters are rich in emotion and they have so much life.  I can't wait to see how he will evolve in his next film. "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm very happy that I watched this film because I've been thinking about it so much since seeing it, I've read the synopsis in its entirety a dozen times already, and I'm still not over it.   This film is a masterpiece.  It's so good I'll go out on a limb and say it's the greatest movie of the last decade or so.  I love the way it's shot.  The editing is tight.  This is a film with so much depth that it's hard to believe it's only 92 minutes long.   I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a bit cheesy, a bit ridiculous, and most of all a bit annoying.   I think that the story, characters, and overall quality was better in the movies made in the 80's and 90's than in this new movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a good science fiction movie like Blade Runner, a good action movie like The Avengers, a great love story like Lost in Translation or a good romance like Titanic then this is the movie for you.   I was amazed by the art direction and how well the actors acted in this movie.  The music was good too.  There is a lot of sci-fi/action/love in this film.  It's not as good as Blade Runner but it's not bad.  I recommend this movie if you like sci- fi movies like Blade runner, action like The A-Team, love story about love lost like Lost or sci- love like The Fifth Element. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a time when you can get any movie on Netflix for like 5 bucks, a little movie called "The Great Escape" should be at least half that price.   I can't tell you how much I laughed out loud at that movie.  One of the funniest and most enjoyable movies I've seen in years.  I'm so glad I went to see it, and I've already seen it a few more times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old-fashioned western where it is the cowboys themselves who have to battle and overcome many enemies. It is about a man who has come to the West from the East who sets out to rid the West of the evil which is the Spanish, who have taken the land which God has given them, and who are still at it in many places. One of the most charming parts of this movie is the fact that the characters talk in the original language of the Indians, the language of John Wayne. If you ever thought that a western could be made where the good guy fights the bad guys with a gun and it has a nice, romantic look to it, you need to see this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't really comment on the actual movie itself. It's mostly just kind of a good time with a few good lines, and a decent premise to begin with.   The one part of the movie that really stood out to me was the climactic fight scene.  After a little bit of a rambling and a lot of dialogue it came to a close with the character of the good guy saying "Now I'm gonna have to find some answers, or get some questions answered."   He then leaves, and as he does the camera shows a shot of him walking into the woods where he comes across a man sitting under a tree and then looking over a body of a man, who is wearing a leather trench coat and a large metal head covering. The camera shows another shot of the body in the woods.  This next shot is a little creepy.  When the camera pans across the body a girl is standing in the background, and then a guy is standing beside her.  The girl doesn't react to the sight, the guy does.  And then it goes all out.  It doesn't stop there.  He talks to the body and then the girl turns to look over his shoulder.  There are more shots of the girl's reaction, including shots of a girl being chased, and the man standing behind her. Then the camera closes in on the girl again and again, showing shots of her looking over her shoulder and even a shot that shows her sitting at a table.  Even the title of the film gets the creepy vibe.  Then it cuts back to the bad guy.  For all intents and purposes the bad guys are just a bunch of thugs, and it's really not anything new.  They get the job done by beating up anyone they can get their hands on.  But it was really cool when it came time for the finale.  I thought it was cool that he finally confronted the girl and was about to say something before she turned to him and put her hand in the air saying "Oh my god, what have I done?   So the scene cuts back again to the man sitting in the tree, now wearing a trench coat.  As the camera cuts back over the body the girl gets up and walks over to him.  She then takes a knife out of her trench coat, and walks right up to him as he is sitting in his chair.  Now the girl is about to kill him,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main idea of the movie is that the people of the village that are trying to survive a disease are doing so by stealing food from the local farmers and selling it for a high price in the market. The movie is made up of a lot of short sketches in which the characters are shown trying to make a living and keep their families fed, while making bad decisions, like taking some food without paying for it and driving off with it (like, um, stealing it), not eating it, and not letting the farmers keep their animals. This movie is about how hard life is on the farm. The villagers try to cope with it by working and taking care of their animals, but life is still hard.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a movie as exciting as this. When you think about it, it is really hard to take that much in at once.   When it gets going it is hard to turn the channel.  When the final curtain closes it is all you can do to keep your eyes open.  It is like watching a movie without the dialog:  I'm not even kidding.  The plot is simple.  An alien is taking a dump on a human colony in a planet-size space station.  We are not told exactly what happened, so we have to guess.  You must be able to sit through about three hours of this without falling asleep.  If you find yourself bored to death after the first two hours of a movie, it may be time to get an eyeful of some other movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The premise of "Star Wars: A New Hope" is brilliant, and I don't even have to bring up the obvious comparison between Han Solo and Indiana Jones. You're watching the same guy in the same movie, in a different role. You know, Lucas, get out of that boring "Star-Wars"-style of filmmaking.   You might remember "A New Hope," from 1975, but you probably don't remember that Harrison Ford got a concussion the night before he shot that film. Ford's performance was so poor, and he was so tired that his performance just felt forced.  George Lucas didn't get another film, and the film is a mediocre one at best.  Star Wars was an attempt to create a "Star Trek"-like experience: It was supposed to be the first "Star War"-style space opera, but it ended up being a boring mess, with little to do with the original "Star Raiders" of 1967.  There's only one good thing about "A NEW HOPE" and that's the music by John Williams.  If you're looking for a good "Star," there's plenty out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film   tells the story of two friends, Paul and Michael, who run a small grocery store called " The Good Stuff " near an isolated forest. The store sells a variety of groceries and sundries and is run by Paul and his wife, Marie, who are very friendly and kind. Paul owns a large horse named Billy and has several farm animals. The shop is run under a very simple set of rules:  If Paul is in a good mood, he will offer one dollar to anyone who will make them a sandwich.  If not, Paul will offer five dollars. If someone does get Paul's sandwich, they will get a cup of milk for that price.   These rules seem to be followed by everyone that passes by the store.  The town of St. John, Ontario has a long history of crime and violence and people don't trust the place and think the pair of friends are up to something very bad.  Paul and Marie are just starting out in life and they don't want to give up their job and the farm.  A boy named Jason is found murdered on the farm and his murder is believed to be connected to Paul and Mike.  Mike has a very dark past and is a killer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a young kid who decides to follow his dreams, even though they mean leaving behind his parents, his brother and his own life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man who is very happy to be a hero is forced to face the very real issue of his own mortality.   The hero of this film is not the villain (as he is usually played by Richard Egan or Anthony Hopkins, as is common in this sort of film).   Instead he is a sympathetic protagonist who, as the movie progresses, becomes aware of his vulnerability, his own obsessions, and his own mistakes.  While not quite as good as the original I.B.A., which dealt with the same subject matter, this movie is still a good example of the genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie's all over the place.   While it has a good deal of good stuff, including a fantastic scene that I don't think I've ever seen before (I know the movie is long, but there's so much to watch), it also includes a lot of bad stuff.  It's a very different movie from the one we saw last year (the one where we're told to just be with the good things), but it feels like a different movie altogether.  I like the scene where it's hard to remember that this is a long, strange, very strange movie, and yet, it's as fun as the best comedies.  A lot of what we see of the story, though, isn't so much a story, and more like a dream.  The action is fine, though the acting is not, with some of the best characters in movies this year being completely unrecognizable.  On the other hand, the humor is better than anything we've seen on screen, and the film's just plain fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film about what it is like to be in a loving, supportive and loving relationship with someone is a special experience.   The relationship between the two leads, a young girl and a young boy, is a great example of what it's like to have the love you can feel.  The girl's parents seem to be trying to turn her into a teenager for her own benefit, and their behavior and remarks are very childish and very inappropriate.  Their mother is a bit too interested in the boy and when the two are in the house the girl will act out with her friend, even to the point of getting angry, and the boy seems to love it.  However, the boy isn't really interested in sex or anything else, he just likes to sit on the steps or the window and look at the flowers outside.  This is all well and good for a little while, but then the parents get all involved with the girl, and this creates a situation that is more dangerous than the boy could ever dream of.  To keep the relationship from getting too complicated, the father tells the mother and she seems to believe it. She doesn't tell her daughter that she can't see the boy, and that the relationship can only last so long as it has to.  While this may seem like a pretty normal situation, it ends up with the mother giving the boy a kiss and putting her hand on his knee, which is an extremely inappropriate thing to do in front of a child.  When the boy runs up to the window in the middle of the day and looks out to see the flowers and his mother doesn't stop him from doing so, this causes the boy to fall into a coma.  A quick trip to the hospital is the only saving grace the boy gets, and he ends up waking up as a teenager, but the relationship is definitely damaged.  It's one of the most moving, heart wrenching, funny, and tragic things I've seen all year, and I'm surprised that it hasn't received more attention.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ...   The film opens in the future.   A man has been sentenced to be killed by his father's favorite hunter.  He is going to be shot as he makes his way to the shed that his father keeps.  A truck approaches and the man jumps in.  The truck stops and the hunter starts to talk to the driver.  The man thinks that his son might be the man that killed his father.  As the car approaches the shed, the driver pulls a gun on the man.  This scene sets the tone for the film: the good guy is a man who has been in prison for years.  It is also implied that the man has a young daughter that he has not seen since she was very young. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I never thought I would be crying so much after watching this... but this is just too good..."   It has a beautiful and sad story about a man who lost his mother and a wife and who still works a part-time job. He has a very sad and lonely life, which is what the story is about. The movie is not much but it gives a feeling of loneliness that is worth watching. The acting is very good and you feel for the characters, their lives and the hardships that they have to go through in order to get their way in life.   The movie does not look very good but it was worth the watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I love films where they make a film to be a comedy, and it's pretty darn good at that. It doesn't really have anything to do with the original film, but it is really well done and doesn't feel cheap like other films like that.   Another thing I didn't like is the ending, where the camera focuses on one actor and the camera then switches to another actor. I guess they felt like they needed more than that, or they were worried about not having enough to do and wanted to get the actors out of the frame, so they just did it that way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always been partial to bad boys (even before The Great Outdoors )    Here we have one of the worst.   This is a movie so poorly written I could have gone to the dentist right now.  It's a movie where we learn the meaning of "unstoppable"   It has the classic bad boys with the terrible girlfriends.  The bad boys have terrible girlfriends too.  Their boyfriends are equally awful.  I could be a part of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie I have seen all year. I loved it so much that I am tempted to make a list of the top ten things I learned from this movie. 1. If you have a problem, don't tell anybody about it.   In fact, don the best you can. It's not like everyone is going to find out.  If you think everyone is watching, then don't try and keep a secret.  2. If there is no God, then you are an idiot.  I can't remember who said this.  3. Do not try to prove that God is not real.  4. It is not immoral to murder a dog.  5. Don't go on a date.  It's going to lead to a marriage.  6. I never saw a smarter guy than Bill Cosby.  7. Do good work in school.  8. Don`t listen to bad people.  9. Donkeys are smart.  10. There are no more miracles in this movie than the miracles that took place in the days of Noah.  Thank you for writing this. I really liked this movie a lot.

I have always loved John Williams music and I think his songs are the best, in fact the best thing about this movie is that it's so simple that it can be enjoyed by everybody. That's it. And I hope that this movie does more than just entertain people.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My mom has this movie in the collection:  My Mom's favorite movie.   I'm not sure why she's still watching it.  It's a little sadistic in it's way.  There are so many scenes of her getting beaten by other women. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said in the introduction, it's a good film. It is very well shot, with a great sense of scale. The movie plays very much like a fairytale about the American frontier and the settlers.   The music is excellent, and I have to give a little bonus to Peter Fonda for playing a character who isn't only a cowboy, but who also happens to be an assassin. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well that was a movie I've always liked.   I was hoping that the movie would be a bit darker, but it wasn't.  It's not a depressing movie at all.  One of the things that made it different from a lot of movies like this was the fact that it was more realistic.  I've never heard a bad song in my life.  Although the movie was a little light in the beginning, the story develops slowly.  The movie has a real good cast of people, and it has a lot to offer.  There is so much character development in this movie.  My favorite character was the girl.  Her personality was totally different from most.  For me this movie was worth every bit of the money I spent on it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film with a plot that is a little bit too over-the-top, but has a good amount of humor, a pretty good romance, and a good ensemble cast.   There are lots of different takes on the concept of a "bad girl" and the problem of girls being forced into bad situations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are plenty of movies about the Vietnam war, and probably not one as good as this one.   It is not the usual "war movie", but rather one that deals with the real, brutal nature of the war.  And yes, it deals with that.  I also liked the way it deals wih some pretty good acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. The music is good and the story is pretty good.

It is a nice little story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a big fan of the previous "The Dark Knight" movies, and that was all I thought about watching "A Nightmare on Elm Street."   ( I didn't think much of the original in 1987, and only watched it a few times. I was too young to know that Freddy was a "vampire," I thought the makeup and the music were okay.)   The movie was not as disturbing as I remembered, and I did not see the whole of the Elm Street story, although I think some of it was done very well.   It was funny, and a lot of the scares were done well. It had some good songs as well as the creepy music.  I will watch this again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so good that it's hard to believe it is an American film made in England (though it was directed in England). The film is about a young man who is traveling the world and comes across a place in Brazil called the Pangea. The land has a peculiar structure where trees grow into trees, flowers bloom into flowers and grass starts to grow out of the ground. This is where the movie starts to take a turn. The film follows an American couple who go to Brazil to have a honeymoon (a very British movie), and the two develop a strong friendship that goes far beyond just a couple. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie involves a fight between the couple over a chicken. This scene is extremely well done and I was thoroughly entertained by it.   One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when the young man (Christopher Lambert) is getting ready to go to bed. He sees a man standing in the shadows of the tree where the honeymoon was to be held. Lambert is very excited about the prospect of going to bed with his love interest. The man notices Lambert and he decides to take the opportunity to impress her with a dance. Lambert does not take the dance seriously and continues his routine. The dance becomes so elaborate and fast that it looks like it will never end. Lambert continues to dance with his mind on the task in front of him but his body, which has no time to relax and let the choreography run its course, loses its balance. This has serious consequences for both Lambert and the man (played by John Hawkes). The dance ends with Lambert in a state of dizziness and the young couple falls to the ground and Lambert passes out on the floor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is probably the only movie where I feel it's totally the fault of the actor (I won't tell you his name though). His character is an idiot who doesn't know what to do with his life when he is finally given his big break. He lives in a nice apartment and doesn't care too much about anything. I don't think he had ever done anything of importance and he gets given a big chance. He meets a gorgeous woman with an interesting character who doesn' seem to like him much and then there is a girl who thinks he is a bit weird. He is an asshole and has an embarrassing personality, and this movie isn't very good (or at least I can't see that.) I'm going to be very disappointed if I'm not in the mood for a really good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's a girl to do with her life when she gets the opportunity to marry one of the greatest men in movie history?   There was a time in my life when I was like you... when the idea of marrying a movie star (who at the time I thought was so nice and funny) made me smile in anticipation.   It was the beginning of my romance with the greatest movie star of all time...   A friend introduced me to George Miller's "Mad Max" and I was hooked from the moment I saw it.  In it, Max Rockatansky is a cowboy who survives a long, long, painful desert storm and then is turned into a wild beast... only to survive yet again when the desert finally freezes over.  It is a film of great beauty and humor and some of the most memorable film dialogue ever recorded, including a scene in which Max tells the story of a crazy, insane, beautiful woman he was having an affair with.  The most amazing part is when Max's wife, played by Kim Basinger, goes insane and attacks him with a hatchet, a hat to kill the beast that is killing her and her children.  I still can't believe that I lived through that movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie twice now.   First time I saw it was at a film fest and I was impressed.  Then I saw another screening at a different place and the thing I liked more was the movie.  I'm not sure why, but it was hard to put down this movie. I have seen it a third time recently.  It's an amazing thriller.  And so is Michael Myers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always liked the idea of an ancient warrior who travels back in time to prevent his death to prevent the disaster that is to come in the future.   The concept is interesting but I think the execution is a little weak.  Unfortunately, the pacing of the movie is a bit too fast.  This is not a movie you should watch in one sitting.  I recommend watching it in the beginning of the weekend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So in all honesty this is not the greatest film i've seen. It's ok. This isn't even the best film in the trilogy (but i didn't think i could give it a good rating anyway). This movie is okay. It doesn't have great acting, or amazing special effects. It just has good acting and good story lines. i don't know if the ending is even a spoiler, but i liked it. I'd give the ending an 8, because if you like the first two movies, you might like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie when it was shown at the California International Film Festival in 1998. It is an unusual film, one that was shot entirely with a film camera. It was written by the writer and director of The Omen, Oliver Stone, who has no previous experience in filmmaking, but he is a fantastic director. It's a very dark film that takes its time to introduce its characters.   It is a film that can be enjoyed by any adult viewer as well as by children and teenagers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty impressed with this movie.   This movie was about a guy who went to prison for the theft of a $50 car, but then he gets released because he didn't hurt anyone.  But the car still belonged to him.  There's some guy named Billy and his brother Bob who are trying to get back into the car and get it back to its rightful owner.  They steal a car from a guy named Jimmy who wants to sell it and keep it as a souvenir.  It's hard to know exactly what to think about this movie, but it had some good action.  I'm not a big fan of car chases, but I did like that they did a car chase in the middle of the desert, and then some quick chase at night.  The story had some twists that I was not expecting, but they added to the story, and they added more characters to the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say, this movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. It was a nice movie and I didn't have any problem with the ending. I have watched a lot of horror movies lately so I was glad that this one didn't fall into the same trap.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a film with some very unique ideas.   It is set in a small English village during the early 1900's and is written and directed by a man who can do something that no-one else can do.  This is not a film for people who like to have their brains bashed.  It has to be seen in 3D, but there are plenty of other movies that would do the same thing, and it's probably going to be a lot more enjoyable when you have the glasses on.  The film was shot by the talented and prolific director John Sturges, and his directing skills and cinematography bring to life the quaint, quaint village of Peewin in a way that makes the town feel like a fairy tale for the viewer's imagination.  For those of you who are familiar with the films by Sturges you will not be disappointed with this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I can see the light at the end of this tunnel!" "A film about two people who fall in love but can't make a living by it.   There are so many interesting ideas in this film, but not enough realness, and it can't sustain a suspenseful plot with the level of over-the-top nonsense it throws at us.  I'm guessing it's the same problem with the director's last film,  I liked it better when it was about the relationship between two people and not the relationship of two people to a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        I didn't really think I'd enjoy a movie about a giant squid at all, and boy was I wrong!   While it might be more of a cartoon than an actual film, there are parts that have some of my favorite parts of any kaiju flick ever made, so why not?   - First, there's the giant squid itself:  To be honest, I didn´t care for this monster. It looked weird, and it was hard to get used to its movement.  However, as this was such a short movie, I guess the monster can be fun in and of itself.   Also, the movie takes some interesting liberties with the monsters in a way that I don´t think you´d expect.  For example, the first giant squid is very different from the last one.  I´d like to think that this movie was partially inspired by the old Universal monster movies, but it´s very interesting that these giant squid get different abilities, like jumping or even fighting.  This movie also has some funny scenes where the giant kaijus fight each other, and even fights each other to death!  The movie also takes a good bit of time to get back to what it was before, but I can see that I´ll be watching it again and again.  Overall, it's good kaijudo, with a fun monster to watch! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was an absolutely fantastic movie to watch.   If you can appreciate humor, then this movie is a must see!   It's a comedy, but not a very good one.  The humor is good, but a little simplistic.    There is a scene in the movie when the character from the previous scene is in a bathtub and there is a woman trying to get her to join her, and the character tells her that she will be the mother of her grandchildren.  There is nothing funny about the movie, it's a true comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It was a real good film in its own right and with the added bonus of being an animated feature.   The story takes place in a world where people are made out of clay and they become monsters, they are the people who will kill the people that they love.  The people who are being made into monsters are not very bad and there are plenty of bad things about the world. The first person that we meet is a little boy called Billy, he is about to be killed by a monster and his mother who thinks he is a monster.  There are a couple of really funny moments and a great villain who is well done and who is not too frightening in the least.  I think that this is one of the better animated films of all time and it would be a great watch even today.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just came back to this movie after a long time to see how the story turns out. The opening scene shows what I'm talking about. The movie starts out with a beautiful sunrise over a landscape that reminds me of the Mojave Desert in California. There are some interesting things happening here: - The mother has her son shot in front of her. She is seen sobbing over the body.  - Her son walks back into his house and finds a note saying that the boy had a vision about her.  He tells the boy about the prophecy in the movie and says that the end is coming soon. He is shot by a thug who is wearing the same mask as the one in the film.   The first part of the movie is interesting as the family gets a little bit out of hand. It does have a sense of humor, but I feel that this is something that should have been explored a bit more.  The movie is mostly action packed. There's a car chase, some gunfire, and the mother gets captured.  A man comes into the house and says to the mother, "I'm the one who has the power" and then takes off with her. When we first see the guy he has a tattoo of the name "Reverse Flash" on his face.  When the boy says that he had a dream of the mask he is taken to a room and he sees the mask that is on his back.  It then flashes back to the moment when the boy was shot.  They escape from the house. The mother and son get to the river and the boat is wrecked.  Once they get to shore, they jump in and start swimming. They get to a place that looks like it is on the side of the river, but then they see some people standing around a campfire.  At this time the guy with the mask starts to approach the boy.  This is when the movie starts to get a little out of control.  In a flashback we see what was going on at the house with the mother.  She's been beaten up and her husband is drunk. The woman comes up to her husband and she's seen a vision of the child, who is now wearing the mask.  We see the boy in the dream.  Next we see that a man is taking her son to a campground with a girl in a bikini.  After that we see the woman with the son and she is about to get
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not gonna lie I'm a little bit of a big fan of this movie. I have seen it in the theatre several times in my early 20s and still enjoy the story. I'm surprised it didn't get more recognition by the time I got to high school. The plot is simple but engaging. I wish there was more dialogue but there are many instances where the dialogue is cut short or only given a brief description.

It looks like it's just been done, but it's not like that! It has a great mix of comedy, action and drama.  I don't know how it's possible to make a good, long-lasting movie like this.

The movie is very well acted and it has a few memorable scenes, but the story itself is just a complete mess.  This is definitely not a movie for everyone.

It starts with a bit of a laugh;  It has a "feel" to it, as it's more than a little silly;  And there's even a bit about a little boy that's a tad touching.  I'm not really sure what makes it "worth seeing" other than the fact that it's entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You want to know why this film is an absolute classic? Well, first of all, this is just an oldie but a goodie; I haven't seen the first one, and I thought it was an amazing picture, one that has aged incredibly well, and still holds up very well today.   The film is about a guy named Ed (Alan Rickman) who wants to get to see the famous magician.  But there are a number of obstacles in his path: first of which is his sister Helen (Janine Turner) who thinks that her brother should try to be a magician, then there are his father (Tim Curry), and then, of course, his mother (Vera Miles).   Of course, Ed can't go to a magician to be seen; he has a job with a local newspaper, but as a result of this he is almost fired.  The reason is because his work has caused problems in the area, and in addition he's been accused of killing a girl.  As we see in the trailer, this leads to Ed having an out-of-body experience, and he returns to his past life, in which he's a magician. Of course this is going to lead to all kinds of trouble; so much so that Ed hires the local sheriff (Peter Ustinov) and his deputy (William Hootkins) to investigate and they all are on the hunt for Ed.  Of all the actors in the film, Rickman and Curry are the best, but the film is pretty good too. It's very well-written and well-acted, with great special effects and wonderful dialogue.  To see Alan Rickman in such a role is nothing short of mind-blowing; he's not only one of the best actors of his generation, but a great one as well. He's got a very dry wit which really works with this kind of material, and the lines are very funny. I like the film so much, I've seen it multiple times since it was first released; it's one of those movies that's going to live on for a very long time, and it's certainly a worthwhile movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a sucker for a good horror movie with good scares and I found this one to be a good one as well.   The film is about a group of young teenagers who are staying in a cabin in the woods. They're all on vacation from school and the father figures in the story are the young woman they are staying with, her mother and her boyfriend.  The girl's mother is a very scary witch who has been torturing a young man she was dating.  They decide to take a trip to see what all the fuss is about. They find the cabin, are introduced to the neighbors, eat a picnic dinner and all goes very well until things get very weird.  After having the lights and lights go out and the whole family looking for them.  When they return home they are confronted by some strange things and then when they take the stairs it's all too much.  I won't say what happens but it does scare the hell out of me.  This film has a lot of scares and it's a good little thriller but it's not much more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen so many good movies in the past year and I've watched some terrible movies and it's hard to decide what's best.   The best movie is a French film about an American who tries to find a place in the world that will allow him to see the beauty in his life and in the people he loves.  It's a gorgeous and charming film.  You just can't take your eyes off it.  The people and the actors are so good.  In a film about love, passion and devotion, this is a quiet, tender and thoughtful love story with a beautiful soundtrack.  This is a film that you should be watching, whether you are an American or a French, I hope you get to see it.

In any case, this is one of those films that's worth a watch in spite of its flaws.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is not perfect.   It can be a bit silly at times, and even the worst jokes sometimes are pretty funny.  And yet, you know, it's just good fun.  The story is simple: A guy has a bunch of friends from college who meet at a camp where a few bad things happen.  Then he realizes the camp is cursed (in a nice way) and sets out on a journey to get all the witches and demons in the woods and then get rid of them all.  I didn't think it was all that silly.  A few people who like to eat and watch scary movies probably should consider seeing this.  It's pretty good, but I'm not sure how you keep a group of friends together for a week in an isolated location like that, but they do, and the movie seems to be all about them trying to get in and out of danger. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the news comes that a young boy who can see dead people has died, we don't think of it as "Oh, poor little kid died" or "I wish I'd been his mom," but as a tragedy and tragedy only.   While the child may not have had a "troubled" life as most teenagers (and some adults), it is clear that he was a troubled boy.  He would be about twelve years old when the movie begins, and at that point, he was in the fifth grade.  A boy with no friends, a troubled childhood, and a death that left a permanent scar on his family, seems like a recipe for disaster, but then, tragedy is always a possibility for anyone.  It is very sad to see a child grow up so fast, even though we see the child in a great deal of pain.  The parents are a bit more complicated in the movie, but when I first saw it, I just didn't know what to think. I'm sure that we're supposed to sympathize with the parents, but that's about the only sympathy I got out of the movie.  At a very young age, the child shows signs of psychic ability, which he displays by the time he is about ten years old.  While most of the adults around him treat him coldly, it is not uncommon for a young child to become a bit of a celebrity.  I found it very interesting to see psychic abilities used as a weapon against one's own family.  Some things in the film are almost too realistic, like the way the parents talk to the boy. It seems as though they talk in a way that doesn't come from a genuine concern for the boy's well-being.  To be a kid in a family that lives on a lot of "drugs," and where drugs are widely accepted, can leave a kid with a bad reputation.  There's a lot in this film that's disturbing and disturbing-y, and while we see a lot about the family and its problems in one part, there are still many, many more disturbing scenes in the second half of the film.  As a film about a troubled young boy, this is a very different kind of movie. It's hard to imagine this being a positive experience for the parents or the child.  If the movie has any message, it's that people should keep themselves away from children. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this film a lot, it was just a good good movie, I loved it, it wasn't a bad movie but I thought the writing and acting were great, it didn't make me bored but I do think some of the acting in this film was off, the way this guy was talking, it felt a little like a "movies in the making" sort of thing, there was a lot of character development, the people in this movie were interesting, I liked the way the movie was edited, it had a feel about it, a lot about the plot and character development was done in the first act, then in the second act it went off the rails a little bit, it made me think the story was a bit silly, there were a lot twists and turns in the plot that didn't pay off, but you will see a good story here, and the acting was great, the cinematography was awesome, and it wasn;t boring at all, I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not expecting much from this film. I'm not a huge fan of action flicks. I love action movies but I've never seen a movie like this where the actors are actually having a good time. I wasn't expecting a comedy to be so good, I'm so glad I was wrong.   This was one of those movies that really surprised me. I was expecting it to be pretty good but I was pleasantly surprised. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite part of this movie is when the characters are in the church, the movie's music starts to play as the movie moves along and the music just keeps getting more intense.   It's really a hard movie to get through, but that's what makes it so great, there's a lot of things happening at once, there are a lot, lots of people, and the movie doesn't waste any time doing things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is all about how much I hate American movies, and it takes place in a prison.   This is a very funny and well done movie about how some prison guards are really, really dumb, they go on dates with the female prisoners, they get drunk and fall on tables, it is really hilarious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title is a bit misleading. This is not a typical comedy. There is a little bit of action here and there and of course some characters do things other than talking to each other.   It's about a father who wants to get back his lost daughter. When his son's life becomes totally unproductive he begins to try and find a reason for it. This leads to some hilarious hijinks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen many bad movies from all kinds of genres, but this one I really liked! The whole movie is about a couple (Darlene and Jack) who are on a trip to get her brother, who has been shot in the head and paralyzed. Darlene has gone to stay with a family and Jack has gotten a job at a toy store. D and Jack spend a lot of time arguing about how they should spend the rest of their vacation. This movie is funny and pretty good. I have heard a lot about this movie and I don't think it is that bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about how the Nazis took over Germany.   This movie, as with other Nazi movies I've seen, was based on the real story of how Hitler rose to power, how Hitler began to be elected as German Chancellor, then later became Hitler's personal bodyguard, and how Hitler was arrested and jailed for his role in the war.  Hitler's arrest was filmed with a camera hidden in his uniform.  A lot of people don't understand that the real Nazi Party was formed to oppose Social Democracy, which is essentially what Hitler was.  It's not clear who the real Nazis are, other than Hitler.  I have seen this movie twice now, and both times I laughed my ass off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's easy to imagine a world where there are no aliens or aliens-like aliens.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie for movie lovers: an awesome action movie, with some good comedy.   It's set in a futuristic city in the future, where there are two types of people:  the "Crazy-ass people" and the "Psych-nuts". The movie takes place in a "Coney Island" amusement park, where a girl named Daphne gets separated from her group of friends. As they start to investigate the crime, they find out that there's a lot of people who have a bad feeling about what's happening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why this was ever made.   What the hell is this film?   It's a horror movie, a western movie, and a buddy cop movie?  It was all made by the same producer, Roger Corman (he made the first two Corman films and the movie about the guy who went insane in a bathtub and drank the blood of his best friend.  It has the usual "shoot 'em up" action set pieces, the usual chase scenes with bad guys who can't run fast enough to save themselves, the typical gory death scenes, and the usual cheesy "the girls think I'm a real big shot" opening theme song.  All in all, it's just a boring movie that seems like a waste of time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a good action movie, "Gods and Monsters" has a good mix of action, adventure and comedy. A team of scientists has traveled across the universe to investigate a rare and mysterious meteorite, only to find out it was all just a hoax. The scientist who helped plan the expedition has now been arrested. Meanwhile, a large meteor crash-lands in the middle of a small town and a local is the only one to survive. This is a fun movie for all ages, with a good time in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching this movie it took a long time to come to the conclusion that it was not about what it was about. It is about the lives of the people who made it possible, people who were willing to do whatever it took to get the picture made, people whose names we still don't know, but their lives would seem to tell us a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing "The Princess Bride" and watching the original movie "The Wedding Singer" (both are great) I decided to try something different and it worked. I don't know about your life but my day started out pretty normal. I got up, worked out, and then went to the movies. This movie is not the worst movie I've seen but it's definitely not the best. It has the charm of the original but it lacks the romance. As far as acting goes the guys are great. When the song comes on I have to say it is my favorite song. It is a great song with great lyrics. As for the ending I felt the movie was going to end pretty much the same way. It didn't. I know I should have thought of this a long time ago. I guess it is what makes the movie great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really didn't want to hate this movie.   The acting was not good, the storyline was not interesting, the visuals were horrible, the direction was bad, the sound was bad and the soundtrack was okay.  The whole movie was a joke.  It was a lame movie that did not know when to end.  I was hoping this movie would end with a good cliffhanger and a good ending.  Even if that cliffhangers were bad and it never ended, the movie still would not be a bad movie. It was not a bad idea to write this review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is good and the acting is great, but why is there no music in the movie?   When people complain about the plot, they don't talk about all the details.   What makes a movie good is its cast, not all of them can play roles like this.  I don't think the movie is a masterpiece, but it is still a good piece of work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard the news that The Girl on the Train  would be coming to America (I had read about the original in a magazine and had a very nice thought to myself that I must see it)   The first thing that struck me was that this is a very well made, very well-written movie. It seems that most of us who had the pleasure of going to see The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo  last year have not seen  The Girl on The Train   It's definitely a good film, but I have to say that it feels like an old movie and it does feel very dated.   There are still some really good moments, but there's not much that's new.  You know what's new?  The movie seems to be inspired by David Bowie's last movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little story that doesn't feel like anything else:  - You know, I really love a lot of classic Westerns. Like The Magnificent Seven. Or Wild at Heart. Or Stagecoach. The first one, if I'm not mistaken, is from 1915. You know? I also like The Magnificient Miss Misery. Or Goodfellas. It's like a cross between a detective story and a Western.  They really had a lot in common with each other.   It is also a classic Western in its own right.  - The title character, played by Audrey Hepburn, is named "Mama" because she was a real little girl, just like my Mama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   I'm a big fan of old science fiction films and movies like this one. The film is so well constructed and the story just keeps you on the edge of your seat, the effects are spot on and you can never look away from the amazing visual effects.   In my opinion this was the best science fiction film that I've seen in quite a while.

There are no stupid twists, no bad acting, no dull scenes, no unnecessary scenes, and no unnecessary dialogue.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm just saying:  This is one of those films that is truly timeless, especially for people like me who don't have a thing to do with cinema, but are fascinated by it all the same.   This, of course, includes the people watching it.  The film itself is just so, so funny!   It's almost like they had a very loose script, so they had to improvise, and that's what makes it so funny.  When a woman is about to get raped by two guys, who have both been drinking, she says, "They said a man would be too much for me to handle!" (The camera follows her up against the wall, as she takes a step back.  This has to be the funniest sentence the film has ever written.  Then another woman approaches and says "Well you've never had a man before!"    What's so great about this movie is that it's one of the few that's genuinely educational, and not just to those who have no interest in seeing it, but to people who know what they're talking about.  It tells you how to get a job as a housewife, for instance.  But I don't know about you, but I'd rather watch a comedy about getting a job than a comedy based on a real rape. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my all time favorite movies from 1970. It is very much like a film about a man who is trying to make himself a success by selling his wife and children to a rich old man.   He finds the money by robbing a jeweler who is giving his wife to a wealthy merchant (who is a descendant of the original robber), and then is robbed himself.  He ends up living in a squalid camp for ex-naval personnel, and in a strange way becomes attracted to his neighbors, a group of young women who are mostly from a war-torn country.  I found the film quite entertaining, with an interesting story about the life of the man who has come to make his fortune. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director is one of those guys that make movies for themselves. I've never seen a movie where I wasn't interested in the characters. There is some romance, but that's about it. There are no major characters, no one that gets a great deal of screen time, and I don't want to spoil any of it, but it's just a little movie that has something to say. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After having watched both of the old Indiana Jones movies from 1985, I was looking forward to seeing this one. Well, the second Indiana Jones movie was great. The second Indiana Stone movie was even better. But, the third one is really an underrated movie!   It's not that it's a bad film, it's just underrated. It was one of the few movies from 1981 I saw on my first day of high school. I loved it. The first Indiana Jones film was a little too light. In the third film, they dialed the movie back a little and it became a little more serious. The villains were good and the action scenes were good.   But, with all the great action scenes, there are only one or two scenes I remember from the third movie.  I'd give this one a 3.5, but I don't think it's all that bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I can't deny that The Rocketeer is not a very good movie.   I can only describe this movie as a "wacky", "funny", "over-the-top" adventure film.  The plot is that the Rocketeers (the good guys) are on a mission to fly into space to stop a vicious robot that has taken over the Earth.  This is where the movie's comedy begins.  Well, the plot is pretty lame, as well as the movie.  The Rockerteers take over the earth and decide to destroy all the robots.  Now, they don't really know how to destroy a robot, and there is a lot of goofiness involved.  For example, the Rockertes have a time machine, so they can go back to when the robot took over and kill it!  Of course, they never do, so the robot is constantly taking over the world.  Eventually the Rocketchas are forced to use their time machine to go back and kill the robot.  Even after they do this they find out that it had been "tamed" by being set to destroy the earth, so it will stop hurting the earth.  Then the time machine gives them the option of saving the world, or killing the robot in order to protect it.  I'm sure the movie had some fun scenes, but they all seemed to be kind of silly.  It didn't seem to be very well thought out, and the humor seemed like it came from the wrong place.  As well as this, there is no plot at all.  What makes the movie better than it was a silly adventure film, is that it is very action packed.  Every scene, as the Rockettes try to prevent a robot from taking over, is awesome.  In fact, there are quite a few times when you can't help but think "WTF just happened?"  I also like the fact that the movie was done in 1980, and it looks very dated.  There were some scenes that were just a bit too close to the action of the movie The Rockstar.  When I first watched this movie I was expecting a good time, but I was sorely disappointed.  Overall, this was a very enjoyable "movie", but nothing more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of the film has not much to do with the film at all. It is mostly about a young woman who is trying to figure out what she wants to do in life and has to deal with a bunch of other people who all want to be in her life. She doesn't understand that not all of them are the way that she is, and there is a lot of conflict and confusion. This is not a bad film, but it is not what I was hoping for from a film titled A Midsummer Night's Dream.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, I have to admit that this is one of the most well-executed scripts ever. The movie was not well-known at the time, but it seems to have been very popular in Australia at the turn of the century. The plot of the film is quite simple, but you do not need a script to see the movie: the camera takes you on a walk through the countryside in the late 1800s, which looks pretty picturesque and you notice everything: the horses, the cattle, the people. There is a scene in which an old farmer who had been married 50 years and had 10 kids runs his cows into a lake (he was never around to see them drowned), and a couple of other scenes that are well-done and entertaining.   When it comes to the acting, they don't look great, but I'm not going to bother with them as the quality of the screenplay is so good.  The only thing I don't like in the movie is a couple shots of an old couple being fondled in bed: I don' like that scene, and I didn't like it at the beginning of the movie.  I'll give the movie 3 stars because it is fun, and it deserves a little more recognition.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie! It has so much good and bad in it. First of all, there is so much action. It's intense. It really gets to the point. It gets to a point where it seems like it's impossible for the hero to overcome his demons.   The hero has a wife and a daughter, but he is always fighting. I think he is mentally unstable. He seems to be the only person in the world who doesn't like to be touched by people. That's not bad for a movie, but in real life, it's a bad combination. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the finest films of the year.   John Woo's   Hong Kong movie   is a film which has a story, set in Hong Kong, which is quite realistic.  The main character, the detective, is based in the detective agency.  He uses real criminals and real victims.  What's more, it shows the working of the Hong Kong Police.  But the main point in the film is the relationship between the two lovers, played by Michelle Yeoh and Johnny Lee Miller.  Both of them act very sensitive, but at the same time there is a dark edge in the relationship.  They have to overcome their differences to help each other.  This film has a very beautiful music, but also one of those film where everything is happening on one side of the screen.  It is beautiful, but it also has a violent and shocking ending.  For a Hong Kong film, it is not very dramatic, but there is quite a lot of action.  A really beautiful movie, but a bit like the movies in the 80's in many respects.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first time I ever saw the Star Wars franchise, and I loved it. It was the story that made me a big Star Wars fan. I thought I had seen everything when I saw The Empire Strikes Back, but I still remember that famous quote: "There are no second chances in this galaxy, Obi-Wan. If you don't complete your mission, you will not be returning."   The action scenes were great, the story was epic, and the characters, especially Jar Jar, were amazing. I would never consider this a bad movie, but there are a couple of things that make it worth watching:  It takes place between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. This makes it a little easier to take in, but it still holds its own.   I would love to see the next movie, too!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        When you watch the opening credits for a movie, you think:    This is a movie about a movie.      And you're right.   They are also about  the movies themselves.   This is an odd movie.  I don't know whether it's better than The Godfather: Part II, or if it's the same thing.  It's not the same  feeling you get from the films you see on TV:  The acting is better, but it's not as good.  It seems more like an afterthought, like they thought they could get away with a remake of the 1970's classic.  And it's funny.  The plot is  weird, not too clever, not overly ambitious.   There's some interesting ideas, but none of them really stand out.  This is more like a sequel to a movie you watched as a kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I must say that this movie is a true work of art. I saw it in a cinema once, and when I saw this I was shocked. It's like a nightmare, where the things are real, it's like they're living inside my body, it has an almost dreamlike quality about it, it looks like a bad nightmare. I really thought this movie was a work of a master of film like Fellini, or Ingmar Bergman. I don't want to say too much about the film itself, but I can give it 3 stars if you want. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been a fan of director Wes Anderson for as long as I can remember. I love The Royal Tenenbaums (not an obvious comparison, but I thought it was great), Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, There Will Be Blood, Moonrise Kingdom, Lost in Translation, Punch-Drunk Love, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Darjeeling Limited, and now The Life of Pablo. These are films of genius.   He's made some films that were clearly influenced by great French cinema, and he seems to have been influenced in turn by other directors.  As an actor he's got a nice combination of cool charm, and a touch of irony, and the character he plays is so appealing.  This isn't to say that the films in this series don't have some moments of high comedy, or that the director hasn't added the occasional dash of black humour. However, the series is not a comedy, and has a lot more to it than a bunch of silly characters and situations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching a few movies about bad people who never seem to know they are bad   and are always trying to hurt other people   I was ready to give this a bad rating, but then the good parts came out and this is one hell of a bad movie.   You get some good laughs   as do the actors, but I was bored out of my mind when the good stuff happened.  I felt like watching a bad bad movie, with a bad ending, with poor acting, a bad soundtrack and a bad plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think we can all agree that the film had a lot of things to do, and the fact that the movie can actually make it out to be a very good film is a bit of a surprise.   The story, in its entirety, is simple: there's a war going on in New York, and a lot is happening to the main character.  There's some action and comedy, some good characters and an interesting premise, and it all ends with a bang!  The ending is actually a little disappointing.  I mean, really?  The movie tries to be an action movie, and there are some really cool action sequences. But then there's also the story, which isn't all that interesting.  And the ending, in my opinion, doesn't really work.  The problem is that it's actually a pretty weak movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character is extremely likable.   He's not like the characters of this movie, he's a real guy.  He gets caught up in a bunch of bad situations and eventually manages to save his girlfriend.  My only complaint about this movie is that it ends with some pretty boring stuff, it gets kinda repetitive after a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot to love about this film:  The soundtrack, with its wistful strings and haunting piano, is absolutely mesmerizing.  There are a lot of wonderful scenes and moments in this film, and none are more important to the story than the scene at the opening, with the beautiful and heartbreaking scene in which the two characters, one an older woman, the other an elderly man, make a promise of eternal friendship.  The two characters are so close to each other that you feel like you've known each of them forever.   This scene has been shown before, so there's no reason to re-watch it.  It's a beautiful scene, and there is a wonderful moment where they kiss.  This film is absolutely wonderful, both in its plot, the characters, and the score. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest flaw of this movie is how the action seems to end on a cliffhanger. I like that this film tries to mix up its action with some more character-oriented story-telling. I am a big fan of a little-known (at the time) American movie called "It's a Wonderful Life" (1965) that I was watching recently and the theme of the movie is exactly what this movie tries to do. The story of the film is basically about a middle-aged guy (George Bailey) who has gone to live in the "homeless" neighborhood of the town in which he lives and has to deal with the bad apples in that neighborhood. The good part about this movie isn't just that it is a good, good movie, but that it doesn't try to be anything more than a good story. The characters are real and have real problems that you can sympathize with and sympathize for. The movie is a beautiful tribute to the wonderful work of George Bailey who was just a great man who was really trying to make a living in Hollywood during the era of the silent-era. This movie really is a tribute to his memory and not just his acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can't get a better story from a movie, than this. It is a beautiful film and one of the best movies ever made. This is what Hollywood is supposed to be all about, good stories. This movie made me cry as I was watching it. This one is my all time favourite movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie at my grandma's house and she was watching the movie with her brother and they loved it. I was surprised how the movie portrayed the characters' thoughts.   My mom and dad were both kind of disappointed with the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to start by saying I've watched quite a bit of bad movies in my time and nothing has ever been remotely close to this. The movie stars two of the greatest actors ever, William Hurt and Christopher Lee, and this is a film that is all about making me love them, the characters are the worst, they don't have enough personality to be believable, and the acting is terrible. It feels like a film written by someone who has never acted before and is trying to make a film like The Phantom of the Opera  but instead of getting a laugh, it gets a massive cramp and a bunch of yawns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found The House With A Clock In Its Walls to be a good and creepy, scary movie.   There were a couple of creepy moments that scared the heck out of me, but overall, a really interesting story with a great cast of characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie so much I made a joke about it:  It's a comedy.   There were a few problems with the movie: 1) You have to remember that this was directed by Michael Crichton, a movie about a guy who gets his girlfriend in an accident while he's trying to get to a UFO.  2) The movie is a bit long.  3) Crich to a great degree relies on editing, especially to get you to think of all the possible angles and turns a movie could take in.  4) Crick's movie has a lot of things wrong.  5) This movie also doesn't have enough sex.  6) In the movie there is a woman who wants to go to a spaceship.  7) This is one of those movies that seems to have a plot.  8) I don't know if this is an American movie, or if it is a Crichon movie, but it does have a lot in common with Crich's.  9) There is something to be said for the simplicity of the movie.  10) There are many other bad movies that are about this woman, and one good one.  11) It seems to me that Crichto's movie would have made more money in France, or Spain.  12) It was good to see some American humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a terrific movie about a guy whose daughter has been kidnapped, and it's a really good movie, too. It's a horror movie, but it's not really a horror film. There's a lot of psychological stuff in this movie, and there are some great performances by Gary Oldman and Michael Stuhlbarg, and you don't really expect a great movie in the vein of Friday the 13th Part II from a guy like me.   What I really liked about this movie is that it has a lot going on, and that a lot is pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film centers around the lives of a couple of high school friends who attend a rural high school located in a remote country.  They don't quite fit into the standard high school cliche, they're pretty nerdy, and like most nerdy guys, they love fighting.  However, when a chance encounter with a local girl leads to a forbidden affair between them, their world starts to crumble.  The movie has a very good balance between comedy and drama.   This is a well-made movie, well-acted, well thought out, and entertaining to watch.

The movie is a very entertaining adventure of a boy and his pet donkey, together with a couple of friends. It is well done and well made.   It was a good film that should be seen by everybody, especially the Tolkien fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie itself has a very intriguing plotline. As the two characters who share a room together are both very shy, and the fact that their teacher (who also happens to be their friend) has been missing for a long time. The two of them set out to search for her, and are attacked on multiple occasions by a strange beast. At first the characters are a little silly, but by the end of the film they start to get more and more serious. It is a very exciting movie, and while it does not contain any actual blood or gore (which is not the main point), it has very good plot development.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very unique movie, and in a way it's more about the journey than the destination. This is not a traditional romantic movie about two people who fall in love and then are suddenly thrown away by circumstances they didn't choose. The main character is just a guy in a hurry to get to America, who wants nothing more than to meet the woman of his dreams and then to return to France, with all his baggage. But his life falls apart when a friend dies, his job is threatened, and his fiancee, a girl he just met, suddenly changes course. This leads to a situation where a man has to fight his way out of the country as fast as he can.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was well made, and not in a kitsch, wannabe-rock 'n roll way. It was done with the best of intentions. This is no doubt a film for the true rockers of our time. There are also more people to watch it with. This would be a great addition to any film library, not only for the fact it's a great rock song, but because it is great rock music, and rock songs are often fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few weeks ago, I watched a movie titled "Kung Fu Hustle" which was really a good little film. It is a funny, entertaining, and heartwarming movie. But this weekend, I was in the city. I'm sure most of the people in this movie had some kind of drug problem or some kind that would interfere with their lives. It was only two or three people in the entire movie who did have a good life. It wasn't until after I was done watching the movie that I realized that there was no such thing as a bad movie.   I'm not going to give away the ending but I will tell you how I feel about it. This movie had a good story. If you have no idea what a Kung Fu Hustl   is, it means the man has a gun. He can shoot a gun out of a gun butt and kill a man with a gun!   The movie was well paced.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new addition to my ever-growing list of guilty pleasure films that I have been enjoying at least once a month since the film first came out.   This is a very good movie.  You may have heard of it.  It is a "slasher movie" that takes the genre to a whole new level.  One look at the credits and you know this is a movie that will keep you looking over your shoulder while you are watching.  This film is well worth your time and your money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      If you are into action movies, you should definitely check this one out. This film is a real hoot. A lot of the movie is shot with a long lens. You can't see the actors very well. There is no dialogue to speak of, but we do get the action. There are a few action scenes that don't quite work but they work for the most part. There's a lot of violence and some fun to be had. There isn't much else to say. You should definitely see it if you like action and a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a shame that The Avengers is not a movie about the real world, because it should be: the real-world is a place where the superhero movies go to die.   For all its flaws, Marvel Studios has made a good comic book movie that is good enough to be a decent movie about a hero.  And I should know, because I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good action movie with an amazing storyline.   The plot is very interesting.  A young woman is sent to an island to protect a child.  She fights the natives (people in the background) and saves the child. However, there are two problems that come from it:  1) The movie's very hard to follow. 2) The action is very hard.  It's a shame that the movie is only 12 minutes long, but if you want to see an action movie that's not too hard, this is a good choice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I am a fan of westerns and western movies in general. This movie definitely takes the western theme and subverts it.   The story centers around a man who is obsessed with an ancient Indian tribe called the Manduwa, that is located deep in the Amazon jungle. He tries to kill them by sending a pack of dogs out to get him, but a boy and his dog stop the dogs before they can reach the Mandua. The boy has a sword made of stone that he keeps under his bed. One night when his mother comes in to check on him, the boy finds out that the sword is made of quartz, a material that is easily cut by a blade of any kind.  This sets the plot into motion and the movie develops very well. This is a very enjoyable movie to watch, even for those who do not like westerns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on a Sunday. I was watching with my brother when the first two scenes played out. The first scene was showing a woman taking her children out of a burning building. Then she ran to a building with a fireman there who asked her what she was doing. She said that she was taking her kids to a church and if she had a church like this she would be a saint. The second scene showed the same woman taking out her children and then running to a nearby house. There were firemen and other people who were trying to pull her out of the house. She was getting pulled back in the house and I'm sure someone yelled at her to get out of there. I didn't know who they were talking to or who the firemen were. They were talking in French, which seemed odd, and the first person who yelled at the woman, who was being pulled out of her home, had a French accent. The next scene, which is a good scene, shows the same person who was trying to take the woman out of an open window. She grabbed her by the arm and started running, but the fireman caught her and pulled her out a window. They ran across the street to a house where another woman was watching a basketball game. She pulled her into her house where she stayed. In between all of these scenes, the woman who was in the building with the fire man and the woman in the adjacent house was talking to someone over a telephone. The person over the phone asked the woman if she could come and take the children. She told the person over phone that they had to wait until the fire was out, but it was only a minute or two before the fire started again. The woman told her that if it was a minute, she would get up and go outside and get them. In the next scene there was another woman who also ran out to an open building with firemen there. The fireman pushed her out into the street and they started to run together. They kept running up and down the street until they came to a streetlight. The man stopped and the two women kept running. The men then pushed them into the sidewalk, but they kept running with the men running in front of them. Then, a man jumped in the streetlight and helped them get out. In that scene they were both screaming and yelling. The scene was over and I ran out and saw the two running together. The two were crying
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've enjoyed The Exorcist, and believe it or not, I'm not a huge horror movie fan.   When I saw this one (for a second time), I was just trying to catch up on some horror movies on DVD.  And what a great show it was!    This was a great performance from its stars (which included my new favorite actors -  Tim Curry   and James Spader  ) and I found myself cheering with them all throughout.  The script was funny and creepy at the same time.  It was a pretty scary movie, and a little depressing too.  I'll probably rewatch it in a few years and will be sure to give this one a thumbs up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had watched this movie many, many times, and it has held my attention over and over. It's not a bad movie, but I wouldn't really call it a classic (I'm a fan of the genre but not a purist).   It's more of a story of an ordinary person who becomes trapped in the worst situation imaginable. His actions don't make sense and it just gets worse and worse as time goes on. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously at any point, and yet it still manages to make the audience care for its characters.    You will definitely not be disappointed by this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie. It reminds me of some of the great movies in my favorite director, Paul Schrader. Like A Good Day to Die Hard, this film is fun. It's a buddy movie. When things get serious, the humor returns to normal. If you like comedies, this one is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of the original, I can say that this is a much better movie. It's a little bit better than the original in that it's more funny and dramatic. The characters and the storyline, however, are all the same.   It's very well made and I can't think of a better director than Jamey Sheridan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The character designs were pretty awesome in this movie, they're very detailed, especially the female character who's character really stands out from all the others. It's kinda hard to explain how I feel about her, but the way she moves around... -The music was pretty good in this film as well, there were lots of different sounds and rhythms throughout the movie, but none were too distracting. -The dialogue in this was a bit repetitive, but I liked it as much as the characters. - The scene with the woman with the huge rack in the back of the car was great. - 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is called "The Girl from Nowhere" and I am told this is the first time in which the entire plot of the movie is revealed in its entirety. This is a movie that is quite a ride. You get the feeling that there is more than one story that may come into play and if there is one to be told then that would be it. It is a short film but there is a lot that goes on in the length of just over twenty minutes. You also get the sense that there are some great characters here.    I recommend watching this for those who love a good mystery/suspense movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it a lot. It's probably a good thing the people in it are not particularly well off.   My favourite characters are the ones that didn't know how to get off the ship (which seems like such a good idea to them).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, good characters and decent acting.   The story is great.  The character development is a great start.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie with a lot of heart and charm, even though the film is extremely long, so long that the characters start to lose interest. However, after the second half of the movie is over and the plot is told, you will be in for a treat.   I've seen more than a few movies about WWI, and they all leave you feeling a bit like you're watching a bad version of the first "Titanic".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie.   It was very good.  There are some very well done action sequences.  My favorite scene:  While playing a game on a computer, a man decides to do a little research on some ancient artifacts.  He starts reading some ancient book and eventually realizes the ancient writing is written in the Egyptian.  The ancient writings reveal that the man and his family were from Egypt (maybe that explains the family resemblance)  After some research, the man finds out that the "mysterious" artifact is actually the pyramids and they are actually located in Egypt.  While investigating the pyramidal buildings, the "skeletons" and the sarcophagus are actually a couple of people.  After realizing this, the old man is then approached by the "man with the golden mask" and asked to join him in his investigation.  And so the man is sent to Egypt.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't want to give away the entire plot in the opening paragraph, but I will say that you learn quite a bit about people at this hotel from the characters at the diner. You get to know a little bit about the characters' lives before the plot even gets in the way.   If you're looking for a good time, then you're in for a treat with the characters that are so fun to watch that I almost wish they had a little more to say (I just can't seem to stop talking about how much fun I had).   It's a fun little movie to watch, with a good twist, but a little too short at just under an hour. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You can't just leave a man with two guns and a rifle."   ~ Clint Eastwood   An unusual and entertaining action film which has many memorable scenes including a memorable sequence involving a man in a chair trying to decide whether to open a door or a window when a bullet strikes the chair and misses the window.   In the meantime, a couple of policemen are trying to get into a house to rescue someone from an explosion that has been caused by the man in the chair.    This movie does not appear to be all that different from a lot of other western films.  In fact, it is a more realistic western than most.  I found this movie to be well done and well acted.  The film includes some scenes of violence and a very bizarre plot.  My rating is a four out of five.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always knew it was going to happen. It was too obvious. It had to happen at some point. It's not hard to read through the words of a kid that has just learned he has leukemia to learn that it's a disease that needs to be treated like any other.   This movie doesn't really have a story, it has just a very slow-moving plot.  I like how we can just follow along and think we are learning things about this character, that is until we realize that we are the same person. This movie never gives me enough to keep going to the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all I would like to apologize for not writing this review earlier.   The movie   did a very good job at showing that a man can survive the destruction of his own home.  It was the only thing that kept me from giving this movie a very low rating.  There were some very funny parts and even though the story was a little on the absurdist side,   the movie made up for it by being very well filmed and the music was nice and catchy.  My only problem with this movie is that there are a couple of scenes in the movie that would be very hard to watch in real life.  Also I have never been a huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film takes place in the town of Montpelier in Vermont. The story centers around the Montpeliers' eccentric patriarch William Stine, a man who loves his family and his dogs and is never happier than when he's at home alone or watching his family in their backyard. He has an obsession with the paranormal, the supernatural, and the weird. His mother had been having strange dreams of an old man coming into her bedroom while she was sleeping and then disappearing. She also believes that her dead husband is coming back to life. Stine is always ready for any adventure - even when it involves a family dog.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It had a good ending, which I didn't expect considering the subject matter. I also appreciated how the characters are not stereotypical, and this was shown with a few scenes that gave the characters character in a way I couldn't explain. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies (I'm a romantic comedy lover), and I had never seen anything like this in my life.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen any of the movies from this group before, but   The whole point of a   group like this is that you can have a laugh at the end, but you really have to stay until the middle for the   story to be   worth your time, as   it has a lot of twists and turns.   This   is not as  scary as the last movie ( which was   a good flick), but the story still works, and   you can enjoy   the movie, even if you don't like gore at   all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It is one of my all time favorite movies, in fact, it is one that I wish I could have seen when I was younger.   The movie is actually a very clever satire on the entire Hollywood system.  This is not just a movie about a couple of young actors and some of their shenanigans.  A lot of these characters are actually played by real life people.  They were given no other option, they had to act, and it works.  It was very funny and enjoyable to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when I was a little kid in a local movie theater. I liked it, but I wasn't impressed.   This is a pretty good comedy, but it's nothing to get your heart racing.  It's a short comedy, and it takes about 10 minutes to set up, but in the next 10 minutes we are introduced to so many characters, that it takes a couple minutes just to get to know them. There are some good laughs here and there.  One of the best parts of the movie, is when Mr. Rumple, and all the other Disney characters, go to an amusement park, and ride a ride called "Mr. Jumpin' Jive".   It may be a little offbeat, and a little too much like a kid's show, but the movie does well enough, and I'm pretty sure some adults (who might be a tad older than I was at the time) would enjoy it as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always liked the idea that the only thing that kept the world's governments in check was a strong military establishment.  The film is about a former army sergeant that ends up becoming a very powerful man and a very good man who has very little to lose.   It takes some time to get to the end but is well worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid science fiction film that, while not without some technical problems, is highly entertaining. The plot is very complex, and I don't want to spoil anything, but if you can look past the poor effects, and the long-winded monologues, you'll be rewarded by an intriguing film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen most, if not all, of the films that have been made in Japan since 1960. In the '70's and early '80's, I made a living as a "special effects technician." While working on many such films, I was often asked to design special effects for a movie or two. The first to get the job was the great Tom Selleck. He had a brilliant set of ideas, and was a great friend of my son, Doug. A lot of the ideas that he came up with were very innovative. However, a lot of his ideas were "too good to be true." He would create these effects by simply using a cheap, and often extremely dangerous, set of gizmos. He would tell me about what he was going to do, and I would work out a series of gaffs to make sure that he would not accidentally injure himself or harm the actors while filming the gaff's. This worked out fine, until I would find a new gaff for the gremlin and ask Tom to try to make it work. The gremlin would go and try to use the old gaff. Then, of course, Tom would fall over the old set and the gremlins would take over again. Then I would spend another half hour trying to fix it. Then Tom would come in and tell me to put it all back together and Tom would make the gimp run around the screen a couple of times, and then he would tell Doug to tell me that he was happy with the way it all worked out. Tom and I never got along very well, but there was always a great rapport between us, and we would often have dinner together. We used to laugh about all the things that went wrong. We never felt that the movies were good movies, but it was good to laugh at Tom's goofy ideas. This movie is no different. This is one of those "too true to be good" films. It is wonderful in every way, and it shows that Tom was not the only one to come up with some very good ideas.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first   It was the middle of the summer, it had been a long day and a long night of sleep. It was about 11:30 on a bright, warm Sunday morning and my dad, uncle and cousins, were sitting on the porch enjoying the early morning sunshine. The morning was clear and bright with no clouds in sight. I was about seven years old at this time and I think that's when I first knew about the sun's rays. We had a big blanket, a straw pillow and a few sun block things. I didn't know much about science but I did know something about sunlight and how it affects us. I had a little notebook and pen to make note of everything that happened and that's all I had. That day I learned the word "fascination" and it was something I was fascinated by. I spent most of the day looking at the little green house over on the right of the screen. The little house was surrounded by woods and trees so there was not much to see, only the house and the sky. I kept looking at all the trees, seeing all their shapes and shapes of leaves and their shapes. There were lots of butterflies, I was seeing all kinds of shapes. I wanted to watch the house. I'd read a lot about how trees, flowers and animals change colors. And I was thinking that I wanted a change too. So I decided to go to the house over there and see what the house would be like. It didn't take long to go from the house to the field on the other side of the house where the butterflies were. But it wasn't long enough. I knew I wanted the house more. And at that point my eyes were still on the house but they were no longer looking straight ahead. I could see that I was standing in front of the little house on the far side of a field. But there was something wrong. I couldn't see a fence or a gate. I looked at everything around me and I saw a lot of different things. Some butterflies were all over the ground and others had taken over the house on my right. I saw many different birds, a variety of colors and sizes. I also saw something that I'd never seen before: A snake. It jumped out from under the ground all by itself. I tried to run toward it but something was chasing me. I ran into the woods and the sun was shining brightly through the leaves. I hid behind some trees

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been wanting to see a remake of "Sleepless in Seattle" ever since I saw the remake in the 70's, and this one comes much closer to the original than it ever did back then.   It's funny, sexy and scary in the most satisfying way.  It also has a few laughs and a bit of character development, something that "The Shining" can't do.  And this is a good horror movie; not to be compared with "Dawn of the Dead," but definitely a worthy successor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After reading a review where the reviewer said this is a very bad movie, I had to give it a try, and after this I'm convinced that this is not a bad movie at all.   I'll give a little about the movie, it's a thriller, based on a true story.  While there is a woman who has been raped, she doesn't say a word, and her story ends with her being raped once again.  We follow this poor woman's life.  One day she's going to the store to buy some medicine for a little boy she adopted when she was about 8 years old.  The first time she goes into the store she meets a man who's carrying a young girl.  She doesn't know who he is at first.  Once she learns who he really is, she learns how to fight against him.  It's not a good thing to go back to a man's home, even if he seems nice at first, he may be an alcoholic or a rapist.  So she goes back with the little girl.   After they get home, she finds that her daughter is missing.   The little girl was just 4 or 5 when the man left her with her.  He took the money they had, and left her without a way to care for her.   It's a bad enough thing to have a little girl, but what is worse is that she's never going to get the help she needs.  To make a long story short, the girl is found by her mother, and she knows it's her daughter.  Her mother is a strong, strong woman.  But the mother doesn't want her to go home, because she's afraid her mother will be angry at her for abandoning the girl to the man.   She tells her mother that she knows the man's name.     Now what's wrong with the movie is that the mother never goes to the police because she doesn' t want to get her son in trouble.  What a terrible thing to do.  Now, I don't know about you, but I don' t feel sorry for her either.  I was glad when I found out she was lying.  At least she found out that her son is an alcoholic, so she didn't have to deal with his problems.  The mother can't stand him at all, but she does go out and search, thinking she'll find her little girl before she
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was totally shocked.   The last half hour was brilliant, but the first hour was just amazing!   First up we had an episode of the classic TV show, Dr. Who.  After the opening credits, we were in a police car. We were driving along the highway and the police had come across an accident. The police officer in the car had been hit by a car and we learned from his statement that the man who hit the officer, a man named William Lumbergh, was a notorious bank robber.  He had murdered a man and then he was going to kill again.  Lumberger had gotten away after killing the first man, but he was killed after the officer had fallen from the bridge.  The police found Lumberly in a car that had a bloodstained coat on the seat, the seat was gone and we knew the coat had been used to rob the bank.  There had been a fire at the bank and someone had made off with about 10,000 dollars, about 10 years earlier. The bank was burned and the building had been taken over by the Federal Government, but we couldn't find the man responsible.  We followed him to his home and we knocked on the door.  It opened and there was a man in his late 50s. He told us that he had been in the army, but his military career was ended in disgrace. He had gotten a lot of money by killing people in the military, and his wife was dying. He was living on a ranch in Colorado.  As we talked to him, his wife died and then his car died as well.  Then we talked a bit about a woman that he knew.  They told us a little about this woman and her death.  Her mother had come to town and told her to look into a shop that had come into the area. She had found a woman's clothes in the shop and she had given it to the mother.  This was a story that went all the way back to the Revolutionary War. The people had thought it was a good idea to make this town a town with lots of banks.  At that time people used to walk from town to town to sell their stuff.  A little bit later we went to a movie theater. It was in the theater that someone had killed one of the actors and then shot her several times and the theater had burned to the ground.  When we left the theater, the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I was skeptical of the film at first, thinking it was a remake of a popular TV series I had seen once a long time ago. It was nothing like that, and I loved the original! - The setting is perfect. I can't believe I didn't see it in my childhood! It's a beautiful setting. - The movie is not like the other TV series movies I've seen before, it is original and very different. I didn`t understand it until I was almost done watching it, and then realized it's a story about a man who is in a constant state of denial about his wife`s pregnancy and the possibility of her becoming handicapped. The characters are interesting and well-drawn. - I think it`s only about 4/5ths of a complete story, but I can`t recommend it for people who don`t like a good old fashioned story. - It`s a short but very interesting film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, you have to like a movie that tries to make a political point. It's not going to do that. The movie's politics are very minor. It isn't about race. It might get some of it but even then that doesn't change what it is about.   A couple of scenes are very well shot. One is about the USMC fighting an Iraqi force. They are on foot. The enemy is on horseback. The Iraqi soldiers are mostly white and the US Marines are mostly black. One black man is killed in the movie and you can't help but wish that the movie made an effort to make him more prominent. You don't really get to know much about him and how he died. It doesn't really have to do with race and it's not something that has to do in the story. It does make you think about race in some way but not enough for it to really be an important issue in the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent thriller about an assassination attempt and the bizarre adventures of one of the participants, the young assassin, who is a bit of a genius.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie: When they're looking for a new leader, the gang agrees to a one-on-one interview with a "good-looking" man who is just as "good looking" as they are, but is a tad more violent.   This is where the movie gets the most out of its "bad boy" aspect: The violence in this film is pretty much non-existent.  It's an extremely simple-looking movie, and when you see this guy "just" beating the crap out of people, it's pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first thing I noticed about this movie was the great soundtrack. I am not a big fan of classical music, but the movie has so much music, it makes it very hard to listen to.   It is hard to explain why I like the film so much.  I found the story very interesting, not a typical fairy tale, there are some darker elements in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to this film at my local theater and was extremely impressed.   The whole film was like a combination of a western, a sci-fi film and a romance movie.  And there was a scene which is worth talking about.  The scene takes place after the movie begins and the main character has just finished a hunt. He finds a wounded deer, and goes to kill it. The deer runs and begins to run away. The protagonist, John Wayne, jumps in a truck and speeds after the deer and the scene is absolutely magnificent.  In the course of the chase the deer passes John Wayne three times. Three times the deer is able to get away. Then it decides to do it again. But this time John Wayne catches it. And so he finishes the deer.  I would have liked to have seen more of this, but at the same time it did not feel as long as it should have been.  It was good, but it was not a very long film.

In order to gain admission, the school is going in a different direction, and Depp's character is thrown into a horrible situation.

There's just something about a guy and a dog who go on a journey together that I find extremely amusing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the film is over, and I had finished seeing a film that was in a class with "The Conversation", "Hollywood" and "The English Patient" as being the most disappointing films ever made, I can't think of a better way to end my opinion on a film.   As for "The French Connection" I find the first part to be better than the second, but not by much.  The story in general, is very cliche at times, but it's done very well.  There are some excellent performances, especially for Paul Newman, but other than that, the movie is pretty uninteresting, and it's obvious that it was made just to make money.  I give "The Spanish Connection" 4 out of 5 stars.

But the people don't care. They don't even realize they're getting ready to be bombed.

The character development is superb, making me laugh every time. There is a lot of swearing in this film, and it's not all too bad.   The one thing I don't really like about this movie is that it ends with the main character getting drunk in a restaurant and calling it a day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie and I like the characters.   They are very different.  One is a normal young man in a poor family with two sisters. His father has an accident and they are forced to return to a poor city and they live with his mother and brother. The man is the same but his behavior is completely different. He is very smart and has a lot of friends. One day when he was at school, one of his friends got drunk and fell down the stairs. He said he was not drunk at all and was about to get into a taxi. The taxi driver said there is a doctor and that he is very sick and has to come to the hospital immediately. The guy was so confused, he went to the doctor and the doctor told him that the guy is not drunk but had a bad accident. He was very scared and then the man said he had a problem.  He did not want to go to the hotel where his friends had stayed because he could not find his parents. He did want to see his friends because they were very nice. The girl he is in love with was very angry that he was too scared to go there because she knew what a doctor looked like.  She started to scream that he should come to a city to meet her.  Eventually the man got into the taxi and started to drive off. He realized how much he hated his life. He then decided to get a job.  I wish the director would give the girl the last scene and let her say goodbye to her boyfriend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not even sure what the best thing about this movie is. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy to see a movie like this, especially one with a female lead. I've never felt more like I was in a bad dream than I did in this movie.   This is what you see when a woman tries to save a man from his own self loathing.  I know it sounds crazy but I really loved how this movie played with reality. For example, I think the girl should have kept her clothes on the whole time. What's wrong with that?   So basically a woman is trying to get away from an abusive boyfriend. What she does is talk to him like a boy. The movie takes place over the course of a few days and at first, it seems like she is the bad guy. She is the one who seems to get what she wants out of things, and the things she wants are all bad. Then things turn around and things are more good. She has a guy who she just wants to be with and who gets her what she is looking for. Her friends are all there for her and they seem to be her only source of happiness. It seems like things will go back to normal when the boyfriend dumps her, but then they get all messed up.  This movie made me angry when I read about it. It's a bad movie, but it is not bad in a way that the audience needs to sit down and get upset about it, it's not bad because it's a good horror movie. It is bad because the movie itself is really, really stupid.  It is a pretty straight forward horror movie and the plot is about a woman who is trying desperately to get a boyfriend who is abusive.  For some reason she doesn't understand the concept of not wanting a man who will abuse you. I guess this is why she keeps her clothes off? Or is that just me?  What is also pretty dumb about this is the fact that a woman's friends (all female) are the ones who help her and the guy she wants to meet. They seem to just go along with everything and then get mad at her when she doesn's something that will upset the guy.  How is that a "dumb" movie?  The movie also has lots of bad ideas. It has a lot of characters who have no reason to be there. It also has a male character who just stands around

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie   The film has a lot of plot. It's about an old man who finds a mysterious artifact, the "Garden of Eden". The old man says this artifact can create anything. He says if he can create a woman that can live forever, he will be rich and have sex all the time. This is what he says. However, he can't find a woman to create a creature like him. His daughter and son come to visit him. He can't stop them from seeing him naked. He doesn't want to have sex. His wife, his son, his daughter and his daughter's son come in the room and talk to him. The daughter's daughter tells him that his wife is so hot, he's not sure if he wants to have a baby with her. The wife comes in and tells her father that she and her husband are so unhappy, and that they have to live apart. The old couple has another talk. The son says his father is so nice and sweet, so likeable. He loves them very much, and wants to be the man who will make all of them happy. The husband tells him not to fool with the girl, and says that they are happy to be with their father, and not with their mother. He tells the son, if he has a baby, it will only be a boy, not a girl. So the son wants to talk to the old man. The father says that he knows all about having children, but he has only two. His first wife died before his second wife. He married his first wife, who gave birth to two daughters. The other daughters died before he had a son. The older one was a sweet little girl, but her life was cut short by a bullet. The young man who was born had no life of his own. The first wife had many children, and a second husband. The second husband married again, and had another daughter. The girl is still alive, and her name is Eunice. The Old man says that Euniece is the mother of his son. EunICE (the daughter) is so beautiful, that the old couple is afraid that her husband will cheat her. EUNICE (who is married) asks the old husband what his first name is. He replies that it is Eustace. The two get into an argument. The oldest couple tries to force the girl to have an abortion. The woman has

As the saying goes, one should never judge a book by its cover, but as far as old school flicks go, this is a pretty good one!   The story was well-done and had a good sense of humor, but nothing too out of this world.  This is one of those movie I would recommend to anyone over the age of 25. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched the movie twice in a row now, and it is only getting better. The movie stars a guy who just happens to be a "daddy" to his five year old son who is going to be an Olympic swimmer. So the movie gets to the point very quickly: the boy has a good chance of winning the gold in the swimming event. It makes sense that the father would want the boy to win and be an Olympian, but the movie takes a different approach. Instead of using the kid's talent and athleticism to build his reputation in a sport that seems impossible to the average kid, the kid is instead turned into a pawn in a very twisted political game. The father's motivation for turning his son into a swimmer is to get him elected to the U.S. Congress. If he wins, the father gets to keep his son's reputation for being a "good kid". He gets to spend a good amount of time with his son and his new girlfriend. The only problem with this movie is the ending. It's not very good and has some poor acting. It has a very interesting story, though, and is a good story with interesting characters. It is worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never had any idea what to expect from this movie until the trailer. It took me a minute to get used to the new name 'Sons of Anarchy'.   It looks so old fashioned.   But then, I never thought that the show would end up that old. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to seeing this.   It is a good old western that plays nice with a western like Wild Bill   and its like that.  It has its fair share of action and   it does have a nice story,   but in the end,  It just   falls apart.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       A movie that I wish I could re watch is "A Nightmare on Elm Street"   It's not even the same film, but a remake. It takes the basic elements from "A Halloween Carol" and "Nightmare on Elm St"  and makes it even more horrific. The main character is played by a very bad actor,   But the story, with great acting by the three characters, and the effects, are amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is really fun to watch. We have a girl with an old school accent that lives at a house with her mom and dad. There is a little boy that lived there for a long time and who is now gone. There are two young girls that live there who are also named Emily and Amy, the girls that don't know the family have to do all the cooking and cleaning. One day when Emily is going out for a walk she sees a little girl running. She goes to give her a big hug and to say hi. But when she gets closer she realizes she is only the girl's dog. She can't bring herself to pet the girl who is standing there with a baby on her hip. So she just gives the little girl a big big hug. As it turns out she doesn't want to be pet and just wants to be hugged all the time. This is where the story starts to get good.    This is one of those films that you should take a little time and think about. It is funny and entertaining and I loved it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first movie about a group of people who are a mix of hippies, punks, and criminals who run around in a city that they don't belong to, they're "freaks" (in a good way), and this is a nice movie that just seems to have everything you could want from a movie that follows this theme.   I can't give the movie a 4 because the writing isn't good.  It is hard to follow a story that is so abstract and hard to believe that it is possible to make a movie like this.  I really like the setting and it would have been better if a man with a camera actually showed up during most of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I got caught up in the excitement of the opening, but then the film dropped it's bombshell!   It is a very interesting film, and the most enjoyable movie I have seen in many a long while.   We have all come to expect good looking people, but this is not so. There are some lovely, albeit very funny women, and a lovely man who is a decent actor.  In the opening scene the man is about to kiss the woman. He tries to kiss her. But it is not possible.  The woman is so attractive, that it seems as though all she is doing is showing off.  But I think she has a hidden desire to please the man. She kisses him. But she doesn't really try to kiss him. She seems to only kiss him to please him. It is just a way to show that she is attractive.  What happens next is simply wonderful.  We watch the woman kissing the man with great lust and desire.  It was simply so erotic to see the woman's desire to satisfy the man that we all sat up straight, and watched, in full view of the television.  This film has a wonderful ending.  While this film is not for everyone, it is a film I would recommend.  The movie:   It opens with a beautiful woman, dressed in a pink night gown. Her breasts and face look almost like they were sculpted. We are introduced to this wonderful woman as she is being dragged down a narrow hallway by two men who are in the process of beating the crap out of her.   This all seems so wonderful to the viewer. She is so beautiful!  The scene transitions to the man who was in the room the previous day. He is being held down by two of the men who were there.  He is having a hard time.  Then she enters.  There is no mistaking her beauty. She has the body of a goddess.  She begins to have her way with the men and in a few moments the two men are forced to submit to the new queen.    Her behavior is just unbelievable. She takes them by the wrists, and forces them to drink her blood.  They get into the bathroom to clean up.  Then she goes into a room that has a man and a woman with another man in the other room.  I was amazed at how she was able to get inside this one room without attracting
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have enjoyed watching The Matrix, and I think The Matrix is the most realistic movie I've ever seen. It's a bit more like a sci-fi movie than a science-fiction movie, but it still looks like science fiction and is certainly realistic. This is a science fiction movie that feels real because it's so realistic.   And I have to say it's the best movie in this series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of movies, it is my favorite thing to do in life. When I hear the "g" word, I immediately go to my favorite movie, "Ghost in the Shell", I don't like the title for a moment. However, I'm glad to say this movie is fantastic. It is a futuristic story about an advanced and beautiful cyborg. The story is pretty original, it will not take you by surprise, it makes you feel like a part of the story. The music and the visuals of the movie are beautiful. There are no annoying scenes with no meaning to them. I'm sure you will love this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well done film that shows how the world is a dangerous place in which there is an undercurrent of hate that is hidden beneath the surface.   The story revolves around a man who has a child by a woman that he has a relationship with.  The film starts out with the child's mother taking her daughter out to play.  She takes a shower and she gets out of the shower and finds her mother in a daze.  After realizing what happened she takes her out of her room, knocks on her door and tells her to go to bed.  Her daughter goes to bed and she does the same.  That is the beginning of the film.  Now the father is trying to convince his son to tell him about the death of his wife.  He says she died of a broken heart.  His son is not willing to believe a word he is saying.  Eventually the son does tell him.  But his father is having a mental breakdown.  And the film is a true gem.  I recommend this film to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must see for the true fan.   The film is a combination of action, drama, and adventure. It is a fast-paced film that contains many exciting sequences that will make you sweat a little.  In fact, it is very exciting when one takes the time to watch it.  It is also funny.  This is the first movie that I saw from Tom Cruise, and it is definitely an exciting film. It includes action, suspense, suspenseful scenes, lots of laughs, and a lot of emotion.  I am glad that I watched it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy: Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. I always enjoy going back and watching that film because it is a timeless, funny, tragic, touching story of the power of love and friendship that is often forgotten by the time it is done.   The story that unfolds in Empire is different from the trilogy but is not without its own charm. It is a little bit more dramatic and involves a larger number of people but there are still moments where the action is really exciting and there are a number of moments where you just can't help but smile.  There's also a lot of humor in this movie.  The acting is also pretty good.  Of all the movies I've seen, this is one of the best.  As you can tell by all the positive reviews I've read about this film, I would recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars or is an Empire fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am still working on my English.   It is a great film, from what I have seen so far. I love the look of the costumes (you know, a little like the old movies) and it was a little creepy at first, but not too scary.  The story is well done.  In my humble opinion, it was like the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie and I thought it was very scary.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a little disappointed by a movie that did not get a theatrical release. It did not do well in the United States, where I live. It is very well written, and the script is great.   For those of you who have never heard of this movie: It is about a man who has sex with his girlfriend in front of her friends, and then runs off to a party to celebrate their success. They all seem to be doing very well, so they get drunk, do a little drinking and a little sex, and make a mess of a party.  I don't know if it was a good idea to have a sex scene involving a big bottle of scotch at a party, and what a mess that makes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The ending  !!!   is an old favorite of mine from my youth,  . It is about a lonely, overweight man who gets a job at a gas station in the woods,   and finds himself in the most interesting role of all:  the manager.   I'm not sure I would describe the movie as being particularly emotional,  because the story is pretty dry,  but it is quite entertaining in its own way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen!   (I should warn you, though:  It is not for the faint of heart.)   I don't know whether or not you've seen this film, but I suggest you give it a try.   The story is a bit odd, but it is also entertaining, funny, and has a good bit of heart to it.  This is a film about a man named Michael Smith, who finds himself trapped in a small country town after a car accident that kills his wife and son.  His story begins when he is given a job that would have him working at a hotel, but that soon goes haywire.  The other people who work at the hotel are all bad, and the housekeeper is a big meanie.  Then, there's the owner, Mr. Jones, who is all kinds of awful.  Unfortunately, Mr Jones has a daughter, so he makes it his business to have Michael's family come to the hotel, where they are held hostage by a group of people called the Joes.  Mr. Smith is trying to get them out, and is assisted by a number of other employees, who are trying to keep him out.  Michael and his friends are getting tired of living in a house with bad people, so they decide to move in with a family in the neighborhood.  One night, they discover the family has been murdered.  But when the police arrive, Michael is accused of the murders, which is a bad idea, because the murderer is in the house with them.  Things take a turn for the worse when the killer turns Michael into a zombie, and then attacks the family.  It is up to Michael to break the cycle, because he knows what happened to his family, and he won't let himself be killed by the murderer.  I enjoyed this film quite a bit, but the ending made it so much better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite horror film.   There are a few things to watch with this one.  First is that when you see this movie with an adult, they are more terrifying.  Second is the fact that the ending was a lot of fun.  Third, a young boy is taken to a movie and he gets his heart broken.  I'm not sure if he had any feelings for the girl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a movie so much that you have to take a few months to recover from it, so, please accept my apologies. I'll try to do it in such a way so that the ending stays in your mind for a long while: a man with a dream decides to do something extraordinary; to travel to a faraway country (not a very distant country, you'll probably be surprised), and to meet the girl of his dreams in a strange, small, charming, little, lonely, beautiful, funny, and strange country;   After that man wakes up with a hangover and a dream and decides to set out on this incredible adventure.   I found this movie very hard to watch for a lot of reasons, and the whole thing is almost impossible to describe in a few paragraphs, but it will leave you speechless and breathless in no time, and with the ending you will definitely want to go on a roadtrip. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen an English-language remake of this film in a long time, and I thought the original made a great debut in its native language.   This film, directed by Tony Scott (G.I. Joe, The Untouchables, and many others), focuses on John (Robert Patrick), a widower who is sent to work for a circus on his way back from his trip to see his family in New York.  John's job is to break his prisoners out of their cages, but he finds that he has become a better man than he could have ever imagined.  The plot is a little slow, and the first half is a bit silly, but after that the film is pretty much one long fun ride.  A lot of fun to be had, too.  I thought I could find more original humor in this movie than I did, but it is all true to the original, and it still holds up well 15 years later.  There is nothing wrong with the film at all, and if you don't like it, you don´t really have the right to criticize.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not as well thought out as the cover art makes it appear. It is a simple tale of a poor girl being taken advantage of by a rich man. I was not enthralled by this movie, but at least it was not bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie starts with a woman, played by a nice lady named Kari Gersch, getting her hair cut by a bald guy who looks like a supermodel. She starts talking about how she's in New York with her boyfriend, but the movie doesn't actually go to New York. She goes to a small town where there's a bar where she drinks with a lot of handsome guys and then goes back to the bar to get her hair done and she meets a pretty girl. She and her boyfriend spend the rest of the movie together but it turns out she's a man, she's not wearing a bra. The movie ends with a young boy looking around in a bookstore, as if he's looking for something. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that just gets better and better and, to be honest, this is one movie that's been on my mind. It's very funny and there are a lot of good laughs along the way.   "It's a good thing we're back where we belong"   A little bit about the plot: a little bit more about the story:  The premise is simple enough: a guy is making a trip to the west coast of the US for his cousin's birthday. He gets a ride with a man named Danny. Danny's a bit... odd. And not in a "You're weird, why aren't you in your own damn room with your own goddamned room!" way, though. No, Danny is in a car with his friend. Danny has a small black dog and is on a mission to get into a state of hyper-focus and then crash and burn and die. This is how it goes: Danny is driving a big, old beat up bus with a trailer attached to it, and the journey is difficult as it seems that the bus is going to crash and be lost somewhere in the mountains. Danny does crash, but that's about it. The story, at first glance, is really only about Danny and Danny's dog. But there's a lot more to it than that, and this is why it's really, really funny. Danny is one man on a journey, trying to get to a very special place that's not really on earth.  It's a really funny movie that can't be missed, even though the first half is a bit slow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised when I heard about this movie, because when I was a kid I always wanted to go to Disneyland.   It has a lot of similarities to Disney's Haunted Mansion.  The story revolves around a man who is a scientist who gets his powers by accident.  But instead of helping the people he is supposed to help, he is a very sinister character who seems to go out of his way to harm and harm badly.  He wants to take over the world, but he doesn't have the power to do it.  This film is a good old-fashioned movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a teenager I remember my friends and I would make a film in our bedrooms in a dark room.   It was about a man who is taken in by a priest who is on trial for raping and murdering his daughter.  I felt sick at the movie as I was very disturbed and did not understand why he was doing it.  The movie did not make me cry but my friends cried as we sat in a room together.  One girl got pregnant and we had to find a place to have the birth.  When we got to a house in a village I thought it would be a nice place to film as we were only about four boys.  We all went to the living room and we all had fun with some girls.  It would have been nice to see them go crazy after being spanked.  If you have seen a movie with a priest involved then you must watch this movie as it is very disturbing and has not a little sex in it. It would be interesting to see a priest and his wife who are both very attractive with very small children in the family.  This is a great little movie and a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot. I like it because there's a real sense of humor in it, and it's a very well done movie. I liked how it started and how it finished.    This movie is in the spirit of some of the movies I liked in the 60's/70's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a word, amazing.   This is a very entertaining movie, I found it funny and the actors are really fun to watch.  There are some funny scenes in this movie (they are in the beginning but this is the only part I remember from the movie) but the main thing I remember about this movie is the story.  It is about a bunch of people trying to live in a town that is run by the military.  I don't like the military in general but I like how they have to live there, their lives are very boring.  This movie is very violent, the lead character is a really tough guy and when he gets his ass kicked he doesn't want to take it back but he must, he has to defend his country.  The movie also features the people of the town trying to get their town back from the military, all the people that live there are really tough and do some really good things, I really like this movie and it is definitely worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun, fast paced, and well produced movie.   It's funny, it's heartfelt, it has a few surprises, it looks a bit more like a "grown-up" movie than a teen movie. But most of all, it is a well-crafted and emotionally engaging story about how a group of teenagers discover a secret that only the rich can afford to keep. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by how well this one turned out. I thought that the film's premise was somewhat silly, but it turned out to be quite good. The film tells the story of two young lovers who both fall in love with a beautiful young woman, a widow called Nessa. One of them (I'm not going to call him "the other one") finds out she's really a man and the other (the guy) sees her for what she really is. It's really quite funny. The acting was very good, especially the one who plays the other one, who's a bit of a bumbling idiot. The soundtrack was okay and the cinematography was very nice. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only time I saw this in the theater was a month ago when a movie theater was closed down. The only thing worth seeing in a closed down movie theater is the "B" movies which usually have very little plot and an endless amount of nudity.   What is worth seeing is a very good science fiction/adventure film from 1970. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what I was thinking about when I was in the theaters watching the first film? I was hoping for a sequel.   The good news is that the sequel isn't that far off.  I'm not going to say too much about the movie here, except that it's a well-paced, well-acted crime thriller.  The movie starts off slow with a woman being interrogated by a couple of detectives about a murder she was involved with some years ago.  She admits to it, and then the scene goes to black, and the next scene shows us a couple driving around looking for her.  It's obvious the couple is in search of revenge, but I think they're really looking for something else, as if to say, "You don't know how to kill a cat, do you?"   They find her, and this is where the movie gets its hooks in.  After finding out the woman's name, they have a long conversation in which they talk about what the woman did, and what it means to them.  When she mentions having a son, they say, not in a bad way, but it's the first time they mention their son together.  We find out that the son is in college now, and is working on a science-fiction novel, which they plan to publish when the man's son is done at college.  He's already working on it, so it's not really necessary to mention it.  A very funny scene.  This movie is definitely not a good one.  You don't need to be a science fiction fan to know it's terrible.  But it's fun, and that's more than you can say about most films these days. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good:  It's funny, it's interesting and I'm glad to have a sequel.  "   The Good: I've seen a lot of these type of films, and it seems like they are more popular with teens today.  They look like something out of a comedy movie: "Who's next?", "We have to go!"  And of course we have a group of kids getting out of their parents house to get a big, nasty mouth from a crazy guy.  These guys do get into some trouble:  "Don't be a douche.  "   I'm not a huge fan of this one, it just doesn't seem to fit in with the others, but as a comedy I'll take a little time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie. The story takes place in two time periods. It takes place during the late 70's and early 80's when the disco scene was happening. In fact, I would like to add that I have never seen such a crazy movie before! It is very interesting to watch a movie about two people in a relationship. One who is totally crazy about disco and the other who doesn't give a shit. Their relationship becomes more and more crazy and they meet many interesting characters. The movie was also funny. The characters don't get enough screen time to develop them completely. There is just enough of each character to have them be entertaining and even entertaining in their own ways.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a little weird to watch a movie about a character who is supposed to be crazy, but I still liked it!   I hope that they'll make a sequel about her in the next movie, cause it's awesome! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, let me start by saying that this is a great movie. If you have not seen this movie you need to do so, but also it is a wonderful movie. This is the only movie that was actually made as a play, where the characters get their own lives, and I can not say enough good things about it, although its not good on the eye, its a fantastic movie with a lot of great lines and scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The first half of this movie is really good. The first minute I thought this movie was a documentary. The movie tells about how an ex-girlfriend of Michael Douglas met and fell in love with him at a party. After the first time they were seeing each other he did some things that would put most men to shame.   After they broke up she then turned around and went back to him.  This caused him to change.  I can't imagine how long that would take for most men.  That said, it does not take long.  It is a shame this movie did not get a better movie made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fantastic movie that has the feeling of being a good old fashioned horror film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Kung Fu Hustle" is a good film. This is a remake of a popular 1960's movie called "KUNG FU HOLDER".   In the original movie, the "Kun Gong-Shun" were a group of Chinese martial arts masters who worked as the go-to guys when the US sent their military to Hong Kong in the early 60's to pacify a small Chinese uprising.   While this movie doesn't start out that way, the main characters aren't the same group of guys. The original movie was based around two brothers who were in the US Marines and fought and died in the war in Vietnam. In the remake, the brothers are a married couple living in Los Angeles and are trying to find a little place to live on their savings when the wife becomes a bit depressed about her recent engagement and she loses all her friends. The brothers decide that this is the perfect time to hit the road and head to Taiwan to learn some of the Kung Fu tricks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good story about a normal guy who's in the wrong place at the wrong time in a strange place.   The story takes place in an old fashioned neighborhood in the middle of a desert.  In this area, people are not very interested in looking at the sky, they're too busy working on their land.  There are also no streetlights, but there's plenty of wooded areas for hunting.  The setting is nice and the film is good.  I'll admit I was expecting a little more from the story, but that's what happens when you're watching a movie in an unknown desert setting.  A good desert movie in the right mood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't want to be too much of a spoiler, but it's pretty clear that a major plot element of the movie is that, over the course of the last few years, the government has turned it into a war. And by "war," I mean the government is going to start killing a lot of people, and it's going to be a war of pure annihilation, like in World War II, but this time it's not going to end like World War I.   The big problem with this movie is the same as all those other movies with the government and it being "evil":   They're so good at it, so slick about it, that it's hard to know that they're evil at all.  The problem, of course, is the other bad guys:  They have to be bad to the point of inhumanity to stand up to these people, but the villains are so utterly unlikeable and so poorly written, that the only reason to like them is that the movie does not seem to care very much about them.  It's like an idiot trying to play a guitar in an orchestra and not being able to do anything good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this is an old man trying to find a young man he knows is trying to get a new girlfriend. He goes to a nearby church, then gets a message from the church leader to meet him at the church grounds. He gets there and meets the young man, who is a guy in his thirties and his mom is in the audience. He's an old, sick old man who's got an aneurysm and his daughter is there with him. He starts going to the church to pray, but his daughter says something about being glad there's no God. She asks him if he's a good Christian, and the old man says, "Yes, but I'm not a good Catholic." Then he takes her aside and tells her the story of how Jesus saved him from the devil and that there is no devil. He says that Jesus had just been crucified when the devil appeared before him and told him that he has to have Jesus crucified or he'd kill him and his family. He was all but begging him to stop when Jesus comes back to life and tells him that there's a devil who wants Jesus to die. Jesus then tells him to leave the old guy alone because there's more to life than being a crucifixion victim. He then leaves and tells his daughter to be brave and just go with him to the Catholic Church, where there's lots of other people who are doing their best to make a living. He has a hard time staying true to Jesus at first, but eventually he's able to keep that faith.   But Jesus' story does have a good ending, as it involves a Catholic priest and a miracle that saves him and brings his family back to him.

I recommend this movie if you like a good laugh with an original story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "My God!" I was not sure how to review this movie.   If you're looking for a straight up action movie,   you're in luck.  This is all you need to get in shape.  If that's all you want, you can stay there.  The movie doesn't have the charm of The Expendables or the excitement of Fast 5, but it is still entertaining.  It's a movie about a guy with a bad temper.  He gets out of the fight of his life by being funny.  When the bad guy breaks the window,  he finds himself with some new friends.  These guys don't take shit from anyone.  But there is one of them,  the one guy  who has a gun to your head.  Now,  it's a gun like you see in the movies.  And it's not a toy.  After all,  this gun doesn't fire shells, but bullets.  So the movie doesn t have much action, but there's more than enough laughs.  I would like to give this movie five stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a movie this good and this weird.   It's basically about a kid who lives in a small, run down house.  One night, he hears strange noises coming from his neighbor's house. And what is the weird thing, he sees a mysterious figure coming out of the back yard with a dog!   And so begins a weird story of a boy who knows more than he is letting on and a bizarre neighbor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about the "I've Got A Bad Feeling About This" film, I couldn't wait to see it. I was looking forward to it, as I have liked a few good French movies of the past. But... this movie is simply an excellent movie about a lot of different characters who are caught up in some very bizarre circumstances. It's not an easy movie to like and I wasn't the only one who thought so. But I can't give it a bad review, just say, "don't miss this!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been intrigued by the idea of a young man, James "Jock" Steele, who has been in the U.S. Army since the age of 17. In the army, he would earn the rank of Sergeant (and in the army is considered the "real thing") and would go on to become a Special Forces officer.   Unfortunately, after three tours of duty in Vietnam, a young American girl falls in love with him, so he resigns from the army.  Once in Italy, he meets a beautiful girl who has taken to calling him "Jumbo" (because he is so big).   The next morning, Jumbo is found dead by a river bank.      It seems he was strangled and his body is thrown in a ditch.  When he is later found, he is badly beaten, but his face is intact.  The girl, Angela, suspects that Jumbo has been involved in something criminal.  He is never caught and he is never seen again.  As a film about the life of James J. Steele, the film has a unique style, combining action, suspense, and drama.  It also has a number of strong acting performances from Robert Duvall, Joe Don Baker, and Peter Graves.  I like the film because it's very interesting, the story is told in a realistic way, and the film is entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that we don't have any real "action" in it. The first two or three minutes of it are some good editing (especially the first half, which is the only really funny part of the movie), but the rest of it is so slow and dull that it's a bit of a disappointment. I liked this movie so much more when it was a bit more action-filled. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not a horror buff, but the movie was so good that I decided to try and be a horror expert.   And this movie made me the expert. It's not a good idea to watch a movie like this in a dark theatre with only one flashlight.  You will get wet and sick.  It was very scary, I got chills from the beginning of the movie.  I'd rate it a B- but that's just me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most successful movies in the history of Hollywood   is a good film which is a mixture of drama, comedy and romance.   It tells the story of an ordinary man who loses his job and takes a journey to find a new job in the city of Paris, France.  But the film goes on to show how a man who is not like any other in the film finds a new purpose for his life.  The film takes the viewers through all the various things that happen in a city like Paris during the year 1912.  It shows the people who are so different to the people from earlier films.  However, the film also shows the beauty of nature.  A young boy and his father run a store and they run into some bad luck.  In the middle of it, a young woman falls in love with the father and he runs away.  We then follow the son who works as a clerk in a bookstore.  He is a bit of a loner.  During the day, he has his work, while at night, he is in the store.  Then one day he meets a girl.  She is beautiful, and he decides to join her in a secret affair.  When night falls on the first day of the affair, the boy decides that it's time to get his job back.  While he's gone, the girl is attacked by some bad men who try to kill her.  Before they can get their hands on her, the man who fell in love at first sight with her, comes to save her. It's an exciting, yet heartbreaking, story about love and life in Paris, Paris,   Paris, and a lot of other things in the movie.      There is so much to see in this film, that it is not worth taking a detailed review of it.  I recommend it to anyone who loves love stories. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an action movie with bad language, a little too much sex and a really bad acting. The acting is really good, and the acting in this movie really is the worst. It's like they cast a bunch of people and they just have a bunch who are just "on," and then they get into bad situations.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most underrated (or perhaps underrated-ish) films out there.   For a decade I had been searching for a movie to watch with my dad and, when I finally found it, I felt as if the entire world just came into focus. It is hard to describe just how intense this movie is, I feel like I am re-living the same things that were happening in real life, except the whole time I was watching it I was like, "Whoa, this is insane, I can't believe we're still watching this."   I have been looking for a solid action film to watch since the 80's and nothing is better than this one.  This is one of the best movies to ever come out of Germany. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest problem that the movie has is not the main character.   Well not really.  The main character is great and so is his partner, the wife.  They're a little too idealistic and romantic and happy for the movie.  I guess the best part about the movie is its amazing story and music.  It was actually funny in parts and it had good visuals and it was good.  Unfortunately, I'm glad I didn't give this movie a 4 star. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid family movie that is packed with the right amount of action, family humor, and well done special effects.   What makes it work:  A good mixture of family and action.  The characterizations are well done.  It isn't a big movie, but is a nice family film with a nice twist. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case it hasn't been explained enough, 'Papillon' is a very sweet movie. It is full of heart, laughter, and charm.   The story is very simple, but very well done. A young boy tries to rescue a little girl who was kidnapped by a bunch of baddies.  It's a well-done and cute movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful, tender and intelligent movie about a man with an unusual brain disorder and his extraordinary daughter. The daughter is a beautiful but sad girl with the gift of seeing a future in the past. When she is fourteen her father is admitted to a sanatorium. He is an old man, a man who has lived a long and beautiful life and yet has no future left. When he sees a young girl his eyes are opened to the possibilities of a future, a future full of light and happiness.   She shows that there are still things worth living for, she shows that life is worth living and she is a beacon for his daughter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is based on the autobiography of a former US president, George H W Bush. Bush was the most powerful man in the world at the time, as the war on terror had yet to reach its height. He had a huge ego, a grandiose sense of self and a love for power. The film also presents Bush as a flawed but flawed human being.   One of the interesting things about Bush is that when he goes through the trials of war, he is not the cruel and evil tyrant of the movie. There is a lightness to Bush that contrasts with his grandiOSE self. His sense of humour is very lighthearted but with a hint of cynicism.  Bush also shows a love of his family, and a very special and very loving relationship with his wife, Barbara Bush.  As the film progresses, we see more of Bush's character and his flaws. Bush is an extremely intelligent person who is able to achieve his dreams and his ambitions. His ego is enormous, and he has no problems about exploiting other people. I was surprised by how well he worked with his political foes.  It is interesting to see how the character Bush has changed in the film.  A friend of mine said that he was a "bad, bad man".   Although Bush was an incredibly powerful man, he was also very self centred. This leads him to a point where he does not even believe in his own successes, and the film shows Bush being utterly defeated in a major battle.  However, Bush did not become a sadist. He is actually quite gentle in the films' depiction of the war.  He was a nice guy, and I think the films portrayed him well. The characters in the movie were very well written. They had a very funny way of communicating. I found them a bit like a cartoon.  There were some very well executed scenes in the movies. They were also well acted, and it felt very authentic.  I was particularly interested by how the films dealt with homosexuality in the war in a humorous and mature manner.  The films had a strong feminist bent, which I really liked.  But I felt that the film was too long, and there were too many characters.  This was also a film that was quite difficult to watch.  Although it is a war film, there were some things that were too far for me to take at first.  At the end of the film, I could not feel

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's funny. It's bizarre. It involves a little girl and a guy in a spaceship with a baby on board. It makes you think of your best childhood dreams, of little green aliens playing with a little boy. It doesn't have the impact of a classic like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (or even something like The Day The Earth Stood Still), but it's a great little movie with a lot of heart, and a lot more to say about childhood dreams than is normally done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have had many a good time watching the new films from the 1980's and there are only a few I can say that I was so sad they went away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a rare treat that a movie from the 50s still looks great in 2017.   When I was a kid the TV was always packed with reruns of movies from the mid 50s like   "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"   The same movies in my home as the one above: .   This is a great movie for kids:  -It's about Rudolph and how he came to be so fat and slow.  -In the end Rudolph got a job at a store and bought a new car.  -His old boss, Santa Claus, found a new suit and Santa Claus was more than pleased with Rudolph's new fat body.  And the music is perfect.  Thanks to a great story and a very good acting cast, this movie is great fun:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago, I went on an all-inclusive vacation to South Africa. There were two kinds of vacations: 1) A "white vacation": This was the one where they take you to the beach, have cocktails, and then, for no apparent reason, they get in a plane and fly off. I would say it was a little overrated, but that's a story for another time. 2) The real thing: This is where I went for the actual vacation. There was a bunch of stuff going on, but I don't remember it all. It had a beach, and there were cars, and some people...and, of course, hippies.   It was a wonderful trip, one I'll never forget. I had a great time with my friends. And, yes, I did have a few drinks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure I'd call this a "good movie". I was very impressed, but I was so bored by the end that I was disappointed in it.   It's like a slow burning fuse: the first thing that happens is a big gunfight; the cops are trying to escape, and a guy has a gun to their heads, and they run away.  Now the story: we see our hero (the hero, not the actor) as he is running through a very large forest; the forest is a place where a lot of strange things happen. Our hero is shot, and is taken to the hospital. The doctors think it's all in the head; we discover that it is in fact a curse. The hero has lost his wife, and now it seems he can only protect his son. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are plenty of bad movies, some terrible, some quite good, but I don't see this movie as a terrible one, at least not yet.   The script is very strong in its plot, and the direction is good.  It's a very entertaining film, the script is so strong, and there are so many surprises, but unfortunately the acting is a bit weak.  This movie is about a war, and while it's not all the worst war film of all time, it's still pretty bad.  I'm looking forward to the sequels.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for good old fashioned romance, and this was a good one. I wish it was on DVD.   The story is about two young women in the early 60s who meet and fall in love at a party on a cold night, and it is great to watch the two of them interact like two real ladies in love, despite the fact that the movie was shot in black and white.  The one scene where it is actually bright is the beginning when the two are watching a film.  It is funny, but not overly so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be a little disappointing.   After all the hype, I was very much looking forward to this film.  It was supposed to be like a cross between the old horror movies from the 1950's and the new ones from the 1980's.  The problem I had with this movie was that it was too simple and was far from being good.  There was no atmosphere in the movie.  You were basically just watching two people trying to find a way out of this house.  I was looking forward a lot for this film, especially the ending.  But instead of making me feel scared and nervous, this movie made me think about how I'd feel if someone tried to kill me, and how there was nothing anyone could do to save me.  This is not a good film to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friend and I went to see this film because we wanted to see what it was like to be a girl in a war zone.   This movie was a good watch, and as you can imagine, I was a bit confused by the ending of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is what happens when you go to an amusement park:  A big, beautiful forested area has been transformed into a giant amusement park. The park has many attractions, but my favorite is the Ferris wheel, a ferris wheel that turns a giant wheel around a hill and a giant slide up a hill. It is fun!    It is a great family film that has a lot of heart.   The film is a little slow at times, but the humor is so funny that it makes up for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a terrific, enjoyable movie.   We are introduced to a man who loves the great outdoors, a woman who is just beginning her adventure, and two kids who get mixed up in all the excitement.  The plot is simple enough: a group of kids stumble upon a hidden cache of weapons (including the old "Karate Kid" karate set) and have to find a way to get the weapons to the proper authorities.  Although the movie has some problems: the plot is a bit rushed at times and the movie's lack of real plot makes the movie hard to follow.  Even the character names are terrible.  It has a great cast of characters.  This movie is a joy to watch.  Recommended for all kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're a fan of horror movies or horror movies with a horror twist then this is the movie for you. You see a very evil and twisted man who loves sex and torture, and his victims are as twisted and as depraved as he is. He's a cannibal and a very sadistic one as well. His motives are pure evil and he will try to kill you any way he can, and he does it in the most horrendous ways. He also does enjoy eating his victims, so you get the full experience of what it's like to have someone eat you alive.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's like a cross between a monster movie and a fantasy adventure with a touch of sci-fi thrown in. This movie is an adventure to a strange new world. If you're a fan of The Black Cauldron and The Hobbit you're gonna be blown away by this movie. The first half is almost identical to The Hobbit and it's amazing. The world building is phenomenal.   The movie takes a darker turn as the heroes fight evil and evil is good and there is no more than one villain. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was completely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.   This is the sort of movie that you watch over and over again, just trying to figure out what's going on.  For those who haven't seen it, you'll have to wait a little bit.  This movie is based on the book "The Great American Hypnotist" by Harold Lief.  The movie is pretty much like it.  I found it very interesting to watch the hypnosis of a woman after the birth of a child, and how she becomes a good mother.  Unfortunately the movie is a bit difficult to follow, and I found that there were several scenes I could not follow because of the changes in pace.  But this was not a bad movie. It's got some good hypnotism to it, and it will make you smile at least once during your watching.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie that's made me smile so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This was my first time watching a movie about a serial killer," I told my wife as I stood outside the local multiplex. We sat in the car for a while watching the movie with her.   It was about an art college that's taken over an old school.  I liked it!   I would never have thought this would ever happen.  The lead was great, as always.  It's not the most disturbing film I've seen, and it's definitely not the scariest, but it's a fun movie and a good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's been a long time since I've been a fan of a film. My favorite genre is horror. Horror film has a special place in my heart because it's so good, it can scare you into death without hurting you or making you feel guilty.   This film isn't like most films that you see, because it wasn't the typical "good and evil" plot. I thought of it as a thriller.  What happened was that a man was having a drink with a female friend when he was shot in the back by a man in a white car.  If you haven't seen the film, I'd warn you that there are many scary moments.  It might be too much for some people to handle, but that's what makes it so enjoyable.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story has some potential but the movie is very rushed in the beginning and the ending is pretty unsatisfying.   It's basically a one-trick-pony: the villain is a very likable villain, and he has a rather sweet story as well.  As far as the characters go, they're pretty likable but the main one doesn't really grow.  The main female character is very different from the other two. She is not a typical damsel in distress, she is very smart, and the reason why the film is so good is the different personalities she has.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is so stupid. I'm sorry but it's a really silly movie.   So why don't they just go to a party at a house of a guy who does a lot of drugs and has a bunch of girls.  This guy does all this drugs and does all the things that are so common in a movie that doesn't even make sense.  I'm kind of shocked that it doesn't happen.  They have to get the girls out of the party so they can make a movie about it?  I don't even know what is happening in this movie. I can't believe that a movie was made about this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I really liked the way the director played around with the camera, and what we see of the town is pretty much what we can expect.   - I also thought that the sound effects were very, very good, especially the way they used a sound effect when the police car drove by and the truck with the ladder appeared.

Well, I didn't expect this movie to scare me, but I think it did. The movie is very creepy and scary, especially when the evil guy shows up.   The whole movie is in black and white.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that is not as bad as it could have been, but that's not saying much. It's not a bad movie, but it isn't a good one either. I would describe this movie as "a big old mess of a movie with no clear focus." There is a lot of character development and a lot about the relationships between the characters is shown. The writing and acting, while somewhat over the top, are not all that bad either. There are some memorable performances. There is one scene where a truck full of cocaine is driving by and a truck is driving down the street and a couple of thugs are trying to stop it and then the truck speeds down the road at a high rate of speed, causing a lot damage to the truck and causing everyone to crash into each other. The guys try to pull their guns on the guy in the truck, but one of the thugs hits a car and the car gets knocked out of the way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know it's a horror movie so that is the best way to describe the movie. What I love about it is that it looks and sounds like a good 80's horror flick. There's a creepy vibe that's so different than the other horror movies I've seen lately. The movie has a strong cast. I was a bit confused when I watched the movie because it was almost like watching an old episode of "Babylon 5" from a few years back. There are definitely a lot of jump scares and a lot more to it than just that. The story is a bit more dark and mysterious than I expected but it was well worth it.

I have to say this is a very good movie. It has a lot of themes and ideas that make you think about the problems of society. The main character, Jack, has a daughter that needs a heart transplant and he does not have the money to pay the bills. The film has an intriguing ending that I think is very interesting and gives us a great feeling about Jack. This is a well made film with a good story that makes you think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a big fan of the classic "The Big Lebowski", this is a great movie to show that it isn't just the classic from which it springs, it's better than ever! If there is anything more to add, it is, as many of you have noticed, that this movie is more like the "Gangster Squad" movies than the "The Dude" movies.   As far as the classic Lebkowsky-penned material goes, it has everything: comedy, action, drama, and the obligatory romance.  This is one of those rare movies that is so perfect it deserves a sequel: one would think that the first time Lebowsky saw the Dude's apartment he would ask him to paint his nails blue, but he instead said that he wanted a picture of the Dude and his friends with a bottle of whiskey in the background.  The only drawback is that it is a little on the long side: it is really the length that makes the movie long, as there are a lot of characterizations (even more than in the classic), some of them a little ridiculous, but it is long enough that it will be interesting for long after the film ends.  It also has a terrific supporting cast, which includes the always fun Dennis Weaver, who makes the Dude look like a walking drunk and who has fun doing it, as well as his wife, a woman who can't even stay with her boyfriend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of how a good story can be a good idea mixed with a good execution of the idea.   The story is simple and the movie is very well made.  The main character and the story do a good job of tying things together and they do it very well.  I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  There are a few problems with the execution of this movie however.  In the end of the movie, the characters all seem to go away.  This leads to a lack of character growth.  It also leads to an interesting movie, but there was really not enough plot development to the story and characters.  One last comment:  I think this movie was released in the early to mid 80's so it is likely that it was made when the story was still very much in the works.  If it was released when the movie was finished then I would give it a 7.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of times it's very easy to be cynical about movies made in Hollywood, especially in the age of The Dark Knight, which is a fairly cynical, even cynical movie.   When I heard about the script I felt like, hey, something could be good in this film.  It doesn't disappoint.  You have a very dark, gritty, violent story about a gang of criminals that takes place in a very unkempt and broken down industrial area.  The people are just as bad, if not worse than the criminals themselves.  However, what makes this movie so great is the fact that it uses the story to explore the social and cultural issues of its time, which isn't something that is very common in films.  These problems are dealt with very well by director John McNaughton, as this story is told through the eyes of an ex-con who is looking to escape from a life of crime.  John McNicholl is an accomplished screenwriter who has written some really interesting films. He doesn't try to jump right into action, but rather builds the characters slowly, allowing them to grow and change.  There are a lot of twists and turns throughout the movie, and even though it can be pretty confusing at times, the story never becomes overly complicated or incomprehensible.  I would recommend this to anyone who has seen The Dark Night, because it has a similar feel to that film, but there are a few differences:  The first half of the movie is much better, and the second half is much worse.  A few years after The Dark night, John McNaghton wrote a short story called "The Devil in my Life."  This short story is set in a post-apocalyptic future, and is about the search for an ancient book known as the Book of the Dead.  Here, McNaughtons uses the idea of a Book of Dead to really focus the story on the social ills of the times.  Some scenes are very dark and gritty, but I found the movie to be a lot more colorful and fun than the short story.  One thing I have to say is that I thought the story could have been longer.  While the movie only goes for about two hours, I think it would have been great if there were a third and fourth act.  Overall, this is an interesting film about the issues of the day, and it is an excellent film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been wanting to see this film since it was first released, and I'm glad I finally did.   From the trailers, it looks like a fun film filled with colorful characters, great performances, and a great sense of humor.  The story is a bit over-the-top, but nothing really gets repetitive or boring.  But then again, it is a comedy, so I guess that doesn't really count for much.  It is funny all the way through, and the humor works in spite of it's ridiculousness.  I could easily see myself watching this all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie.   I like how it's a combination of different genres, and it's really pretty good.  It doesn't rely on any gimmick, it's just a good story about a guy who gets out of prison and lives as a fisherman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an awesome movie. It tells the story of a small town in the mountains of Colorado where a couple (who in this case is a husband and wife) are separated. Both the wife is an alcoholic and the husband is also an alcoholic. The film tells this story of their relationship through interviews with both characters who are pretty much caricatures of the characters that you would see in a 1950's movie.    They are a married couple who live in the mountain cabin that they have bought. It is a pretty simple structure: the husband has a bad temper, the wife wants to talk to her lover and then the husband beats her up.  I enjoyed the humor in this movie and I would like to see more movies like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, and not in a funny way, since the movie was all about the sad things we've all gone through and I think it was a very honest portrayal of how we all felt when something like that happened to us. The story is simple but has a lot of interesting bits to it that I enjoyed. I had a great time watching this movie and it had me laughing, crying and smiling a lot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off: It's a pretty good movie.   I loved it.  I think the director of this movie, Mr. Tomatii, has a wonderful sense of humor.  His movies are very dark and dramatic.  This movie deals with the human condition and we find out why the characters are the way they are.  The main character, Toht, is a very sad character.  He has a great story and his story is beautiful.  It's really sad because of what happens to him at the end of the movie. He can't come to terms with what has happened to him.  But, at the same time, he finds out that he can move on and that he has people who will love him for who he is.  Mr. Takamura has a marvelous performance.  Everyone else, except the two actors in the movie, are all pretty good.  And, finally, I have to say, if you have a friend or love one, you need to see this movie. I think it's good enough to keep your heart beating for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of both sci-fi and horror.   In this movie they take the time to make the atmosphere as real as possible and not a fake or fake-like movie.  I do have a few complaints but I will talk about them later.  This is a great sci-fie, I will see this again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a cross between the Lord of the Rings and a Rocky movie, it has it all in terms of action and excitement. The cast is great and the cinematography is fantastic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie, in which Michael Douglas plays a doctor who develops a new "medical" treatment for a condition that he has seen in his patient.  The thing is that the doctor (Douglas) is not the "hero" of this movie.  He is the villain, the monster that makes the patients suffer (and the people around him suffer).   It is a wonderful, horrifying and beautiful movie. It should be mandatory viewing for anyone with a family.   This is the best movie that Michael Douglas has ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of the movie is actually very complex and I was still surprised how this movie has the capability of being a great adventure movie. I can easily see that the movie was directed by John Waters. I found it very interesting the way this movie is structured. The characters and situations are very colorful and the story is very interesting and interesting. It has the characteristics of a horror movie. It is a scary movie. This movie was also very funny. The movie is very well made and the movie had great performances by the actors. I recommend this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It has an incredible mix of humor, drama, and some decent action. The story is told from the point of view of a young boy in the late 80's who has just watched a movie about the life of an astronaut, Neil Armstrong.   You might expect a child's film to be boring, but boy is this one fun.  While the comedy is usually the most amusing part, the drama is the real highlight, from the emotional father, to the awkward kid who has no idea what he is doing.  In the end, I really enjoyed the story and the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is very good. There are more than 30 good scenes in the movie. There is not much to talk about. There were the great scenes of the movie and there were the funny scenes and then some very good scenes. This movie is definitely a good film. It was not a terrible film. I have seen movies from all around the world and this one was in the top 10 in my list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so good you could put a smile on your face and still not smile.   The whole movie is a simple but sweet story of two girls getting close to each other, it has a lot of humor in it but not too much that it spoils the movie for those who aren't really into the kind of comedy.  This is one of those movies you put on when you want to watch something funny, but not something that makes you have to go to the toilet.  There are some laughs, but nothing that you will laugh about, the music is good and the girl's reactions are believable.  The two of them are very good friends but they are just trying to do something together, it is not that they are interested in each other but that they have some type of attraction to eachother and that they need each other to survive.  I am giving this movie a high rating because I have enjoyed watching it and I think that you should be too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to lie:  This was a long movie, it took me about an hour and a half to finish it.  It is about a man who gets the call that his wife has died.  After a funeral he is put into an ambulance.  He gets to the hospital and is there for a few hours.  As he sits in the hospital a nurse approaches him.  She is an actress and she is acting in the play the hospital is doing.   She asks him what he would like to do.  "What would I like to be?"   In the hospital he gets a letter from a woman who tells him that he looks very much like his late wife.  But she is not his wife. She is his daughter.  This makes him decide to go back to the play and find out what happened to his daughter and to his wife..

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a very good sci-fi film from 1967.   It tells the story of a spaceship crash that kills the crew and leaves the passengers, a human boy and an alien boy, with no way of ever finding a home.  The two children must work together to find a way to repair the spaceship while being pursued by a hostile force.  This film is a great sci-Fi film from the early '60s, it follows the same story and style of a Star Trek episode as seen in TAS, but this time it's told from the point of view of a little boy who's trapped on a spaceship after its crew was killed by a spaceship. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of film noir it has been a long time since I have seen a film that has given me a feeling of nostalgia.   This is a good film, well executed and the setting and characters are excellent.     I don't care what people say about this, this is a film noirs classic, and I would not change a thing about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place a few weeks after a series of mysterious earthquakes which are blamed on "alien" activity.   It opens with a typical "science fiction" style with a woman in a lab coat running on a treadmill and yelling: "There are no aliens!   This woman is actually the character's wife, but is played by a woman named Susan Stryker.  This film is really great.  It's set in a future where the government has created a program to train people for what will be the next phase in mankind's progress.  There is no alien life in this movie, but there are plenty of people in cryogenic stasis, and the story follows a series where a woman is in a relationship with a man who is in stasis.  I can't imagine anything more boring than being in a long term relationship with an android.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't really advance until a girl (the wife of the main character) gets a job with a corporation where her new co-workers are "android" clones.  And then I had to wait for the second half of the movie to actually find out what this android clone is... It's a pretty standard science fiction story, and I didn't find anything particularly exciting about it.  But it's a movie that's worth watching and I recommend it to any sci-fi fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am glad I saw this movie.   There are two reasons for this review: the first is that it was such a big surprise to see it before the year ended.  The second is that the first act, especially the scene of the man in the park, is very well acted, even though the movie can be a bit slow at times.  If you don't like slow movies then this one won't be for you, but if you like slow films then this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was made for the sole purpose of taking a young boy and making him a teenager for 10 years! It is not a kid flick, it is a very mature story which deals with a lot of subjects you may or may not want to address, but there is a lot to it! I thought that it was very original and well told, and it would make a good Christmas movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I think of a good science fiction film, I think Starship Troopers.   It's basically a satire of the military-industrial complex, but without the ridiculousness of Starship Trooper.   If you're in the mood for a good satire, try out Starship Troops. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of people are talking about how great this movie is, and it is! It has a real "horror" feel to it. The acting is good. I love the way the characters seem real, like they are living in this horror movie they are watching! The story has some good things going for it. I can't say how scary the movie is because I was really creeped out!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie.    The story is simple and not overly complicated, so kids and parents alike will find it funny, cute, and heartwarming.  In my opinion, the most important theme in this movie is kindness.  The main character has no idea what he is, he's a little kid, and his family has no ideas about what he could possibly be.  They try to do whatever they can to help him, but in the end they fail and they don't even know why.  I think that this movie has a lot of heart and hope that will last a lifetime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really surprised that this movie was actually released. I guess they didn't want the movie to be just a dumb movie.   This movie is definitely an action movie but not much in the way of comedy. There is a lot of action in this movie but it is really slow paced and doesn't really get going until about 30 minutes in.  This is a very good action movie. It has all the necessary ingredients. It is a good mix of comedy and action. I'm not a big fan of the action but there is so much to like about this movie. A good movie, but I don't think it's that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to write a review of a new movie that is coming out in theatres soon:  'Ender's Game'.  It is directed by Gavin Hood and starring Asa Butterfield, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Viola Davis.  It focuses on a group of teenagers who are part of an elite military force known as the Gernsback family.   The story takes place on a planet called earth and the teens are sent to Earth to fight in a futuristic war between Earth's military and alien race the Chulak.  After a few days of training and the training of the others the team is attacked by the alien race.  Unfortunately for the Gents there are too many of them, and they have a few too many tricks up their sleeves to handle.  The alien race takes them to a hidden cave and have the humans captured.    They have the Gens attacked by something very large and a giant snake emerges out of it and they are killed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a well made film, and is not a bad one either. It will get a lot of praise from those who know how to find a good film, but for those who have no idea what it is about, it is a fine movie, but not of the same calibur as his other movies, this being a film which has a strong plot, well written characters, a good script and some good acting by both the lead and a supporting cast, it still has the occasional flaws, which is to be expected from a film in the 90's.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie about the plight of a man with a stutter.   The stutter is in the lead character but the character is not what makes this movie so good.  It is the story.  The movie tells of a stutterer and his struggle to find a job.  He is a very sympathetic character but I was also touched by his love for his wife.  There is much to like about this movie.  One of the best examples of stuttering. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no real interest in a live action film from the 1970's about an animal control officer, a cop, and a cute little kitten who has all the charm of a chocolate box.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I should say that I loved the first movie because it really did feel like I was walking through the desert. It wasn't exactly that kind of desert. I think it was more of a desert of the mind, like being at a mental hospital. But still, it felt like I had gone on a long walk through the deserts of the world, from the deserts I was born in, to the deserts on the moon. I loved how much I felt like a real person and not like a piece of art on a canvas. I was there and I wasn't the subject of an experiment or anything.   The first movie wasn't really much of a movie; it was a story, but a pretty one. This second movie has become almost like a movie, but with a more surreal twist.  I liked it a lot better than the first one.  In fact, the second one was better than my first movie. It was a nice change of pace, but still felt like just a story.  It was an interesting movie in some ways. I liked that it showed that sometimes, things don't always go according to plan. Sometimes the people are there for the right reasons, sometimes they are there not for the best reasons.  At the same time, I liked how the movie dealt with the themes of the desert, but I think that it wasn't all that good.  So, it was an okay movie, and I thought I should at least give it a shot.  This movie is now one of my favorites. I don't think I could enjoy anything that much better.  If this movie had been made in a few years ago, I would have liked it much more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is so funny and so ridiculous, and it's just so funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a big fat slice of life with no suspense.   All the major characters, including the mother of the protagonist, are shown in a very shallow way.  A family of three is shown in the beginning of the movie. The husband is on the phone when the kids are in bed and the mother has her arm around the son's neck.  The mother goes on and on about how she didn't know it was wrong to go to sleep with the children but the next thing we see is her running away from the husband who is yelling and screaming.  You know the rest.  It is a bit of an easy film to watch but it is good to see the mother and the kids in action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this a few weeks ago and I was surprised to find that the movie had not aged badly.   In my opinion it is an amazing film.  It has a classic feel about it, with a little too much of a retro feeling, but then a great twist at the end, with the big boss getting caught in a bit of a trap, so that he has to save the day by himself...   It is also a bit silly, with some gags, but overall I would rate it higher than The Godfather.   Overall it is a great film that you should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm glad I went to see "Wag the Dog" (with its original opening credit sequence) as an impressionable kid. In the movie, a young lady has a vision of a wolf-like creature chasing a dog and then biting it. The dog gets away and then runs through a field full of sheep. A group of boys come over to investigate, but the wolf is still there. The boy who was bitten comes running back and the dog jumps into his arms and licks him. When the boy and the wolf come across the wolf's body, they leave it in the field and run back to the girl's house to tell her. The next morning, the dog has a tooth knocked out of it, and the boy asks for her to help with it. She asks him to wait until she gets to her house, but he won't stay out there, so she comes back with a broom and clears the field. They go into the house and there is a pile of things out on the floor. The girl takes out the wolf and takes him to the garage. She puts a blanket on him and ties a collar around his neck. When she goes to work, she notices a bunch of feathers on the garage floor and a pair of wings on the door. She goes to the front door and it's open. She climbs inside and shuts the door behind her. She takes out a camera and starts to take pictures, but she gets stuck in the front window, so the dog comes in and bites her. They leave the dog, but then the girl gets the phone number of a farm where the wolf was caught and they drive off.   The movie was probably made about a year after the first sighting of the wolf, and it shows a little bit of the original sighting. As with other sighting movies, there are a few things that aren't in the original description, such as a group of children and the man who was seen with them.  The Wolf is the only non-animal character to appear, and there isn't a lot of action, but it's an entertaining movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie and recommend it. It is very funny and at times hilarious. I can imagine that it was the same for Mel Brooks. I like the fact that he made a movie about a fat girl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I really love this movie.   While the film itself is a really good film, it does a lot of things poorly.  It's a typical western, but it doesn't really work because there isn't much that can be said about that.  I don't see why it isn't more popular because it has a decent script, a decent story, and a decent cast of characters.  In other words, it's a well-made movie, but there are flaws, like it's pretty much a bad western.  But if you like good westerns, you'll like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a classic, but not the only one.   The classic films by the classic directors are the movies that you go back to and rewatch.  The film does have its own merits, especially for the people who like the director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie.   A must see!   The story was a great combination of the horror and sci-fi genres.  This movie really went with the times, and the idea of a group of scientists who find a way to make everyone live forever and then to put a bomb into an alien craft.  They are then trapped in a cave that looks just like the one on the beach at the end of the film.  I am really glad that they found a way around the time travel problem.  A bit strange at times, but I still loved it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is about a guy that lost his arm in a freak accident. He then found a lady with the same accident and he becomes her love interest.

It takes a long time for it to start, but that doesn't matter, because once it does you'll wish you had a few more seconds to enjoy it!    I would recommend this movie to everyone and I am so glad that it got a sequel!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie about the Vietnam War. It is interesting, dramatic, and a little disturbing, which I liked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I said in the trailer, this is a funny, weird, and very charming movie.   I don't think I can think of a single movie where I have found myself laughing so hard during a movie. So many jokes hit on the absurd but then the humor is so clever that it still manages to be humorous. I found myself on the edge of my seat the entire movie. There is also some cleverly placed slapstick comedy that is a welcome addition to the already strong comedic aspect of the film.  This movie really makes me want to take a long shower. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie. It was well put together. I loved the ending and I found it to be a nice change of pace from the usual action sequences.   It's hard to get a good review about this movie without having to make fun of it.  The film is about a mercenary group called the Ghost Riders and their battles with the baddies of the world.  When the bad guys try to kidnap a princess and kill her father (the main bad guy), Ghost Riders show up and drive the bad guy and his thugs to the wall.  However, a problem arises when a new Ghost Rider shows up and he's a guy named Danny.  Danny has an ability to turn into a giant lizard.  He also turns into a truck and he destroys a town.  It seems like a fun movie until it turns into an action movie.  We get all these crazy scenes where Ghost Riders fight monsters, go on horseback, and do other crazy things.  This is a typical action movie with a lot of action and I would have much rather seen it with a different plot and more comedy.  But overall, this is a fun, good movie with some great action sequences and a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had not really thought about the whole zombie thing until now. I did not know that this was a film that was shot in Australia back in the 80s. There is a bit of blood and gore. It's not as scary as it seems. I hope that we do get a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the movie "The Wizard of Oz" in a while so I thought I'd give it a try. I was expecting some low budget horror movie but instead was given a movie that is a very interesting movie. The story is told from the viewpoint of Dorothy and how she is the reason the tornado comes to Kansas. She doesn't think of it as a tornado. She sees it as something different. Also there are some things about the movie that made me really want to see it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so glad I saw this movie. It was the movie that turned me onto fantasy movies in general.   There was a scene early on where this girl and the guy were in a cave. There were bats flying around the cave and then this thing pops up out of the cave.  He talks about how he was raised by wolves and how he killed them all.  The whole movie was like that.      He was pretty cool.  It was also very dark.  There were lots of bad guys, but they did bad things in a kind way.  That was fun to watch.  But there was a guy who looked a lot like Robin Williams.  I don't know why this was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a very good retelling of the story of the famous novel "The Man Who Was Thursday" about a former World War I pilot, now retired from the armed forces, who is given a chance to travel the world. The author of the book, Oscar Wilde, and the film's screenwriter, Anthony Minghella, do a great job at capturing Wilde's style and style of speech.   (If the film had a better cast, it might have been a masterpiece)   This is a movie where Wilde is just one of many characters and he appears again and again and yet again.  He was one of the most popular and powerful figures in the literature of his day and yet he is portrayed as just another well meaning person in a world filled with very different characters.  I liked the ending as the movie is a bit over the top and there was a lot of tension but it does provide the movie with a kind of a happy ending.  This movie is definitely worth seeing but it is not a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The premise is simple: a boy named John (Kirk Wise) is the only one of his group of friends who can see ghosts, and he uses a special device (a specter stick) to help him deal with his fears.   In order to use the device to communicate with the ghosts he must enter a special room in his apartment and take the device away from his mother.  This is where the story picks up:  A local movie studio has a special guest in town who wants John's mother to make a special movie.  Her name is Mary (Linda Hamilton), and her husband is Henry (Walter Winchell).  This would be a nice movie, if John could be convinced to do it, and if there was a decent screenplay.  The story is very basic: John is being pressured to go into the movie studio by Mary, who wants to meet with a movie producer named Ed (Frank Lloyd).  Henry wants John to do something for Mary, and Ed tells John to find Mary the most beautiful woman he knows, and take her to the movie production.  It's a good basic premise, and it's interesting, but there's not a lot of story here.  John finds the woman at the studio, but the movie doesn't get made.  A few months later, John and Mary are back in New York.  But John can't forget the woman who helped him.  So John and the woman get married, and Mary goes back to the studio to film a new movie.    I think this is an enjoyable enough movie to have watched, but it suffers from a basic plot.  I'm not really surprised that it didn't get produced, but I wish that it had been.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of all times, this is a film made in Germany but with a twist.   This is the second film of this director, and in the first one he was making a comedy that was very funny (the whole film). In the second one, he started to make a comedy again and a very sad film (for all this time he was very calm and collected about this). This is an excellent movie to watch when you are very tired (which is pretty much all the time) or at work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a classic that is so good it's impossible to watch it, so great it's unbelievable, so weird and hilarious and beautiful it's mind-blowing, so touching it's heart breaking. It's a movie where your heart goes out to all the people who were there at the beginning, it's the only movie you'll ever see that is about two old men trying to build a house, it tells the story of how a young couple, a couple that is the perfect match for each other, decide to sell their house and go off in the woods to do their own thing. It tells the true story of their first and only attempt at starting a new life together, how they tried to start a farm, and how they had a big problem with the bank that prevented them from starting up the farm, how the neighbors started to look out for them, how their old house was destroyed and how a new house came along after a huge change in their situation.    It's so beautiful in so many different ways and at a time when most of the big movie stars were off doing big movies, this film became a true classic, it was the perfect movie for everyone, for teenagers, for men and for women. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching a movie with a couple of friends and I noticed that it was about a man that became a monster because of a woman. I didn't care.   After some more scenes of sex, blood and a bit of torture I realized that it wasn't a horror movie.  It had more humor and more humor was added to it by a couple more people than I usually see in horror movies. I would recommend this movie for its humor, it was pretty good.

It didn't make me laugh as much as I was expecting it to, but it wasn't bad, it was just very sweet and a little sad.   This movie would be very good for a kid's birthday or a holiday. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this one much more than the first, which wasn't very good in the first place. Now it's pretty much a remake of the first movie with some added scenes. It's a movie that's very, very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, but not very good.   It's not a bad movie, it's a good, short movie.  It starts off with a short monologue from the young man, "Why I got into acting?"   The next few scenes (which, again, are short) are interesting.  For instance, at a restaurant, an older woman says "When a good woman is on your side," "And you're with me."  And then, in the kitchen, the young male is talking to his wife (who is not yet aware of the young, beautiful woman, in his kitchen). The young male tells the woman, "You're beautiful, but don't you know it?"  After the conversation, the woman looks up to him, looks at him, and says, "I'm a good wife."   Well, the female character in this movie is the best I've seen in years.  She is the epitome of a good girl.  I had to rewind my tape to watch this movie over and over.  My friend's brother was at a bar, and there was a girl at a table who seemed to him to be a good looking girl. He told his friend, "My friend told me that the girl at the table is a good-looking girl." He was amazed at his friend's judgment.  The young female, in this short film, is the picture of a girl who is an object. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie with excellent performances from both leads. The pacing was spot on, the story was interesting, and the plot was well-paced and had several surprises for us all. The ending was unexpected, but at the same time, a perfect ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love horror movies. I love them so much that I can see a good one being made almost every other year. That is what scares me about this movie. The writing is bad, the acting is bad. The cinematography is bad and the effects are bad. It is just bad. I cannot stand the "mature" and "serious" parts of this movie (I mean it is not bad in the least, but I still have to complain) and the "torture" parts. I would like to see some good gore and the best special effects ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really did enjoy this movie.   It was a short but very effective story.  It is just like the story of a young boy and a big tree.  There was a very nice use of music during the scenes of the boy being chased by the tree. The music was very well done.  The only problem was the length of the movie. It only covered about a third of the actual events.  I hope that there is more like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie I saw last weekend was a great movie in every sense of the word: fun and exciting, with great performances and lots of cool special effects. I had never seen a film with "Stinger" on the title before, and I think it's probably the first film where you hear the voice of a cartoon (and in the original version of the movie, the voice is a guy in a cartoon suit) who has a great laugh and says a lot of the funniest lines.   It's a fun movie and you'll probably like it.

I saw it the day it came out and I'm not ashamed to say that it scared me!   I was afraid that I was going to have a headache, I was scared to death. It was a very silly movie with a silly ending.   But it was funny and stupid and funny! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a perfect example of the perfect action film. The entire film is intense, suspenseful and a thrill to watch.

This is a must watch for anyone who wants a great action film for the screen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So... I'm a little late to reviewing this movie, but boy am I glad that I watched it now!   The movie follows three teenagers. One of them is in a gang, another is a friend of his, and a third one is an undercover cop who is really trying to change his bad habits.   Well, the kids, with the exception of one of them, is the best part of the movie.  They all have good chemistry. I thought the gang was the best in the movie because they were the most likable and enjoyable.  The detective is a good guy in a good part. He is trying to do his job to the best of his abilities, so he can be a good person and not a bad person.  It was a good way to watch a good film with a good cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this film, although a bit on the long side, it's certainly a fun movie.  It's a bit silly, the humor is not really that subtle or subtle at all, but it's funny.  I found a lot of humor in the film, the acting was good, and the animation was good too.    The story was a little more interesting than the previous films, and while it doesn't quite follow the basic plot, I can't say I disliked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I have to admit that I don't have a particular taste for the paranormal movies and I don t know how to describe this one. There are no supernatural elements, no ghosts or other apparitions; the ghosts in this film are more like ghosts in a storybook. The plot is simple: an unknown family leaves for vacation in the countryside where they are attacked by an unknown entity. Although there are many jump scares (sometimes literally), I don 't think that this movie was designed to scare anyone. If anything, the film is a cute story about a girl and a mysterious entity. It is one of the many films that I watch while driving down the road with a cold beer and some chips in a cup.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I'm a big fan of horror films.   There's a special place in my heart for those movies that manage to scare the shit out of me every time.  And so I watched this film.  I found it to be a pretty good flick.  It starts with some pretty good acting.  The setting isn't that scary, but the story isn't bad either.  There are good acting performances and some good scares.  So why the negative?  I feel like I could have done more with the story.  A girl, who is being held prisoner in a cave has to find a way to get out.  She learns a few spells that get her out and we start to understand who she is.  But there's no way out.    The reason I can't give this movie an A+++ is the acting.   There were some really good acting here.   I have a feeling that this movie could have been great if they had cast real good actors.  This movie doesn't have much action but there's enough here to get your attention. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is the fifth installment in a series of bad movies that have made the box office stink for years. They don't deserve to be on a list like this, they don't even deserve to have a reputation. They are just a collection of badness and stupidity, so bad that nobody would take their movies seriously.   You can find bad films like this in every genre, but they are all terrible.  To paraphrase a song, "We're going down the road that no one ever goes down."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is not a bad movie at all. It's a good, albeit simple, adventure comedy that should keep you entertained, even while you think about all of the possibilities.   It's so much fun to watch a cast of weird and funny characters in a ridiculous situation, but they don't forget their goofy charms during the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off with some typical cliche bad guy bad guy plot that we all can easily remember, but soon the movie turns on its head when one of the characters gets hit on by a mysterious old woman (the movie is about 70% bad guy, the movie also shows us the "bad guy" side a lot more) and she then brings him to her secret "resort" which is a tiny beachfront cabin. The movie then goes a bit different from the usual. The bad guy in this movie is a rather intelligent, rather beautiful (but not too beautiful) old woman who has a special talent (she's good at making art out of dirt, which she then sells to a lot of rich old people) and also is a very powerful "villain". The movie is based on a series of "novels" that were written by a German writer called Dr. Heinrich Harrer (who was arrested and executed by the Nazis for writing a few good stories) and were about the lives of a young painter who goes to a fancy resort on a summer vacation, meets a beautiful young girl and falls in love, becomes a wealthy old man and is even able to do things like fly. One thing that makes this movie special is the ending where the bad guy kills the good guy with a blow to the head (the old woman has a "lucky punch" which means that she will see her death coming) but then she "resurrects" the old man, so he can kill the bad guys. This movie has a lot in common with the famous German movie "Die Unbekannte Süd" about a young, handsome doctor and a young girl. One of the things that make this movie interesting is the twist ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is funny. It is fun. It's about a girl who wants to be a model, but her mom and sister think she can't. And then she runs away to the desert with her boyfriend, and her parents finally come around to thinking she's a nice girl.   But it's not about the desert, or the guy or even the girlfriend. It was actually a great movie about a kid with an unrealistic dream, and how she gets caught up in reality.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is a movie that you must see!   For starters, the movie is called 'I Love Lucy' and it is made into a very good film by the great Harold Ramis.   The movie is an adaptation of the movie that was made by Desi Arnaz in 1956.  The film that is made in the movie was very good and it was made on the same movie that 'Desi Arnas' made a couple of years ago.  I have watched a couple clips of this movie and I really liked it.  It was a good comedy.  There is also the character of Lucy Ricardo who is really funny in this movie.  For those who don't know, the character who is the main character is 'Lucy Ricardo'.  It is interesting to know that this character is so different from other people in the world of movies and it shows the fact that she is a true star!

I don't even have a lot of favorite movies (I usually just put down all my favorites) and they usually don't have much to do with anything. I was happy to see this one though.   First off, this movie does a good job of telling the story and the pacing is perfect, and the actors all do well in their roles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure everyone who reads this review will agree that   The movie   is   a   good   movie.   If   you haven't seen   it yet   don't get me wrong.  They haven't made any improvements in this film that would have made this a  good movie. However,   if   that's what you came here for then   come out and see it.  The movie  doesn't feel like a movie that has been made recently.  The film  is the very first ever film to feature the main character,  John M. Roddenberry.  It was also the very last film  to feature   Star Trek   on TV.  Yes,  this is  Star Trek on film.  This film is also the final film to see   the original cast  of Star Trek: The Original Series.  With this film  Roddedberry created the   Star Wars   film series and created   Battlestar Galactica   the television series.  But,  I  haven't read these two series but they could have easily been part of this movie. It has so much more to do than just feature the original Star Trek cast and I found it interesting to see Rodderberry's ideas for  Star Wars:  a "solar system of war"     Roodenberry's Star Wars didn't come out until years after this movie and the movie is set some time before the movie was.  Roddy looks like he stepped straight out of Star Wars.  I found the story interesting.  There are times when it was hard to understand exactly what was happening.  At one point Roddie's ship is attacked by some sort of creature.  When it is over the creature is dead and so is Rodd.    While it would be easy to say this is because the ship is not strong enough it is also possible to think that the creature didn't like Rodd's ship.  In the first third of the movie Rodd and his crew do not return home after their mission.  We get a chance to see the ship with its new occupants and are shown that it is a good ship.   Rodd is also on the run from the authorities.  As for the alien, it seems to be a kind of  "virus" and it is attacking the crew.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at a friend's house this past weekend (October 25th) and there was a group of about five of us at her place and it was a good time for me. I was really impressed with the casting choice and the acting choice. It's interesting to watch the actors react to the situation.   In a way it is reminiscent of the '70s action/crime films that were so popular and played on the idea of a man and his sidekick who are just trying to get out of a crime scene after a shootout.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent, well-produced crime thriller with some great characterizations and an intriguing plot.   I liked how the story seemed to revolve around the characters having a little trouble with their mother, and the mystery behind her murder being more and more difficult to solve.  This is one of those movies you watch over and over again, with each viewing providing a fresh new clue. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this as a preview for a film that I had seen in the 1970's. When I saw it again about two decades later it had changed quite a bit, and a lot of it had to do with some brilliant direction by Martin Scorcese.   The original is basically a murder mystery that starts out like any other.  There is the obligatory scene where a bunch of guys walk into a movie theater to see a murder being committed.  The film is a classic that was created to give back to the critics of the time after the great success of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.  You are meant to think, "What a piece of crap."  It is full of the type of stupid stuff that people say about movies that are about nothing at all.  After about the 20th time you start to wonder why you are even watching this movie.  If you can't laugh at the stupidity and awfulness of these things, you aren't a moviegoer.  One of the reasons this is so funny is that it is a thriller so you are expected to laugh at it.  But most of the things happen so fast you don't have a chance to get a laugh.  It isn't like it doesn't make sense, though, which is what I like about the original.  I suppose this could be a great movie for some people.  However, even if it didn't make you laugh, it wouldn't be a bad movie to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the first films that had the power to make me fall in love with the genre.   A wonderful little romance between an aristocratic English woman, her beautiful, but very stupid, lover, and a noble, but rather simple-minded, Italian peasant.  I never thought that I could be that impressed with a silly love story.  But I was, and in fact it was the first time I watched a film about love between equals, without the usual silly romantic subplots.  What really made me fall for the story was not the romantic subplot, but how the couple went about their daily routine.  They never made a secret of it, or any attempt to mask it; they were simply real and they did not try to hide it.  It was a beautiful film to watch.  This is one of those films which is worth seeing on film as well as on the screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite films of all time.   In the world of television, when they call you a 'jock' or a 'nerd' they mean that you've taken a course at one of the many universities which are located throughout the city.  The only thing is that the university is called  The   New College.  What this means is that in one of their buildings is the old college which was demolished and is now a museum.  It was this school which gave rise to the most infamous case in the history of television and the rise of 'The Simpsons'.  The New College is in the business of 'educating' its students with a strict dress code and a sense of humour so strict that all the girls have to wear hats.  Students there are called  Nerds who do not know any different.  There are only three men in the school and two of them are in the film 'The New College' who are known as The Professor and The Professor's Professor.  They are the only ones of those three who know of the real nature of television.  I would like to say that 'The Professor' is the most important character in the whole of the film but the Professor is one of those who doesn't really give a damn what other people think about him.  He only cares about what is on the screen. The Professor is not the only person who is not too bright.  In fact he is so bright that he can not see that the rest of the boys who are supposed to be his friends don't see the truth in his statements.  One day one of his students Mr Bumble is brought to the New College by his parents who, of course, want him to study at the college.  This is the last straw for The Professor.   The Professor wants to destroy this guy who is now his assistant, Mr Bumbles, but the headmaster, Professor Quimby, sees an opportunity and sets up a contest where Mr Bums will get to do an acting class with the Professor. This is to show that his students are not too stupid to do well in a class.  Mr Bumphs takes this class but the professor is not happy and he tries to get Mr Bumps into trouble.    As he goes about his business The Professor comes across Mr Bumbs and Mr Bumbles who are his students and they're trying to help Mr Bump.  At the beginning of the class

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all good movies this one has to do with an old lady who was killed by a drunk driver and the driver was sentenced to death.   She had been sick, and at that time no one paid her any attention so when her heart stopped she passed away.  She wasn't even drunk; in fact her body had been too stiff for long periods and she had only been driving long enough to make a few turns before passing away.    Her daughter, a nurse, was devastated by this tragedy, she was the last person to see her alive and this film shows how close to the edge she had fallen, and her daughter is haunted by that experience.  It is also shown how the life of a nurse is very hard, but not impossible, the only reason she survived is because her daughter had saved her life once.  What I liked about the movie is that it was very funny, and so was the story.  I think that it is a good idea for a movie about a real life tragedy to be made by a young person who can relate to it.  This movie has a few flaws, but I like it, and I like that it does not rely on its sensational plot to draw people into it, it is more about the old lady and the story of how she died.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a lot of trouble watching this, as I had to be in my own home during the movie. I watched the movie in a theater, because I live in a suburb. While this movie could be seen through a movie theater window, it was much better through a window in my home, where I was able to see what I saw clearly.   The story is about a man who has taken a job to work as a janitor in an elementary school. He is the first to discover that the building is on fire and is forced to leave the school. Later in the movie he realizes that he will be working to clean up a large amount of blood and he discovers that the janitor who is responsible for all the blood is not the real janitor at all but is in fact the killer himself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So let me get this straight.   It's a classic: a guy gets so fed up with the world that he becomes a superhero.  What a ridiculous idea that was.  But the concept of that comic book character, the whole idea of the title character becoming a superhero, is exactly the right one.  It is a great, funny, fast-paced, exciting comic book adventure.  Not for the faint of heart.  No.  That's not a good way to describe this movie, because the first half of it is ridiculous and the second half is so far beyond ridiculous and it doesn't stop.  The first half is a joke.  This is a really bad, very bad movie that doesn't get any better in the second and third quarters.  You are supposed to laugh so hard by the time the main hero starts his big fight with the supervillain that he literally throws up the way he does after they do the battle.  In fact, the first quarter of this movie is so bad, it's a wonder it gets more than a half of a second in the film.  And it doesn' t get better.  I'll even put it this way:  This movie is as close to worthless as you are going to get, probably.  All this movie has going for it is an almost perfectly bad premise, a good cast (though maybe some of them are just here for the money), a couple good comic book movies to compare it to, and a great lead.  So it really should have ended at the end of the second quarter.  A quick review of the rest of the movie:     1.  There are a lot of times where the director is just not very good.  When one character is not even there, he can't keep his own character straight.    2.  One of the greatest comic book movie villain ever created.   3.  As good as most of the comics he is from.   4.  He's just a good guy who got super powers.  5.  Good guy who is supposed to be a superhero and ends up being a complete loser.  6.  His costume is supposed be black and blue and not yellow and green.  7.  Maybe a little bit different, but still the same stupid costume.  8.  Really bad CGI and very bad acting.  9.  Even worse character design.   10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a couple times. The first time, I found the acting, direction, and directionless humor to be fun. I wasn't very familiar with the movie, but I liked it!   After that, I came back for the sequel, and I found this movie to be even more fun.   And the third time, not only am I not bored but I'm so happy!  This is a great comedy movie with a terrific cast of characters. The writing is very clever and clever and the jokes are often very clever. I don't think that the characters and the movie are quite the same as in the first two movies but I still laugh out loud a lot.  It's a really good movie!

He's always going to go to the club with the women, it's just a matter of when. If it wasn't for the stupid cops and the "cool" guy that keeps coming back and not getting the girl, this movie could have been so much more.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie so much because of it's clever writing and the wonderful acting!   We have a bunch of people at a bar in a small town, and a few of them, a good deal of the time, are talking about their jobs.   It's kind of a cliche in some ways, but they don't seem to mind.  They are just having a good time.  Then this one man comes in and makes all the people smile.  He's tall and lanky, looks like a college freshman, and has a kind of infectious smile. He gets the girls all hot and bothered.  But we also have a guy in the bar, who makes everyone else laugh, and when he's done, everyone has left the bar.  This is how they're spending their time.     So, the two guys are playing cards while drinking and talking about all the good times they've had in their lives.  It starts to rain, and we see the guy with the umbrella standing outside the bar while the other man is sitting inside.  We are shown the other guy's apartment, in the same neighborhood as our two main characters.  As the rain continues, we see him get wet.  So we see all of them taking turns getting wet. The girls, I'm sure you can guess, are the best at it.  The guys keep getting wet and laughing at the girls.  That's what they're doing when we're watching this movie.  If you liked that movie, you'll love this one.  For those of you who like movies where they go to a bar, and drink, and smile.   This movie is well worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! A few small bits were bad, but it is still pretty good. The movie is about a man who is searching for a woman who he left 10 years ago. He goes to an old cabin that she built and finds her dead. A woman named Jane is at the bottom of a well in the middle of nowhere. She is crying. The man takes her down the well and brings her back to the cabin. She does not know that the man she left 10 year's ago is her brother. It is a long story, but the plot is great! I hope you guys love it too!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the new X-Men movies and this is no exception. I don't know what it is about this movie, but I'm always happy when I see it.   "Witch Hunt" is a fantastic X-men movie that has a unique feel to it that is reminiscent of the old 1980's X-movies. "Witch Hunter" is also a film with strong performances by all the actors who make this movie stand out from the crowd. The original cast is all back for this film, which is very welcome news for fans of the comics and even more so for those of us who like the comics, but haven't seen a single movie featuring the original X-titles. The movie is also pretty good, even though I wish there were a few more special effects in the movie that would have made it that much better.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is like some kind of modern version of the fairy tale: the hero and heroine are trapped in a cottage while the evil queen and the three wicked witch doctors (the most evil witches ever!) try to steal the precious and magical potion. In the meantime, a mysterious stranger, named the Little Man, arrives. He is a simple and simpleminded little fellow. He can make things happen, but he needs help to do it. The Little Man is a character who knows how to make the right decisions: he knows how bad things can get. So he takes the two young girls and himself to a faraway land called the Land of Untold Stories. He takes them along on a journey that could only happen in the Land, where the only people that seem to be in any danger are the evil witch doctors who try to rob them of their childhood memories.   He learns that the two girls are not really lost at all.  The characters in this film are very well-developed and I really enjoyed watching them all unfold.  There are quite a few good and funny lines in this movie.  I found myself laughing a lot.  My main issue with this movie is that, in order to get the heroine and the hero to help each other, they are often required to go through a series of bizarre and confusing situations. This doesn't make it any easier for the hero or the heroine to make their way through their difficulties, but it can make it feel a bit confusing to watch as the heroes can sometimes be missing or confused.  Overall, this is a very entertaining little film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is very good, and very short.   As mentioned above, the movie is about an American teenager who lives in Germany.  This kid doesn't like German cars very much.  He wants a German car, but he doesn't know how to work on a car, and doesn't want to get killed in a car wreck.  So he sets up a bunch of German friends who want to drive him to Germany, so they can take him to the car show and show off what a good German they are.  They don't get there, so one of them decides to drive the car, thinking it will be faster, and gets into a big accident.  In the accident, one of the German boys gets killed.  The guy in the front seat is so ashamed of how he got into the accident and for being a bad driver, he is ashamed of himself.  When the other boys take him home, he tries to kill himself. His mom tells him he can't. He is so depressed, and depressed the movie ends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really amazed how good this movie is.   It is about a young woman and her boyfriend who both fall for a girl they meet, a good looking woman who lives with her grandmother.  The older woman tells the young woman that she is married to a boy she met in a bar, and that the couple are having a child.  They break up, and later they have a fight and break up again.  At the beginning of the movie, it was impossible to look away from the pretty girl with the bright red hair.  Then, at the end, when she tells the boy she's married to him, you cannot help but admire her.  It's such a good story and the girls look so sweet.  I was also impressed by how well the director, Ronny Yuen, could capture such a lovely looking actress in the middle of all the action and turmoil of the film.  After it all, the movie is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie opens with a voice over saying that a mysterious man is going to kill everyone in a remote part of the United States. The man is a cross between Clint Eastwood, Rambo, and Bruce Willis, all while smoking a cigarette and wearing a trench coat and a gun belt.   As we follow this man, we get a glimpse of a young girl getting abducted by him while sitting on a swing in the woods.  A few moments later, we see the girl riding in a motorcycle down the road, with two men in a truck following her. The movie then moves to the police station, where we see a woman being interviewed by a detective, who also seems a little familiar. We then get a little more of the girl, as she walks through the station, talking about a man who has been harassing her for a long time.  The girl is then told to go to the garage, where she finds the mysterious man (Eastwood).  The police then break in and find the man, who is talking about killing the police. They then chase him, with a gun drawn.  Next, we go to a small town in the Midwest where the girl and the man meet.  There are some small scenes with the man and a couple of people in the bar, but no real action is seen.  Finally, we head to another small town where the man kills some people.  After the killing, he is approached by a police officer and is shot in the head.  When the police arrive at the scene, they are shot at, but the man is still alive.  So, in order to get this "mysterious man" who is threatening everyone, they will need a gun to shoot him, and the girl has a gun.  Then, it goes to a cabin that is being haunted, which then leads to the main plot.  This movie is a pretty good one, with good acting and a creepy story, but doesn't have much that's really special. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was raised to believe that people who have been in a relationship are supposed to be happy together and not just the happy couple who have found each other. I'm a big fan of romantic comedies but this is definitely an exception.    It is an interesting study of the relationship between two people that, while certainly not perfect, are nevertheless capable of being happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie.   The movie seems to be trying to be a good story about a boy who is raised by a couple that don't think much of him (that is how the boy thinks about his life) but is so happy to have a real home and a loving family to care for.  He seems to go from bad to worse, with a bit of luck, a lot of hard work and a bit more luck he has a family and a house to return to.  This is the only time in his life where he is really happy.  After a bad boy has to deal with a bad family, the boy tries to make the family like the good ones, and then finds out the hard way that people can have both bad and good sides to them.  There are a lot more good things in the movie, but this is the movie that stands out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen all the Star Wars movies, all of them were great in their own right.   This movie had more of a Star Wars feel to it than the other three films I have watched.  I like the sound of the explosions, that is a bit hard to pull off, but it was good nonetheless.  This is definitely a Star Trek/Star Wars hybrid.  The crew of the Enterprise   have to work together for the best of intentions, but they also have some problems that they need to work out before they can get off of their ship to go back home.  It does feel a bit like a Star Fox movie.  There are some really fun action sequences as well.  Star Trek   is very well done, and they give you a good reason to watch all six movies.

And I liked how the characters are actually like real people.  It had the right mix of humour and heart.  I would like to see this movie again.  There are many, many movies in the world like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm still in disbelief about all of the crazy things that happened last week. The scene with "Crazy Bill" on top of the "Dime," the craziest thing I've seen in a long time, and then "the man in black" (that guy that has a head like a bowl of candy corn) shows up in the next scene.   The only real reason to watch this is to see the guy who does all the things in this film: He walks in the doorway of an apartment building. He looks at the girl who is walking out the door of her apartment building and walks into her building. This is a guy that does things that are not done in the movies.

There is one man who lives in a small apartment who is very tired of the life and just wants to go back to the real world.   He has a wife, but only she knows he is living there.  He wants her to move back with him.  She refuses to move.  The only way they can stay together is if they drink too much and have sex.  This is just the beginning.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original trilogy had some flaws in the narrative but in the end it worked.   This sequel is better, better, even better.  It is much better than the first and better than any other movie in the franchise.  I've never seen the original trilogy.  The last time I saw the first one I thought that it was awful.  But when I saw this I didn't feel it at all.  This movie makes me feel like I can actually fly, and I haven't done that in a long time.  What made the first trilogy so special was that it really felt like the filmmakers were just trying to tell the story of a small town in a small country.  They had no money or a big budget.  So they just wrote the script, shot it and were on their way.  Now that they're back and have a huge budget to work with they just get better and better. The special effects are way better than anything that's come out in a while.  There's more to the story, and the dialogue is better.     But the most impressive thing about the original films is that they had this fantastic, fun, tongue-in-cheek, yet still realistic, sense of humor that was funny as hell.  And this sequel is just that.  Yes, there's a lot of heart, but there's also a lot more humor.  You get the feeling that this movie could be the basis for a Saturday morning cartoon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last thing that could have possibly been good about a Hollywood flick of the 1980s, which is really saying something, was how the film itself was made: this was basically a small indie feature made to be shown as a showcase for some of the film-makers who were beginning to show an interest in making a feature film of their own: some were successful, some weren't, some left a trail of failed films behind them; in fact a fair number of them turned out to be much worse than the films they starred in.   Yet it did manage to entertain:   "And when I was finished, we were on a little bit of a run and that was what we were doing! We didn't know the name of the movie, we'd never heard of it, we had no idea what we had on our hands, what it was about, what the characters were like. We had all sorts of things going on in the background, it was really chaotic! But I was still going and that's what the first part of the story was all about: me and my dog trying to get around!"   It had been a good run, but the two men who made it - the first of which was the great Jack Lemmon - had finally finished their run.  He had a reputation for playing hard to get and had lost a good bit of his star power with his various comedies; yet he still managed to get a number of decent films made.  Lemmon himself would have a very good chance to get another movie off the ground if he decided to make a film about the 1970s:  He was already a well-known Hollywood actor:  "I can't believe I've done a movie about the '70s. I have to give them credit for their creativity. I guess it's because they're trying to bring something new to the entertainment world... they're still trying to catch up with the trends, they're putting in new things in their movies every now and then. They are making new movies in the 1970's. I love them for that.  "

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film, filled with heart and humanity, and with it we can see that this is a true film with a great director.   The story of a man who is an assassin, who has to kill his own son because he is sick and it is the only way to get rid of his disease, is very good and it was told well and it gives a lot of character to the character.  He wants to make his son very happy, and the good people of the city try to make him that happy but unfortunately it is not possible, because the boy will not be happy. So we can say that we are given a nice good story about a real man and a good film, and that makes the movie a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title is a bit misleading: there's no sex or romance, and it's not very serious. Yet it does have an impressive cast: it contains the best supporting roles of my life (and the only serious ones I can think of) and it has a certain innocence that makes me feel proud.   It's not particularly beautiful: it looks like a low-budget, badly shot, amateurish film that's been passed around from one friend to another and then given a name and released into the public sphere.  But this is no one-hit wonder, and as much as I'd like to take this to task, it's really not worth doing so.  It has its charm, its humour, and a good few laughs: in fact, I found the film's ending quite good.  The most memorable part is the opening sequence: I found it a bit dull, but that's just my personal opinion.  There's nothing particularly special about the acting: they all do their roles well, and if you enjoy a good bit of self-parody, you should love this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the best thing about the movie is the fact that it's based on a children's book.   But as the movie progresses, it becomes quite different.  The main characters are all very likable and interesting.  I liked how they all got together to save the day from an evil wizard.  When the evil wizard (which was clearly spelled out) said that he would bring the wizard (the main villain) to a new world, where he could have his way with the princess, it was the moment that it all really started to get creepy and a bit scary.  All the action in the movie was quite well done.  A lot of it is based on practical effects, and while a lot of them were effective, there was one part of the movie where they were trying to take a real live person and put him in a giant, flying machine and a huge, flying castle. It was very weird to see.  There's a little bit of magic in the book as well.  So I think that a childrens' book could not only bring out great, imaginative, fun, and funny movies but could also inspire a lot more serious, thought-provoking, and interesting work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why I waited so long to see this movie, I really wanted it when I saw it for the first time. The movie starts out with a montage showing the various events of this movie in chronological order. We see the beginning of a new job, a first date, and a fight with a bully. Then we see a bunch of kids who look like they are about to have a big fight with their school's principal. It doesn't seem real until they start fighting each other. As the movie progresses, things get really crazy. Some of the kids get really into the "fight" and it all looks really cool. A fight with the principal seems to have made a big impression on the boys. Things start getting really exciting when a bunch other boys turn up with a new friend. At first I thought it was a prank, but then I realised it was the actual principal. The guys start beating him up and we see him lying on the floor screaming in pain. The principal gets up to fight again, but the guys who were with him get scared and go home. The next day we see another fight involving the principal, this time it turns out to be real. It turns out the principal has been arrested and now he is being punished. The boys take him to a nearby police station and show him all the violence he has done to them. The police do not believe their story and then he ends up fighting with the whole gang who have turned up at the police station to beat him up. Finally the police arrest him. We then see the principal with some boys as they are led away in handcuffs. I don t think this movie is real at all, but I can't complain too much about it.

I am a huge fan of the book. I love all of the characters. It was a good action packed movie but it didn't have a whole lot of humor. It didn't really have any plot but it was just a good fun adventure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While The Green Mile is an American classic of the 1990's, it should not be dismissed as a typical American story. The film shows the darker side of the American psyche, especially in the portrayal of a dying doctor.   It is a well made movie that is a classic.

The characters in the movie seem like they didn't get a good life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you don't like it, try to like it less:  There are so many good things about this movie. It's not an action movie or a "torture porn" (a movie with really good horror elements). It's a good, well-made story that deals with issues of social class, race and the value of life.   This film is really interesting, not just because it deals with good ideas but also because it's a very funny film.  I can't say I loved it. I just found it to be a very good movie, with some really good performances and an interesting story.

It looks like a bad movie, but it is not.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a scene in this film that is absolutely stunning: when the girl's parents come to take her home, they find her at her sister's house with a bunch of old people who have the same looks and manners as her.   They are sitting around a table playing cards, and the old man in the white shirt is holding a glass of whiskey in his hand, while the old woman in the black dress has a bowl of soup in her hand and the white-haired man has his hand in his pocket.  This is one of those scenes that makes you sit up and take notice.  And then, as the woman in a pink dress leaves the room, the boy in the striped shirt comes walking out of the house.  It is as if he is saying to the old couple, "You've got to believe me, I'm as handsome as my mother, and I've got a good heart.  I'll never tell."   I don't want to make this any more complicated than it is, but this movie is so beautifully directed.  There are lots of really good shots of the characters walking through the streets, of the houses of the rich people, of them driving, of cars going by.    The dialogue is perfectly delivered: the old people and the other people in the houses talk about how much they like them, how they could never be as good as they are, how hard the parents have worked to get to be so wealthy, how their daughters are beautiful and how much better the girls could have been if their parents had had more money to spend on them.  Just the way the actors say their lines, and how they sing them, is such a joy to watch:  And it is just like the old guys in the neighborhood to have a good time: "The only good thing about this place is the little old women.  You know, these old women, they've had so many husbands, and they never even let one go home."  You just can't make a good picture about a rotten world like we live in today.

He's got the biggest gun in the world. He gets up in the middle of the night, and takes out some Mexican drug dealers. He doesn't get anything out of it, but he thinks he's really cool. It doesn't last long. By the end of the movie, he's dead. That's a pretty cool ending.    It's a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not a very funny movie, and its not even very interesting. But it's a good little film from a good man, who should be celebrated. It's like a movie about a guy who has lost a cat. The cat is so cute. You really want to give him a bath, so you go down to the bathhouse. When you come out, there's a kitten with a tiny tail. You don't know what to do. You have to find a place to bring the kitten. So you put on a shirt and get in a cab. When it's time to go home, the cab pulls away. It takes a long time to get there. Then you get there and the cat is gone. Then it's the kitten again. You decide to go to a place where you can't drive, so that you don't lose track of the kitten, and you find a spot where it can't be seen. You go to sleep, when you wake up, you see the cat standing in the middle of the road. There are three cats that look like it. You think about the cat for a while. Then the cat walks into the middle. You run after it, and it jumps into the river. You swim, but the water's a little icy, so it's hard to get to the bottom. You're about to give up when the kitten jumps out. It grabs the kitten and they jump in again. This time the kitten's on top of the car and they keep going until they're in a little boat. There's a big man in the boat with a cane, and he doesn't like it very much when you jump into the boat. You've got to keep the kitten down by the water. You try to hold the kitten by the leash, but he's a very good swimmer and they slip through the water into the ditch. They're about 10 feet deep. They get out of the ditch, but it's icy, and there's ice on the ground. Then they come to a big tree with a white-painted trunk. They climb up the tree and there are no more trees. The river flows past a man's house. The house's on fire. You climb out of your boat and take shelter in the house. You hear voices, and the voices keep getting louder and louder, and they're talking about a girl who's supposed to be in the movie. You find out that the girl is supposed

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the movie I've been waiting for my whole life to see.   I just found out this movie was released in theaters last week, and now I just want to go see it.  This movie is so freaking cheesy and cheesy is the only word I can use to describe it. It is so over-the-top ridiculous that you'll almost feel bad for laughing in the face of it. I think the director and cast were trying to make a movie that would be like one of those old Saturday morning cartoons about the adventures of an old guy who rides his bike across the country. I can't think of any other movie I have seen in which a guy rides his bicycle across the USA on the back of a pig.  It's so over the top that it will probably end up being the most embarrassing thing you ever see. The movie is like the bad TV shows your parents used to watch when you were a kid.  I think this movie has a good cast that I haven't seen in a long time.  Some of the best acting in recent years has been from Billy Crystal.  Johnny Depp (as "Wolverine") was pretty good. I guess this is how it should have been: "If Wolverine is a cow, then what would Wolverine do if he was a cow?"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months ago when I was going through old TV shows I stumbled on one on TV called "Pushing Tin". It is about a poor housewife whose husband leaves his job and leaves her to care for two daughters and a mother and child. She does not find that easy to do because she is a good cook, but doesn't know how to deal with the daughters. She gets herself into serious trouble and she needs help from her son who is a professional actor who has a crush on his stepmom. They go into a bar and he has a real fling with the woman there. There is a real good fight between his mother and him and he takes a hit in the end, but he still wins and he leaves the woman with a broken heart. When she goes back to the house she is upset because her mother wants her to give up her career to stay with her, so she goes to a friend's house in the city and asks her husband to take care of the girls. She doesn't ask the husband to marry her because he doesn't want her to leave his mother because of him.   (review from: www.thewanderingvault.com )
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm always a fan of sci-fi/fantasy, but never a big fan of the Star Wars movies. So when I saw this one, I was a little worried (at the very least), but then I watched it and realized that I was more worried about the movie than I was about the film.   It has all the ingredients for a good sci-fantasy movie: good writing, good acting, and good special effects. It seems to have been shot on location in Mexico at some of the locales in the "Saga" universe.  But the story is a mess. I won't bore you with all the technical details. But it goes from very good to mediocre in the blink of an eye.  In fact, all of the "Star Wars" films have been like this, in a way: every story has one idea and one set of characters that all work together perfectly, but there's a lot of "What the heck are they doing?!" and "Where did they come from?" that makes it all seem so boring.  There's a great cast of characters, and a few of them seem to be a little better than the others, but they seem to have very little to do. The first two acts are a bit like a "What-the-hell-are-they-doing" movie. They all look great on the big screen, and there's the best special effects I've seen in a Star Wars movie. But then the film goes off the rails and the movie turns into a "Where-did-they-" kind of movie.  The last two minutes are a pretty great ending to the story.  For me, it is a movie that is almost great, but not really. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So i have been looking for this film for a while. It is a fun little movie and it is funny to watch.   I am not sure if this is the "best" movie that we have seen in the past 10 years but this is still a fun flick.  I have not seen all the other movies but this one is entertaining, funny, and very well shot.  This movie is about a guy who goes to a "cousin" to get revenge. The cousin, though, is only interested in the money and the woman who he wants to seduce.  So the guy goes back to his home and watches TV.  The guy then goes to the cousin's house.  Once at the cousin`s house, the guy has one of those fun little moments of surprise.  And then he falls asleep.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film about two years ago, and I just now found time to watch it again, which is a rarity these days.   After the two previous films I have seen, I was pleasantly surprised that this time around I could see all the actors' faces, and all the great stuff they were doing.  If you are a sci-fi fan like me, you can't be disappointed by a second look, especially not with the actors.  The dialogue, the action, the beautiful designs, and the music all worked together so well, it was like watching two very different films, one with the stars, and one with everybody else.  I give this film a 4.5/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, that's how we got ourselves into this mess.   It was pretty much like all the movies I saw in high school were made.  The lead character was a pretty typical American hero who gets involved with bad guys because he is trying to get some action and he is a man.  I think if this was a movie about a Chinese woman who has to kill a Chinese man who is a total psychopath who wants to kill her and kill all Chinese people he would have been a much better movie.  And I'm not just saying this because I liked the guy.  So, this is about a group of good-looking, intelligent, well-respected college students who are thrown together because the principal's son, a Chinese kid, has been found dead and his body has been turned upside down and his bones are broken.  To complicate things further, they've been invited to a party that is being thrown by a wealthy Chinese man. And just in time for the party they are called on to find out who the killer is.  This is a movie where the main character is a white American with some Chinese characteristics.  That's all I can say.  Not one good thing about this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fine tale of survival and vengeance set in the North American wilderness of Canada. The film takes a look at the horrors of the winter season by exploring a remote, rural village in northern Canada. This area of the North is often called the "Wild West", which, in many ways, is true. Although the locals of this isolated community are pretty much what you would expect them to be, the story is told in a relatively realistic, almost documentary-like style. There is a few action sequences, but they are of little consequence. Instead, the focus is on the people and their lives, and it is shown in a way that makes the situation seem real and the characters feel like people you would know. I highly recommend watching this film if you're a fan of westerns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is definitely the best animated movie ever made   The story follows the boy, "Vin" (voiced by a young Mickey Rooney), as he and his mother go around the world in search of him.   During the voyage to Australia, a meteoroid has landed near a group of children, and the kids believe that Vin is a spirit who needs their help.  This group includes three of the best cartoon characters of all time:  Alice (voided by Barbara Eden), the ever-friendly mouse; Charlie (voged by Danny Kaye), a rambunctious bird; and Vern (voidd by Mickey Rooney)   Although Mickey Rooney's character seems a little silly in this film, his performance is so good and so well-acted that I can't stop laughing.  There are so many great cartoon characters in this movie.  When Vin goes to Australia to look for his brother, he finds himself having a lot of fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off like a traditional horror movie. However, it quickly turns into something truly disgusting and disturbing.   It starts off as a typical horror movie with a couple of characters who are looking for a way out of the house they are trapped in.  But then, there is a moment where a door opens in the attic and the whole place starts to burn up, and everything in it dies.  And then, something grabs the characters from the fire, and then it moves them to the bottom of the earth.  It is very different from a horror movie, which is usually a slow burn, with gore and the blood being pumped up to an unbearable level.  There is an element of comedy in the movie, with the characters saying how the place is so hot that it will cook them alive.  The horror comes later, when you see what the characters have to deal with. It is a very intense movie.  To be fair, I only watched it once (the movie was very poor, but it was interesting to look at it for a second) but if you enjoy gore, horror and the bizarre, then you should see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Here's how it all begins: the very premise of this movie seems absurd: a high school cheerleading coach is taken hostage by a bunch of high school students for a bit of fun. The reason that the plot seems absurd, however, is that the movie itself is surprisingly good, especially as far as suspense goes.   There are a few minor problems that mar the proceedings, but that's nothing new for a David Lynch movie: the opening is a little silly, the characters seem a little contrived, and the plot never really takes off.    For a David Cronenberg movie, however (and even for Lynch), the atmosphere is strong: as the movie progresses, there's a little bit of an unsettling vibe to the whole affair, a sense that something's not right.  At a certain point, it seems as if the movie's really getting into its stride: in the last third of the movie, Lynch gets a little scary, and even the characters start to grow on you: in particular, the guy who's the target of all the hijinks eventually becomes a little sympathetic.  The big problem with " The Elephant Man " is that it's not the kind of movie you could ever make on a budget.  It's certainly not for the faint of heart, and it is a tough watch at times.  I'm a sucker for Lynch, and I would love to see more of his work.

The whole town is looking to see her fall in love with him, and they do, but a very tragic event happens one night when the man and the girl get drunk and she accidentally kills the man's girlfriend in a drunken driving accident. This leads to a very complicated relationship between her and the town police chief, who is very much a father figure to her. Written by Anonymous

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen all of the The Dark Knight movies, and I have to say that each one was more intense than the last one. The Darkest of Days is more brutal and violent than anything Batman has ever done. The Joker is much more evil and frightening than he was in the previous films. He's even a little smarter in this movie than in the others, as he gets a new "buddy," a "friend" named Mr. M, who is the first one to actually make a joke about killing Batman.   This is one of my favorite Batman movies of all time, especially for the more action packed stuff.

This is where the comedy comes into play, and how funny this movie is!   The story takes a strange turn near the end when there is a fight between a couple of kids.  I will say that the ending scene with these kids is funny.   But the way that it is done makes me smile.  There is a great deal of comedy in this movie, and I would recommend this to anybody who likes funny movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of The Goonies, I am happy to see that the movie has an even better sequel.   The Goons   is set in a small town called Puffin. The boys who live there were a little strange. They went into the woods to find treasure, and what they got was more than they bargained for.  The movie starts off by introducing us to the main characters, a pair of brothers who are a bit eccentric, but have a knack for finding things in the woods.  While walking through the woods one night the boys are attacked by an unknown creature. The two boys manage to defeat the creature, but it quickly comes back the next night, and it seems it's very interested in one of the boys. The other boy then decides to go to the nearby town.  If the boys could not defeat the monster, they should not waste their lives in the wilderness. So they decide to run away.  They do. The rest of the movie follows these two boys.  It is about them trying to get home, and all kinds of bad things happen along the way.  I really liked the movie. It is funny, it is a little different, and at least they did not have to spend $500 to make this movie.

The story is well-done and not just a simple remake, but a nice retelling of a true story.  It has a good cast of characters: some are simple, some are good-hearted and some even seem to be possessed by an evil spirit.  The atmosphere in this movie is so dark and sinister that you could easily imagine a scene from a Gothic film.  In short, I had a good time seeing it and I highly recommend it to fans of the original and to those who just want to enjoy a good horror movie.

I had been thinking about this movie so much recently and the fact that I was able to see a remake in theaters is a great gift to me and my friends.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is probably the best thing I have seen this year.   I love how it has been edited into a 3 minute long movie.  This is one of my favorites.  It was like something out of a movie or some sort of science fiction. I have not seen anything like it.  Thank you for making a good short movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to say one movie has improved on the other over the years, but I have to admit that I've gotten a whole lot better at keeping my attention when I've seen the other two and now it's time for "Killer Klowns from Outer Space"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fine movie. I don't know why anyone would think it is bad. It is good, that's all that matters.   It is a comedy but it is also a little bit of a tragedy, and I love it. The story has a happy ending.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This film is a love letter to the 1960's. It's funny, charming, and so well put together it just stays with you, not letting you forget about it even as time has passed. It is a movie you don't want to miss. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is an entertaining look at a young man who is going to have a very successful, and perhaps even a long, career in show business. At the same time, he will have to be very careful. His wife is jealous of his success, even though she doesn't know what she is doing. She is a great actress, but has a little problem in her back story: her father's last name is Fainter. She was conceived in Fainters' basement, and at least part of the time spent there is probably the most interesting part of this film.   This isn't really a romance; it's just a good comedy.  The characters are all caricatures, but they are pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the movie yet, but I can tell you it's the best of the trilogy.   The movie's like a cross between "Casablanca" and "Pulp Fiction".   There's a lot of action in this one, so don't expect a very easy going movie.  It gets real messy in the end, but the ending is a nice touch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, not a great one (that is not true about any movie, even a good one) and not the greatest film of its kind either (the best movie is "Ludwig van Beethoven: The Last Symphony"), but is a good time, a time where, for a while, it was not too busy, no action, but an excellent, lively, interesting film with enough humor to make it interesting and enough to make you enjoy it. A pleasant surprise, and worth watching in any year, but not too bad at all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the movie "The Last Time I Saw Paris"   There are just so many great memories of Paris, I was lucky enough to spend several days in the city over the summer,   which was the first time I visited France for a year or two   and was thrilled to find I didn't need to visit there again for years   - and I still loved it   A brilliant film, and I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am glad that i am not the only one who watched this movie.   It is a funny movie. I found the dialog and humor to be funny. I also found that the movie is more about the people than it is about the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite films.   It's got a good cast of characters, and the story has a definite edge to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It takes some time to warm up to the idea of a woman who is just going to have sex with a man she doesn't know very well and thinks he's a good-looking fellow.   But it's really just like a weird sort of high school film.  It's a very strange film, and this strange film is filled with strange characters and odd little moments that never really get explained.  In the end, there's one image that will stay with me forever:  I am a big, burly, burrito-loving, burritos-dealing burrito loving, burr-eating burrito eating, burp-smoking, burping, burro riding, burramming, burrowing, burrant, burrrring, burry, burring burrrai, burrier, burred-out-burry, hairy-burried, hazy-hairy,  lanky-lanky, long-legged, short-legged burr riding, hairy, hairy burrito, burried-out, burrerer, burrent, burrer, fannish, fanny-faced, fawn, faunsy, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        A story of the struggle of a young boy and his father to overcome a curse, and their struggle together with a boy and girl who are both of a supernatural and paranormal nature.   What makes this movie so great is the depth and complexity of the characters.  They are believable, and each has their own flaws, but when you look at them together with the struggles they go through they make a really great story about human nature and the strength that we can be when faced with the challenges of life and death.    This is not a perfect movie, it has a lot of flaws and is not without flaws, which I can see why some people have not liked it, but it is well worth a watch and I recommend it as a great example of a movie set in a Victorian English village. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great horror movie from the 70's.   I really liked this movie but if you are looking for a scary movie with a lot of gore then this is not the movie for you.  I was surprised by the gore.  I think I expected more from a movie about ghosts and witches. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't even know what to say about this one. I didn't find this film to be "good" at all. It was all sort of generic in the beginning with characters talking to each other like idiots, with the only difference being that they were talking in the old school cartoon style with bad voices and poor animation. The main problem is that it was "boring" from the get-go because it was very simple.  The main character, Tetsuo, has a girlfriend, Hana. Tetsou gets into a race where they race a robot. Then he loses and Hana goes to stay with him for a week. He is very lonely and tries to get back to his old life.   The only interesting thing about this film was the ending. The ending made me laugh, but I don' think it was funny enough to make me watch the rest of the film again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this yesterday night and I can tell it's a good film, but the plot is just plain stupid. This is how it goes: the local doctor (Mr. Cusack) decides that he needs a new doctor and so he hires a young woman (Carrie) who wants to become a doctor. She gets a job and then she starts dating the patient she is supposed to be working with (Ray). When the patient comes back from the hospital the doctor realizes that he isn't a patient anymore, he's a murderer!   This is obviously a movie about a murderer who tries to get away with murder, and a young doctor who thinks she can save him.   The only thing I didn't like about this was the ending when the doctor takes a knife to the head of his patient, which is sort of a lazy way of saying he's going to kill his victim.  It also makes it clear that Mr. Casack isn't the most intelligent of people when he says he wants to kill the patient with a knife. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend and I watched this movie a long time ago. We liked it when we were kids. It was just as good as we remembered it being.       I've never been a huge fan of horror movies. I'm more of a gothic romantic drama fan and I have trouble sitting through a good one without getting sick.  But this movie is awesome.  It's got a good atmosphere. It is about a college guy who goes back in time to fix something with the past. It's all well-done and nothing out of the ordinary.  I also liked it that it was shot by a student director.  If you like the time travel theme then this is a good time to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most of the great comedies of the sixties, I laughed my ass off at this one. I knew right from the start that it would be great, but I couldn't imagine it ever getting any better than it did.   What an astonishingly funny, utterly heart-warming, and utterly unique film, one of the very best in the director's catalog. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good little movie. I watched the film again to see how the film was different from the books.   It is not like the books where there are more action and there are a lot of characters.  There is just some time travel, a couple of people that meet, one of which is a nice guy, and we see what happens to these people in the future.  The film has a good plot, good actors, and a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An adaptation from an earlier book, but based on a true story, this is a compelling portrait of a true hero who refused to flee when the Nazis were coming. He had no choice but to stand and fight. He became a national hero because he could do no other.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When a movie like this happens, it's like a little bolt of lightening strikes the heart. It is so easy to love this movie and even though the plot is a little off in places and the characters aren't as great as they should be, this is still a great movie. The animation is great and the story is a perfect twist on the "good vs. evil" thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to review the remake of the horror movie, but this is such a good film with a good story.   This was my first time watching the remake, so I can't really judge it, but I felt like the movie is so much better than the original movie, and so is the story. The story has a more solid structure than the remake. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent movie from a wonderful team of story tellers.   The movie has a very interesting storyline and does well in capturing the spirit of the time.  From the main characters to the people who go to the cinema to escape from the world, the movie does an outstanding job in being a true film noir. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good flick. It has lots of action and good gore. The writing is well done. The movie is about a team of CIA agents who go on a mission to steal a nuclear weapon that's being held by a terrorist. The terrorist turns out to be a terrorist in disguise. The film is good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished watching this, so I haven't had a chance to actually write a review yet, but I'll try to do so when I have more time. I was surprised by the fact that, despite having some minor flaws, the whole thing just worked.   The characters all felt like they could actually be real.  The movie seemed to have been shot all at once on a low budget and was more or less done on a shoestring. It was made by a guy who has no previous acting experience (and therefore has made some mistakes). The acting was very good, especially by the three lead characters.  There were some small plot holes in the movie and I felt the movie could have been better, but it wasn't bad and it's easy to see why it has a good following.  I liked the film and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in filmmaking.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is great. I love that it is based on a real-life story. The movie has a real mystery to it. It was very intense, suspenseful, and very enjoyable!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie had some good laughs and was fun to watch, but it got a little repetitive.   I liked the idea that the film is set in an airport with very little people, and then a lot of really funny people, including a guy that looks exactly like John Lennon.  There is also a lot more action than the movie gives credit for and that is a very good thing.  The music was great, and a lot better than most of the movies in the 1980s.  Overall, a great movie and definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The  ... .   was a great movie for a great time.  If I had one critique I would give the music. It was too quiet to be a good suspense movie, and when the tension increased the music went too.. I can only see the movie in dim light.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Funny in a funny way...   I like this movie a lot and I'm still laughing my butt off"   A nice little comedy about a boy who loses his favorite guitar and finds out that it belongs to an elderly, but happy, old man who also loves his guitar. He meets an elderly man who is the same age as the man who used to own the guitar and the two have a nice time playing it.   It's not exactly the funniest thing I've ever seen (if that's the right word for it), but it's a nice little romp with a couple of laughs thrown in. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been a big fan of "superhero" movies. I hate to say it, but I'm always a little disappointed. I always get the feeling of watching a typical "good guy" with a secret identity, superpowers and a super-smart but dumb wife.   But not for long.  Once the hero's identity is revealed and it's revealed that he's a good guy, you know what?   Now he's good!   And that's the fun in this movie.  This is a good, if a little slow, action film.  I didn't think the hero would last very long, but he was able to beat the bad guys and keep his secret identity.  The supporting cast was pretty good, especially the villains, but the heroes really came through.  Not to mention that it was funny and well-directed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It wasn't exactly the worst bad movie, but it was the worst movie I've seen in a long time, and it's pretty much the worst part of the movie I enjoyed the most.   This is a decent enough movie, and I liked the idea of a little monster that's supposed to be a child killer.  But the rest of the cast is pretty bad.  This movie is also kind of slow, which is to be expected, but the whole thing takes ages to get there.  Overall, not a bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was never a huge fan of horror films, because they never seem to work. But I must admit I have enjoyed this movie quite a bit. There is one scene where a very tall and very silent man (Gosling) appears and scares a woman. That alone will give this movie a good rating.   But there is more! At one point the old lady says to the old man: "You know this is a good time to go. I am afraid you'll never come back." But in that scene I was really scared and wanted to turn away from the TV and run.  I loved that scene and the sound effects!   The other scene (this is in the old women's house) was much funnier. Gosling (who is still very good and scary in this movie) finds a dead rabbit and decides to eat it. The old woman tells him not to do it because there is a dog in the room. Goslings tells her to just be afraid, and walks to the room where there is no dog. This was such a great scene and reminded me of those scenes in "Nightmare on Elm Street."   "A Good Time to Die Hard" was rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always have a hard time coming up with a good review for a movie of this kind. It's been twenty years since The Shawshank Redemption and yet my eyes keep wanting to look back at it. It was one of those rare movies that managed to both shock me and entertain me simultaneously. It does take a little while to get going in the story and by the time you get to the second act of the story you are either in a state of shock or laughing to your very core. This is where the movie truly shines. There's so much to the story that it can almost be a horror film or an adventure film. It is very interesting to see a character like Richard Gere playing a character that is so down on himself. He has the ability to charm people but he also has the skill to be as despicable as he wants. It gets so complicated at times as to become almost a thriller. It also becomes a bit of a psychological thriller where the audience starts to see more about Richard G. as well. The movie is a bit dated now as a result of having been made so long ago. It has a little bit of everything but the movie does have the potential to be great again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent retelling of the classic story, but with more humor, and also a bit of a romance in it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie so many times, I even think my children have seen it.   The best part about this movie is that it is an adventure.  This movie is definitely one you don't want to miss.  The story is awesome and has the feel of an old west western story.  It is a very well thought out movie and has a real Western feel to it. The sound effects are pretty good as well.  If you are a western fan, you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very, very well made. The film is extremely well paced and well thought out. It is a dark, disturbing, and disturbing movie, but it is so well made, that you can't help but go into it with an open mind and a heart full of sadness.   The story is very well thought, and is both a scary and a disturbing one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, no, let's be clear: it's not the best movie you'll ever see (the best movie is going to come in the form of an anthology film from the '80's!) but it's a good film, with a good script and some decent performances, that doesn't require much interpretation to enjoy. There are things going on in the film that can get a bit tedious, even if the ending is somewhat satisfying, but those things are minor compared to the many interesting ideas the movie explores. There is some really good acting from some excellent actors (though most of them aren't quite up to snuff for their roles) and the directing and screenplay deserve some respect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a very good horror movie and it is good at horror, which is a genre I am not so fond of. This movie will be good for people who like horror movies, though if you are not one of those people, then maybe you will like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about a man with a plan.

It was a great treat for me to see a film where the actors are really great and it looks like it is in real life! I really like to see movies with good performances and the people in them look great! The soundtrack is amazing and it is one of the very best films of the 20th century! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is pretty good.   While the story is not new, it still has a lot of good ideas and an enjoyable plot to follow.  Unfortunately, it feels like it had to be a bit more expensive than it was, to justify the cast.  For example, the main character is very forgettable.  The only good thing about this movie is that it has a few funny moments, but other than that, it isn't much to look at. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a rare film in which the characters are all completely uninteresting.   One of the actors is so insipid that the entire movie seems like a joke.  The story is a bit silly and it's pretty bad, but it's funny all the same.  I've never had any good films from Italy so this movie was a pleasant surprise!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much I wanted to give it a 9/10 and I didn't want to give a lower than a 9 because of the "special effects" in this movie. The story was great: a guy is out of a job because he's stuck with a drunk old lady (who's a witch). She wants him to do a movie with her (which he's reluctant to do), but she has to be rescued by a stranger, a ghost. They go to a house that's been haunted by a man with long dark hair (who looks like Paul Newman). There's lots of things that make you feel creepy, like the smell of smoke, the ghosts, the strange noises, and of course the witch. There's a lot of suspense, and a lot to think about.   It was a fun and very funny movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the movie, "Jurassic Park" is about the park "JURASSIC PARK". In a couple of scenes in the movie you will see the park from a point of view which is very interesting: the whole park is open to everybody (and dinosaurs!), the animals are being kept in pens by the park staff: the "P" stands for "parker", the "R" stands "recreational", the two numbers are used to represent the animals: the female Pterodactyl, the female Velociraptor, the "males" are the "D" and the "F" are meant to represent "sport": this is how the park was in the 60s: all the species of "Pterodac" was kept together, there were the "A"s and the females Pterosaurs ("P" and "R"), all the female reptiles (and one or two males) were kept by the female park staff, there was a female Velociiraptors and a pair of Pteranodon ("B" and P), a female Raptor ("C" and F) and a male raptor ("E" and G). You see the female raptor and the female "P " are the same; the female Raph is the same as the male Raph; the "male" Pteroc is the male Veloceraptor; the males Pterodon and Raph are different from each other, the male raptors are different; the Pterosaur and "Mammoth" were different and all the other species were different. So the park is "Jurasic" in a way: it is the only place where all the animals and the species were the same.   This is how an old man (the director Frank Marshall) explains: there is a reason why these animals are there in the park: "Juratain", it was an old place for this area of the park, it was the only "normal" park in Jurassic Park: the other parks were so different that they were like "The City of Lost Children" (the movie is called "Jury" and was shown in cinemas as "Juri" in some countries).   So we see a dinosaur park in a dinosaur-infested park of Jurassic Park. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I don't know about you, but I didn't know that there were these two sisters (that's right, two) who had a very bad relationship when they were younger. It's not like they ever got over it, but they are in the middle of a war and both are dying. I didn the two girls had a long talk about their past, they didn't talk about a lot of things, like what happened to them on a field trip when they first met, or how they got into movies, or even why they weren't together when they had such good chemistry, but it was a nice conversation, which I appreciate.   It's hard for me to write anything negative about a movie that had such a good cast of characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an original movie in the first world war. It's like a bad version of the German version "Panther" with a bad movie actor - this one is so bad it's amazing. There is something about this film that will give you the shivers, in one of its weakest moments. The acting is absolutely terrible, the direction and cinematography are bad too, with terrible camerawork. You'll be hard pressed to find any other film with this many problems. You can see the whole film in one hour and thirty minutes, a total mess. It seems to be shot by accident, shot with handheld cameras, and the actors are clearly not knowing what they are doing. I can't recommend this movie enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never expected to see this movie in a theater when I was a little kid, so I had to do some research to see what this was all about.   This movie is a classic, a time capsule of the '60s.  It was not made to make money, but it is one of the best American comedies ever made.  I will never forget this movie, it is a great time capsule and I have seen the movie more than once. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really surprised at the quality of this movie and the fact that I'm now going to make it my new favorite movie.   This movie is good because it's an old favorite that was rediscovered and remade.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched "Wormwood" about four years ago. I had a little bit of a problem with the movie in that I felt like I was watching something like a kid in a horror movie where the adults were so creepy that they would scare a little kid with a gun, even though I was too old to be in that film.   The story is pretty simple, although it has the makings of being a pretty good horror movie.  This is a movie I watched once, when I was eleven years old, and I remember it well, although I have forgotten a few of the details.  One of the most interesting elements of the movie is the fact that the children can see the adult characters, and they are so terrified of them, that one of the adults ends up as an afterthought.  Unfortunately, the movie also includes one of those movie moments that make you wish the kids hadn't been put in a place where they could see adults, such as the one where one of them sees a dead girl on a beach, and another goes after it.  While the children do make good use of the beach as a jumping off point, the kids make little use of it, except to watch a shark swim by.  There is one sequence in the movie where two adults come to the beach, in a fishing boat.  At first, the adults act like they are friendly, and their conversation with the kids is amusing.  Then they start to act like this is just a regular day, and leave.  The next day, when a little girl is attacked by a shark, the girls and their mother realize the adult who went on the beach wasn't a friendly person and they decide to find the real killer.  In one of my favorite scenes in the film, the mother, who has become the father figure to the girls, attempts to hold the boy off while the girls go to the other side of the dock, but the boy is just too fast, and he manages to take down the father, who is swimming.  If you like creepy children, you should probably watch this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So we're going to take a few minutes and talk about the first ten minutes of The Last Jedi.   This is the most fun I've had watching a Star Wars movie since The Phantom Menace (and, yes, even The Empire Strikes Back ).   With the cast returning, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, along with Lando Calrissian and his new droid R2-D2, are set up as good guys for us to root for.   And while they all do some stuff that seems like it was ripped off from a bad '80s sci-fi movie (R2, you're a bad bad robot!) the real highlights here are the special effects.  The CGI is pretty good, especially in the scene where Lando blows up a ship in a scene straight out of a Bond movie.  There are some nice set pieces and we get a little glimpse into what Anakin may have been like as a young man (although I'm not so sure he would have been much better than Kylo Ren in terms of looks, charisma and badassitude).   I think The Last Sith is a superior sequel to The Phantom of the Opera.  Luke has the right amount of badassery in terms and with what he does in this film.  Lando is back!  And I hope they don't make his robot R2 a female (in an interesting homage to the original), because I'm having a hard time keeping my hands off the adorable droid.  I don't think any of these characters will be leaving my mind soon, except for maybe a Kylo-fied Vader and a drooling Leia (although Leia's voice has to be better, I think, and I hope she's in a good place with her brother Ben).  I am also looking forward to the inevitable return of Carrie Fisher.  In the meantime, this movie reminds me a little bit of the original The Phantom and its follow-up, The Revenge of the Sith.  And, yes that movie is in the canon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a film about two people who meet. They become friends. Eventually they have a kid together. They are both happy about this. They love each other.   This film is about a couple who meet, become friends, have a daughter together, and then have a child together.  They are happy.  This is an interesting film. It is not a love story, but it is a true story of friendship. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great film.   The story is simple:  There is a woman who's on a plane to Brazil where her boyfriend has gone missing.  She tries to find him through the flight attendants but it becomes obvious that they don't know where he is.  Eventually she is forced to go to the airport itself and search around the plane.  Then she gets out of the plane by finding a door and then goes on to the city.  This is one of those films that is so real and so real.  And it is a beautiful film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to the theater to see a new movie called The World of Tomorrow. I loved it    And I'm not alone. It's been nominated for a Golden Globe.   It's not a big budget movie, but it's definitely an interesting little sci-fi flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It seems to me that if you take the film into account, the plot is an excuse to play around with an old horror movie, the genre has a bad reputation, but the script is very good, and the performances are also very good.   The film contains some oddball scenes: a man falling from the sky, a ghost that moves by changing shapes, and a small boy named Vincent with a pet poodle, which he rides to school.  One scene that makes me giggle is when the boy sees a man (played by a young Peter Lorre) chasing the girl with a hammer, but then she runs away, and he comes after her with the hammer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! I thought the movie was very well acted, and it was really great to see a good old time movie like that.   It is a classic film that you all must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like you said, it's like a "Superman" meets "X-Men" type of story.   It is a wonderful little slice of life with a couple of laughs and an awesome title!   If you like "Scooby Doo" and "X Men" and like "Ragtime" and enjoy "Clueless" then this is for you! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a good film! It is about a man who goes to find out about the murder of a very beautiful young woman who was walking home on the streets in an area where there are a lot of bars and other bars. The scene where he finds her on the stairs has me in tears. The ending when he walks down the street is the best ending I have ever seen in a movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I must say I was pretty skeptical about this movie and did not want to watch it, but then the review in the movie theater was not only positive but it was even funnier than the movie itself.   I think that is what made me watch it again and I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie because my friends and I loved a similar movie called   The Last Stand.   That was like a very gritty, realistic movie with a young man who has to fight off all the bad guys.   This movie takes a similar tone but it is not as gritty.  You get to see a real man face the worst kind of life in a world filled with bad guys and drugs.  I am not a big fan of the original film because it is a different type of movie but this one is a close second to the original.  This is a film you can enjoy and learn from.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to say if The Green Mile is a good film because of the many clichés (and of course the terrible plot) but what makes it interesting and good is the characters.   John Coffey is a pretty bad guy in this film. I thought he was kind of cool, but when he turns on the charm and talks to some people it gets very weird.  It may not be that bad but when you watch this movie you will remember it forever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film in the spirit of The Exorcist that, although not as well received by critics as the movie that had its roots in a supernatural story, is nevertheless an effective work with some original ideas, particularly the use of music, a technique very rarely seen since the silent era.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story: The plot: One of the first films I watched on DVD was The Exorcist   I was never able to understand it, but I can see the similarities: two young men go to a creepy old house and try to exorcise a demon from a young boy.   It starts off very slowly, but when it gets going, it's a truly terrifying thing to behold.  I could go on about how the actors really pull off the characters, how the film takes place in a single room, how it was shot in a dark room with scary shadows (although the actors are never in the shadows, instead they are in the light),   But then I have to move on.  A lot of the acting is over the top, but the fact that people could scare me off with one look is pretty scary.  It would be pretty easy to make a film like this.  This would be one to watch over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   The story was entertaining, funny and well written.  A little slow start but after a short period of time we start to feel the tension build in the story and then the action begins to pick up.  The script is so unique that when you watch it you wonder why it hasn't been done before.  It's a great movie that has a good action scene every time and it's the only way I can describe it.  There is nothing like this movie in any movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's fun, smart, and very original.   The lead character is a girl named Sara who, though a little naive, is strong enough to see past the dangers of this new world. I was reminded of the good old days of the 80's when I watched this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good film with some funny moments, with the most important scene being that with a lot of people around me I don't see the problem, there's a lot in the film for me to talk about, but not now, just when I'm looking forward to another week with my kids.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot, it is about a guy who got himself into a lot of bad situations and had a lot to deal with. It is about someone who is doing the best he can with what he is given and trying to do the right thing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was about a young boy who was kidnapped and brought to a place in the middle of nowhere where he is treated inhumanely. A woman then kills the boy and cuts his hair, then she dresses him in a blue outfit that is reminiscent of a nun's habit, and then she brings him a meal of some sort to eat. This girl later reveals herself to be his mother, who has been living in a cave for over 400 years. The man who took the boy to this place, has a strange face, is wearing a long white cloak, is covered with a red cape, and has a very strong mustache. It looks like the film was very old and old-fashioned, with no modern features. I did enjoy the movie, however, as it had a very good story line and an intriguing plot that never reached the end.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The film is about the relationship between a young man (Mads Mikkelsen) and his wife (Michelle Williams). They live together and are not happy with each other, the relationship is strained by their problems and a little child (Annette Bening) and some older kids (Robert Forster and Michael Gambon) from the neighborhood make things awkward. But, in spite of this they are very close to each other and at the same time they are always thinking about the future. The film has a really nice look and a great story that is filled with suspense and a lot of laughs.   In the movie we are shown that the relationship of an older man and a young lady can be very difficult to handle. At times the young man feels guilty, in other moments he can seem to feel like his wife is making a play for his money, and the old man feels like he is being held back. But their relationship is not one of love, it's not one between a woman and a man, it is a relationship between two people who love each other a lot.  "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why this movie had to be in this format.   The pacing and editing of this film is almost laughable.  It is clearly a low budget movie.  The cast includes no real acting talent and the sound is pretty bad.  This movie looks like it was shot in a low-budget motel.  I'm glad that the filmmakers had a decent budget, because this movie is really unprofessional.  You can't believe that any of these people made it this far. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure I'm one of the few people who has never seen this.   This was a pretty good movie with an even better script, but the acting and the writing are pretty low.  It was a good flick to watch and some of the scenes are quite funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A funny, well acted film, with a lot of laughs.   The music is very good and they try to get it in a movie for the first time, which isn't bad at all.  The movie does have a lot to it that a normal movie would have.  It's about two friends, that like to play video games, who have to hide from the police while they sneak around and find a way out of a trap that the police have set up.  This movie does a good job of taking a comedy and turning it into a tense, scary movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is a really good movie.   The pacing is just about perfect for a kids movie. I don't think they went too far with it, but they went with the theme well enough.  This is one of those movies that you look up in a bookstore and say "What?"  It's about a girl who loses her family and then goes back to school for the summer. It has a story that could have been a lot worse, but it's not.  I really liked this movie, and I'm glad I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is one of the best films I have seen in a while.   It starts slow, but it builds its tension up to the point where you will almost forget that the story is in a film.  In this film, the protagonist, R.J. (John Cusack), is a drunk (or so he claims), living in an apartment on the border between Los Angeles and San Francisco. After a car accident in his old apartment, RJR starts living with a girlfriend. The girlfriend is the object of RJR's affections - a beautiful blonde woman (Linda Hamilton) who also happens to be a prostitute. It isn't long before RJR is running around the city, trying to get to San Francisco so that he can get to his girlfriend. This is a bad idea - he is only on the phone with his girlfriend and the phone is broken. The only good thing about this film is the good acting and the beautiful scenery and cinematography. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited to watch this movie.   It is based on a true story and I love true stories.  The movie starts out in the 70's and focuses on a young man named David.  It shows how the people of the 70s were in the midst of the worst times they ever had.  These people were at the peak of their lives and had the most amazing houses.  I don't know why David can't get a job and how the house has been there since it was built.  As the movie goes on it shows the people are struggling with the worst things to happen to them.  This is not a movie for those that don't like sad movies or stories about people that were too good to be true.  My rating:     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was just the right mixture of action, humor, romance and mystery.   The plot was really a mixture of a story about a boy named Danny and his best friend, a girl named Sandy, who are searching for their brother, who is missing from their family.  It all began when Danny meets a young girl named Claire (played by a great actress named Sarah Polley) who happens to be from the next town over.  Claire also happens to have a brother named Frank, who has an older brother, and is a boy who loves movies (he has a giant collection of movies on tape).   Frank is not a good boy.  The first time Danny meets Frank he is riding his bike, and a man (played, I kid you not, by a really talented actor named Robert Blake) steals his bike.  Frank decides to take revenge by taking Danny out on the road.  This was a funny movie.  In a way, it was like a cross between a James Bond movie and a Rambo movie. It also had a good blend of comedy and mystery as Danny meets some tough people, and his bike gets stolen, and he must outrun them.  There are some fun scenes where they must out-run a car that is following them, or when Frank comes upon some bad guys who seem to be trying to steal his bike (they are trying to make a profit by selling it to Danny's father).  While it is funny that Danny has to run out of the woods in a snowstorm to find his bike and to save his friends, the movie is really fun, and it keeps you engaged.  If you are looking for a good action movie and you like a good mix of humor, mystery, and suspense, this one should be on your must watch list.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'll enjoy this movie if you like:  A good story-line and plot, a good ending and movie itself, a pretty and funny picture (especially when you consider the movie is about a man in search for a good night's sleep)   I've been interested in this movie ever since seeing the trailer.   When I first heard about it, I wondered if the director was an actual doctor, or if he was an actor, trying to get in on the success of an older movie, the '70s one, about the same plot.  It seemed like the kind of movie you saw in the '50s, but with a twist.  And it has the same story as The Big Sleep, only here the character is a young man with a penchant for sleeping in his own grave.  What I liked about it is the way it is told.  One can't help but watch it and feel that the story has been told already.  I found myself thinking about The Big Night.  As I'm sure many will too.  Perhaps it will be a better movie after you get over the initial shock, and see what's really going on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun movie. It has lots of good jokes, funny dialogues, and very good acting. There is no bad character, no cliché, no over-acting, etc. It is very original. I think that the director, writer, and actors (especially the director and actress) are all very talented. I enjoyed watching this movie, and I hope that you will enjoy it, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is interesting, and it does get an 8 from me. It doesn't have any real action, just the usual action from the 1970's (including a little space-opera at the end). It is good, not great.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I loved this movie.   I am a big fan of the movie, but the way this movie was written by George Dzundza was amazing!   He wrote the best movie ever, and this movie is the proof.  The story of this movie and all the characters are perfect.  If you want to know what to do when your on vacation and have no money, this movie will make you happy!  I want to go see this movie so bad!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised that this wasn't a bigger hit (I love the director, but he never made a huge hit). It's about a kid (played by David Cross) who's the son of a famous actress who is just about to begin a new stage of her career. The daughter, who is now about 7, is in charge of the business. It's a little too good for this to be really a big success. It has a nice, funny, and well-written story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was just about to watch this film (as I am about to make a habit of doing)   When it came out, it was praised in almost all the movie magazines I had on hand for the way the plot was executed.   Now it is my understanding that the plot is a little silly in places and that the way that the two heroes (one a very good detective and the other an average but clever lawyer) investigate a murder that has been committed on an island is a bit of a waste of energy.  In fact, the first half of the film is rather forgettable and drags, and the second half is an interesting romp with some excellent gags (especially a very well-played parody of a movie).   That said, I will have to give this one a chance to see if it has the guts to stand up to the challenge it poses. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good example of a good science fiction film. It is a little slow and you need to sit down with a cup of coffee or something, because it takes a while to get going. It's about a man and his wife who are being attacked by aliens. He shoots one, the aliens go after the couple and they are running. They have to hide in a house while the aliens come in and kidnap the couple.       I watched this and liked it and thought the movie was interesting enough to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always had an affinity for the classic noir genre, especially the films of French director Charles Chaplin. And I love this movie: it's filled with all the charm and wit that I loved about the noir films of the 1930's, and I loved it all the more for the fact that this was filmed long ago, and the actors are still around to play their roles.   It's not one of those films that has some real plot or ideas. It's more of a collection of stories: one of a young writer who meets a woman he doesn't really like and then meets a man he does.  They have a couple of sex scenes, then the man leaves the woman and she runs off.  Then, she comes back to meet him the next day and he gives her a chance to explain herself, which she does, and that's how things get complicated.  The movie is very funny, and it's a good look at a time that seems so distant from us today.  About the author:  This is a review of the 1960's French classic. I have no real idea what this was about (if you can guess it, please don't say I didn't give you fair warning) but I'm intrigued. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not a horror buff and I had never heard of the movie "Night of the Demons". But I had seen a lot of horror movies and this one was one of the best.   The movie was shot in Germany and had the feel of a German movie.  I will definitely be watching it again and getting a DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very interested in watching The Shining.   The Shining   is an extremely well done psychological thriller about the psychological and personal struggles of a young woman who has been given a very special gift and a very evil man.  It is a slow and tedious story about the struggles of this woman, who is tormented by the demons of her past.  The characters are a bit overdone but they are all well drawn.  Some of the characters are not well drawn but their actions and reactions are all very believable.  I liked the movie a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the better movies in the series and it's a very different movie than any of the other ones.   This one has a lot of heart, some good action, some decent characters and a very unique ending.  It's a real movie for a true fan of the series but not for the casual viewer.  The story is very different from the others.  This movie shows a group of friends who are friends for life, all with their own problems but also some kind of connection, something that isn't always present in the movies.  A lot of things happen in this movie, but it isn't a movie where all is happening in one hour.  I found it to be quite well paced and enjoyable.  Some scenes are a little long but it never feels like a movie that has a boring ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have loved this movie for years. The story is about a man who wants to get his head cut off.   The movie is a very good, funny, and heartwarming tale about a little man who likes to kill his father in order to get back at his abusive mother.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at a wedding with my parents when I heard the news. I was in the theater the next day, and I think I was a little shaken up after watching the movie.   The movie is the story of a man (Ray Romano) who runs for his life when a bomb goes off in the subway and he has to run with a man named Jim (Gary Sinise) who has become one of the "Big Three" at the hospital.  The story is really simple, there's a bomb.  Jim is a real nice guy, and when the bomb goesoff he says, "It's the end of the world, we'll go out in style."  It's a good time and I can see why Ray Romano is a big star. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's title is taken from the "Three Men in a Boat" song.   This is a good story.  The acting is good and the story is great.  At times there is a hint of a tragedy.  You should not expect to enjoy this film.  If you enjoy a good murder mystery and some suspense with lots of mystery, this is the film for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie.   A wonderful story about a poor woman who has to work in an underground railroad.  What a great story and I loved it.  I did not expect to find a movie like this.  There is an underground rail system in every town in America. They transport people who are in the street or the prisons to the other side of town where a railroad is dug out in the hills and they travel along that train.  But this film is about a woman who travels through the underground railroad to get away from her husband and her mother.  This film is beautiful and it is about life and love and the love that is deep and long and so pure and perfect.  The movie is about love and I believe in love.  After watching the movie I think that I would want to travel down to the train in the mountains.

I also liked that they made it about the environment rather than about a person's problems. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by how funny this movie is.   It starts with an old man who decides he wants to be a cowboy again after years away.  He has a tough time convincing his granddaughter that he is ready for the next adventure.  After spending some time at the local cemetery, he decides to go out in the open.  But before he can get too far, the old man is found shot to death by a horse.  As he is wheeled into a hospital, he meets a lady who is trying to get a little extra money for her horse. The woman's horse has a really bad reputation.  What follows is some really good old timey shooting and shooting and finally the old folks are reunited with their granddaughter.  It is all kind of silly, but the acting is good and the humor really is funny.  This was a fun movie to watch and one I will watch again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great.  I enjoyed it. I also have to say that I wish we had got a better ending.  It seems they didn't do much to the set or the set-up for the end.  The story is very good, but there are some problems.  One of the problems is the poor directing. The camera never seems to focus, it is constantly moving and changing direction.  This can be seen most noticeably in the ending. It is a poor and unprofessional film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I ever heard about a movie called   ..   in a movie theater, I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it sounded like  ."A movie about a man trying to get his life back on track by taking care of his children." Then a man says to the man: "A man's got to have his own way, and if it's his way, well, that's his business." And the man replies, "I don't think I can. It's my life." Then the woman says to him: "If you can't stand your own way then why don't you move on." And he responds: "I can't walk without feeling like I'm on borrowed time." After the two of them finish making love they say goodbye. And the woman finally asks him, "Is this the last time? Have we already had a good run?" And the guy answers: "Yes, the last."   That is what I wanted to see in a good thriller: a man whose life seems to be slipping away from him and yet somehow the film shows the way he has to walk with his children and do his business, and at the same time he can't let it all go.   It's not just a movie about the people who have to make a living. It has the feeling of a film about people who live in the wrong way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half is a good introduction to this story, where we see a young boy being taken advantage of by an older man in a creepy, but also quite funny way.

The ending shows the characters in the way that they really are.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe I watched this movie.   It's good.  There's something to watch when the story comes up.  In some ways the story is predictable but it is worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the classic series.  I liked the story.  It was hard to tell whether this story is going to be a classic or an under-rated gem, but I like it all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the better movie I've seen in a while.  I feel like this is an adaptation of a short story that would be good if you didn't care about the whole thing.    The film takes place during the Vietnam war and is a story about a couple who are trying to live a happy life with their child.  It's not a very good movie, however it is a good look at a different war.  This isn't one of my favorite movies, but it is good enough that you can watch it once without losing interest.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first time watching a Chinese film and I was blown away with its Chinese setting, but I did not expect it to be a movie of such complexity.   From an early scene when the old man tells you about the past, and how he met a girl. This was amazing as we see old men (the guy looks like a very nice older uncle in his later years). It was so funny, that I had to pause the movie so I could laugh at every little thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am pretty sure I am in love with a movie about a group of women who become "one big happy family" as they meet, fall in love, and make a movie in New Orleans.     It is set in the early 70's in New Orlean's Old World and New Orleans is back to its old ways when it's night time and "the city" gets dark.  The story is told through the eyes of four women and it is quite a funny and engaging movie to watch.  It has a lot of great lines and a great story and a wonderful ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a very enjoyable film and you could easily see the characters being drawn from their own backgrounds.   The story of a man and his son who fall in love with the same girl is well executed.  A very entertaining tale of love and deception.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea is simple: you are the star of your movie.   You get to do what you want.  You're just a movie star.  And you can do anything you want to.  But the bad guys are after you.  They are out to get you, to destroy you, and to make a little money on you for doing what you do.  So when they find out that you've been up to some dirty, shady stuff, they come to get it.  If you want revenge, you've got to act fast.  Then, before the bad guy gets to you, you'll get a chance to have a little fun...in a different way!     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to give props to the directors of this movie!   This movie has a few small problems, but not enough to bother anyone.   It's about a young man, Alex P., who decides to go to the big city to attend the Academy of Medicine.  As is usually the case with most movies about medicine, the movie is pretty bad.  Alex gets a job as an assistant on the medical staff of a local hospital.  He gets himself in a lot of trouble by stealing drugs to sell, and getting his nose cut.  This leads to his getting fired by the hospital. The first day Alex goes to the Academy, he meets Dr. N., a doctor who is just about the same age as Alex.  N. is interested in teaching Alex about the arts of medicine.  The story has Alex meeting many people in the school and his interactions with N. are very interesting.  In addition, there are some other characters who are quite interesting. I have little to say about the acting of the actors in this movie.  One of the most interesting characters is Dr. M., a woman who is obsessed with the medical art and seems to know everything about it.  She is a real moron.  There are some minor plot problems, as Alex's relationship with N., the director of the Academy. is a little confusing, and the doctor who plays N. could have used more screen time.  However, there is enough good in this one to recommend it to anyone who likes the art of medicine movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Starring James Cagney in a rather understated performance, 'Straw Dogs' was a wonderful example of an actor playing a character that was not a typical one. The acting of this film is wonderful. Cagny is able to display a great range of emotions; from fear and terror to happiness, regret, and love. There are no bad performances in this movie. It is a great film from beginning to end."   This is the first of a two part film about two little girls (Shelley and Mary, who we are to guess are sisters) who are the youngest children in the neighborhood. We first see them together at a party, when the younger sister, who is called Mary, is the target of a boy named Peter (Sidney Poitier) and two other boys. Sidney is in the middle of a fight when Peter throws a rock at Mary's back. The rock bounces off her, and it falls into the mud. She is so terrified she runs off to hide. She then meets up with her older sister, Shelley, and the two girls run into the nearby field where Mary gets lost in the weeds and plants. The girls find Mary again, but this time she is with her aunt, who runs a horticultural business in the area. Shelley and Mary tell the aunt everything that happens, and when the aunt tells them to leave, Shelley and the other girls follow Mary out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies in the past decade, an amazing tale that should be watched by all movie-lovers: A group of five people who had to fight against the evil forces of nature.   The movie is not that good, but the story is really beautiful: the scenes of the fight against nature are really moving:  The fighting scenes are really fun, the movie is really scary:  This movie should be seen by everyone, especially by old people: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that there are two types of films in the world:  In which every frame is so perfect and so perfectly acted, that you can't help but be mesmerized by the amazing talent of the actors, who, with their unique sense of style, manage to create an aura of mystery and intrigue, and then all of a sudden, just as all the tension is building to the climax, the film changes its tone, and is replaced by a darkly comic film which, despite the title, is actually not very funny at all.  It is so bad, and so devoid of any redeeming features, that I feel that the directors have no shame in putting on a show which is both terrible and laughable at the same time.  The acting is bad and bad, the story is bad, everything about this film is just plain bad.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Frozen" is a masterpiece. It's such a brilliant movie, a magical film. It has great musical numbers, great cinematography. It is a movie that you can watch as a children's movie with a good story, and still have it hold your attention. And there's a great message within that movie. It may not be the perfect movie, but I think it is the best movie that Pixar has made.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "All You Need Is Love" is a very emotional movie. The cast is amazing and it's an easy movie to watch and it does not take itself too seriously. It's a very happy film that is not very preachy or preachy at the same time. The movie was good, it's hard to think about a movie that I really loved. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh at their own problems. I really liked this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most outstanding character in this movie is a great hero, not so much a hero as a man that knows he was born to do something and is willing to do so with a smile on his face and a firm purpose in his heart.   It is not for nothing that this man has been called "the real Napoleon." He was a great soldier and a great general. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie has the perfect combination of acting, comedy, and love scenes, and I've been waiting for this one for a long time now.   It looks gorgeous with its glossy cinematography and lush music.  I really enjoy the movie's music, but it's especially awesome in scenes when there's no music or dialogue.  The acting is excellent, and the movie feels fresh every time you watch it, thanks to the fantastic writing and direction. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A funny movie about the dangers of life. There are many good jokes in this movie, and the characters have many good quirks to them. There is not a bad joke in this film, which is not saying much.   I gave this a two out of three stars, because of a couple of minor problems. One minor problem, and one major. The minor problem is that the film is about a man who is in a life threatening situation, and he wants a friend to help him out. The man is called Sam. His best friend is a woman, named Annie. Sam and Annie are trying to escape the life of danger in the desert. They are trying, but they are running out of time. Sam knows that Annie is not trustworthy, so he needs to act fast. When they get to the next town, he and Annie have to do a funny thing to escape. The problem is the movie does not have any kind of story that makes any sense. Sam is running from his friends, and Annie is trying to get him to do funny things to avoid them. I did not laugh, but I didn't hate it. There was plenty of humor in it, but it just doesn't make sense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must see for people who like good old movies.   The movie doesn't really stick around, and that's the problem with it.  If you haven't seen it before and you're like me, then you're gonna love it. The story is told from the perspective of the characters in this movie, and they are all so likable.  It is so fun watching these characters run around and try to get a job.  There is a scene at the end where the characters run to the river with a fishing net and they catch a big fish.  They put a big bag with the fish and a couple other things in the car and then they head off to go and do something.  I can't help but smile when I watch these two great characters make a huge mistake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this is a sequel to "The Thing".   One thing I love about this movie is that the film takes place in the '70s, so I guess this means that there will be a lot of 80s style horror movies in the future.   The film doesn't really try to reinvent the wheel, but it's still good.  A great director, and a great cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. It is based on a true story. A man was arrested for having sex with a man's wife (which is what the police said) and he was charged with first-degree rape and other charges, but the prosecutor who handled the case was a very experienced woman. She knew the right lawyer and, in a last-ditch effort to save her client, told the judge that he was not the real rapist because he had an erection while having sex. The judge didn't believe the prosecution lawyer and sentenced him to life in prison.    It's a good story, but I have to give it some points because of the movie itself. The movie was actually shot on a sound stage. It was a good idea, but not executed well. I'm still laughing about how they put on the fake handcuffs and put the woman's hand on a real gun.  The movie is pretty much perfect; it has a good cast of actors and even though it is a short movie it doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't overly dramatic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is not like a regular "boredom leads to a tragedy" movie. This movie has the right mix of comedy, drama and a little romance (that makes the romance not as bad as it might seem...).   The comedy is very subtle, but still funny, sometimes funny enough to make me laugh out loud.   Overall, this movie is a classic, and I hope that this movie will come out every year (if there is still a year) since the cast (and director) have aged well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at the end of the month in the early 70s (probably in a midnight showing in a local movie house) and it was wonderful. It was a fun, enjoyable movie. I have to say this is one of the more unusual films I have ever seen - the scenes were quite unique for a silent movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can you say about a film like The Green Inferno?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I must say that I was extremely intrigued by the premise. A couple of guys go to a creepy house on a remote hill. While there, they find a secret tunnel. Once they enter it, they discover the entire house is filled with an assortment of odd creatures. The plot is rather predictable, but the acting was top notch.   The only negative thing about this movie is that the music is just awful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I watched this film about a week ago.   There are a lot of people who have been in these kinds of films before but this one is a nice one.  It has an excellent lead performance by Peter Fonda, who is playing a detective.  He is very nice and the rest of the acting is pretty good too.  This is one of those rare cases where the bad things are good and the good things are bad.  I don't even think that I really liked this movie.  To me it is too slow, too uninspired, and just too dull.  If it had been the old-fashioned type of detective story this movie could have been really entertaining but it is just too ordinary.  The film is full of good ideas but they are not really developed enough to have any lasting power.  What is very unusual about this kind of film is that it is very, very slow.  Peter Fondy (who is playing the detective) is driving in a limo and he is talking about the death of his ex-wife and his own problems.  They are both in a very ordinary suburban type of town.  Fonda has a good role and I like him a lot.  There is a really good and interesting mystery.  But this movie is just so ordinary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, the movie is amazing. The characters are all good, and the plot is great. The movie has a very good romance, and a few good horror scenes.   There is also one really good scene where a guy falls in a river and has a heart attack, only to come to a rescue with his motorcycle.    The plot twists are good, but not too hard.  The ending is nice, but can be a little abrupt.  A good movie, well worth watching, just one small flaw - the ending was pretty sudden, but it's understandable in the movie's situation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film in which the writer/director could be forgiven for his over-expansive vocabulary.   I enjoyed this film quite a lot, though I have my misgivings about it.  I believe that the plot is somewhat contrived and over-dramatized, which makes the film a little too melodramatic for me.  The story itself is more than enough, but in addition to that, the film is pretty darn silly.  This is not a bad film by any means, but rather a film that is enjoyable by the light of its own merits.

It has a lot of characters, each of them has his own little story to tell. The movie opens with a little girl getting married to a big man, who does not care for the little girl, only treating her like a child, and a priest who wants to sacrifice her to the demons. She decides to fight back and kills a lot, and when they capture her, they keep her chained in a box. The next day the priest gets his revenge and sacrifices a lot more people, including the little one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There have been many good films out there about the Vietnam War, but it was a little surprising to see one that was made in the 80s.   It's a well acted, beautifully shot film about the daily life of a young, American soldier who is going to war. It's an honest portrayal of a conflict that has so much to say about the human condition that is made even better by its realism. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am surprised with how well the movie goes about being a good film. I like it because it is a movie that will have its share of comedy and not much else.   My only real complaints are the music. It is not bad but it is not so great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Aliens" franchise is one of my favorite movies of all time.   This one is a little bit different.  The story is fairly simple, and has a decent sense of humor, but the characters are just flat.  For a movie about alien invaders, this is like some kids movie about zombies.  It is all "the aliens came, they're coming over the hill, the aliens are coming." The whole movie is pretty much just "the alien invaders are coming.  This is one that I would have loved to have seen in the '70's or early '80's, but I'll take a good Aliens movie any day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed the film in general, but I enjoyed it most of all for its portrayal of a couple of young lovers:        In the first minute of the film, we find a beautiful girl, whose name is "A.J." (which translates to "Little Angel").   "AJ" is a bit of a loner, who is very timid, shy, and awkward. Her favorite hobby is watching movies, and she can do nothing about her beauty. She seems to have a troubled relationship with her mother, who disapproves of A.J. And her father is a deadbeat.   However, at the beginning of the movie, A. J. is in love with a boy named "L.H." (Lincoln Henry). He is not a very good looking boy, with a very large nose, and a thin face. However, his face is beautiful, and the eyes are hypnotizing. I believe that A. j. is attracted to him because his eyes are beautiful. A.j. asks her to have sex with him every night for a year, and to give him a gift of a diamond ring every single night. She is a shy girl, and when she gets into bed with L.H., A.H. does not know what to do. It is clear to A. H. that he loves the boy, and he wants to have him, so he tells A.A. to put on a dress, and dance for him.  She does not understand the meaning of these words, and A. A does not like it at all. However she does not speak, and does not dance, so L. H.'s father finds out and sends the boy to a home for troubled girls.  "Lincoln" was the name of the character L.S. in a film of mine that was released by MCA a few years ago.  L. S. is a character in a play by Lillian Smith. I know a lot of people have enjoyed the movie because L. J.'s parents liked him. I have no idea what the girl's reaction to the idea of L.J.'s having sex with her was. I can't imagine the effect it must have had on her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most enjoyable, engaging, and entertaining movies ever made.   What's not to like?   A young woman living in a small rural town becomes involved in a romance with a much older man.  They become engaged.  Things go bad.  But, the good news is that there are plenty of things going for them.  The town is small.  A man and his son, an elderly man, and a few local women and children, all love the movie.  This is just a well-made, fun story, with some great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off strong. The first person, one shot, shot for shot, best of the lot, you could easily argue this is the best movie of the year. The main characters, a young guy (Evan) and a young lady (Michelle) who is his girlfriend (Eve) are in a big car crash. They get out and see an old house and they decide to go in and look around. They see a strange man (Ricky) standing in front of a door and a note that says "come out and you will see the same thing as you left and more" and a picture of a big cat. They go to the door and it looks different from the house they just saw. The old man is there with a big knife. They try to open the door. The door opens and there is no one there. The man is still standing and the cat is gone. They decide they want to get out but the door will not open. They start to make a run for it, but there is a big tree in the way. Evan sees a little kid and runs over to him. The little kid picks up a rock and starts throwing it at the tree, but Evan, who is a lot older than the kid, takes a swing at the child. The kid runs off but the big man is following them. He pulls out a pistol and shoots Evan. The child hits the big guy with the rock but the rock gets stuck in the tree. The boy is running off when the man with the gun comes up behind him and shoots him in the neck. The movie ends with a little girl playing in a tree who falls off.   The first 3 minutes are great.  It begins very badly. The two characters are talking and Evan and Eve are in front a door. There is no sign of any sort of door. One man has a knife and looks at the other man. Then the little girl comes running up and Eve's brother has the cat. It is hard to describe this film, but it is very good. The big man has more than enough to deal with, and this is a movie that should be seen in a large theatre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg and his movies. I have watched "War of the Worlds" as a teenager and "The Color Purple" and "Jaws" as an adult. "Schindler's List" is a Spielberg movie but with an edge. Spielberg was very good at making a movie for a different generation. He did not use special effects like "A Clockwork Orange" did or jump cuts like "E.T." This movie was made with a low budget in a studio in New York. The acting in this movie is good and so is the directing. Spielberg does not go overboard with his special effects but he did not have to. He is the best Spielberg and this movie was a great success.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not great, but it is well-written. It is very slow-paced, as one would expect from a historical romance. It has a story that is compelling, but there are moments when the characters do not really fit together, so you have to wait to see what happens. There are scenes that are very good, and there are a few scenes that you can't really get your head around. There is a long scene where one of the characters is in a car that crashes into the opposite end of a house. He is then carried to a house in the middle of the desert. The entire scene is beautiful, with beautiful scenery, and you can imagine a beautiful scene in the desert, with the sun setting and the sand sparkling. But the movie is very, very long. So if you can watch this movie in one sitting, it is worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You don't know, but I have to say it.   There's some sort of love story between a male and a female, which is more than a few times interrupted by a police officer, an injured man, and a group of street children.  This is the kind of thing you can find in any film that's a comedy, but there's an added twist.  After he sees a car going over a bicycle, he goes home and tells his wife about the accident.  He then goes to bed, but later wakes up to find his wife with a different man, with his pants falling down.  So, you can see there's a big difference between a romantic comedy and a police comedy.  But what is also funny is that the police officer is a detective, and he has the same kind of relationship with the female as he does with the male.  I'm not sure if he's homosexual or just a little bit crazy, but he is the most entertaining detective I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to try to find the positives about this movie, but the worst part about this film is its music and score.   This movie is about a black man named George Giddings who lives on a farm.  He's a good farmer and has a son, Jimmy Giddins, who's good looking, good natured, and very clever.  On one of their family's frequent trips to the movies, the two get in a fight that leads to Gidding and Jimmy being sent to the town jail.  Jimmy is then ordered by the head of the local gang to find a job.  There, Jimmy is captured by a mob and taken to the local town jail where the jail guard asks Jimmy to go to his room and lock him in.  After Jimmy finishes locking the door, he tries to talk his way out of it and gets a bit drunk.  Unfortunately for Jimmy, the jailer then takes him outside and leaves him to his fate.  The movie ends with Jimmy being murdered in a car wreck.  It's a little bit predictable but that's about it.  What is somewhat ironic about this is that the movie is set in the 1930's.  If you were looking for a good western, look elsewhere. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie is based on a true story.

This is a great movie and I recommend to everyone to watch this movie and like me you have to watch it at least once a month.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first scene is one of the best scenes in a movie to be found in recent years.  The movie plays out very much like a modern version of a classic tale of a witch who wants to turn herself into a beautiful young maiden by the sea.  This movie is set in the 1930's and tells the story of a young woman named Margaret (Jennifer Ehle) who has just returned from a visit to Europe where she is hoping to be married to a handsome young man named William (John Malkovich).  Margaret's story begins when her family becomes the unwitting targets of an evil spirit who forces her to become a witch and to hunt down a beautiful man who has been murdered.  Unfortunately Margaret finds herself in a position that is almost exactly the opposite of what she had planned on when she set out on her trip, when she returns to her home in New York she finds that a young man has murdered her family and now she has no choice but to become the most wicked witch around and to travel across the world in search of a spell to turn her back into a mere girl.  Jennifer Ehle is perfect as Margaret.  Her character is very well written and her reaction to her new life is very realistic.  Even though Margaret is a very pretty woman, she is not an attractive woman and her character becomes even more compelling as the movie continues to unfold.    This is a film of a very good quality.  When I saw this movie I did not expect anything from it and when it was finished I was pleasantly surprised.  To be honest I have not seen any other movie like this in recent times and I really hope that other people will see this one.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in witches and magic and the way they interact with their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the true story of the life and death of the famous film critic Roger Ebert.   Ebert started out his career as a copy boy at a local movie theatre, and over time built up a reputation as one of the best critics around. His critical acumen and love of film quickly earned him the admiration of film's most prestigious institutions and awards.  The movie that made Ebert famous was, of course, the Academy Award-winning film Chicago (1989).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good guys: This is a pretty good movie. It does have a few problems, but the good guys get through them all with a little help from a sympathetic doctor. The bad guys: Well, I don't really like them as much as the good guy characters. It all boils down to the fact that this is a sci-fi movie that has a bunch of bad guys.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'll try to be concise: the idea of a high school is a pretty awesome premise. It should be a perfect blend of all the things that make a good teen movie: heart, comedy, good characters, and even a little romance. Well, it isn't that great. There are some really cool setpieces and a good part of it is pretty well done, but it isn in places really predictable. As a whole though, I liked it very much, even though I think it could have been better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good, no doubt about it. It takes place in an Italian restaurant, the owner is a bit of an asshole, and I felt bad about a guy that goes there once in a while.   This movie doesn't deal with the subject that is probably the most important in the world today:  It's a great movie about the effects of war on people and animals.  This is the only reason the movie will remain in my movie collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it's the perfect movie for the holidays, if only because it's about Santa Claus and the elves. If you're a fan of these types of movies you'll love this one.   - Rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .     The first half of this movie is pretty much the same as the previous ones: the protagonist's girlfriend has to leave him because he doesn't want to go to her house because she is sick, and his brother comes to rescue him.     This leads to all sorts of crazy adventures involving time travel, time travel and more time travel.  The second half of the movie is less crazy and less silly: a little more realistic and more grounded.  It also features a couple of interesting (and hilarious) characters, a good ending and an amusing song. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know this was going to be a bad movie, but I thought it would be really funny! I'm not really a fan of horror, so I was looking forward to it.   It is a really funny, silly little movie.  This is one of those movies that was made by a bunch of little people, and it works pretty well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of bad movies in my life and this is a really good one. It is dark, intense and well acted. I have never seen a movie so sad and scary. There is no hope for the future, but that is all part of life. There are some people who look for this kind of movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of film noir. When I was a kid, I went to see films like The Third Man and The Third Woman, and even though I don't understand the plot, I'm still fascinated by this genre. The plot is simple, but it's not simple: a young man, played by Edward G. Robinson, becomes obsessed with a prostitute named Celeste (played by Jane Russell) and her mysterious past.   Robinson is perfect as the young man's friend: he's easy to love, but at the same time, he's not stupid.  He's also not a bad guy, but he's definitely a character I wouldn't want to be in the same room with.  After seeing the film, I know I will watch it again in a few years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very fun and funny flick!   I like to laugh at bad movies!  This movie reminds me of the movies I watched as a child and have seen many times over!  It is a great mix of funny, gross and downright silly.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the summer of 1982, after a long and tiring search for an "A" for his high school graduating class, Tom Cruise finds his "A." This is a high-speed chase in a high school, a school of dreams. It is a chase. It's the chase of a lifetime. And there's no way you can outrun this car, Mr. Cruise. It may have been the first time a man was in a car chase for three months and got away alive. "The Color of Money" was a high art of its time. It was, in its purest form, a film which is now a legend, and is still being appreciated in its original form. I had been searching for a film like this since I was ten, and it was the first film that left me without any doubt about it. This is an American film, as it was to be seen in America. The French and the Germans will not touch it, the Italians will not buy it, no American will ever touch it. I hope someone does something about it before it's too late.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My mom went to watch this movie when I was growing up. She was a movie fanatic, and had a special spot in her house for horror movies. There are few things in the world more depressing than watching a bad movie. I have never been so scared in my life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know, I had forgotten that this was a musical. It is. That is really not a word, but I'm willing to allow it. The film is about the love between two friends, a girl and her boyfriend. They live in a country where one night a stranger (a "magician") shows up at their door and makes a deal. You see, the magician is really a man who thinks he is a woman. He has lost his way, but he can see that he is being pursued by a man (a woman) who is a "magical" man. The "magicians" are both desperate to be accepted by the girl's parents (so they can marry), and the girl is desperate to get away from the man. Both the girl and the boy are desperate to find out what is really going on, and are ready to risk everything for the girl. As they go into the dark woods they both discover they have a magic they are ready and willing to use. This is a good film, well done, and very imaginative. It's about friendship and the power of love, and if you like that sort of thing, it's worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is one of the few films that I liked that I saw before the 90's, and it is one that shows it's age quite nicely, if a little too heavily. I think I got all the details wrong, but that is a fault of the movies I saw then. I don't remember too many movies this strong, or of this type, so I feel the film would be better remembered as a piece of entertainment than an education.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie itself is about a character who is about to be executed for the murder of his wife. In a small rural town, there are three families. One is the wife's family, the other two are his wife's families.  This movie is about the three families as they try to get revenge on the killer.  It's all very tragic as the three family's go on trial and the trial gets very convoluted as they all have different opinions about who the killer could be and how he came by the murder weapon.  I'm not really sure about the direction for the movie, it has a very tragic feel to it and there are several scenes in which the killer is shown to be very deranged.   Overall, this movie is an interesting experience, and I will definitely recommend it to those who like movies about small rural towns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've had my eye on this movie for a while, and I'm glad to see it finally hitting theaters.   Written and directed by David Ayer, this is a really good, low-key actioner about the aftermath of a major crime.  The movie is based on a true story from 1973, in which a guy named Mike (played by Chadwick Boseman) is shot by a crook while walking his dog in the middle of the day.  It has a good mixture of action and romance, with some clever dialogue and a nice soundtrack.  One interesting thing about it is that you can tell the guy has a crush on the girl (Jada Pinkett Smith), who lives across the street.  There's some great use of color in this movie, particularly during the chase sequences.  Overall, I think Ayer did a good job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are lots of good movies out there, but none better than this one. I can't imagine a movie better than the one I watched tonight. There's a great deal of drama and pathos, but this film is never sentimental or self-indulgent. It's simply a great film about a great man who was a wonderful guy, and a great American.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so very sorry to say that this was my first time watching The Big Lebowski but I'm glad I gave it a shot.   My husband and I watched it together about an hour before he went to bed last night.  I was very intrigued by the title of the movie.  The story itself was fun and entertaining.  It was also funny and I loved the characters.  One of the main characters in this movie was the most entertaining character ever created.  His name is Walter Sobchak and he's a crazy alcoholic who wears a leotard.  You can't help but be enamored by the story and the characters and you feel sorry for this guy.  If only you could meet the other characters in the movie as well.  We all know there's a great scene in this film in which one character takes off his clothes and the other character laughs and says "He's beautiful, isn't he?"   It's pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a real-life mystery of the first class and one of the finest of all of the Indian movies. It is a good film with some good dialogs and great songs. The story is also very good. It also has good action, action that is more than what is shown in the movies.   It is very good to see a movie about a train of trains where the first one to arrive at the terminus was the biggest train to carry anything. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching the recent 'Frozen' movie, I thought of this movie as a good sequel. The movie was great and I loved the soundtrack too.   I was disappointed with the character in this movie because they changed so much of his character from the previous movie. He's much more reserved now and it's not a good thing.  I thought the movie was not as good as I remembered it being because of all the changes they made to the character and to the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a movie about a family with a history of domestic violence and abuse, it's pretty hard not to want to turn away, at least from the movie itself.   It is the kind of movie that is hard to watch as it is, and is certainly not something you could watch and get a good feeling about a whole lot of stuff.  It takes the time to do things right, not in a cheap, cheap way, but by using the story to build it's characters in a manner that is well done and realistic.  The film has a very well done atmosphere to it.  This movie is more about the story that tells us how things go when there is no good time for it. It's a quiet movie with great dialogue.  I think it could have been better but it's still a good flick to take a break from the usual genre stuff.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie in years. It was an awesome movie.   What the hell was wrong with people when they didn't know what the name was?   It's a great movie. Don't watch it before you're 15 years old, because that's when you're going to have fun with the little kids in this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When this movie was first made in 1964, it was a disaster. But the makers of the film managed to overcome all the disasters that they created in this movie and came up with an epic adventure film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film and the performances are all quite good and they really made me feel sorry for the villain in this film.   The main villain and his cronies (not quite bad guys) in this flick are rather stereotypical and are not all that menacing or evil.  Also a lot of this movie has a similar theme. The main antagonist seems to be the same type of villain in many films, and it all seems to end up being pretty sad.  The movie ends with the hero, the one that we care for, dying.  I thought I had a bad case of bad movie syndrome, and I was right...   Overall this is a film that has a lot going for it...but it is not a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good, but it's not the kind of good that will make you gasp and jump up and down and think, "Yikes!" It's great fun, with good ideas, but there are too many silly moments, and the acting isn't quite up to the usual level. It's a little hard to tell what's going on at first, but then you remember that this is a comedy that's all about the comedy, and it's hilarious. It features a lot of big, goofy characters, and we have no idea where the story is going, so there's plenty of chances to catch up with them. I'm not sure how many more like this one I can get through. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good example of a film with a good ending. If this is an introduction to the genre then I can see how the film would appeal to a lot of people. It has great production values, and a nice story.   Overall   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was skeptical about this movie, as the trailer did not look good, and I expected some of the scenes to be out of date. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised, with the film's originality, its sense of humor, its heart, its good writing, its acting, its performances, and its sense that this is a really good movie.   The main character is the son of a wealthy man who is dying, and his wish is to visit the past and the future. The present day is a strange, dark, strange place, and so is the future - they both have a lot of weird, twisted characters. The movie is not about the future (like I expected), but about the past. It's not a movie about the world, though, although we get to see its buildings, its people, its culture, and the characters and their interactions.    This is a real, genuine movie - the most realistic, even, movie I have seen in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best horror films I've seen in quite a while. The movie does a great job of creating a mood that is both creepy and exhilarating at the same time. The way the characters are portrayed as people who are living out their lives at their own pace is a very refreshing thing to see.    I am definitely going to watch this movie again soon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an action movie in which we can't help but laugh, I liked it.   The action is good, and the movie looks like a decent one at that.  One thing that's a bit annoying is the "dancing girl". It's not like you'd see a dancer in that sort of movie.  I was also a bit disappointed with the ending, although it has some good moments.  If the movie had been released 20 years ago, it would have been a huge hit, but then no one was as interested in that kind of movie then. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of the show I am not sure how I feel about this movie. It is funny and it has some pretty good visuals and sound to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll admit I'm an absolute sucker for good action movies.   I was completely drawn into this movie due to my love for the action genre and the action movies I see in the theater.  In the movie, a few months after the end of World War II, a group of former members of the Nazi Party return to England to try to help make things right and bring their old boss to justice.  The film is shot in a dark, gritty fashion and uses the most realistic portrayal of Nazi Germany that you're likely to see.  There's a good mix of action and character development that keeps this movie from going stale.  This is a great film to check out before you pass the baton to another film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a time and place for all things, and this movie is just about perfect for that.   The only thing that isn't perfect is the film itself, but it doesn't even matter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've got a good appetite to start with and don't mind a little violence and blood, I highly recommend       A man comes into the desert to get his revenge. I don't really know the details of this movie, but it has a couple of good lines and a couple good scenes.   In all seriousness though, it's not my cup of tea. I won't recommend it to everyone, but if you're looking for a good action movie with lots of blood and action, then this might be it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a film where the good, bad and mediocre happen.   It is about two people (a black male and a white female) who meet in a diner.  They get on pretty well. The black male likes to talk about the "good old days" (which were bad) while the white female likes to complain about the bad.  After a bit of that, they have a conversation about a woman, who was shot to death.  It doesn't really make much sense.  There was a murder?  It makes you wonder if they are the same person.  The blacks' story (not really a good one) makes it difficult to enjoy the film at all.  I can't recommend this one for someone who is looking for a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie's pretty much exactly what I wanted from a sci-fi movie, and what I've always wanted from movie after movie, which is a feeling of peace and understanding of things. The movie's about a guy who can literally do anything he wants to anyone, and a young girl who decides to help him by going on a space ship with him. What's the real story? Why did this happen? The ending is pretty cool, and it does end, but only in the sense that it's a cool ending. I would recommend this movie for anybody who's a fan of sci-fies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good, old fashioned story. It is not the sort of story that you can easily get off your butt and do, as it were, because you are a busy guy. The story is told mostly in a flashback fashion. But that doesn't matter too much. There are several things that do matter.   It is a story about a man who is having an affair with a woman who has just gotten out of prison.  It's a story that is filled with drama.  I'm not sure what it is about this movie that is so good. It's just a story, about a woman trying to get out of a terrible situation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie   had a good plot and good characters.   My favorite scene was the one at the end where our hero had just finished telling a group of kids about his adventures.  One of the kids said "you never really learn how to use a sword until you have to" and I thought that was a wonderful sentiment.  The action in this movie was pretty good. It was a well-told story, although not one that I'd recommend to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched many, many movies, and all have been interesting to me in different ways. This movie is in my opinion more like an epic of the medieval period. It has a great cast, and a story that has a lot of depth to it. It is very hard to find a good place to begin this movie.   The movie opens with the knights going to their final battle with the enemy. A great battle that the audience will enjoy.  The battle is very well done. The characters all have different motivations and I can see where they are coming from. The acting is top notch.  It ends as a grand old battle.  This movie was a real treat to watch, and I was glad I watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the kind of film that can easily be rated 5 stars without having seen it. It is a terrific film about two young lovers who live in an isolated cabin in the woods.

It features great acting and scenery, a good-time score, and lots of laughs and slapstick.

He didn't have the best of health, but   this movie made him smile.  The movie was about two veterans who return from Iraq with PTSD and a long battle with their mental illness.  This movie was good fun, and did a nice job of showing the war and what it was like.  There is a lot of humor in this movie, which is rare for a movie made in the 1970s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really good movie, and that's saying a lot.   If this movie had the ability to make people care, I probably would have found the film more interesting than it was.  A lot of the time I felt as if I was watching a bad horror movie.  What's a horror movie you ask?   The best way to describe a horror film is a movie where you have two groups of people battling the same creature.  And what did the film accomplish?  When it started the audience knew that what was about to happen was wrong.  Not for the first time in a horror flick (The Sixth Sense, Friday the 13th, etc.).   When the creature starts to attack one group of people, all of the adults run to the exit to be left alone.  The one group that doesn't want to be scared is the little boy.  After one group is forced to flee, the little kid goes in to the house and finds the creature.     What happened next was amazing.  All of the kids ran into the room, the adult's ran to their beds and then the little guy just stood there waiting.  There is a little girl who was in the room in the second group that wasn't as terrified as everyone else.  But the little girl is not scared at all.  While the other kids and the parents are running into the house, she stands in the door, looks down and then turns and walks out.  When she looks up and sees the creature standing over the boy she runs out the door and is never seen or heard from again.  As I mentioned, the one thing that scared me was the creature, but the other groups of kids and adults in the house who were running in to be saved were all just plain scary.  It was a shame that the little one is never shown again because I would have loved to have seen a little glimpse of the little thing.  I will never not be scared by a good monster movie and the kids in this movie are all well done and I really enjoyed watching the kids run in and out of the house.

From the first moment I met the director (a young Italian actor named Luciano Pavarotti), to the last (my favorite scene), the director never lets the emotions of the characters fade.  The last scene (with the music) is a classic, and it made my day, and I loved every single second of this movie!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a wonderful combination of genres.   With the beautiful animation and good acting it is a really enjoyable film.  The music is very nice as well, with some lovely piano and violin pieces and some very nice melodies in the background.  This film would be an amazing story to tell in a class, as it takes place in an abandoned house.  A little girl and a little boy wander around the house and try to find a way out, while trying to get rid of the evil that surrounds them.  There are some really nice scenes in the film. There are also some really wonderful scenes in it. The film could be quite a good horror film, if you don't mind a little bit of slow pacing and lots of scary music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am happy to see that the films were given a wide release in the US, because it is not possible to find a movie like this anymore.   The story of this movie is a mix between the stories of the great American authors; George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, and E.M. Forster.  It starts with a young woman who is having trouble dealing with a very sad and pathetic situation and her attempts to make sense of it.  As a woman who knows the meaning of suffering, the scene she is in is not a happy one. The first person she sees is an elderly man. He has become very poor through bad farming and is looking for an exit from the world he now has to live in.  She says nothing and waits for his response, but his response is that he is tired and wants to take a nap. This could easily be a scene that was inserted in any Hollywood movie to set the mood, but this is not Hollywood.  The next scene is a young man with a sad story. His story is of a man he saw murdered.  He was found with a bullet wound to the head, and he says that he did not want to kill the old man because he knew the old, and knew he would be sad about the young man.  If anyone has ever met this man it will be difficult to find the words to describe the misery of his story, as his sadness and helplessness permeate every aspect of his being.  After being told about his experience in the movie, I found myself asking, why did the author decide to use this story, which was of such a sad and sadistic nature?   It is obvious that the writer had taken a lot of personal experiences from himself and the people he knows.  And this is exactly what the story is about; the suffering of the individual and the suffering and humiliation of others. It is not about the struggle of the rich versus the poor. This is not the case.  This is about the suffering a man or a woman can feel in a world that has no care or compassion for them. The main point is that the people are not treated with kindness, but only disdain.  What kind of world is this? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so impressed by this movie that it gave me the urge to write a review.   Not many films are able to make you want to run after your girl for a good hour.  She was absolutely stunning in her red velvet outfit and the sexy poses she was able to pull off in her low cut black dress were truly amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So here's the story:  This movie, the film that brought the most "funny" actor into the world to play a role, a role which, to be honest, seems to be a lot like a kid who is a tad on the mean side, and is a bit more on the "evil" side than his character in the book would have you think.  This character, named Tom, plays a part as a bit of a joker.   He seems to enjoy his role in the film (and the role is a little bit like a comic relief), but as the film moves along, there's a growing sense that he's having the time of his life.  With this comes a lot of hilarity and a lot more of a sense of fun, which is good, since he's supposed to be on the wrong side of the law.  Tom's girlfriend (played by Jennifer Beals) is the epitome of an overly-serious romantic comedienne.  And when her boyfriend leaves her in a moment of anger, a very emotional Tom doesn't know what to do, so he decides to throw his girlfriend across the room to her death.  So a lot goes wrong, a lot is thrown and, in the end, the two find a solution to the problem:  They kiss.  But it's not a happy kiss.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished this movie because I found it very difficult to stop watching after a few seconds. I loved the plot, the acting, the music, the comedy, the romance, and the cinematography.   It has a few flaws though, mostly in the characters and the acting. The movie is supposed to focus on a character who is being held hostage, but then the whole movie is the character who was being held. He is then a little kid (with a dog?) who learns to play chess and other chess games, he gets to be the captain of a chess club, he finds his way to the palace of the ruler of his country, he has a beautiful relationship with a princess, he is able to solve some puzzles and solve the plot.  The whole time I was looking forward to a better ending.  As far as the plot goes, it is pretty good. The actors are very good.  While the movie is good, there is a lot of romance and funny scenes that didn't sit well with me.  I think it would be better as a children's movie rather than a family film.  If you enjoyed this movie, then I suggest you go out and watch some other movies and try to think of something that's similar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not sure what my expectations for this film were. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, and usually those bad movies are the kind you would be embarrassed to show your kids, especially in front of strangers, but this is a very good one.   The story follows a woman in love with a man who works in a bar that has a lot going for it. The woman falls in love and then dies from a heart attack, and the man finds himself in a terrible dilemma. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   It's the second half of the movie that's good:  - the second third of the film is all about the people who run the club. And it's a good club: they're fun, they're smart, they've got a good sense of humor, they don't drink too much, and they're all good people: good fun, and the one guy they call "Mr. Bumble-Wumba" has a very dry sense of wit and a very bad sense of fashion.  - they're great dancers, and it's very funny watching the guys dance and do their routines.   For a movie about the local club scene, it's mostly good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie about a year and a half ago. It's a great movie about an American boy who is a member of the French resistance.   The movie itself is a great one. It features French Resistance members. It is funny. It has a great sound. The French Resistance were pretty good at their job. I'm not sure what it is about the movie that is so good. I just like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original Star Wars was one of the few truly good movies ever made.   I was 13 years old when I saw the first Star Wars.  I watched the original trilogy in my father's apartment.  A little boy could handle a story like that.  George Lucas did a terrific job with the special effects and made the film seem real.  He was able to make a story out of a galaxy far, far away so realistically that I was amazed when the first trailer came out and the image of an Imperial Star Destroyer was so realistic that I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  The only drawback to the original Star wars was that Luke Skywalker was a bit of a wuss.  For that reason the prequel trilogy was necessary.  It was a good film because I enjoyed the characters more than I would have liked to.  You could watch the prequels in a weekend and then see the original film a few years later and be pretty much the same person.  In the preQUELS Leia is a bit more responsible.  But that is all part of the charm of the preqels.  Han Solo and Princess Leia are my favorite Star Wars characters.  So many great lines.  They were all fun to watch.  Leia was a great actress in the preqsels.   I wish I could tell you about the prequestions.   They were hilarious.  One of my favorite things about them was the way they used special effects.  Some of them worked better than others.  There were also times when it looked like someone had stepped out of an old Disney cartoon and made an action movie.  When we first started seeing all of the new characters we were a little intimidated and wondered what they were going to do.  Sometimes the pre quels were more entertaining than the original movies.  Lucas has created a really wonderful universe.  People seem to like the pre QUELS.  However, I don't find myself as impressed by them as I was by the originals.  If there is a sequel to the pre quests it will probably not be any good.  And it will be hard to watch the original films because they will seem old.  My favorite part of Star Wars is the soundtrack.  That is all Lucas' doing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a wonderful story, well done, well directed, well acted, well written and well acted. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that was so good and this one has a lot of things to say.   A big part of the movie is how it portrays the relationship between John and Rebecca. We see them through John's eyes and we see the depth that John is willing to go through to save Rebecca. When John realizes he needs to put Rebecca in danger in order to save her, he does not hesitate and when he has to make a difficult decision, he makes it. When Rebecca finally comes to terms with what she has done to John and realizes that it was the wrong thing to do, she does not waver in her love for him.    We get to see John be a good father to Rebecca and the two of them have an awesome relationship and you can see them grow to love each other.  I loved how well written the story was and how John came to see what he had done to Rebecca was wrong and when it was done, it was too late.  The last third of the film is the best part of it and really shows the growth of the relationship of John and his relationship with Rebecca and how that will ultimately lead to the downfall of the man who does all of this to Rebecca. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all - this is a good, action-packed, heartwarming movie about a girl who gets lost in a labyrinth and finds a treasure map.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only "bad" part about this movie is that all of the people who die in this movie are so cool.    You would think that this would be a more boring movie.  But, nope, there are some really cool people who kill themselves in a movie that, while entertaining, is very over the top. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off the reviews of this movie don't count. It's not a bad movie by any means and it's definitely a movie worth seeing. The plot is a good setup to a bad sequel, but it doesn't live up to the previous film, which was a far more enjoyable film.   The story is all about a group of people in a small town getting along with one another. They live together and are happy with each other. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I would see the day when a big screen movie would try to scare the pants off of us.   From the very first scene, when our heroine (a little girl) is awakened by the cries of her dead mother, we are instantly transported into a world which we are all supposed to love.  This is a movie where even a child can enjoy.  And you know what?   The movie's greatest accomplishment is that despite the very real and very upsetting events that take place, we never lose our ability to appreciate the beauty of a beautiful child who knows how to get away from her parents while she waits for her mummy to come and get her.  When I heard that Michael Shannon had been cast in the part, my first thought was "I can't wait to see how this movie's going to be like."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is basically a re-working of the story of "The Exterminator" starring Richard Dreyfuss,   but this time there is a different villain named Lord Vortech,  who is basically the "Hannibal Lecter" of the 1980s.  He is a super smart guy, who has his own laboratory for creating super-villains, who can make you kill people just by talking.  Vortek, or Vorteck as his enemies called him, is more like a psychopath than an evil mastermind, as he is driven by the desire to see humans die from his experiments.   His only goals are to kill humans by means of his weapons, and then himself.  This is pretty much a standard villain from the 80's, but it is interesting to see a new twist added to this villain.  However, there are other aspects to this movie, which are more interesting than just the evil of the villain. This movie was made by a French director named Georges Franju, who had not been able to produce any good movies until he met the French movie critic Jean-Luc Godard.  Godard was also an author, who wrote a short story "The Dead" for his then famous movie, "Dirty Harry."  This story is an adaptation of this short story.  One of the most interesting elements of this story is the relationship between Vortesh, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, who plays a young detective named Nick Van Damm.  They fall in love during a routine traffic stop, and after a brief separation, Van Dammes gets back together with Vortesck, only to be murdered by him.  Van Dammel then travels to France, and becomes the "Exterminator."  VanDammel is a man who was so smart that even when he was a young boy, he used a special type of pencils. This allowed him to learn the meaning of mathematical symbols so quickly that he could write and read a book in a few seconds.  Because of this, the "exterminators" must constantly look over the city for the living dead, or the dead who will return in search of their loved ones.  Unfortunately, their job becomes very dangerous and dangerous, as they can not always rely on just themselves.  A good plot is a good plot, but the acting is also pretty good, especially in the villain Vortelc
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of movies have great songs. A lot.   I've watched this about 2-3 times in the last year or so.  It's a classic, even.  I like my westerns more simple and less fantastical but it is just a fun movie.  The western is always a good thing.  This is definitely not the first time we've seen the West.  A little too much the "cowboys and Indians" aspect of it is there, I thought that would be toned down.  No matter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   I went to see this movie because it's a pretty good horror flick with a fairly well done story.   When I saw the trailer I was hoping for an R rated version and I was somewhat disappointed.  It's a good little movie for Halloween and I think that most people will enjoy it, but I would not recommend this film to anyone who is not a little scared of the dark. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie.   It has everything you want from a good film.  A very dark movie that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about evil, crime and the law.  I've always thought evil was good at times.  It's hard to be a detective but when a detective comes along...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While the movie has its own style, the acting is actually quite good. A lot of people claim that the movie is too violent, but it doesn't bother me at all. It's not a very good action movie though, it's really about family and their love for each other. It is very entertaining, even though it is too fast paced, especially when there are too many people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a lot of great action and drama.   At the start of the movie, I saw a lot in the movie I didn't expect in the first place, especially with the ending.  It has a bit of a weird tone to it, the characters are not like the people I know.  This is something I like to see, I like the different types of characters, each one unique.  I like this movie, even though the ending is a bit weird I like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time, but I was nervous as hell about seeing it because of the poor reviews.   But I'm glad I went to see it.  I can't give too much info about it. It's a western movie about a bunch of characters that include a girl, her father, his daughter, and the sheriff who's just a regular guy who likes to hunt, ride horses, and shoot at Indians.  So the story is this girl, she's from New York and her father is from Texas.  But he's a pretty good shot, and he's hunting Indians, and they're coming in and out of the mountains on horseback. And they're pretty bad looking.  Now the main character is a guy named John Smith. He's just some poor, down-and-out guy that wants to do something that he's not supposed to do.  It was really cool to see his daughter as well, because she has a great, almost romantic relationship with him.  Anyway, Smith tries to run away from his daughter with the Indians. He gets into a lot of trouble and gets shot at by some Indians, so he gets his horse killed.  The girl's father goes to help him get back on his horse.  This is when the Indians turn on him. He has a pretty bad shot with his gun and he keeps losing it. The girl says, "Don't take it out."  And she holds it in, so that her father doesn't have to shoot her father.  Then the Indians come in, and she says, in the movie, "I'll shoot first," and she holds the gun there and she shoots it, so it goes off. She's pretty cool.  And that's the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. The story is really well done, I think it has a more serious, mature and romantic ending than most other movies in this genre.   The story goes something like this:  A young man, who has lost his father, decides to marry a beautiful woman, who is the sister of his father. The man is given to realize the mistake in his life, and in the end, the man realizes that he can be happy with someone else, and after some years, he does. The movie is shot in black and white, and there is a bit of humor in the movie, but in the very end it leaves you with a really bad feeling. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie many times over the years, but each time it is more true to life. It will bring a tear to your eye.   Cecil B. DeMille had the talent to make movies about a hero that did not have a very happy ending. The movie is centered around the story of the man known as the King. It is very interesting that the real-life Cecil B. deMille wanted to make a film about this guy. It did not stop Cecil from having some very good roles. He has a great physical comedy that is more like a Western than a historical movie. His relationship with his father is great, as is his relationship with all of his women. De Mille knew how to capture the spirit of a good man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a nutshell:  A man meets a woman who is a bit strange, and he tries to help her. He makes her his bride.   I found the story to be somewhat confusing, and that's a very common problem in the movie. There are too many questions in the story: Why did a man become a priest? Why do all the priests love to get naked? Why is the priest married to a woman with a bad back?   The story has a lot of twists and turns.  If you don't know how to deal with this type of movie, then I'm afraid it won't work for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to commend "The Wolf of Wall Street." It's a very good movie. It's very good at everything it tries. It is good at creating a fun scene, at setting up the themes of money, greed, and a broken system, at building an ensemble of actors that are as great as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill and Martin Scorsese, and at putting a great movie together. The actors are all excellent. The movie has some nice dialogue, some good performances, and some wonderful music. This is a very entertaining movie, and it really is fun to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've had this movie since it came out in 1997, and still like it more than I did when I first watched it. It's a bit of a raunchy comedy, and the whole thing is about a group of people who dress up in ridiculous costumes to go out and get wasted on a weekend. They don't have much success, and when one of them gets killed in the bathtub, they decide to put a stop to it and do everything in their power to make sure that nobody ever kills anybody again.   This is one of those movies where everyone laughs, everyone's a dick, and everyone's funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, you should definitely see this movie with a good friend, since there is so much you can learn about how to deal with bad people.   There is so many situations that are very well drawn, but none of them are out of control and you see the characters do all they can to keep control of their lives, with a couple of twists that are not really that dramatic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I don't know what kind of films are the most entertaining. If one is a film based on an actual event (no, there is not a sequel), and another one is an "epic" film, one can only be disappointed.   It looks like a very bad script, a poor acting (most of the characters, apart from one, don't seem to be able to move their heads at all), the story is about a man who is a "genius" (yes, he is an old man) who has just returned from a trip to New York (which he has forgotten about) and he is trying to find out about what has happened to the old people of his town. What he finds is quite disturbing... (I can't even imagine what kind-of horror the young girl is going to show when she's done, or maybe she will try to escape or something like that.)   I hope that it won't be released by Universal again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't explain why this was so much fun.   It was a perfect blend of humour and excitement.  If you can't laugh at a scene like that, you're not trying hard enough.  I had a blast playing with a bunch of kids and seeing all the things they could do with a toy rocket launcher.  There were lots of great references and cameos, as well as lots of gags and character development.  This was a good action movie to watch while having a picnic in the park.  It's probably my favourite of the Star Wars movies.

I like to think they are just doing their own thing. There is a boy who seems to enjoy watching the world burn. He is trying to get in on the action and the boys try to get him to join.

It's about a guy who just went away to his farm, came back with a new girlfriend and a baby (the baby is named Dax), then gets the news that his brother has been killed in an accident. The movie is mostly told from Dax's point of view but there's a lot of action as well. The story is interesting and a little bit silly but is actually very well told.  The ending is a bit strange but is still funny.  Dax is a likable character with a lot to say about a lot but is a little over the top at times.

The only thing he can do is to try to teach the son some manners but it never works. They go out of their way to help each other, they have a beautiful relationship. The film is funny. It has so much heart, it is a true story. It is beautiful.    Read more reviews at IMDb.com

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the film I had been waiting for. I saw the trailer and I have to say that it was exactly what I had wanted. I was very interested and thrilled to see a film set in an imaginary small town.   The plot of the film is simple but very effective.  The story is that a very powerful woman, called Aunt Sally, takes on a new apprentice to teach her how to become stronger. The apprentices are the people that were there when this woman arrived in this small town to teach the very young children.  She has had her eyes opened to the dangers that surround her.  One of the main themes in the film, and certainly one of the strongest in the series, is that we all do not deserve to live in a cruel world.  If one looks at the movie and feels a sense of wonder and gratitude, then I think it is safe to say, that there is hope for those that do not know what the future holds.  I have enjoyed all of the films in the Twilight Zone and was eagerly awaiting this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well made movie with a good story.   There is a little girl, a little boy, and a little dog named Spot who are all playing together.  They have an aunt and a uncle who live nearby and Spot and his mom run along side them.  The aunt thinks that the two little girls are a nuisance but she lets them keep playing because her sister was born with no hands.  Later a man comes over and spots Spot, and goes over to talk to his uncle but Spot sees him and runs away.  After a while the man goes to his sister who has a hand and she tells the little boys that her sister is having a baby.  When the woman sees the hand she goes in to give birth, but doesn't have a lot of luck.  She takes a little scissors to make a cut on her hand and there's no problem, but the scissors get stuck in her hand.  Luckily her mom came in to help her.  But the mom is having trouble with the scissors, so she tells them to go play in the snow outside.  So the little boy goes outside and plays, the little girl stays in the house, and the dog stays with the aunt and uncle.  There are some good moments with the girl being very nice and helping the man out and helping to give the uncle a drink, and then the dogs are playing a game of hide and seek with the little hand and the aunt goes in and takes them away. It's an entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie a few years ago as part of a group of old films that was on the small screen in a small town near me. It's not really a bad movie, it's just about a man who goes to his grave in order to be remembered, so he goes back in time to the last moments of his life and finds that his time with his wife has left him very bitter and despondent about life. This is one of those films I watch so that I can tell other people about it so that the word spreads and more people see it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a kid I loved movies about people who didn't know how to do things. These movies gave me all the thrills of being an adult in a movie.   These days movies like "Gone Baby Gone" give me the thrill of going to the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good old-fashioned, rousing tale of good guys fighting evil. I can honestly say it's one of the finest animated movies of all time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's all in the name, a little over-the-top, but it works.   I didn't think it was possible to be completely ridiculous, but here it is.  It isn't a comedy, but a very surreal and silly movie about a man who loses his sense of taste when he tries a new restaurant.  He goes out of his mind eating some food that has a strange smell, and the only thing that calms him down is a hot dog.  The humor comes not only from the ridiculous characters, but also from the food itself.  And I like the name: Bikini Bottom  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the first time I can say I really liked this movie. The movie is about a man and woman who were together and had a child together who had a stroke and passed away. The only thing I don't like is that the movie was only made in 1970 and it took me a while to find the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In spite of being a remake of a classic movie, The Mummy Returns, the movie looks like it's been made for the TV.   The film looks like a television series.  I liked that.  The mummy is a bit of a lame henchman.  He's a guy who takes the money of the rich and then doesn't give a damn about it.  It's almost like his name is "The Mummy's Uncle".  The creature himself isn't a bad looking guy either, he's just a bit under-sized, so it's not very scary.  Still, the movie isn't bad, I suppose, it's just that it isn't really scary. It's like a really bad TV show where you can't make out anything.  At the same time, you could say the movie's only goal is to make you want to see it again.  This could be a good thing, or a bad thing.  Maybe people will want to watch a remake.  In the end, I'll stick to my original review of the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I can't recommend the movie, because it isn't very good. I'm a bit surprised that it is only a 3.5 because it has a lot of action and the effects are really good and funny at the same time. You may like it or not but there's no good. If you want to see the most extreme scenes of human nature in action then this is a great place to go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first movie of my career. I did not know anything about film at that time. When I started I thought it was a bad movie, but it grew on me as I watched it. The story is very good. It has a very good ending. I liked it very much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the movie but I read reviews. And I like it!   It's a very good movie.   The director, Don Coscarelli, is a professional. He knows what he's doing.  I like a lot of people in this movie. And, a lot are funny.  It was very funny in the beginning but there were a couple of scenes which were just plain nasty. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film years ago in the 80's but I haven't seen it since and I had forgotten about it because the quality of the film was so poor and because of its time and because it was directed by a guy who was only interested in making a dumb action movie.   But then when I saw it a few months ago on TV, I remembered all these things and saw how the film had been done with such intelligence. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        In terms of a good film, this is one that has a high amount of potential.   The story that's told is something that could've been told years ago and it is a story that I'm looking forward to seeing on the big screen.  In the end of the day, it's a story about a young boy who has fallen in love with a young girl, and a boy and his girl who fall in love, and then fall out again and yet again...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of both the 1980's and the 90's.   In both movies I watched, a man was murdered by his brother who was jealous of his wealth.  This movie follows the same story with a lot of twists and turns.  Unfortunately this was also a very expensive movie which may have put a dent in its box office earnings.  The story is good and it's a bit over the top with a bit of bad acting but it's definitely worth a watch.  It's not a masterpiece but it is a fun movie that you won't be able to take your eyes off of.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is very good. I like the fact that the movie depicts a more serious approach to the story and that the main character is a very unique character.   He is a guy with a passion for cars and the world around him.  He spends his time in his garage developing his dream car and trying to get as close to it as possible.  It's quite fun watching him trying to learn to drive it.  His friends aren't very good at it either but he is very interested in learning and taking it all in.  You never really think he will ever be able to get the car up to speed or be able get to the next destination.  But he does eventually and he even comes up with a new catchphrase:  "I'll make it!"  The car is a beautiful red car.  I think you could have a beautiful purple car and you would be better off.  This is the kind of movie that's worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a wonderful movie! It takes place in a futuristic future where the rich have all but wiped out everyone else. The two main characters are the main reason the poor exist: Jack, the heir to a vast fortune, is an orphan and the main antagonist; he has made it his mission to make the rich pay for their sins, and has been a good man from the start. Jack's plans come to fruition, but not without a very close encounter with death.      This is one of the rare movie where you feel bad for everyone involved. I had such a good time reading the screenplay and watching the movie. It is very well-crafted and the characters are well-developed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a child I used to dream about a great war. It was the war in the Middle East and the only part that interested me was the movie "I Am Not a Serial Killer" about a serial killer who was executed after being caught and sent to an insane asylum. The real war didn't interest me. That's why I like this movie so much. A lot of things I thought were impossible in reality are made possible in this movie. I hope more people will see it and that some people in the future get to live their lives in peace.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It may not be what you expect from a superhero movie but this is a good enough movie to merit a 4.   This movie has all the hallmarks of a good superhero movie: a strong hero with a decent storyline; plenty of action with an occasional comic book-ish gag; a well-staged, well-acted action sequence (not the least of which includes the car chase); and an attractive, albeit somewhat unrealistic, villain (not to mention the love interest).   The first half of the movie is a little more of the action and action-adventure genre with some funny parts mixed in.  It's a little cheesy with a little "bad guy" who is not the most interesting villain since the title character but the action is good enough to compensate for it.  Unfortunately, the next part of the film is a bit too much of the superhero genre.  The villain is an alien who, with his henchmen, is attempting to conquer a galaxy.  He has to battle the main character, a man who is "an ordinary guy" and who has never done anything very noteworthy in his life.  There is some humor throughout the movie but the ending is the real reason to see this movie.  If you like a good Superman movie with a few comic book elements mixed in, then this is one you may enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was completely blown away by this movie.   This is a fun, energetic movie that gets things right and keeps the viewer's attention, with a story that is pretty good, well-drawn characters, and, best of all, a killer soundtrack.  The soundtrack is fun, too.  In fact, it's pretty good.  I am a bit of a jazz fan, so I was happy to see that the movie's jazz music is good. Although I had no idea where the Jazz was coming from, I loved it.  A lot.  It's fun.  With this movie, Warner Brothers has done the right thing in casting a great actor as Dr. Jekyll.  And he is an interesting person: a brilliant medical man whose dark side is revealed by the events of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie twice and didn't have a great time either time I saw it.   They are the kind of movies that just don't grab your attention and don't feel like you are part of anything.  They don't have the special effects you want from a science fiction movie but there is something about this movie that really does.  This movie is a really bizarre, almost absurd piece of work.  While it doesn't feel any better than any of the other science fiction movies of the 80's this movie is still weird.  The characters are all completely ridiculous and the special effect is just off.  It is hard to talk about this film without giving away the plot.  I can't describe it in detail enough.  There is a virus in a space ship that is a biological weapon designed to kill off aliens.  When the aliens die the virus infects the food and the humans can't digest it.   They need a human food source but the human who is supposed to be the leader of the aliens has been killed by a virus and all of the crew is turned into zombies.    I won't go in to the plot because this movie might get very confusing to someone who is not a science fi fan.  Some people have complained about how they don't understand why this is important to do this type of movie.  One of the reasons that I don't get why this was made is because it is just so off the wall.  Maybe they were bored to death.  Perhaps it was an experiment of sorts to see what kind of films people would like.  As someone who loves science fiction I love that they tried to make this movie but it is such a bummer because of all the weirdness.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about a family.   It is the second time a family has been caught in a murder/suicide.  In the beginning of the movie, we see how their lives are constantly at war.  This is where the movie really begins.  The parents are married and have a son.  I like this movie because we get to see their emotions and their struggles to make each other happy.  My only complaint is the ending of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the story of this movie because it's a comedy about a guy who lives in a fantasy world.   He is also a really strong and talented fighter, but he is just so very shy and self-conscious and awkward that it drives him crazy.  He lives in his house full of magic books and monsters that have taken over the city and all the people who come in contact with them or work with them must be killed or enslaved.  It is only after he kills one monster that he meets the girl who lives a few houses down who teaches him how to be a real wizard.  And there are plenty of funny and fun moments in this movie as well as great fight scenes!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this in a friend's basement, and even though it was a low budget film, I was still entertained. The plot is simple: a group of high schoolers are invited to a birthday party. However, instead of being a fun day, they are made to work as slave labor at a construction site for some of the best movie actors in the history of the medium. I thought this was just a very entertaining movie, not very sophisticated but entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are many good movies made in Hollywood but this one is probably the best one. It is so good that even though there are many bad movies made during the 1950s that were a lot worse, this is probably one of the few good ones. The film has a very serious tone and it takes itself very seriously. Even though the story is very simple, it is done very well. The actors and actresses all do a good job at playing their parts and even though I only gave it 4 stars, I would give it 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it a couple of times, and the first time I was so sickened by the violence and the blood that I walked out halfway through the film. It's just that I could never forgive such a horrendous, sickening, and despicable film.   The most offensive part of the film is the "revenge" plot. It involves a couple who had been caught in bed together, who were attacked by a knife-wielding stranger, and who then proceeded to sexually abuse and torture each other for a bit, which is all fine and good except that they didn't find any real pleasure in the sexual abuse, instead they did it because they were angry at each other. When the man who raped them comes out of the woods, and finds them in bed again, they are not horrified by his presence, nor does he look at them in disgust, instead he looks at them like he would look at a piece of meat. What's the point of having sex with someone who isn't worth it? And what's the purpose of raping a woman who is probably having a good time having sex?   This film just made me sick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie opens with a flashback that takes us back to an alternate universe, where the only thing that seems to be missing is a giant killer asteroid. In this alternate universe there is a town called Rockland, a small town in the middle of nowhere in the American mid-west. Rockland is ruled by a powerful woman named Nellie (Marianne Faithfull). Rockland has had many bad people move in, but the only ones who seem to be leaving are the two bad guys, Bill and Pete (Danny Glover and Gary Busey). Bill and Peter (Groucho Marx and Paul Newman), a former teacher and former school bully who are now drug dealers, are the best friends of Nellies daughter (Melissa Leo). Nelli is so afraid of her husband that she's willing to risk her life to get her revenge.   Nelly has a terrible husband, but she is willing to put his death on ice to get what she wants.  Then it's on to a nice story about the two guys, Peter and Bill. Bill's bad habits include a certain habit of hitting on beautiful women (the movie was shot on 35 mm film, and the film was originally shot with a 35 mm camera) and a certain bad habit of shooting his victims at a distance in order to make them seem like more than just victims.  In addition, he is a drug dealer who lives in the back of a pickup truck, making the movie easy to watch.  Pete is a very nice guy who is addicted to alcohol. He is a retired teacher, but when he is not teaching he spends his time shooting up and shooting people. Pete is always there when Nellys daughter Nelliel (Melinda Dillon) needs a place to sleep at night.  Nilliel's job is to go to Rockland with Nellis father, John (Bruce Dern) to pick up Nellier's things, but Nillie is scared of her old man.  Bill is also afraid of Nillies old man, and he will do anything to take out Bill, but he gets tired of watching and ends up shooting Pete and Nillily.  John is really bad and a drug addict too.  After Peter and Nells death the movie cuts to the present day, where Bill is a good old time guy who loves his family. But he's not very smart or nice, and all he wants is a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has everything.   I have seen the movie on more than a few occasions.  It is good enough to make me want to stay up late and watch it over and over again.  This is the movie with the greatest dialogue ever.  The movie opens up with a good guy at a dinner party.  What we see is him talking with a woman who has been dating a man for several months.  They start chatting and then things get serious.  I am not saying there is any romance between the two.  But this woman is going to do anything to have this man.  One of my favorite lines is, "The first time I had sex was with the smell of a man's foot on my shirt."    What else could I want. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows two high school girls who have the misfortune to be best friends who were picked up by a police officer and taken to the psychiatric hospital. A patient in this institution was the killer, and he murdered a young boy named Gary who just happened to be on the same bus as the two girls.   "I love the girl with the black hair and her long hair and the girl who walks out of the movie and doesn't want to speak to me for five seconds"   This movie is a comedy of errors, and a lot of laughs can be had at the stupidity of the two main characters:  There is also a lot to like about the director, which explains why I like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the original (and I have not seen it in a long time), and when I heard that this would be adapted, I had high hopes. I was not disappointed. There was so much good stuff happening that I felt like I was watching a film from the 70's (and even the 80's, for the matter). The story is great, and it is well put together, which was definitely not the case in the original. The actors were well-versed and played their parts well, and I could feel that they were not only having fun, but that they knew exactly how to play the roles that they had been given.   "I am a HUGE fan of his original (not to mention his sequels) and I have seen it all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's really sad that only recently, when I was looking for a good action movie, the only one with this kind of concept I could find was "Death Wish 3".   The reason for that is because the story and the acting in that movie were the best ever made.   Now, I could say that this movie is so-so, but I really liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film based on the novel  The Big Chill   is a true American masterpiece.   It is hard to think of a more realistic depiction of life in the country of our birth.  From the opening scene we can see that this is no ordinary family drama.  While the parents may have had a tough childhood, we do not see them in an unsympathetic way.  The kids are well acted.  A young man who is a drunk, and not very good at anything else, is very entertaining.  This is not a film you see at a restaurant, but a film made in a living room at midnight.    I am not a big movie buff, but this film made my love for the genre grow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful film about a group of poor orphans that live in a poor shack.

The film's not as good as the trailer, and that is a shame because it is so well made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting much out of this movie but i was still pretty excited about it. It was my first time watching a film about a black guy getting into some hijinks with some white folks. It has an original title.   A little story: This movie was shot in 1977. I went to the theatre with some old friends. They went in to see a black kid getting into a hijinks and some white people had come along to see them.  I do believe it was shot at the same place as the movie where "The Birdcage" is based on.  It is a little different from that movie, but i think it works better for this one.  A good movie to watch with friends.

It was the day i met     the man who would become my father (I remember the scene in the train station),   who became a father,   and who took me and my mom to   the movies.  To this day   I have to say that   it is one of the greatest movies of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title makes the movie sound like an 80's comedy with some kung fu thrown in for good measure.   I don't really remember the plot very well, but I know that a Chinese businessman is attempting to sell his product in a small town by hiring a bunch of thugs to beat up the local bully, the local sheriff and his family to get his product back.  There's a good balance of comedy and action throughout the movie.  After an attack by the Chinese bullies, the sheriff takes his family and the bully to an amusement park and sets them free.  I won't go in to much detail about the Chinese villains, they're all well written and the character designs are a good mix of Asian and American.  In terms of the film itself, there's a lot of fun, and the action is good.  The plot was a bit over the top at times, but it was enjoyable and the fight scenes were great.  You could probably guess what the ending was going to be after the first few minutes.  If you enjoy a good 80's adventure, then this is a good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie. I am not sure where to begin, it is easy to watch but hard to sit through. It is like the classic sci-fi movies of the 70's, only a little more colorful and weird.    It is hard to watch a good sci-fie movie when the only "science" being done is by the kids in the backseat of their school bus.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of great films in my life, but I think this is one of my favorite ones, hands down. It is an incredibly imaginative film which is filled with wonderful, fun, and even sad moments.   It is a very unusual story, with no clear, defined villain and few people to save it from itself.  When we first meet the two main characters, they are young people who seem to be enjoying their high school life, while being stalked by a monster, a large spider, who is apparently responsible for the murders in their local town. This is a rather sad tale, and we soon realize that there is more going on with the two boys than first meets the eye.  It's a very interesting film, and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Kung Fu Panda" has been around since 2004 and it is still very popular, even though it has yet to reach the grand heights of the previous entries.   It is also a perfect example of how to have an animation that is both hilarious and ridiculous, and it will always have a large following because it is so perfect.  It features some wonderful characters and some excellent fight scenes, both involving the use of a few simple martial arts moves and a wide array of animals.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say? It is a good action movie. It is set in a very interesting world, that is also interesting to see, for example there is a magic lamp that is able to transform people. You can see that the movie's plot is about a group of mercenaries who do not have good values and who are all about stealing as many things as they can from a place, but in the end a powerful sorcerer who is able in his own way to change people back into normal human beings comes to rescue the mercenaries from certain death. There is a very cool soundtrack that is a combination of some old songs, and a few modern ones. This is a really cool movie with a good soundtrack, and good action and good fight scenes.

The astronauts then get their ice cubes out of a cupboard and then they melt it.

The film was directed by a great man, Joe Wright.  Wright was the co-author of the best picture in history, The Dark Knight. His other films are well worth watching.  The Dark Tower is a great addition to the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film about a boy from a small town who, when a car accident sends him to the hospital, encounters the man who killed his family.   The movie has some fun with its special effects, and some of the scenes are pretty cool, including a couple of fun chase sequences. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is not a lot of gore, and I would even say it was low on the gore scale. The main characters are not especially charismatic, they do not have the charm and energy of a B-movie star (which I guess is a good thing as B-movies usually have to resort to the "just try to keep from being killed, and if you die then you'll be so sorry" technique), but the actors are very good.   They show a lot more depth in a short time than in most B-funks, and that's saying a lot, even for someone who has watched so many in this genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was thoroughly entertained by this film. It was not an original, but I can not complain about that.   My favorite characters were Peter (Gus Van Sant) and the girl who he dates.  My only disappointment is that there was no real action, though there was some. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love these movies from the 60's and 70's, but this one is more about the characters.   There's no real action, it's just the guys out looking for a job, and the girlfriend (Tatum) trying to make a better life for herself and her son.  One problem I had was that the movie takes place in a small town.  When the girlfriend, who is always in danger, was found, they were both in danger.  Also, there was a lot of talking and the women are not very good.  Overall, it was good fun and I'm happy I saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'll start with a review that I don't like, but I will not hate it:  1. In an ironic way I really appreciate the fact that the movie is about a man who doesn't have any family, because the real family is the ones in this film:  2. This movie has a really good ending, even though it is very clichéd:  3. And yes, this movie is a parody of the "American Pie" movies, which is very, very funny:  4. One thing:  5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        I love a good comedy and I love comedies about women. This is one of the funniest comedy-dramas I have seen in a long time. The actors are all so wonderful! It is so rare to see a movie where both the male and female characters are likeable. I have never seen a movie in which both men and women have such good chemistry together.   It is a comedy-comedy where the women have fun and the men are just a nuisance.  The movie doesn't go too far with it's comedy and just gives you the good stuff without making it too complicated. The movie is funny.  There are some laughs here and there.  It's good to see the men being ridiculous and trying to get a date with the women.  What else should I say about it?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My son and I had no idea what to expect when we took our kids to see "In a Year of 1592". I'm pretty sure we both had the "mohawked, bearded, long-haired, long hair, beard, long moustache, sword, and a red coat" syndrome that has taken over many of today's "bad movies". I found it to be a fun movie with some great lines. My favorite was when the villain's goons are trying to murder a man in a house and a woman, who's standing there with a bunch of men, tells them "I think it's a good idea to leave this door ajar". My son, who was in the second row, had a blast watching the actors do their best to not look like they were having a good time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember being 12 or so, and not knowing who I was, but having a great time at the movies.   The movie is not the greatest, but it's a good start to the "A Star is Born" series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The idea was good:    This movie's only real failing is that it really was about a girl.   It is all about how good the movie was - it was funny, clever, smart and had all of the ingredients to be a classic.  It should have been called   The Girl in the Green Hat.   But that's not a bad thing, of course - I'm all about the girl in the green hat and   I think I could have watched this movie twice   if they had let me   do something more interesting than sit in a room and eat my peas.

It is a film that shows us the inner workings of a little girl, who is forced to run away from home because of her father's cruel ways.  After a brief adventure in a strange place, she meets a wonderful young man, who becomes her guide to a new life.  A very simple tale that is full of innocence and happiness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film: it's a decent story, and the cinematography is excellent.   - I had mixed feelings about this film:  I liked it; I felt that the film had a decent structure; however, I felt as though there were a few plot holes which the author failed to close.  I think there was a reason why this film took me a while to finish: there are some plot holes, but there is nothing that would keep you from watching the rest of the film.  As for the ending, the ending is the one thing I liked about it, but the film did not really leave me with any high-grade feelings about it:  - The character of M.C. is interesting; however he's pretty much a one-note character.  He's a bit of a dickhead, but then he gets involved in a very dark story and it really gets under my skin.  - There are some cool sets and costumes, but they look a bit cheap, like they just came off the back of a warehouse truck.  Also the cinematographer's work is a bit shoddy; however I feel that the director could've pulled something off with a better cinematography.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always wanted to see a film about a girl and her friends who work on a beach in Sanibel, FL.   The girls have to deal with the constant harassment from guys who don't like the color of their hair, or the way they dress.  The movie really shows how the group is a reflection of themselves.  It's a very funny film with a very dark heart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie from an excellent director. It is about a couple who find a baby deer on the beach, feed it and let it go. It runs to the water, climbs into a boat, jumps out and starts swimming.   The movie is pretty good, with some good music and pretty good acting, it has no problems.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a long movie (almost an hour longer than the one on YouTube), but it's worth the watch because the main story is worth the price of admission. This movie is about two men in a car, one of whom is gay. It's been a while since we've seen the gay character get involved in anything cool. So it was nice to see a gay character (named Ed) in a big time action movie. It had its moments (see, I'm a big fan of action movies like this), but the movie had its flaws.   The story itself is great, as a lot of the movies in this series (the other one is not so good). But, I think the acting was a bit over the top for a movie that's not that long. I loved the way the movie put me in the mindset of a child as I watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm happy that the film is coming back in theaters in a few weeks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a terrificly paced action movie. There are a number of sequences in this movie which are not particularly impressive in terms of design, technical performance, etc. However, I enjoyed the movie immensely as I'm a big fan of the Conan the Barbarian movies and it seems that the filmmakers have really tried to put some more of a personal spin on the character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not one to watch a movie to enjoy the story, and to be honest I was a bit disappointed that the movie didn't end with some more dramatic scene where a hero comes to avenge his friends, because the movie wasn't even about the hero. The story is basically a love story between two people who are at a bad place in life: a man who lost his wife to cancer, and a woman who lost her father to lung cancer. The woman is depressed because her father was never the same after he was diagnosed with lung cancer, she doesn't even have a husband or child. They spend a lot of time talking about the problem of getting the money to pay for their daughter's school fees. The man makes some jokes to make the conversation light, but the woman doesn't seem to get them and the woman starts to tell him how they both lost a lot and how they are living on the same income that her father used to earn. In the end of the movie the man's wife tells him that it's okay that he is trying to support their daughter because they will get married, and the man asks the woman if she will marry him and they are about to kiss before they stop talking. Then the movie ends.   If you're going to watch this movie just for the romantic story then I suggest to do it, but if you're looking for some drama then it's pretty bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not a huge fan of action movies, and I've never been a huge Star Wars fan.   The movie had a very similar vibe to The Terminator.   With a robot army on a planet, a group of people are enslaved and forced to do everything a man does, only for the robot army to become stronger and stronger.  It was an interesting premise.  But it got lost in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is another great movie with a very unique plot.   It has that feel of a good old 80's thriller.  But it has a different feel to it, it isn't as serious or dark as most films like this and it is not the most action packed movie you will ever see.  In fact, the movie starts off in a rather good way, the story begins in a small town, and while it is mostly just a small rural town, there are some interesting characters to be had, and you start to really like them.  Then they all get involved in a big conspiracy that makes their lives very complicated.  The movie takes a long time to get going, but then it actually gets going, and by that time, you start going on a bit of a roller coaster ride with a lot of action and suspense.  I think a lot to much attention has to be paid to the performances of the actors, and as much as I was enjoying the movie the whole time, at one point, I was quite sad that it was over.  It was a great movie and if you like action/thriller movies, I recommend this movie to you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought it was going to be a really good movie from the trailer and it is.   It's not a great movie, but a good, low budget movie that tries to tell a story that's not about violence, and instead deals with something that's far more important than the death count: people.  They do a good job portraying this in an upbeat way and having some humor in it but it's really just a great and heartfelt movie.  It doesn't get any better than this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .  I love "Aladdin".   The characters, the humour and the story are all excellent.   It's about a little monkey who goes into a palace and then on to a little desert.  Aladdin is an Arabian prince who wants to get over his fear of the "hounds of Hell" that are always chasing him.  This is the story of a boy and his friends who go off and try to find some gold in this place that the bad guys call Hell.  I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple, and has a very simple solution, but it's really interesting.   - The main protagonist is an unemployed man who is sent to a prison camp (actually a farm) after he steals some machinery (he has very good aim) from a factory.  The main character is very likable (although he has a bit of a bad mouth) and is a good example of a person being completely unaware of his surroundings.  - It's really funny to see how the prisoners try to make him a prisoner of the camp, and the guards are very amused by this.  At one point they have a nice conversation about their favorite movie (I think it's the one with the "chocolate pudding") and how much they'd like to try it.  This movie has good acting (not as good as the one in "The Incredible Journey", but it is good), good plot, and good ideas about how to make the most of the prison system.

A very unique movie, that I can recommend to a friend who wants to get into an old-school movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   (A good movie? That's a hard question to answer.   I can't imagine a better movie to review than The Room   and this review is the closest I can come.  I've seen a few films about bad movies but this one's a lot better.  It's a film about a group of friends who have each found their own ways to cope with the   life problems that have been thrust upon them.  They're not   particularly religious or anything but the group as a whole   tries to make up for   those parts they've played a role in causing.  For the most part, I thought the    humour was really funny.  The film really did get better the more you learn about the people involved.  At the time it seemed like a movie about   what happens when   bad people get together.  What a fun movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie.  I've seen some pretty great movies in my time, some were just a waste of time like a lot of old cartoons where you had to be dragged around like a pig in shit...   Well, this movie was more like a movie where you couldn't really do a thing, where everything seemed to be a bit too slow and boring.   A bunch of old guys are sitting around talking about some old movies, like a bunch of rich old ladies talking about old movies...  There was some great acting, especially the ones where the actors weren't old and didn't seem to really know what they were doing, like the guy who played a drunk and a biker (one of the funniest parts of the movie).   There were some very good scenes like when one of the old guys goes home to his wife to tell her about the movie...it was the best movie I've ever seen...  I loved the movie and it was a great comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, this is not the typical western, it is an action packed movie with lots of action scenes, guns, explosions, and lots of stunts.   This is a movie to show you, what is to come.  There is no time to slow down this movie is so fast paced.  The story, does not change much from scene to scene, but, the actors play the roles with such perfect talent, that you will not be bored by any scene, even the most extreme of them.  I recommend this movie to anyone, who wants a quick thrill, without the hassle, time and effort it takes to put together a western movie.

All in all a fun film with very good music and a great cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very disappointed in this movie.   It felt more like a promotional video than a full movie. It had a great premise, but then it took a detour into some really cheesy, cheesy, goofy, goofy-looking action.  The plot, and the fact that it was in a movie theater rather than at a theater in the city where it was supposed to be made didn't help.  I have seen it several times, and it always looks better with the added makeup.  It has a great cast of characters, but they never seemed to be in it for the right reasons.  When it was a movie about the Vietnam War, I thought it was amazing. But that's about the only thing the movie had going for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't normally watch movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am happy to see that the series of the original "The Wizard of Oz" will be getting a new installment.   This is not a bad film. It was never the same as the first one, but I find myself more and more excited about this new film every time I watch it.  The plot of the new film is rather simple.  Dorothy is at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West who is the embodiment of evil and is after a magical ring.  It is up to Dorothy to rescue her from the witch's clutches.  This was one of those "good" films in which nothing spectacular happened, but it was well directed, entertaining and had a strong cast.  My only complaint is that the new movie could have been even better.  A new, younger, more energetic witch in Oz would have been nice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm very glad I saw this movie!   It's really a shame we don't have a whole lot of horror movies like this in the genre.   They are usually done well and it's easy to get hooked on this movie.  And it was well worth seeing.

There is a good amount of nudity in this movie and the music is really good and a little different.  This movie makes me want to come back and watch it over and over again.

It was not really a good film but it was a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to good movies it's really hard to find a bad one, as they are often so well made and so good, but even the worst of them don't feel like a mistake.   One of the things I like about this movie is that it seems to have been more than a little inspired by the film that came out in 2001.  As a kid I loved that movie, so that's how I feel about this one.  It's a real story about a guy who had a son who died in a car wreck, and he's the one who brings that son back to life again by reanimating him.  And he does it with a little help from his friend, who has a special potion that makes people come back to their old lives.  But I loved this movie so much that I'd like to give it a two. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.   This is a nice little comedy.  We are introduced to our main character and get to know her real personality.  After an accident where her husband has an accident he and his daughter are trying to get the insurance money.  The insurance company are trying so hard to find a mistake and that is not an easy job.  At one point she is asked to be the babysitter for a couple of little boys.  This isn't a typical kid's movie and we get a chance to see more of this character.  As we see we get to see her trying to figure out who she is and who her boyfriend is.  Even though this is a silly movie I loved the funny moments.  I would like to see this on TV because of the silly scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I ever saw this movie I found it funny and entertaining, not to mention cute in it's own way.

The first being his  The Night of the Locusts, which was not as good as some other movies Oshima's made. I would say the movie is better than The Night Of The Locust but I think this one is closer to Oshima at his best, but still not the same. This movie is a good blend of comedy, drama and action.   It's a sad thing to say, but there is no real romance in this movie.  There is a funny and touching scene between the two main characters in the movie where both of them are trying to figure out who the girl is. It is very sad and a shame that we never get to see more of the two characters together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot! It's a good horror movie and good action movie! It also shows the effects of the nuclear bomb and the effects on the environment! This movie is good, it doesn't try to be too "special" it's a great horror movie with good characters and good effects!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited to check this out when I saw the trailer on the internet and after the movie, I'm glad I was.   This is an enjoyable movie.  I would give it a higher rating if it were only about two or three people, not five. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a shame that the film doesn't open with an awesome and beautiful shot.   We can see the setting, the mountains, the trees.  It really feels like a dream or a hallucination.  But, like most films of the time, this is an extremely stylized film.  The soundtrack is very good too.  I'm not exactly sure what this movie is about though.  But, the characters, the setting and the dialogue, all make it the perfect movie to have with you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The one and only "The King" from the "Citizen Kane" filmography was a fantastic and powerful film.   A brilliant character who was as ruthless and sadistic as the people around him.  When watching this film one can only marvel at the fact that there was a time when movie audiences were not as desensitized to the cruelty that is the way human beings were treated.  For people who had no real experience with the world this film was absolutely shocking and shocking to be honest.  It is almost unimaginable how this film could get made in the days before sound had become widespread.    It has a truly excellent cast and performances from all those who were involved in this film. The King is one of the finest American films and it is still as good as when it was made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is very well done and I really liked this movie. However it is too long and you can't get used to it quickly. I was pretty impressed by this movie and I hope this will be released on DVD.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie, and I have seen it a million times, and it is always an excellent movie. The story is about a guy who is in love with a girl who loves to shop and then ends up working at a big box store.   It has a lot of humor and the story is excellent, and while it has a few parts that are a bit of a grind to get through, it's well worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to action movies, they don't get any better than this.   The story follows two people who, in the middle of a jungle, find an ancient statue of a man who has just fallen from a plane. They investigate and discover there is something strange about the place and they find an old cave which is full of ancient hieroglyphics.  This is where it starts. The story isn't very interesting, but I found myself following the two guys who found the statue and getting them back to the plane where they found it.  The action scenes were fast and intense, but mostly just some random people trying to get past a crowd.  In all, a pretty entertaining action movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the kind of movie you like when you're watching on a rainy day. You know, when you get up in the morning and think to yourself, "I'm so lazy. I hate my job. I'm so stupid. I can't write. I need to take a nap, I'm a dumbass!" Well, there you have it! A movie about a dumb bastard who tries to get by with a lousy job in a big city. It's all about how the dumb bastard can't seem to get a break, but then the dumbest person ever gets a chance to get some. Then another. Then a third. Then finally, the dumb-bastard wakes up and realizes the whole system isn't working for him. And you know what? He's right. And he's right for a lot of other people who're just like him. It seems the dumb guy has some brains, but that's not why he sucks so hard. The movie's a mess. It starts off with a good old-fashioned bank robbery, where the dumbass gets robbed, and then the real heroes show up. It all works because the dumbbastards and the heroes are so ridiculous, and the dumbard is so irritating. And that's why he's so dumb.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A brilliant sci-fi film, which shows us the future world of the late 80's. A very well written script.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very well made, and at the same time not. It's not a bad movie, but there are many films in which the special effects are amazing. They look good in a picture, but not so good in real life. The story is about a man who finds the wife of his dead son. It is not the most beautiful story. In fact, it's not even a good one. The characters are all stupid and in bad taste.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie from a good director:  The story is an original idea and the actors are all excellent:  As you will notice from this review, I am a big fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. This movie may not be one of his greatest movies, but it certainly is not a bad movie.    I found the acting to be excellent, and the story to be interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first movie I've ever seen where everyone talks. They aren't just talking about how they are going to kill the enemy, or that they are the best group of people to ever walk the earth. They are talking about everything they have, and how to get the most out of each other. I was expecting this to be a typical action movie with guns and explosions, but they are not the only things they talk about.   There are some good action scenes, and this movie is a great example of how good acting can make a movie great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film follows a group of young people who go on a camping trip.   It is a fairly simple story. The film has a nice, relaxing, and romantic atmosphere to it. There is a feeling of freedom and adventure that is found in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The characters are really quite wonderful. They have a certain way of speaking about themselves, their own lives, and each other, without resorting to the tired "I'm in love with you" or "we'll be together forever". I thought they had such a good chemistry. You can almost hear them talking through the screen. It's really quite funny too! The music is very good, and you really hear the words! The story, like I said, is quite good. It is an enjoyable movie, with many laughs and a good plot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of movies, you will probably enjoy this one a lot more after you have seen the movie a few times. It's not that it's not a good film, it's just the fact that it does have something that is unusual, and is a little bit scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of this film is like a great mystery, with no real suspense or real tension until the last 20 minutes, when it takes a turn for the dramatic.   There are some things that are very good in this film: the setting is wonderful, the actors do a wonderful job, the setting, the movie, the writing.  This is a movie that I don't regret seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fantastic movie that combines the best of old school horror with the best in today's horror film. This film has everything you want in a good fright movie, the killer has an edge to his story and his performance as a serial killer is so convincing. If you liked the classic classic Hammer Horror films and the movies from the Hammer era like Night of the Living Dead, The Curse of Frankenstein or The Creature from the Black Lagoon then this is your movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's no secret that I'm a big fan of the late Michael Cimino's films, so I was very excited to see "Death Wish 2" last week at the local cineplex. I found it a refreshing change of pace from the violent and graphic violence of the previous movies. This one is not like the previous ones, but it is much more about the personalities of the characters and the relationships they have with one another. The performances by the lead actors are excellent, and the story is much better than the original. This is a very enjoyable movie, and it is one of the best entries in Cimine's collection.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-rounded drama with some excellent characters.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is an exercise in making a movie with lots of action, and yet it's not very fast paced. That is, there are no moments of real excitement - that is, no explosions, no big fight scenes, no fast and furious, and that is the way it should be, as a film. But if you take the story seriously, and the story does not rely on action, it's a real enjoyable movie.   I loved the film: it's quite good, and I think the cast is excellent: the actress (Sally Field) does a good job. The soundtrack by David Newman is beautiful.  It was funny too: the scene where they run to the other side of the street is very funny.  The bad thing about it is, that it seems to be a very big movie, but it's only about 3 hours long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite kind of movie is the kind where the camera gets used to slow, repetitive, low-quality editing, and it's great.   When you have a character as dumb as my buddy has, who keeps asking the same question over and over to the exact same people, "why?"   He has no clue what he's doing, doesn't have any purpose to life other than to be a nuisance.  He lives in a fantasy world where there are no friends, no family, no home.  This is one of the worst films that I've ever seen.  It's as good as the first half of The Day the Earth Stood Still. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw a friend who is going to see this, and I knew I'd be going to a good one! This is a great film and a great movie with an excellent screenplay by John Sayles. It is a real joy to watch! I saw it when it was at a showing in a theatre in New York City, so I haven't seen it in its original print, but from what I hear it is a film I'll never forget. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original film that has become a cult classic is still very much available and has been filmed more recently by director Don Siegel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about a young woman who has lost her virginity and is going to a party when she gets a call from her brother about a dead body in a canal. She and her brother go out and are arrested by the police.   She gets a lawyer and a priest and gets an abortion and a stay in jail.  She is going back home and when she does she sees her mother getting married to another man.  The next time she sees him it is with a man of about her own age.  But she is going crazy and does not realize that her new husband is actually her brother and not the other way around.  She and the priest get married and have a boy and a girl.  In the next scene she's going back to the wedding and notices the boy is older than the girl and has a dark skin.    The girl is now a mother and is pregnant.  This is the beginning of the ending of this movie and it's beautiful.  A film about a woman who loses her virginity but then sees her son get killed in the same way but with a different set of circumstances.  The way it ends is just amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is what a great movie should be. I was completely lost the first time I saw this movie, and now I know why. It is a very good movie, but you have to be there to realize it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really love a good story.  I always try to watch a new movie and try to find one that I think might be worth watching.  The first one that came to mind was the one where they are all at a bar and the main character gets into an argument with the bartender over whether or not he wants to go on a hunt.  And he is right, the movie is great.  But, there is a problem:  There are two other characters, both named John.  John is a little man who is in the movie for about two seconds and then leaves.  Is this a bad thing?  Probably not.  We never learn much about the other character, but he's not bad.  There is a scene where he is trying to pull off a daring rescue in a flooded room, and I wish he had a better partner.  It is a shame that the other two characters have little more than a few lines and one little scene in the film.   It was a good little movie, but the whole thing was a little strange.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is my favorite movie of the last five years.   This is a comedy film with a plot that is simple and yet complex.  It's not a perfect movie, but it works.  One of my favorite characters is the narrator, who keeps trying to figure out what exactly is going on: is he crazy? Is this the end of the world?   It all adds up to a fun experience:  "When we die, we will see ourselves again" is pretty much a perfect line.  A perfect movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There were so many cool moments that I would never have dreamed of, even though I've seen the film twice already!   What was so great about this film is that it is made entirely from an old black and white film with some interesting cinematography.   The way the film uses these old clips from the 1950s is a very subtle one, which makes you think of the movie as something you would watch in a movie theater rather than the same old film-within-a-movie that most film noir films are.  This film had such a great sense of humor about it, as well as a real sense of character and mood that made you want to know what was happening to everyone.  What you see in this film in no way resembles the "hick" characters who have been played to death on film for decades.  The real story behind the movie is that the two guys who played the two brothers, who are the real stars of the film, actually had a falling out and split up.  You can get a good sense of who the real protagonists are in this movie from the two main characters, though we don't get much of a look into their personalities.  And there is no way you could put a negative review on this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The opening sequence is a gorgeous image. I am also impressed with the story and acting. I don't know if I could get this one over on a scale of 1-5.   If you liked Star Wars: Episode I then you will love this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the film's opening scenes set up the whole plot, including the murder, in a clever and clever way. The film then takes the opportunity to do something about racism in America: we see that the murders occur, in part, because of a long history of racism in black culture. This leads into a discussion of how white folks are more "conscious" of racial issues than black people. As a result, when we see blacks being murdered, it is not just that blacks are being killed, but that they are being murdered by a black person.      The violence in this movie is mostly done to the whites and the women. The "superstitious" whites (which are almost always whites who were not white at the time of the movie's making) kill black people with impunity. In fact, it seems like a pretty large percentage of the murders are done by white people.  The film's ending makes it clear that the black woman was just as guilty as her husband for killing the two young black kids: the two men are executed by being hung from a tree, which was a common method for execution back in the early 1900s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen a great movie in a long time.   It looks like a remake of a good old movie   of the 60s,   which would be a good idea.  The story is told in the style of old Hollywood movies,  with characters that look like they are supposed to be from the past,  but in fact are just trying to get by in the 21st century,  and with the humor in the movies not being funny it makes it difficult to follow,  which I can see being an annoyance,  I have no idea how this movie can possibly be good,  i mean a few lines in the movie are like "I will take the big stick and beat up my wife and son,"   as if that makes sense,  it is as if the script was written by a guy that wants to get out of Hollywood,  if that is the movie then it is a very bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film which is about the real life events that took place in Japan during World War II (1939-45). It is about two young men: Keiko (Sakurai), a Japanese student living in Germany, and Kazuhiro, a young man from a poor village in Japan. Keiko is very depressed about her life in Germany and her mother's suicide. Kazuiro is very determined to join the German army to fight in the war and, when he learns that Keiko has gone to Europe to visit her mother, he rushes to meet her. Their relationship is rather complicated: Kazuuro is too selfish, not at all interested in her happiness, not quite able to understand why she has a crush on him (which he seems to be a little surprised about) and doesn't show it. He is also very vain and doesn a lot of other things to make Keiko think that he's her one true love. The movie is very funny: the two lovers often do silly things which makes their relationship amusing to watch.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching it with my family in the 70's and it is still pretty scary. There is a lot of blood in this movie and it never really makes a big deal out of it. The gore effects are quite bad and they are always very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 20 minutes or so of this film are pretty bland, but the story does a very good job of establishing the characters and the conflict that drives them. It's almost a good film if you're interested in a bit of character drama.       This is not a really interesting movie, but it's not bad either. It could have been better, but there is an understated but powerful quality to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, I believe this is the finest performance in a movie I have seen in a long time.   This is the true story about a father trying to get revenge against a man who killed his wife and then went on to kill another man.  This film has such strong elements of the real life story that the viewer should not be surprised at the strong performances that were given.  It is a shame that this movie was not more widely shown by movie theaters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised to hear that this film was made in England and had a British director and English cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "He's a monster, and he's my friend."   It was a lot of fun to watch, with great dialogue, good acting, and the great music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is somewhat reminiscent of "Gone Girl" in some ways, which is a good thing. I'm not one to write a review that can be construed as a negative review, but it does feel like a pretty straight-to-video movie. There are some neat bits, but I was a bit surprised by how much the film has to be told through the eyes of an adult male. Even the scenes with the young girls seem to have been shot by an adult woman, who seems to have a lot of experience in the subject matter.   The one problem is that the movie has a lot going on, and it's hard to follow along. The book is divided into three sections; the first part covers the events in 1990. We find out that the victim is a young woman named Catherine (Lily James), who lives in a small town in Pennsylvania. There is one other person in the town who is aware of Catherine's disappearance. It seems to be some sort of cult, but Catherine isn't the type to give up so easily.  After Catherine's mother (Margaret Qualley) and the police are called in, Catherine is found dead in the woods. Her sister's boyfriend (Richard Jenkins) is taken in for questioning.  There's some debate as to whether Jenkins killed Catherine. Jenkins denies it, and the sister believes that Jenkins was with Catherine at the time of her death. Jenkins isn't taking it well.  At the end of the first section, the police question the boyfriend to see what sort of evidence he has.  In the second section we find out how Catherine and Jenkins became friends. Jenkins was a drug dealer before he joined the cult.  This is a pretty dark movie, but not without humor. It's a bit like "The Omen" for older people.  Overall, the movie is entertaining, although it does run out of steam at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that the best thing about this film is its simplicity: an old couple finds an old shack out in the woods and decides to live there. A few years later, an old lady (Sallie Hart) comes to live with them. It's just like in " The Secret Garden ".   You know the story: the old couple and the old lady go out for a walk. The old lady stumbles upon an old house. She has no idea that she's not the only person who has been to this house in the past couple of years. She starts to visit, and then decides to stay.   When they go to a nearby village for a few days, an angry man (Walter Matthau) starts to make trouble, even though the old man (Fred Ward) tries to stop him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been watching this movie a lot lately. The movie was produced in 1965.   It is a comedy with a story line and with action.  The story line involves a bad guy named Alistair who steals a plane in New York City and runs off to Mexico.  His wife is not pleased and wants to see him go to jail.  Alistairs plan is to steal a plane to Mexico so he can get away from his wife.  When Alistar arrives in Mexico he meets a young couple who run a casino. Alistark is then able to escape from prison, which is why he is able to steal the plane.  He gets to meet the man who created the casino that is where he is forced to play the "chicken" and where his true motives come to light.  This is a really fun movie that is a nice little comedy that takes place on a small island in the Caribbean.  It has great humor and a lot of action and has a good ending that has been a good follow up to the other Pirates movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had heard about it several times and was excited to finally see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy the movie.   It wasn't bad, but there wasn't anything about it that caught my interest.  It was mostly just boring and repetitive.  There were several times when I just wanted to turn the tv off and go to sleep.  I thought the movie had the potential to be a fun, but forgettable, flick.

In this case the filmmakers have managed to combine the best of both worlds and created something truly wonderful.  This is definitely worth seeing and I highly recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's a shame about all the movies like this one," I was saying to myself.   One moment I was in a dark movie hall at night, watching a play called "Ivan Ivanovich" by Ivan Mironov. The director's name was not mentioned in the credits, but his name is familiar to anyone who is acquainted with the work of Boris Godunov.  I was watching a man, the hero of the play, take his last drink, and then take a fatal shot to the head.  A man who is a good man, a father of four who is trying to save a woman from drowning.  It is the final act, and Ivan Ivanovich's last drink was a beer -   After Ivan Ivanov is shot, the story does not change.  The man who was shot has a nervous breakdown and dies.  He is a drunk, and his wife is a woman who loves him.  They are separated when he is shot and in two days' time, they will meet again in his living room,   In the morning, Ivan Ivanievich wakes up.  "Why me, why, God, Ivan, why?   I'm going out in the morning.    I've gone for a walk.  It's not very pleasant out there in the streets,  " he says to himself.  Ivan Ivanivich will drink again.  This is a tragic story about a man trying to cope with the loss of his wife, the separation of his family and the sorrow he is enduring.  At the end of the film, Ivaniviov drinks a beer, which he does while he is standing up. There is a shot of him drinking it while walking down the street.  Ivan Mironovsky.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best horror films out there, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.   As mentioned in the title, you'll get a sense of dread right from the opening scene.  This is the movie where people will be running away and the protagonist, Will, will get a very unfortunate accident.    It turns out that he is wearing a mask that looks like the monster from this movie.  I can't even imagine how the other cast members react when Will's mask comes off and his face is exposed, it's a great effect and I really wish they would've done a sequel.  One interesting thing I noticed was a part where they show Will's house as an asylum.  They should really do a sequel to this movie, especially if they wanted to get more publicity for the movie.

What really impressed me is that, during all the action scenes in this movie, the actors do not flinch.  For the most part the people are doing things that I would not do.  The people here don't act like a bunch of ignorant jerks.  This movie has a lot of depth and is just a great experience.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone who is a fan of action movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is based on an autobiographical novel by the same title by a famous novelist named Jean Cocteau. The book is set in a French village called Croyat and deals with the everyday life of an idyllic French family.     In the beginning the story is very simple.  At the end of the film, everything is not as it seems.  The main characters were written with a very high degree of irony to make them funny and also to show their innermost thoughts and feelings.  While reading the book, I really thought I was watching a romantic movie in a way. I was wrong.  I was disappointed with the movie for a few reasons.  First of all, the main character is a woman. It wasn't a good idea to have a man play the main role and make a woman the heroine.  Second, the acting was terrible in the movie.  Third, the plot is a mess.  It's almost impossible to follow what is going on in the film and what the characters are thinking.  Fourth, the film was shot with a large budget and had a big cast of actors.  Fifth, the ending was a big letdown.  Six, the story isn't very deep.  My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing that has always kept me interested in films like this is that in a movie about a kid who is obsessed with the movie, the kid's mom gets sucked in by a weird looking car that seems like it is about to crash at any minute. At first she can't get the kid to open his mouth, and it looks like this kid is going to become a recluse, but he keeps singing a song about a crazy woman who can read people's minds. So eventually she realizes that she is the crazy woman, and gets in the car to go home to tell her family the truth. But then the car does a weird thing, and we don't get a good look at what the car's about, but we can guess what it is: a giant robot.   This is one of those movies that is both silly and kind of scary. It's kind of fun to watch the kid with the mouth full of his favorite movie song sing about it. But the real weird thing is that this movie starts out with a really scary scene.  "I don't like to think too much about the future," said Albert Einstein.  The girl in the movie knows a lot about Einstein and her little brother is afraid of her because he thinks that she can hear the car that's going to crash into his house any minute now.  After that there is a very funny scene with an imaginary little girl who is scared of the imaginary big scary girl (well, it's kind, but doesn't really scare).   The car in this movie doesn't like it when people are looking at it.  This movie is a bit different than most films like it. It is the kind of movie that people want to see because it is good. The movie is about a strange car, a giant little robot, and a kid that is obsessed and obsessed and that's about it. The movie has a few good jokes and some good acting in the main cast, but the movie isn't particularly great. The best part is the giant robot, a robot that can read peoples minds and has no real personality whatsoever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie I enjoyed so much I want to do it again.   I love movies where you can feel a person's frustration in their struggle.  The story isn't super original but I think it was an interesting concept with a lot of interesting twists.  If you like horror movies you can definitely check this out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I found out the movie I wanted to see was entitled " The Secret World of Arrietty," I knew it would be an interesting movie.   There's lots of magical creatures in this movie (and it's all made up by the author himself), and the main character (as well as most of the creatures) are real people (or at least the ones that have any real personality) with a real story that's told in a manner that feels natural.  In the beginning of the movie, it seems as if the filmmakers are playing a bit of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" with the characters. There are lots of strange characters in this world, and it's really hard to tell who's human and who's not, but at some points they all seem to be talking to each other.  The story is very simple and yet interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not really a horror movie fanatic so I was surprised at how much I loved this movie.   It's an entertaining and scary tale of a man, who finds his wife is pregnant.  He knows he can get rid of her, and decides to take her back to his old house to hide the child.  His plan goes wrong though, and he and his family find themselves trapped there.  One day he finds a picture of a child with a strange face and a big scary looking eyes.  The whole house starts turning into a nightmare...   This is a great movie, and I would recommend this to any horror fan out there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll take the praise of the movie, which, as all good thrillers are, is full of excitement and suspense. I am amazed at how this little movie has gained such an immense popularity, especially in Russia.   An actor of extraordinary charisma who had played on TV a few times and had become an actor with a large following of admirers in Moscow and other cities (Moscow's Meretz Film Festival gave him a standing ovation last week) has done the movie. It is very difficult to put into words how great a movie it is.  One of the things I liked most about it was the way it was shot: it is a movie shot in real and impressive locations.  It is a thriller in the style of 'The Manchurian Candidate', though one doesn't need to know anything about the Communist era to understand the plot.  A great performance by the leading actor and a good supporting cast are the real highlights of the film.  I recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, my dad made the movie and told me about it, I couldn't understand a word of it until I saw it. He didn't do much with his life, he lived on his parents estate, did a little farm work and raised a lot of children.   I can't say too much about the story, it is basically a tale about a family of people, the mother and two daughters, a father and a son who are the children of a man named Willy, he's sort of a lazy alcoholic and he also keeps his wife around.  So, a day, a woman comes to the farm to visit Willy for a few days and the two men want to give her a ride back home.  Willy wants to give a ride to a fellow who wants to spend the night at the farm and is upset when the woman won't be back before he's done.  The two men get a gun and go to the barn to fetch it.  There, they find a man lying on the ground, one of the men aims the gun at the man and Willy shoots and hits the man in the forehead.  In a rage, the man tells Willy that the two other men are planning to go get the woman.  When Willy gets out of bed the next morning, he sees two men riding towards the barn.  A woman, a boy and a girl.  They all jump into a wagon and drive off.  That is, until the wagon is surrounded by armed men and the woman screams.  With the help of a woman and some men, they try to get the boy and the girl out of the wagon, but their escape is cut short by the arrival of the two bandits.  One man tries to escape, but gets killed by the bandits. The other one is able to get out of his bonds and gets into the wagon as well.  It is here that you see how these men got into the farm, they found the wagon at a local town, the two young men, who the wife had been talking to, had come over and asked to borrow it. The men get into the horse and drive away.  Meanwhile, Willy's wife is in the wagon trying to get into her house, but it is too late.  I thought this was a pretty good little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife saw this movie when it came out. She was surprised that it was funny, with no violent stuff. She thought it was a bit too violent, though. It was a nice, well-made movie. It didn't seem to me that the main character, a little kid with a moustache, was the only one who was a little bit different. That's not too bad of a thing, I thought. He could be any child.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found that a good thriller/fantasy movie with a very good score.   It was a good mix of fantasy, horror, action and adventure.  This is my first time to see a movie from this genre.  The movie has a strong action part and it is good.  There are many scenes where the actors are doing action.  It is worth to see it only for this.  And the ending of the movie is very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie   When you have a good director like Mr. Kijima, and a good screenplay written by Mr. Nagamine, you should make something like this.   The acting is so good   It's hard to believe, that they really did try to get a young actress like Kamei, to play this role. !  She is a good actress, who should not be forgotten.  She plays her part perfectly   You will want to see this movie again and again   This film has everything: ! A good story ! Good acting, and good effects ! Great music, and the plot is very interesting   If you have only one movie to watch this summer, it must be this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You need to know the story.   At least you don't need to watch all the way through to know, just know that at the end a car crashes and then the movie just turns into a documentary about people trying to make up for their sins by doing good deeds and then dying horribly.  And then one of the heroes says he's going to have a party in his home that he's putting together to "raise the dead," and the narrator asks "The dead?"   You've got to watch the movie to be sure of what's going on, but it's a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great story and excellent performances, all at a great price.   There are some really good ones in the bunch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, there is a really good movie in this, that even better than its predecessor.   The director (Jorge Luis Borges) obviously had a dream: he wants to make a picture that would take place in the time of the Spanish Inquisition (I'm guessing).   And we have a beautiful movie here.  The story takes place in an unnamed (and beautiful) town in Northern Spain.  A group of young people (one is the wife of one of the characters, a sort of princess) live there.  All of them are quite different from each other.  But, I won't spoil it, you'll have to wait for the movie to see how it is.  And I hope that there is no misunderstanding here: this is not a sentimental fairy tale that has been translated to the silver screen: this movie is one of those stories that will be remembered a long time: even today it remains a fascinating and difficult subject to investigate. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went into this movie as a fan of the original TV series.   This is the only movie to feature the characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (or is it Slayer? Whatever.)   The film begins with the introduction of Angel: a vampire, not really of any particular age but clearly from a troubled past.  He is given a gun to shoot an intruder and kills the man in a very gruesome manner.  Unfortunately for him he is soon shot by the man he has just killed.  While this is happening Buffy is in the library reading a book about the paranormal.  Her attention is captured by the figure of a ghostly woman in a dark corner of the library.  This ghostly figure soon comes to life and begins to take on the form of Buffy.  Angel is quickly turned into a vampire after being bitten by the ghostly stranger.  With his transformation completed Buffy takes the gun from Angel's hand and shoots Angel, only to be turned into another vampire as well.  After Angel has been slain a group of vampire hunters (one of whom Buffy had been a student of) attempt to make an attack.  Buffy saves a girl who was being attacked by the hunters.  A small girl is found dead and Buffy decides to use a slayer's scepter on the hunters instead of slaying them.  There is a small struggle between Buffy and the hunters as they try to kill her but they fail.  The girl who the hunters had been trying to kill is found in a pool of blood.  She has no wounds on her body, just a black stain on her robe.  Some time later the real Buffy arrives to find that the hunters have been killed by the now dead vampire hunter.  It is then that we meet Willow.  Willow has just been attacked by a vampire and the person who attacked her has turned into the demon known as the First Evil.  Now Willow must defeat the First evil while the movie tries to be scary.  I don't mean to spoil anything but the film ends with Buffy being possessed by the First.  Once again I felt that the movie was trying to scare us but failed to do so.  But, that is only my opinion. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good animated film. The film does a nice job at blending in some of the more famous animation characters into the story. This film does have the same "feel" as many other Pixar films. It is a nice story. The art is done well enough for what it is trying to do. It's very easy to see what is going on in the world. I found the voice actors did a nice thing.   The film has many more moments than other Disney animated films.  The first 3 minutes is the only part of the film that is not really animated. It has two voice overs with a man and a woman talking to a child.  The movie has a lot of action.  It ends with the best ending ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm going to make a confession: I watched this film not long after I saw the documentary about a man named Michael Rennie in London, who lived in a building called The Rennies for 20 years and never left. I didn't really watch the documentary, but I remembered thinking "I can't believe he lived without ever getting out of the building" when it was finished. And this film did a great job of capturing that same feeling. It's one of those movies where you're not so much worried about any particular outcome, but rather that you just want it to happen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only flaw I found with the movie is the fact that it was supposed to be a horror movie but it was more like a horror comedy.   And for that reason, I could only laugh.  I will always remember this movie for its good performances and good humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is definitely not the worst I've seen. This movie has a very interesting story and a pretty decent script. Although this movie is kind of cheesy, there is something very special in it. It's just that everything that happens is so ridiculously over the top. I didn't even realize how messed up everything had gotten until the movie was over. There are too many things that don't make any sense, yet there's a scene that shows a car crash that is never seen again. There is also the fact that most of the characters are not even the same. The guy who plays the victim is so old and the other guys who have been in the bar scene all seem to be in their early thirties. There's just so much that is just so bad about this movie, it is honestly almost scary.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While this isn't a perfect film, it is a good film that will keep you thinking.   The plot is rather weak, but the actors have the right mixture of emotion and seriousness.  If you like action, drama, and adventure you will enjoy this film.  It's like a movie with a very bad and funny actor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun movie to watch.   The story is good and it does not require a lot of time or effort to get through it.  In my opinion this film is a great example of what a well made adventure movie can be.  This film has a good story and a lot to offer.  The first half of the film has an interesting story about a man who lives in a small town.  He has a son who is a little older than he is and a wife who is very sick.  When the wife is near death he must go and try to save her by going to a cave.  It is an interesting journey and an entertaining way to start a new adventure.  After finding out he was going to the cave his friends tell him to take the train to the main city.  They say he should go to the city to see if any good things are happening there.  If there is no good things it may be a good idea to move out of the small town in the meantime.  While he is in the cave he hears noises and when he gets out he sees a giant spider and his wife in a big pool of water.  At this point the story comes to a close.  I liked the story and the adventure. The acting was good, there was a good pace to the story.  There was a little humor in this film, the film did have a lot about it that was entertaining and good.  All in all I liked this film and it was a fun way to end the adventure film for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had not seen this one before, but have heard enough good things about it to say I recommend it. The movie starts with some strange dialogue about a man who is obsessed with something called 'harp' (though he keeps getting distracted). Then the film takes off and the rest of the movie is filled with suspense and mystery.   "I can see a harrumphing and a winking as far as my eyes can see. And the harrumming is not the worst I have heard. There is a bit of a sibilant quality to it." - Peter Bogdanovich  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard about "Marmaduke," my initial response was "What the heck is this?" I was under the impression that this was going to be a big Hollywood film with a ton of actors and a big budget. But then I found out that it was actually a short film. That was a shocker.   As a short, it's actually quite amusing.  As in, it'll make you laugh a little bit and then stop. It also shows a very good sense of humor.  I was initially surprised, thinking that it would have the same kind of impact on me as the big budget Hollywood films that I often find to be very mediocre.  But, in actuality, I've been watching a lot of short films lately and I've noticed a definite trend, so it's probably worth checking out.  Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this on the big screen with a crowd. It looked like a great movie when it started up, but the action got worse and worse. I'm not kidding about that. By the time they started attacking the enemy, the bullets were flying around like a war zone.  I would recommend this movie for the kids with no brain cells, but for anyone else, stay far away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an original story, about a young girl who discovers the existence of the paranormal. The movie has a very distinctive, unusual, even slightly disturbing atmosphere and a very interesting, original, and original plot which takes the viewer on a journey of unexplained phenomena.   The film was shot very well and is a very entertaining movie to watch.  A few of the "wisdom of the woods" quotes from the film:  "The woods are lovely, dark, and deep. But they are filled with those things that go bump in the night, those dark, slimy things that move quickly, and creep silently in the shadows. I have known of these creatures for years, but had not dared to investigate them. I had heard that they lived near the woods, near the river. I knew that the river, if it could be used, would carry a great deal of power, and might make a great evil if used wrong. But I knew nothing about these things, about these monsters, and how evil they were. I feared that my own imagination would be twisted into something horrible." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to thank the makers and all the people who made this movie and the cast.   First of all this movie is very, very interesting.  When I first watched this movie I was very excited to see the movie.  The script is great,   It's very easy to like it,  It is very well written and the character's were really enjoyable.  First there was the romance between two guys and then there was another guy that came in to help her,  This was a great character and it was very well done.  I enjoyed the movie very much,  But one thing I noticed was that   There were only two scenes where there was a close up of the face of the girl.  And it's not often that we see a close-up of a girl's face.  Now in all these movies you see a lot of women being seduced by men but in this movie the man was the one who was seducing the girl,  And I think that is very unusual to see.  It was very exciting.  This movie is a really good watch and I highly recommend this to everyone who wants to learn something new about girls. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been a fan of sci-fi, but this is the best space opera in a long while!   The setting is very realistic and interesting, the acting is good and the action is well choreographed.   When a space opera movie sets a tone like this and then puts in a little humor, I'm always happy to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is not that original. It is an adventure in a fantasy world which, unlike our own, is a bit more complicated.   Unfortunately, all the characters, especially the bad ones, are dull and boring.  The movie has a good ending but the ending is nothing like the beginning.  The movie is a long-winded attempt to make a fantasy movie with good actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Déja vu"   (a film with more than just a dash of the surreal)   I'm not sure I liked this movie more than the first one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie for the first time, and it is one of the better movies to be released so far.   It has a unique premise that is very simple and is set in a small town on a Sunday evening.  There is a story, but the rest is simple and not much is said other than that there are no guns used.  I felt this movie was more about a father's struggles to maintain a small farm.  This is an amazing movie and worth every penny of your hard earned money. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never really watched this movie at first, since i never really liked the characters. I thought the idea was silly, the acting was terrible, and the plot was ridiculous. But then i watched it with an audience, and now it's just hilarious. This movie is actually about an actor, who is going to star in his own new movie, which will also be about his new movie. His new movie will involve him playing the roles of all the famous actors, to prove who was better in their movies.   This movie was so funny.  "I'm a hobo, I'm a pimp, I suck cock!

This movie is a little bit like a horror classic with a little twist and an important plot point. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed The Giver more than any other book I've read. There was an interesting plot line about a family living on a planet that had gone mad. The family was the most important thing in the world. They were all people like me. People that grew up in the same time as me in the '50s, who thought that the '60s were a good time.   It really seemed to be a movie written for the older generations. The movie was a very long one. I'd say it was over an hour. It was funny, but I couldn't find a single word that wasn't funny. The plot was interesting, but there were some parts that were kind of hard to watch.

He has a mysterious sister named Mia, who keeps him from playing too many games, and who always seems to be out of sorts. But then one day, after playing some games with a neighbor boy, Mia gets hurt.   In an emergency room, Mia asks the doctor to put a needle in her arm so that she can be put to sleep.  In the process, she gives birth to a baby boy, and when the boy is born, the doctors find out that Mia is not her sister. They think that Mia had an affair with the neighbor boy and had lost her baby at some point in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie.  The film follows a woman and her family through a series of bad luck events that can only be described as a curse.  A simple enough premise but executed to perfection.   The plot is a little slow to get going but once things get going it's a good film.  I have seen a lot of bad movies but I never wanted to watch a bad movie with bad acting.  Even when the acting is bad the movie works.  It may seem like a movie about a curse but it's not.  Instead this is a love story and one of the best love stories I've seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old fashioned, no nonsense movie that has a strong plot line, and a story to tell.   It is about an orphaned little boy (played by Billy Wilder) who wants to be a big man, but all he gets is nothing but a small voice. He goes down the river on a raft to the city, and ends up in the big city.  The plot follows the boy, who must learn to deal with the people, and the ways of the city. As he learns about them, and grows, he finds a love for a woman, and learns to love again.  A film to learn about life, to grow and to be good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You might not be a big horror fan, but you should be when you watch this.   This is a great little horror movie that is set at a Halloween celebration.  This movie starts off a bit slow, but with just a little over an hour it gets into the fun part.  I was scared pretty badly while watching this movie, but then the story caught up to me and the scares started to be fun.  There were a couple of scenes where we felt a little uncomfortable with the acting and the story.  Then a couple minutes later, we were all grinning like idiots.  The movie doesn't focus on gore or anything scary, but it's not a bad movie and it really keeps you thinking about horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I thought it was pretty well-done. The story was interesting enough, but I didn't see the point in spending so much time with the characters. The movie took place in a place I'm not sure I've ever seen before, a mysterious little house on the outskirts of a small town. It was a strange and somewhat confusing place, full of odd people, and lots of secrets. My favorite character was the woman who went to a place called the "Haunting" as her mother said it was the house that was haunted. She was a beautiful young woman, but as the movie went on, her personality changed. She grew angry at what she saw as a curse being placed upon her family and then killed her father and uncle. She's been haunting the house ever since.   The actors did an excellent job at portraying each character and the film was really fun to watch. It made you want to watch more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An early David Lean epic, set in the Middle East, is about two young boys in the small town of Shand, who come across a strange and unsettling figure: a mysterious and naked man wearing a greenish cloak and carrying a walking stick. The boys get very excited, and start running away with the strange figure. As they get closer, they find out that it's a skeleton, and that the mysterious stranger has no idea how he died. This is an amazingly beautiful and suspenseful movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part about this movie is that it has a very original plot. The plot is completely original.   In the last part of the movie, a young girl gets married to the son of the man who killed her friend. The boy is a very smart man and he seems to be perfect. The girl who is in love with him falls in love and wants to commit suicide.  What would be so different about this plot? There are a lot of similarities to other movies like:  - The main character (Maurice) and the girl (Yvonne) are both orphans (or should we say "half-orphans"  ?)   There are also a lot (I would say nearly an entire) half-orphan (or half-sibling) characters   - There is a lot going on (like many movies have) in this movie and you can watch it many times without getting tired.  If you don't like the idea of a half-brother becoming a brother, you might not like this movie  .   What I like about this one is the way it keeps you guessing.  One minute the plot is like most films that take place in a small town, but then you realize that the boy is actually a vampire (this is not new).   This movie is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of those rare examples where the movie itself is the best part of the movie.   This movie is a true classic, it's a movie that is hard to watch, and almost impossible to look away from.  It may not be as well known as the more famous westerns of the time, but it's just as good.  I watched this movie when it was first released, and I didn't know anything about this movie at the time.  In fact, the movie is actually based on a series of novels by the same name, published between 1911 and 1913.  As a matter of fact, a lot of the details of the story are identical to the novels, but with the same characters.  The movie's protagonist is a sheriff named John Connors, played by John Wayne.  Although I don't really think that John Wayne was particularly good, the story is very similar to many other Westerns of that time, and the movies does a good job of showing just how good a western can be.  A good western does a great job of portraying the early years of a frontier war, and showing how the men of the period were the same people they were when they fought the British in the American Revolution.  For me, this movie will be one of my all time favorites.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about the first time the English language came into contact with the German dialect of the Prussian army. The Prussian Army had a reputation for being very good at fighting. A lot of the movies and books about the war focused on the Prussians being a strong and well-organized army. It was also not uncommon to hear them described as the strongest army in Europe. However, it turned out to be a different story. One of the best features of this movie is that you can tell how tough and dedicated the soldiers are. They are willing to kill without remorse for no particular reason. I never knew a Prussian soldier that did not have a smile on his face at some point during a battle. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd say this is one of the most original, and interesting, science-fiction films ever made.   It's also a really good movie with a lot of fun and very interesting ideas.  The movie starts with a couple who decide to escape Earth because of the recent problems on Earth. The problem is that a comet is about to hit Earth, which will cause an asteroid to hit the earth and kill all of us and our families.  They decide to go into space to the planet called 'Eterna'.   The Eterna has a lot more than just a big moon. The moon is made of diamond and other very valuable materials. It is in fact a kind of mine from where they can make a lot money.  But the moon is just a little too big for the Eternas and they need to go back to Earth.  As soon as they get off of their ship and onto the ground, they hear this crazy scream, followed by some other strange noises. There is some kind of a war going on and the ETERNAL PEOPLE ARE BEING ATTACKED BY THE EVIL HUMANS. The ETERNALS HAVE GONE TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM INSTEAD OF THE CRYSTAL PLANET.  While we don't know what they're attacking them for, I assume they are attacking them because they think they are the 'evil humans'.  Now the ETERNAN PLANETS have their own sun that produces a lot less than the sun on Earth does. That is why Eternia has a large moon that can actually cover the whole moon.  Unfortunately the Esternes are only a little bit further away from the solar system than Earth is. They need to reach Eterno before they are destroyed.  We are also told that they have a very large army and that the Eterne army is very, very, VERY powerful.  Now you can see the similarity between Earth and Eternu (Eternae) the two worlds that are almost a single entity.  In the beginning of the movie, the Eneru are trying to contact the Esters (Earth).   So you can imagine how they have to build a giant 'S' shape to make it so they can contact the Earth. Unfortunately when they are building the S shaped it gets destroyed by the Earth's army.  So they go to another planet, which is much closer to the Earth, and build a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good  . the good . The good is good.   I don't have a lot of good films, but this one stands out as good in every way.  No, it doesn't feel like a bad film.  It has great acting.  The acting is spot on.  There's nothing bad about this movie.  I can watch this one over and over.  In the end, it is hard to tell how good a film is until it's over. However, it's an excellent film. I like this film's story, but don't want to leave it here.  If you are a fan of the old Star Trek series, give this a try.

I can't say for sure if it's a good or bad ending, but I certainly feel that they were trying to show how the characters changed by having them go through different experiences, and it worked out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's so great about the film is that it can easily be made into a pretty good film in a few minutes.   This is not your typical Disney princess movie.  The story is pretty unique and the story and characters are all very unique.  As the story goes on the story develops with the character as a whole as well as with the story.  A very unique story with a very unique ending.  For those who don't like the original films I would highly recommend this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an instant classic.   It's not just a good film, it's an absolutely fantastic one.  If you're an audience that appreciates films from the 60's, 70's, and 80's, this film is sure to please you.  It has an original plot that's not cliched or predictable, and a cast that's diverse, likable, and enjoyable.  You could go on and on about the characters, the art, the soundtrack, and even the acting.  But what really matters are the performances.  The entire cast shines, from the leads to the supporting cast.  And you may be surprised to see that the entire film is shot on 35 mm film.  This film is a must see.

My friends and I would play games like Super Mario Bros. 3, Star Wars: TIE Fighter, or any one of the countless titles we'd collected. Even if I had never met the guys in this movie, I would have been so happy.   I also like that the girls are always getting the girls to fall in love with them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to say that this movie is perfect. But I am going to tell you it's a really, really great movie.   The story is pretty simple.  The hero, the main character, is a big, burly guy who is a good shot but has a problem.  He's got some kind of trouble in his past that is preventing him from ever getting his shot at the big time.  This guy has a little brother who also has some problems. The big bad guy is a guy named Dr. Henry Bong.  Dr. Bong has this horrible obsession with killing off people he deems unworthy of having a soul.  At first, he's trying to create the perfect murder weapon to kill them.  But after an encounter with his assistant, the "Little Lady," he decides to use his creation to kill off his family instead.  However, Dr. Boging is about to kill his nephew.  So he has to find a way to stop him.  Now, there are a lot of little problems with the story.  One is the fact that Dr.Boging is really a bad guy.  When the little guy's girlfriend goes to pick up him after school, Dr Boging kills his girlfriend and leaves her body there for a little while.  It's a bit weird but it's something.  Another problem is that the Little Lady is a horrible character.  She gets into a fight with Dr. Boing and that's pretty much it.  And there's not really any way to solve the problem other than to just put a stop to it.     Unfortunately, this movie takes a little too long to get to the good part of the story which is when the hero finally kills Dr. Bonding.  I suppose it was a little bit annoying at first because there's nothing really happening for a good long while.   But I was so happy to see the little baby boy come out of Dr. Bing's chest after Dr. Bohing's death.  Then, after a few scenes where Dr. Boding and his assistant try to get some sort of explanation out of the little boy, the little man runs out of his house and into the woods.  After a while, he has a vision about Dr. Zebudov who is actually a demon who was killed by his nephew and the little girl he likes.  In order to protect his little boy from the demons

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A good movie with an evil director, a bad story, and a pretty good cast, with a twist ending." - Mike Ryan I'm sorry to report that the Director of "Crazy Mama" is an Evil Man Who Makes a Little Movie Every Weekend.   This guy's so much worse than the evil director and producers:  He shoots a little movie every weekend about a little girl who goes crazy after being burned by a hot dog, so she murders people who have hurt her.  He has no talent for the script, but is just plain bad in the film.  This little movie is no good, and has no meaning to it.  The producers and director have tried to make a movie about a crazy little girl, but have ruined it badly with a bad script and bad acting.  You would never know from watching this movie that the crazy little girls and the bad people are part of the same family, or that they all work together, or know each other.  I'm sure this movie was written by someone who just wants to make money.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad that the time has come to look at the films of my youth with fresh eyes.   It is a film that is a must watch.  This film is one of the best, and most memorable, of the 70's.  It's an epic tale that will never be forgotten.  From the very first scene of the movie it was clear to see that this was the film to watch. The story is not unlike the film "Hancock". The characters are all drawn in a classic style, and the music is very powerful.  You should never get tired of watching this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie a lot.   It took place in some kind of abandoned castle, in which the two main characters lived and, unfortunately, were kidnapped by an old witch.  The story was very well done, and I don't think that I have seen a movie which made me cry a lot as much as this movie.  It reminded me very much of "The Man From Planet X" (I also watched this movie once but it was a long time ago and I do not remember it very well at all, if at all...)   But in a good way, because the movie was well done and not cheesy.  I hope that it will be made into a TV movie...!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that doesn't take itself too seriously yet still manages to be a classic comedy from the past that is not a rip off of a movie: the jokes are good, the acting is great and the story, despite being a little bit predictable, is funny from beginning to end.   I am an older fan and if the original wasn't bad enough, this remake is even more bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of this film is like an action film with a lot of explosions, and that is pretty much all you need to know about it. In fact, I am so impressed by the sheer number of explosions in this movie that I cannot stop looking at the screen (I don't want to, but I have to - the explosions are crazy!). The action scene that is the most entertaining is a scene in which a group of terrorists (a.k.a. the "Killer Snakes") has hijacked an airliner and is threatening the pilot. The plane explodes, the terrorists are killed and the pilot escapes.   But the pilot is not as lucky as the hijackers were. The pilot is found shot through the head, and it is the terrorists who have killed him.  At this point we find out that a group called the "Crown" has been responsible for all the hijackings, and now the Crows are taking a bigger and bigger role in the terrorist activities. We meet several members of the Crow, including the leader: the "King of Fear."  But how is this group formed?   When it seems that the Crown is taking too big a role in terrorist activities, the "Knights of the Round Table" attempt to find a way to stop it.  It is only at the very end of the film that the film finally makes a revelation: It turns out that the "Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense" has actually been working for the Crowing and that the two groups have been fighting for years.  The film also reveals the Cofradia's involvement in terrorist activity in the Soviet Union, and they are trying to gain control of it. There are also some great twists throughout the film.  So all in all, this is an entertaining, action-filled action film. The only real problem I have with the film is that the ending is very unsatisfying.  Overall, this was a great action film from 1970 that is probably best remembered for the memorable sequence in which the pilot was shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie about a man, who has a strange fascination with the fact that all the things he sees around him seem like living things, but which are really alive, alive from the outside in, and which live inside his head as well. In his life, he gets more and more interested in the whole issue of a living being, whose nature is not obvious to him at all, and he is also curious to find out more about it, which he doesn't get from his parents, who are very much against him thinking about it.   Unfortunately, the story of this man, and his life is too tragic, very tragic, for the whole movie to be really effective. The ending is pretty bad, and the story, as far as it goes, is too bad to be worth a film. But, the movie, which at least had a certain good potential, had to be seen to be believed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie is a movie. Well, that is what I want to say about this movie.   It is a short one, but in my book it is a really good short one.  For what it is, it doesn't stand out much.  The main character is a very good one. His motivations for doing what he does are pure and I really liked him.  We also get a good twist that makes the story a little different.  At the beginning it is quite confusing, but that's when we are on a good track.  I really like the direction they are going with the story.  It's not just that a good part in it makes us think, it's also that it is simple enough for young people to understand.  This is a nice little movie, and it is not very long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You are all in for an interesting, darkly humorous, highly entertaining film about a man who, while waiting for the bus in a New York subway station, decides to stop for an early dinner with a woman who has been waiting since 4:30 to meet him. The two of them go to a fancy restaurant, where a number of other patrons sit at a small table with two empty chairs. There is a heavy, awkward silence, and then the woman appears from the table, smiles broadly at the man, and goes on talking.   The woman's name is Marjorie, and she has a voice that's like the tiniest whisper. It's the kind of voice that gives a little wiggle-room, so you can go with the flow of the conversation and let Marjory take the lead. They've been friends for years and it's always been fun to watch them play each other off one another.  Marjore doesn't like her and Marjorious doesn't see her as an equal.  There are a lot of subtle references to classic movie comedies, especially The Day The Clown Cried, but never in a way that's cheap or cloying.  The movie's structure is very much like a bad sitcom: there are a couple of funny scenes, and as the movie goes along, things get increasingly ridiculous.  It's hard to say whether these elements of comedy are what really makes this movie funny: it's impossible to say.  On the one hand, the film has a lot to say about a lot. Marjories stumbles into a relationship with an attractive young woman who also stumbles onto his stumbles. The movie plays like an odd little sitcom in which both couples are in on the joke. At one point, Marjores and Marijorious make a joke about the name of the restaurant: a restaurant called "The Hoot."  Marijory and Marjay are both very unimpressive characters: they aren't bad actors, but they lack the subtlety to make them seem funny. Marijorie is a real joke: she's both cute and funny, but you don't want to give her too much credit because Marjoretts's voice and facial expressions make it hard to tell the two apart. Marjay is equally unimpressed with his relationship with Marjoren.  If this movie had been made in 1957, the story would be about two divorced
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Olympics" is a great movie for a great reason.   First, it's set in the late 50's/early 60's and features a terrific performance by John Wayne.  He's a man who would have been an Oscar winner in any decade.  His filmography also includes, "The Quiet Man" (1947), "Gentleman Jim" (1964), and "The Big Heat" (1967).   Then there's Lee Marvin, the most iconic of all the leading men who never had a leading role in a Hollywood picture in over 20 years.  The story is set on a ranch in the mountains.  I've seen many films set on such a place and this one is no exception.  It is a classic Western set against a backdrop of a beautiful landscape.  As the film progresses, the story moves from an innocent man (Bruce Campbell) who loses his family and finds himself in trouble on a lonely, remote mountain ranch to a man whose entire life has been a lie.  That the whole film is set in such a remote place is just an added touch to the suspense.  If you're a fan of westerns, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first heard of this movie I was very curious as to what type of movie this would be like.   I watched a preview, and even though I didn't get a sense of what the movie would be about, it was an entertaining movie.  There was a lot going on in this movie, but nothing really stood out for me. I didn?t think that it would be a good film.  It had some good acting and a good story.  The main story line was an enjoyable, and somewhat believable one.  I wish I could have seen more of it as it was only 12 minutes, but it was still a decent film. The movie didn? t make me laugh, but I?m glad to see that they did try to make a good plot, and the ending was a little odd, but at least it was a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie about a thousand times, from the old video store, to the old radio station, to a little video rental shop, and even to a tiny little bar (not my kind of bar). This movie is so old, and so bad, that I find the idea of having to watch it again hard to stomach.    In its attempt to be hip, the film's producers tried to use a wide array of film styles to tell a story about the life of a poor man, a man who is constantly on the move and is always trying to find work.  The filmmakers also wanted to tell the story of a man on the run. The problem is that the characters don't seem to move very well; they look like they are frozen and stiff.  As far as the acting goes, the young, nervous, and dumb characters donned by the actors are the worst.  They look so unnatural, it's unbelievable they ever got a job on a movie like this. The movie has a bad story.  A young man tries to be the good guy by going after a girl.  She's a pretty girl, and he's in love with her.  He's got a plan to get her to marry him, but when he does, it turns out he's too much of a fool to pull it off.  Now, I hate to be negative, but this movie is horrible, and it is the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great example of how you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. It's based on the true story of one of the most infamous criminal interrogators in history, Henry Lee Lucas.   It is the story of a former Army interrogator who is called out to interrogate a soldier accused of rape in a village during the Korean War.  As you can tell, the book is full of action, gore, and torture.  It's almost a shame this film version didn't come out a little later because it's such a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie, though it does not contain any real action, at least not that I saw. The story is about a woman who is searching for her husband, who is supposed to be dead. The film is not about the woman's search for the dead man, but about the man's search after her. It is a good mystery movie and the ending is a cliffhanger.   I recommend this movie to anybody who likes a good old-fashioned detective movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie.   It starts with an epic battle of the old school vs. the new school.  And it doesn't even have a great ending.  The movie goes through the whole "war" against the old and tries to find the new way.  When it comes to the new "school" it just seems like a copy.  At one point a character, an old school girl, gets hit by a bus.  Then a young boy hits her and makes her laugh.  That, along with the whole old school getting their backs up for no reason, is probably my favorite part of the movie. I was glad that I watched this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies about New England ever made.  . You know the rest of the movie by the end, but it's still an awesome movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you were to ask someone what he or she loves to do most, they would most likely say "make money."   The movie takes place on a train traveling from Chicago to Los Angeles and it's easy to see why, with the scenery being the perfect complement to this tale.   There is no shortage of characters to like and hate throughout the movie and while not as well developed as some of the more notable cast members (such as Don Corleone's brother Johnny and his girlfriend's mother), the main character, Laddie, does manage to find his niche in the world of the mob. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's always difficult to judge a movie on a one-minute clip.   What this movie is about is the fact that you can't know everything about a person.  When you meet him, he's a stranger and you can only imagine what's in his mind.  The movie is not about the man and his problems.  They are a very sad thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good watch.   The movie has a very good story, well written.  As for the acting, it's not great, but the story is very good.  It's about a man who decides to make a movie about the great white sharks, and ends up being attacked by a few.  I thought it was a very well acted movie, with good acting and well put together scenes.  The story does get a little too old at the end, but I like the ending of the movie, and I think it has some great music.  Overall a good film that I'd recommend to any fish fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "good" in good movies is not what I'd call good in the strictest sense of that word, it's just good in a way that leaves me feeling satisfied with myself after each viewing.    I've said this before, but I'll say it again:      I love this movie, and it has given me the same kind of pleasure I used to get from watching Bambi or Dumbo or, if I'm being honest, watching a good romantic comedy with my Dad and mum on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  This film is not a "good movie" by any definition, but it is a good film, and I say this with all honesty and appreciation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing I enjoy most about this movie is that it's set up in such a way that it can make any genre of cinema look like a masterpiece by comparison:  This is a true classic film:  And you have to know that the reason the filmmakers didn't end the movie with a nice big finale like most Hollywood finales do is that they thought that was what they would be remembered for:  It is, I think, one of the best "movies" that has ever been made:  The music is also just about perfect:  A good, old fashioned, no-nonsense American story:  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves good filmmaking:  Highly recommended: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is always something good in The Man From Earth.   As much as I like this movie, I wish there were more funny things in it.  The story of this movie is about a guy who discovers a giant monster buried underground and decides to investigate it. He finds that it is a "solar system" and that the monster is connected to the sun. After trying to break into the sun the giant comes up to the surface.  While there he goes crazy and begins destroying the earth.  When the creature leaves he is rescued by a very wise old man. The old man believes that the creature is evil and that he will cause the earth to break apart. The monster leaves and the old man is buried alive.  But the movie doesn't stop there.  After the old lady dies there is another old lady who comes in from the sun and saves the earth from being destroyed.  So that is the end of the movie.  That is all I can say about this movie. It is definitely not the best movie of its kind but it is interesting and has some good laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My parents met while working for the same company in the same factory in my hometown. When I was around five years old, my father had to go to the hospital for a few days to get a stomach ulcer. One day, while I was playing outside my room, I heard my mother crying and yelling outside the house, asking my father, "Why have you gone to the bathroom so often?" "I have no money," my father replied, "and I can't get out of the way of an elevator" "Then why do you have such a big stomach?" "Because it needs to be big to get me out of a lift."   I remember, a few years later, when my father was sick again, he said to my mother, "Don't worry. I'll go to see the dentist the next day." So he did. And on the way there, he told me, "Look who's here. I've got a bigger stomach than you."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no words to describe this movie, but let's start with the first scene:  Well, the director clearly took inspiration from the classic westerns and made a movie inspired by the real westerns:  A bad ass bandit is riding off into the sunset with a big gun and a big smile on his face.  In the next shot:  The hero is trying to steal a horse.  At one point, we see the hero riding a horse:  It's an excellent scene.  There are so many things going on in this scene that it almost seems like a film, but it's not.  What's a film without dialogue?  There's a great, tense scene with a bandit on a horse, and a shot of a man trying to sneak past the bandits:  One of the actors (?) is obviously a real badass.  I can't believe that he was able to pull off a horse kick:  There was a horse fight in the movie and a horse kicked its rider:  This is one badass moment:  And finally, here's a shot from the same scene:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie. It's great.     As much as I enjoyed the idea of the story it didn't feel right at all.  There are no twists or turns.  The movie was just a bunch of people trying to get to the top of a mountain.  They all know the rules and what not and they are all trying to figure out how to get there.  I don't know if it was good or not.  It's a movie you might see once, then not again for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie which you will enjoy. It has an interesting concept about a couple of people who start a new life in the country, who start working in a small bakery and try to get by.

It's funny, it's funny for a good while, and then it gets to the point where you are getting annoyed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, it was nice and sweet and cute and just so funny. I loved the love interest, and I loved all of them, even the other love interests, they were all so fun. The movie was about a guy named Kevin who fell in love with a girl named Dixie. He had a big crush on her because he thought she was beautiful and he thought they would get married someday. But one day she gets an idea, he asks her to move in with him. But he's not quite ready for that yet. Then he decides to ask Dixie to move out. So Dixie comes home one day and says she'd like to move back in. Kevin tells her no way, he's got another girl on the way. Dixie says she can't move in, she's got a boyfriend. Kevin says he'll move in later that night. But Dixie changes her mind and they get married. Dippy's the perfect wife, she doesn't make Kevin uncomfortable.   One thing I noticed while watching the movie, was that it was really funny to see the "cute" boy, Kevin fall in love, and then realize that all of his girlfriends weren't as "cuteness" as Dixie and then eventually come around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen the original film version of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" since it came out in 1960.   For me, the remake is just as good as the original.  I think the best thing about this is that the story is so well told.  The movie has a lot of action, humor, romance, and drama.  My favorite parts are the first two acts, where Bill Nye's dad gets really into the physics, and the final act, when Bill and his little brother get into the air.  Bill is so brilliant as a scientist.  He comes across as smart, humble, and genuinely nice.  As a kid, I was amazed by how he could invent things like the wind-up toy car, and later develop a system for making a wind-less toy rocket work.  In the end, it is Bill's father that saves the day.  This is one of those movies where I would recommend it to everyone:  This movie shows how much we have changed in the last fifty years.  Even if the movie was made in 1960, it shows how advanced we have become.  It is so refreshing to see an old sci-fi movie that isn't set in outer space.  Thanks for making an entertaining movie, 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a film fan but I found myself entranced as I watched this movie.   There are only two films I've ever seen where the characters were so likable.  So, I must be really good to be able to enjoy this film.  The film, however, is not very good.  Director John Landis plays up the film's themes about a man who is a failure but finds a friend who is the perfect match for him.  There is a great, great romance to the movie, though, and the dialogue is brilliant.  This film, unfortunately, doesn't have the humor that would make it a worthy film. If anything, it is just funny and is certainly entertaining, but there are no laughs in it.  For example, there is a wonderful scene where the two friends discuss about the weather in the movie.     However, this film is great in terms of acting and the themes that are explored.  I have enjoyed it so far and I think I'm only getting started with this film; I am hoping that this film will only get better with time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not perfect. It's full of plot holes. It has a lot of stupid dialogue. It doesn't make a lot more sense than the first two films in the series. It makes no sense that one of the heroes is the leader of a group of street urchins who have a magical powers. It even makes no more sense that the movie is set in a time when the population is largely poor and the hero is the one who is wealthy and not a poor farmer like in the books. But it's a very entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie last week, it is the first one I have seen in a long while and was a good experience.   The plot is a simple one but has enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a new film out every other week about a young girl living in New York City who takes an interest in the local occult groups and takes up some very violent and dangerous projects with the help of her friend (who happens to be the leader of a Satanic cult of which she is also a member) and her father (who also happens to have a connection to the cult).   This film is so different than the other movies about teenage girls doing extreme projects that have been coming out in the last few years, that it is hard to explain and hard to enjoy but still manages to be pretty entertaining.   The characters, their actions and the stories are all very well written and very original but are all in this bizarre and fun sort of way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to the movies for the first time in years.  We had just been married a year and she had a lot of fun in the movie theater.  I enjoyed most of the movie, I'm not a huge horror fan but it wasn't bad at all.  It was like a horror anthology movie, there were a couple of different segments and the only bad one was the zombie, but other than that the movie was pretty good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "No more of the dead!"   I'm not entirely sure if I've watched a better one yet.   It has the usual "giant-monster-attack-on-small-town" plot, but it has enough twists to keep you interested.  To be fair, I do have one minor gripe.  The movie has a scene where a group of people run through the woods trying to find a road.  I thought that was sort of funny.  Then a bunch of people get in a truck and drive all over town.  It would have been nice to have a little bit of character development here.  So, yeah, it is just a decent movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen The Fifth Element, you are not a man. It's not only a pretty good movie but also one of the funniest films in the cinema genre.   This movie is a science fiction adventure movie that is set in an alternate world. The world is not ruled by a government and is run by a large corporation named Auran. The story focuses on the lives of a team of explorers called The Five who travel through different universes with a mission to help humanity to achieve a balance between the forces of nature and the forces that are controlling it.  This film is not a bad movie by any means. The movie has a great plot and has a lot of good ideas.  It is a lot darker than many sci-fi movies but has a good balance between good and bad. The plot is a little ridiculous at the start but the movie actually gets interesting after the movie's first 5 minutes.  The first time I saw this movie, I found it a little annoying that the movie was so long that the ending was pretty much a cliffhanger.  But it is still one of my favorite movies.  There are so many good moments in this movie. I liked the ending pretty much the whole way through.  When I saw it for the first time, I was really surprised because the movie didn't seem like something I would enjoy. It had a lot to get me interested though and the ending I thought was pretty good.  I also really liked the whole world of The Fifth element. I thought it was a nice way to explore some science fiction ideas and a very different type of movie.  If this movie wasn't for me, I probably would have watched more sci-Fi movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So far, I like this movie very much, and would like to see a sequel. This movie is a combination of   a family comedy with a good story.   A nice story about how a young man is getting prepared for his wedding. A guy is trying to become a man by getting married, a beautiful girl is looking at the man who looks like he might be ready for it, and an older man, a wise old sage is teaching him about love. I loved it.  The acting was wonderful. This is a family movie at its best.  I hope this movie does a sequel as this one is great!

One day they end up in a bar where the girls are all crazy and have to defend themselves from crazed men who are trying to make a getaway from the police.  This is another great film from the great director, Jack Clayton, and it's great fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit, this is one of those films where you have to watch it a couple times before you can really appreciate what is going on, but even after a couple of viewings, you can't help feeling that the director is on top of his game.   After all, there isn't a bad picture in this movie: the camera is very steady and in very good focus, and the acting is mostly top notch. I especially like the voice of Peter O'Toole.  Another nice thing about this movie is that it has a nice sense of humor.  It also seems that the whole movie takes place in a daycare:  In any other movie you would expect a bunch of very silly kids playing games and throwing toys about.  But in this one, they aren't messing around!   In fact, the kids have real problems:  A kid named Charlie is trying to catch a bug, but the other kids throw him a soccer ball and he never catches it.  The other kids get very frustrated, and so do we:  Charlie gets very annoyed and thinks he has gotten to be the worst kid in the world.  At school the other children insult him and call him stupid.  Charlie has a lot of problems in his life and his only hope of avoiding that fate is to be a great soccer player:  One of the kids (who happens to be Charlie's friend) thinks that his soccer is really the only thing that will save him, so he's trying to get Charlie to join them at school for soccer.  With the other kid's help, Charlie gets on the field, and when he fails to make any headway, the other students come up with a plan to embarrass Charlie.  This isn't pretty, but it works:  Eventually, all the kids are so angry that they start to act even worse.  Once Charlie is embarrassed enough, the principal shows up.  I like how the principal makes fun of the bad behavior of the other boys and kids, and Charlie's school life becomes a lot happier.  We also get a great montage of Charlie's friends playing soccer and all their problems.  One part really sticks out to me, though:  "Don't you mean 'go to hell'? You know, like we do."   This is such a good idea that I don't even know where to begin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this version of "The Day the Earth Stood Still," the story is pretty much the same as the earlier version I saw years ago. The people of Earth are in an uproar about a strange meteor that has crashed to Earth and has appeared in the middle of a field. The local scientist, Mr. Brown (a terrific actor) believes that the meteor was brought here by an alien race and it's going to blow up the Earth and kill a lot of people. He wants to set off a bomb that will blow up every town in the Earth in a huge explosion and then all the people in the world will come together to enjoy a big picnic in space. The problem is that the Earth's magnetic field is not strong enough to hold the meteor in place. So Mr.Brown sends up a balloon to try to hold it and is not very successful. The balloon doesn't last very long and goes down. As it falls it pulls the meteor with it. It continues to fall, but now it's heading straight for a big town. Mr. Johnson (a marvelous actor) tries to save the town by setting off a small bomb, which would probably blow up both the meteor and the balloon. But it doesn't work and Mr.Johnson, who has been trying to save people since he was a little boy, has been killed. So now he's going on a quest to find a way to stop the meteor before it blows up the world.   If you're looking for a good science fiction movie, this is the movie for you.

It was some kind of science fiction film about people with unusual abilities, in which some of the people who are doing all this are very friendly and have a good sense of humor about themselves, others are evil people who do evil deeds and sometimes want to destroy their fellow human beings. But the whole thing was a great story.   The one thing that really struck me about this movie was the music.  It's great! It's really nice!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie in the summer at the local high school. I am now in my late 50's and thought this movie was just like one of those cheap comedies on TV I used to get on tape. There was no comedy involved. There were no characters. It was all a bunch of silly characters (I am an ex-football player and I don't care about any of the people in this movie). I have watched this movie about 7 times. It is always the same story, just different faces.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent movie that deals with a very serious subject, the mental health problems of teenagers.   It is a must see movie if you are a parent, teacher or someone who wants to get a good look at the mental disorders of young people.  It tells a simple but touching story with a simple set of themes.  One of the things that impressed me about this movie was how it dealt with the subject in a non-political way.  No one uses the word "evil" in the film, and the subject itself is dealt with in a way that is not too over the top.  The movie does a good job at showing us the difficulties that teenage boys and young girls have in dealing with their mental health issues.  If you have a teenage son or daughter, this movie should not be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had been wanting to see this movie since I first saw it in the movie theater a few years back. And when I finally made it I found myself enthralled and even frightened.   The film starts with a scene of the evil villain, The Lord of Darkness (Christopher Lee), looking over the devastation left by a tornado in Kansas. He has been called back by his master, Satan the Devil (Peter Cushing), to put a stop to the destruction. Satan is a very bad man and a very evil man. He is Satan the Dark Lord of all evil, and has the power to do just about anything he wants to do. It is a surprise to find the "little one" who has been saved from a flood being played by Peter Cushing. It all seems to be going well, except for a couple of young children who have gotten trapped in a river by Satan. It was a nice surprise when I found out that they had been saved by the little girl and were about to be rescued by a boatman, when a tornado came through the area. Satan was very upset with the townspeople who were still at work, and didn't want anyone to see him again. After he had put a lot of power into the tornado, Satan realized he had made a mistake, and then the flood came in and covered all the town, except the boat. Satan's plan was to send the boat away so that the people couldn't find it, and leave the town without them. In order to do that he had to convince the people that the boat was cursed. But, there was a problem, because the water kept rising, and Satan thought that he could put the curse on the boat so that it would sink if the boat got close to the surface. Satan told everyone that the curse was on the water, and that they would drown in it. The townspeOPLE were totally convinced of Satan's words. This is where Peter Cushnoc comes in, the poor little boy, and he thinks he can stop the storm by telling people that they can't believe Satan's lies. So the boy starts to go around telling people what they want to hear. When everyone starts to listen he tells them that Satan is lying and that the water can't be controlled. So everyone starts praying for the boat to come back to them. Unfortunately, as you can imagine, it doesn't, and so the boy is left to die in the rising flood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In addition to being the perfect example of an action movie, it also has some of the most perfect dialogue I've ever heard in a movie.   "Let's see what happens when you get an old guy with a bad memory, who has been married twice, and an orphan boy who's been kicked around a lot.  I guess we'll see."   And there are so many beautiful lines in the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful and tragic story, a man who has lost his wife to the "pestilence" and found himself cursed with the "ruler of pestilence". It's a shame this story is so very, very old. I'd love to see it again, but unfortunately it is, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only bad thing about this movie is how it's presented. There is a lot of shots of the streets and people walking in it and you get used to it, but then, when the two main characters start having sex, it becomes really difficult to keep it under control. It just looks a little silly.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent movie which contains no overt sex, violence or foul language.  The story is simple and the characters are simple. It's the simple story, in simple characters, which makes this so interesting. The first part is about a young couple, one a farmer and the other a school teacher, who are trying to find a place to live.  Their problems are simple and have no great impact on the plot.  Things are not quite so simple when the farmer falls ill.  He is taken by the doctor and the doctor's daughter, but a mysterious illness sets in and the girl dies in the family house.   It was obvious from the first sight that I was going to enjoy this film.  I like simple stories and this is one of those.  This film shows a little humour and is suitable for all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror films, you might like this one. It's a well-made slasher movie.   It takes place during the late 70s, and features a lot of gory, disturbing scenes.  I wouldn't call it a good one, but I don't think it's a bad one either.  It is kind of a mystery-movie-within-a-thriller, and the story is interesting enough to keep me reading. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   If you like to laugh a lot, this is a comedy that will keep you laughing a long time!   The movie shows a bunch of guys in a college town getting to know each other.   They go to their first party.  It's a real good time.  The film also shows a group of girls who are all over the guys.  A real nice movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's setting is the near future, in a postapocalyptic America, where a deadly virus has swept the nation: it's called "viral" for a reason: it sucks the vitality out of you, leaving you barely able to fight off the disease's grasp. But there are some who do fight back, like two young cops, Billy and Paul, who happen to stumble upon a cure to the disease: an injection made out of "the finest quality blood" (according to Billy) which will supposedly give him superhuman strength and healing powers: he can run the streets faster than the cars on the highways, and he's not above shooting a bunch of thugs for fun.   And he does shoot a bunch (not always, but he's been shooting the streets for so long that you're supposed to like it), but not everyone in the movie (like most) is so lucky, and some are infected, or become infected as they fight to survive: some end up dead, others are left for dead, and their bodies are turned into zombie-like creatures: I think I might cry, but maybe not:  The zombies are fun: they're pretty cool: one of them even tries to eat Paul's head:  And Paul has his own fun, by shooting the undead while his "friend" Paul (the cop) is asleep.  So: if you're a fan of the genre: give this movie a look; the ending is pretty bad, but then: why does everyone else have to die?   I like how the ending didn't end the movie the way it was intended: Paul shoots the infected, and the zombies come out and do the same to him:  It's a very, very bad ending to the movie: there's a reason why people don't like the end of the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Bartlet" is a fun little movie with a lot of good jokes and good dialogue.   Bartlett is a high school English teacher who has a crush on his teenage student, Maggie (who plays a lesbian with an air of self-loathing) and he falls for her at every chance he gets.  But when Bartlet is told he will be making history by becoming the first ever president of the United States in "The Bartlet Presidency", he must overcome some strong obstacles to make it to the Oval Office.    There are a few good moments:   -The closing joke: "What if Bartlet had a daughter?"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a decent movie. It starts with a pretty great scene: a group of kids are playing hide and seek and they find themselves in a cave. They don't have a map and they are not supposed to have a cave inside a cave, but this is an excuse for a good scene and they use it to create an atmosphere that is fun and entertaining. It's also a good story; a little bit of time is spent in the middle of the film and the characters are given time to come to terms with what is going on. The only thing I wish they had done was to put a stop to it and give everyone a little space.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't watched many movies in a row, and I was quite surprised by the movie. I like this movie, it has some great fight scenes, a very good script, some good scenes. The ending is great. The story is interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love The Lost Boys. It has a lot of action and suspense, and a lot more humor. I particularly liked the ending (at least for me).   The Lost Boy is about two teenagers who travel with a gangster, who has two children with a woman. The two boys go to meet this woman, who turns out to be a bad-tempered person who likes to beat her boyfriend and then take the children. The first scene shows how a typical gangster movie might begin: a group of robbers enter a house, rob it, and then return it.   One thing that I always found strange in The Lost boys was how the gangster's son had a crush on the mother of his girlfriend. This would have been interesting in the 80s or 90s, but this is a pre-internet world, and I wonder if there are any real-life examples of this today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . This movie is funny in its way, but you will always laugh out loud at the end of the film, at the scene where the car is flipped over by the truck and then when the driver of the truck jumps up on top of the car and the car flips over again. I like the way they filmed this one, the way their costumes were different, and the way the actors reacted when the car flipped over.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest thing that gets lost in the chaos is what is really important, what is being said. There are a lot of people that will be surprised that the best comedy in all of Hollywood is about the fact that the only way to keep a man from getting drunk is to give him a gun. I like it for a few reasons. The story is pretty silly and it has a lot more heart and soul than the typical Hollywood comedy. The cast is great and it is funny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie the other night and I was really impressed. The script is so clever and well written. There are several different and amusing plot twists in the first half of the movie. I thought this would be a silly comedy that would only bring laughs and would end the movie in a fun way. I was not disappointed! It is actually a very funny movie and it takes you back to the old days. It is a really good movie and I recommend it to everyone who loves a good comedy and a good ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   After a long, long wait (almost a decade), the new version of  The Pink Panther  appears, in all its glory. This one is definitely a throwback to the 60's and 70's (and maybe even more so to the 30's), in many ways.   The movie starts out strong (moreso than the first one), with the introduction of some familiar faces:  The Pink Poodle   And he's all shiny and chrome and white. And I mean that literally.  The Poodle wears a dress, in a very long-form wedding gown (think the 1950's), and the rest of the cast is even more colourful:  Kitty (the pretty little black cat),   "Chinatown" (the old bar-owner),  Toto   and even a few old friends:  B.E.  (a big, strong fellow),          (who looks like he could rip someone a new one),       (the big-eyed, bald-headed cowboy with a cowboy hat),    and, of course,              The Pink Panther.  This group is definitely the main focus of the movie, and they bring a lot of personality to the proceedings.  But there are also some more familiar faces to get to know (and even a new friend who's even more colorful and memorable):   There are still some of the old friends from the first film (and the original cartoon) in the film as well, such as The Puma (who can transform into a big, white bear),  Miss Pussycat (a young woman with a puffy pink coat),   Chippy (a purple cat who likes to be called "Bunny"),   Biff (an alien),   Flapjack (a huge, angry dog),  and Mr. Big (a talking lion).   It really feels like the original P.P.  had a bunch of friends who would all come together to have a good time:      And when you do get a good party going (or even just a good weekend) with friends like that, you know you're in for a good night:    It's almost like the movie has a sort of "party atmosphere".  But, more than that, it's funny all the way through.  Even the old-fashioned

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it, I liked it a lot.   I really liked this movie and I wish I had seen it before I started taking classes at college.  I have to admit that my first viewing of the movie was very disappointing.  It looked like a horror film, like something someone might make for a cheap thrill and this is why I really hated it.  A bunch of people in a house, they try to kill the family dog, the son gets the dog's leash and goes outside to kill it, but the son's car gets stuck and he can't get to it in time to help.  And you have a bunch of kids, mostly in college, in the woods trying to kill a dog that is very dangerous.  The problem with this movie was that there wasn't much plot, there just wasn't any reason why they should kill the dog.  They didn't need to kill him.  In my opinion this movie is about as well written as a cheap horror movie can get. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good, simple story, with the most charming lead character ever.

It was good seeing this movie again, after being away for a year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's really funny, although a bit depressing.     The story begins when a woman is trying to find a missing baby that's been missing for a while, and that baby was a boy.  There are so many "takes" in the movie. The opening credits are hilarious.  You'll never see anything quite like this.  The comedy is a bit too fast for my taste.  A little too funny.  Not so funny, or sad or scary.  Very funny.

I had just watched The Great Wall  and thought to myself: Gatsbys are always so great, how could anyone go wrong? I knew that it was going to be a good one, I just didn't know it would be this good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one of those movies that is so unique, so fresh, that it's so funny, it's good, it has a beautiful score, it is well-written and well-acted, it was directed by a wonderful filmmaker, and it's a love story that is funny, sweet and touching all in one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is not a great film by any means. But it is worth watching for its unique and creative ideas about war and the psychology of human beings. It has its flaws. For instance, the military action on the island (where the film takes place) is slow, and the characters are mostly insipid. But the movie doesn't rely on any obvious formula to make its point. Instead, the filmmakers (the same guys who made Inglourious Basterds ) take risks that have no clear ending, and sometimes fail, and at other times succeed beyond the wildest imagination. The acting is generally good (especially the lead performances), but a few of the performances don't work as well as you would hope. Overall, it is a fun romp.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say I like this movie.   It's not bad (except for the horrible acting) but the writing is awful.  I wish we could get some good actors in a movie like this.  The best part is the opening scene with the young boy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a good example of the type of movie that the French have made over the years, with the big budget production and the good French cast.   - I like the title "Jeune Fille-Poulet"   This is a funny, but good, comedy movie, although it isn't as good as some of the French comedy films, it still is good, but not as good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I must point out that it is NOT a "romantic comedy" about a rich woman who has to deal with an ugly son and a rich husband, so, yeah, that's not "a comedy."   This is more like a movie about a woman who doesn't care about her son and her husband, who never gives up, who just wants a decent life and has enough money so she can leave her husband and run off with her husband's best friend, who also doesn't give a shit.   And I have to say that a big part of this movie is a really funny scene with a guy named John Leland who is a very stupid man who believes all his own lies: he thinks that she has a new kid, and that they're both crazy, and he's completely blind to the fact that this woman has never had a kid and is still in love with her ex-husband, and they both have the same taste in guys.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good drama. It's good to see the main characters get into a bit of trouble, but it is only to give us more of these characters' problems.   As I mentioned, the main theme is a relationship. The two lead characters have this relationship that they are trying to maintain. They both like one another very much, but there is a difference in their feelings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first movie ever, I've been watching for a few months.   It's a short movie that takes place in a small town.  The story goes like this:  The town is small and all the kids have grown up and grown out of the towns.  There are only two people left, and one of them is a woman.  It is her dream to visit a different town. She meets a young man in town that is also looking to visit another town. They become friends and it is her wish that they spend a good day together.  Eventually, the man leaves and she decides to return.  She tries to tell her friends about her plans to visit, but they don't believe her.  Her friend convinces her to come to town for a good time.  They have a good couple days and then one night, they are invited to a party.  So they head to the party and they are treated to the greatest night in town.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a pity that it only contains a few minutes of actual content because this movie is one of the better films of all time. The acting is really good in this film, particularly with one of your most beautiful leading ladies, but the acting has nothing to do with the story because it's nothing more than a bunch of weirdo's playing out a crazy story. I guess the fact that there's a whole movie's worth of weirdos playing out the same basic story is what really draws me in. The movie's concept is pretty straightforward. A bunch of kids get the opportunity to go on a vacation and it turns out that the people who have the vacation are all weirdos. This has the same sort of feel to it as a kid reading a book about a monster attacking a school. It's not as good as a children's book. But I'm sure it has a lot more plot than a childrens book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie: It's time for me to admit something: I don't like Michael Mann. It's very obvious and I'm not even surprised. I think he's boring and stupid, but who cares? I can't get into his films because they're all so dumb and unfunny. I don not like his movies and I don a dislike for him. The movie is called Seven Pounds because they put a 7 on the front of the film to hide how terrible it is.   There are three main characters: Joe Bussard (Chris Mann), the son of a rich old man (who's actually just a guy who works in a gas station), who works as a clerk at the grocery store. Joe is in love with a girl named Lisa, and he is always at home with her, but he can't break up with her. His boss, Mr. Doolan (Tony Salmons), is a man who hates Joe for some reason. He doesn't like him because he is the son and he never liked Joe in the past. Joe goes to the gas station and meets an old woman named Martha (Elizabeth Moss), who is the head clerk and he falls in love.  One of the funniest scenes in the movie involves Joe's boss, who gives him a bad grade for being late. Joe wants to go to his apartment but his boss says he has to work with the girl. It is obvious from the beginning that the movie is going to end with some kind of a romance. The plot consists of Joe trying to break up Lisa with Joe. Lisa doesn't believe him. At one point Joe has a dream that he's back in his apartment, but the next scene he's at Lisa's apartment. So far the movie's plot has no payoff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went into this film expecting something different.   After seeing "The Usual Suspects", I was looking forward to a fresh take on the supernatural movie and was pleasantly surprised.  Unfortunately, it turns out to be a little too much like "The Manchurian Candidate" for my taste.  There are a lot of things going on, and if that's not enough to bore you out of your wits, there's also a lot to dislike.  As you might have guessed from my previous reviews, I'm not big on horror movies in general, but "A New Day in Murder Town" doesn't seem to be all that different. As far as the plot is concerned, it's an intriguing one:  There's some very strange happenings in the town of Derry.  Several residents are mysteriously murdered, and the local police are nowhere to be found.  One local detective, however, is on a different kind of hunt.  His first case involves an elderly, well-dressed woman named "Maggie" who has a strange, bizarre look about her.  When a police car is called for, the woman is found dead at the side of the road.  She was struck by a car driven by a young man in a cowboy hat.  The local police take on a hard case to solve, even though it seems clear they have no leads.  However, what's strange is that in each of the subsequent murders, the killer seems to have the same look in his eyes.  He seems to be watching and studying Maggie's every move.  Maggie has no friends and no hobbies, so there's a certain cold calculation to her.   When a local news team visits the town to investigate, they are told that something has been going on there for a long time.  What happened to the locals?   Could the killer be local?  When I finished this movie, I felt a bit guilty that I wasn't paying much attention.  In the end, it still wasn't really too bad.  It certainly wasn't worth a watch, but it certainly didn't have to be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is just a blast!   The whole plot revolves around a new recruit on a special forces team sent to fight in the middle of the jungle. After having an accident, a strange creature attacks him.   While the rest of the team is trying to find his dead body, the team's new recruit comes back and he too comes under attack. The movie has a good story to it and good special effects, although a couple of the creatures looked a bit fake, but at the end of the movie everyone is fine again and the action scenes are pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always found a love for film noir in its simplicity.   I was just over ten years old when the first film was released.  This was a big influence on my youth.  There were a number of films like this made over the years, but this was by far the best.  The story is a little convoluted, but the characters are wonderful.  If you like films with good acting, well written stories, and a good plot (even if you don't), you'll like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Man Who Fell to Earth" was an extremely ambitious project by its producers to get audiences on the edge of their seats. It's a movie with a lot of possibilities that could have gone the wrong direction with too much over-the-top animation, over-enthusiasm, and too much violence.   Yet the film worked and managed to get the audiences to the edge without overdoing the animation or over-dramatizing the violence. The animation is a bit old-fashioned, but the effects work by W. Earl Brown and Jerry Herman are terrific and a lot more imaginative than what was usually seen in the period.  The soundtrack is a fantastic combination of old and new music.  " The Man Who Failed " is a solid science fiction story that features a very human hero. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why I watched this.   For a good Hollywood movie it was the same kind of bad.  It had no plot.  One guy says how boring it is to be in a relationship.  The other girl doesn't think so either.  Both start laughing when they realize they are alone with each other.  Neither would ever want to do that, they would rather kill each other!  They get in their car and get into it.  Now the movie becomes funny and funny until the ending.  There is one scene that seems to be a car chase.  I didn't think they would get to a car since they don't have a driver.  So, they get to an abandoned house.  At the end of the house they are on top of a body in the basement.  They come up to the car and the girl asks what is going on.  Then the guy tells her how boring being in a "love" relationship is.  This whole thing is a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have watched a couple of these before and it was all about "the man from Neptune", who in every movie in this series seems to be a good man but really is a rotten bastard who is more evil than good, but hey I'm getting a bit old for that.   Anyway, after a long day in the hospital, Neptune, the father of the main character (Rolf), is being attacked by a shark. He has to use his magic to save his life, but he is too late and is left in a coma. Rolf goes out to find Neptune and he is just about to be killed when the doctor tells him about the shark attack. Rolph is then ordered to kill Neptune's son, but it turns out Neptune doesn't want to die and is able to talk Rolf out of killing him.  The two go to Neptune's home and are able to save the family, but they are unable to keep their eyes open after the shark's attack. After the attack Rolf is put in jail and Neptune, after talking to the doctor, goes into hiding for some time.  After Neptune has been out of the way Rolf decides to go looking for Neptune.  This film is a great film about love, friendship and magic.  I can't say anything bad about it, even though there are a lot of scenes where Rolf seems to have a lot more fun than Neptune does.  Rolf and Neptune's relationship was really sweet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most things that I've seen on TV, this was better than what it was based on.   It is a very well acted, well acted and well shot TV movie about a man that is a former police officer who is trying to find out who killed his wife.  He has a son that has been taken away from him as well.  It was a real treat to watch this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic, and the best part about it is that you can enjoy it without having a clue about what is going on.   Like the name itself says, this movie is about two lovers and an old house.  The couple are the first ones in their lives to have an "old house" and are having their first love affair.  It is a movie for all lovers of suspense, and it has a lot of it.  But it is the perfect movie for people who like mystery.  While the story is good and the characters are well-drawn, the plot is what keeps this movie going.  I found that the story was so good that I felt like I was watching a movie with a good story instead of just a thriller.  Just try to enjoy the story!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was an incredibly enjoyable movie to me, with tons of funny, well written scenes, and an interesting plotline.   The story itself was very well done.  When the people who brought the car to the beach were asked who their "heroes" were, there were a couple of names that came to mind for me:  The guy with the long beard  - The car was actually a "Pony", and the driver, the guy with long, white beard, is a cowboy/cowboy.  The girl with the glasses   - Her name is a reference to the movie "Dangerous Liaisons" (the movie where the hot girl in glasses starts having sex with the cowboy who was supposed to be her boyfriend.  If you have ever seen that movie, you can get the idea).    She got a tattoo of an eagle on her shoulder, which is a symbol of "Poleman", the legendary mythical warrior.  They also have a movie called "Pornstache", which is the movie where that dude who looks like a cross between the Hulk and the Terminator shows up and they have sex.  A lot of guys in the car, including some of the guys who were in the "Pixie"-The movie where a man who is supposed to get a lot of girls has to wear a wig (or fake one) to keep from getting laid.  This is also when she was supposed the meet the guy she is supposed be with (who looks like Captain America or Superman, but is actually a man) and the guy that looks like the Thing (The movie when two guys fight and make out).  They even have a guy (whose name is "Sparrow" a reference of the movie of the same name where two guys with sparrows are in love).  He comes to the aid of the girl and also has a "sparrow" with him.  He is voiced by the great James Woods (The guy who played the role of Jack Skellington in the movie that is "The Nightmare Before Christmas" ).   It's a fun movie, and it's definitely a worthy replacement for the original "Pineapple Express".   The "Polly" is a "Tornado"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is quite a shame that the original ending never made it into the TV-Series:  There is a great deal of potential in this one:  One thing that I always find most difficult with a sequel is the inability to resolve any issues:    This film was a lot like the original:   It was set a couple years after the end of the First World War:   There are a number of parallels between the war and today.   The film is based on a true story:   The writer, Richard Condon, who wrote "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" has been a long time member of the Army.   He has been at the front in many places:   He had been stationed on the western front in France, Italy and Russia.   His book had been made into a motion picture.   Condon is a very good writer:   But his book is set in a very different context:   In other words, this was a different story and a different setting:  He was a British soldier who went to the western Front in the First War.   At the front, he had been wounded twice and suffered many hardships:   One was the loss of his horse.   Another was the freezing cold and constant rain:   While he was at the frontline, he came upon a German soldier whose horse had been shot.   It turned out that this soldier's horse was not really wounded:   His horse had just run a race:   This was not exactly the stuff that Condon wanted to read about in his book:   So he set out to write a book about this soldier who was both a "bad boy" and a good soldier.   In his book, Condon was very critical of the French Army.  One day, he met a French officer who took a great interest in him.   After a few months, the French officer told Condon that he was getting bored with his soldier.  Condon told the French soldier that he wanted to write his own book about a soldier. The French officer thought it was a good idea:   "The book," said Condon.   "is not just about a man, it is about life."   The French soldier agreed to write Condon's book but insisted that he would only write about a British officer.   So Condon decided to travel to the front with a young woman:   Just as Condon had decided to write about the soldier who had been his
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is rather simple, though you'll get a kick out of watching it and it's really well acted, but if you've seen the previous one, you will be completely at home with this one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best films in recent memory, one of my favorite films of the year.   The movie is an excellent adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel, and a pretty good movie too, which is to be expected with a good writer who knows how to make his book read like a novel.  A good performance from all involved, and this is not one of those films with a ton of explosions or gore you will not want to see, but a well acted and well-directed movie you will want to go back to watch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are not familiar with this series, I recommend watching a few episodes first, before reading my review. It's an average action/mystery with a few twists at the end. It doesn't deserve to be called a masterpiece, but is an enjoyable series that can bring the audience into a story about a group of friends who all got addicted to some drugs. One of the characters is addicted to alcohol and tries to get her friend to join a drug ring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've ever seen a horror movie you know what I'm talking about. A man, a very bad man, is walking down the street and meets a young boy, the boy is very afraid and scared and in some weird way that guy is in love with the boy.   It's a very silly movie, really silly and I've only seen it once or twice in my life, so I have no idea how to rate it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good and funny film and a good reminder of how much freedom we have when we are born. It also points out that we are all born into this world to fight.   It is a great idea that is not realized very well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just had a great time with this movie. It's so good.    The first half is just so wonderful. The humor is all over the place.  I thought there was going to be a little bit of romance in this, but I don't think that's the case.  The ending was very well done, and it was definitely unexpected.  It's not often that I feel like this movie is just a fun movie that doesn't make me want to go out and get some dinner.  There's really no reason to go watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be one of the best movies I have seen in a while, a good drama with a strong story line.   This film was made for an American audience.  It had a strong message about being in a marriage that was doomed from the start because of an affair the wives are carrying on. The husband is a good guy but is unable to get over his wife's infidelity. There is a wonderful twist ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie about a bad guy.    The story is a little confusing, but I think the best thing about this movie is its cast.  I really like the chemistry between Tom Selleck and Peter Boyle as they talk over the phone, which is about the only thing we ever hear in this movie, and then the next thing I know we're in a bar and the next scene, they're on the run and we're inside a car chase.  So I guess what I'm saying is I liked this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is so great that I wish it were a three hour movie.   It's so good that I even watched the trailer for it before I watched the movie. There's one scene in the movie that I remember vividly.  A man (played by George Clooney) has a heart attack and can't wake up his wife. Then he's rushed into the emergency room. He's put in a wheelchair and is taken into a room with the doctor (played with great power by George Hamilton). The doctor tries to tell George the symptoms that he has (he has a cold), but it's a trick to get George to admit to his own heart disease. George finally admits to the doctor that his heart disease is inoperable and he can't afford the expensive treatments that a heart surgeon will give him. Then the doctor tells George to look at a picture of the nurse he loved. George is overcome by a feeling of peace and a smile breaks out on his face. The picture in the doctor's room has the words "She loved you as much as you loved her." And this is how the movie ends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a fantastic movie that deserves a lot of love.   This is a classic movie that has stood the test of time and will be remembered long after its last reel.  It was a masterpiece with a powerful message that was just as relevant today as it was then. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I had high expectations for this movie. The fact that it's set in a school in the 90s made it seem like a bad joke, but once I figured out who the bad guys were, I was hooked.   I've always wanted to see a good old fashioned 90s gangster movie, but this one is on another level.  I had the feeling this would end badly, and it did, but when a gangster shoots a gun, you've got to see it for yourself.  It's hard to find the words to describe a movie like this, but the best way I can describe it is that it has a little bit of everything: a lot of violence, a strong female character, and a very interesting plot.  This is a movie you should definitely give a shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great adaptation of a very fun book.   In a fantasy world where magic and human interactions are the norm, the people of a small town become accustomed to the presence of the'magical' Harry, the best boy at their school.  His classmates are all impressed by his ability to conjure small objects out of thin air. It is a wonder that Harry and his friends haven't been kidnapped already.  There are no magic scenes here, though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun film that doesn't stray too far from the original premise.   The "Manchurian Candidate" concept is pretty good, the story is pretty cool, and it's got a good cast.  I really enjoyed this film, I enjoyed the action and even the comedy, and I found myself wanting to see more and more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Taken 3" is an intriguing third entry in the "James Bond" series, and it's an interesting one to boot.   This is the third installment in a trilogy that has been around since the mid-sixties, and like all these James Bond movies it is a homage to what came before.  This movie has a pretty good cast of young actors that have aged up nicely and are very good in the film.  It is not as good as some of the earlier Bond movies, but it is still very good and interesting.  There is plenty of action with a lot of driving.  And as always, there is plenty going on in the background in a way that is more like a detective movie than a James Bond movie.  The third movie in the series takes a lot from the earlier films in the James Bond series.  A lot of the fun in this film comes from the banter and banter between Bond and Q.  I really enjoyed it.  Some of the scenes between the two are quite good.  Q and Bond are both quite well built and handsome, and the action scenes are enjoyable.  Unfortunately the plot of the film is not very good, it is really too bad.  Like all the other films in this series it is very silly and not very smart.  For one thing it is obvious that James Bond is going to die, but we never really learn why.  So far the movie has been made to be like a James Lafferty novel, except there is a lot less Bond and lots more action.  Of course in the novel it is clear why he has died, and in the action sequences Q is more mysterious and is more of a leader.  In the movie he is just there in a Bond disguise, and then he dies without having done much of anything.  Instead of being an adventure story the movie is more about the banter, Q and James Bond.  That doesn't help the film's story.  Although the film does have a good cast, there really isn't much of a plot to the story.   So while it is fun to watch James Bond get shot up and chase a baddie with a rocket launcher, it doesn't really make for a very good movie.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best bad movie I've seen in a while. I don't know why people like bad movies, but I like to watch them. This is a well-directed, well-acted, well written, well thought out bad movie. I was totally blown away by this bad movie (it was not a bad movie). I don' t know how bad bad movies can be, but this one is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent, well made movie with a great script and a good performance from Michael Caine.   The plot of the movie is very simple: the British are fighting a German Army in the Middle East. The Germans have landed in the Sinai Desert in order to invade Egypt.  It was the British who decided to give the Germans an easier task than expected, by sending two of their own soldiers on a suicide mission, one to kill the enemy leader and the other to get back to London.  But when the two soldiers reach the desert they are discovered by the Germans.  And when the Germans find them they kill them both, but not before the soldiers make a horrible death scene, which they can't even be bothered to edit out.  I loved this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was interesting enough. I can only really see the movie as a horror movie and that's where the movie is at its best. The movie had enough of a creepy atmosphere but still had enough action to keep me on the edge of my seat. I wasn't completely sucked into this movie, but it did keep me guessing and kept my attention as well.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie because it has a lot of character development. I like how he and his family try to live the quiet life, even if it means ignoring them. I also liked how he's trying to figure out who his father is. I was also a bit disappointed that it didn't make a bigger deal about his father's death or anything.   A good movie, but it wasn't the best of the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished watching The Devil's Advocate in a quiet theatre in my hometown of Barrie, Ontario.   This is a fine movie.  It shows off the great acting talents of William Gillette and a good supporting cast.  The setting is well done.  I love the old school style, but I like the new modernized style more.  This looks like a fun movie and I am looking forward to seeing it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a "dramatic" and "emotional" drama about the life and death of a famous poet. It is a very original film from the author of the novel, with a great cast including a young Dustin Hoffman and an Oscar-winning director of "Mysteries of Love", William Wyler.    The film is based on the life of the American poet Alfred North Whitehead, whose life was a mixture of the romantic and the surreal. He wrote about his love of poetry, his depression, his relationship with his mother and his thoughts about his children. His poems reflect his emotions: sorrow and pain, the loss of a beloved woman, the suffering of others, the longing for love, the pain of being alone and the joy of family life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's only "problem" is how bland it is.   I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but this movie just has nothing to it.  The movie starts off with an ominous song (I'm not talking about a bad song) and an evil man.  When a bunch of innocent people are attacked, the "villain" comes out of the shadows and does a lot of running around to find people to help him.  While doing so, he also finds a bunch more people, and a kid.  Then, at the end of the film, he goes to get his son and his son ends up dying.  After all of the chaos, the hero's son goes into the town hall to ask for help.  It's like the whole town just went out to the mall to play hide and seek with all the toys on the ground.  If the kid was a bit more than a kid, this movie would have made a lot more sense, but that's about all it did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this is a very good movie and should be seen by everyone. It was written by the brilliant David Mamet and it is about a group of friends and they are all very funny and charming. The main character is the funny, intelligent and very charismatic Michael Clarke Duncan and his co-star are very smart, charming and always fun to watch. I liked this movie very much!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first thought when seeing the trailer was this was going to be a cheap, poorly made film from some uninspired director. I didn't think that was possible since the director is a noted movie-maker and the cinematography was excellent.   However, as I sat in the theater I became increasingly intrigued.  In a very short time the film moves from an ordinary situation to a frightening and disturbing one.  I have to admit, I didn�t think there could be a better script for a horror movie.  It is a well-told story with a few surprises along the way.  The screenplay by William Goldman was very well written and I thought it would be a good idea to see what would happen if it weren�t for a couple of un-named, uncreative, evil characters.  This movie is extremely suspenseful and scary.  There is much to enjoy here and I highly recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is worth your time. If you are a big fan of Star Trek, you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a good popcorn movie.   In my humble opinion, this movie is a little bit better than some of the others from this year.  At its best, the plot is good, and the action is good.  However, it's a bit predictable, the comedy is a bit old, and one of the characters (an old lady) is a complete bore.  I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't, I'm giving it 2 stars because it was good, but not great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little nervous about this movie, and I'm still a little concerned. The movie is not as good as I remember, but it is not bad either. The action is good, the story is good and the characters are good.   It has a great feel to it, not too over-the-top, just enough to make you think and feel. I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of the film is a mixture of suspense and comedy, that gets more interesting in the second half.   First of all, this is a pretty well-made movie. There are lots of shots in the film that will remind you of a good classic.  Also, the story has a really unique atmosphere, where the protagonist (the villain, of course) is an author who has a love affair with a young woman.  The ending is not very convincing, since the villain's scheme is not that interesting, but it is fun to watch.  In the end, the film shows how a man can be more than just an author. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After I had seen the first 2-3 episodes, I was convinced I would enjoy this anime greatly.  It is a story about a very weak character, who has nothing to give, yet has a good will to do anything. He is given a mission to rescue someone who has a very unusual power.  He has a strong will, but lacks the skill to pull it out. He has to overcome a problem, and it is the one obstacle he has.  The comedy in the anime is funny at times, but the story itself is not worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that I thought was a bit dull and boring.

I can't remember a good and original movie like this in a long time and I'll be happy to see more movies like this.

But there is more!   After the incident, the girl becomes very depressed, tries to kill herself, gets help and so on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First let me state that I loved this movie. It was just good, good enough to make you go "oh this must be the best movie ever, and I've already seen more than a few of them."  It was pretty simple, but it had that "oh so cool" factor that keeps me going back.   I love movies with cool looking cars, the movie has a cool looking car, a motorcycle and even a car in the background.  It's just such a cool movie, the soundtrack and the editing are fantastic, and the movie ends on a very cool little cliffhanger.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw this movie, I was a little disappointed. I thought it might be about a bunch of homeless people who go on a camping trip.   But once I got over the first disappointment and remembered that it was shot on location in Texas, I thought the story was really neat. It's a little hard to tell whether this movie was filmed in or around Los Angeles, but this is definitely a very good movie, even though it was filmed almost entirely in Texas. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't understand the appeal of this movie, to be honest. I found the actors pretty good, the dialogue was good, and the action was good. The ending was a bit too convenient, but I can't fault the movie for that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a huge horror fan but I found this to be a great movie. It's pretty short but there is a lot of tension throughout the film which is good for a short horror movie. This is a good sequel to the movie 'Curse of Chucky'. I like this one a lot better than the previous version which is one of the best films in the series.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie very enjoyable. I think the movie should be made into a movie and I hope that they make it into a film in the future. I also found this film very interesting because it was about a boy who grew up to be an adult. There was nothing unusual about him and he was just like everyone else who grew old.   After the boy grew up and he married a woman he became the new owner of a farmhouse. He loved this farmhouse, but when his wife started to get sick, the boy had to take care of her.  He did a lot of things and became famous. The movie had a very funny story and it made me laugh.  I liked this movie and would recommend it to all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film which shows the human side of a child and his father. The story of how a child was separated from his mother at a young age and lived in his father's house for a while before he was eventually adopted. It is interesting to see how the relationship develops between the child and the father and his family. It also shows the father's relationship with his son and their life together. The child shows some of his father and what a caring and good father he is. I personally think this is a good film, I am looking forward to seeing it again when I see it on DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed watching this movie with a lot of friends. It was not too long but not too short and had a good plot. The story started with the usual murder of a little girl who falls into the lake. The next day there is a body found. After a quick investigation it turns out that she was drowned in the lake because the husband of the girl died in a car accident. It turns out this man killed her because she was trying to make a new friend. We then start the next day, the woman who was murdered returns and is upset. The wife of the murdered is arrested for the murder of the little girl. After this the next week there is another murder. This time it is a young woman who is found murdered and then a man gets arrested for that crime. We are then told that this little girl may not have been murdered but a man had kidnapped her. I found the whole story a little strange but overall a good film.

I don't know why it took me so long to see this film. It looks great, is exciting, well-written, and well-acted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot.   It is a decent sequel to the first one.  They just had to take out a lot of scenes which were boring for me, but I guess that is what is expected.  The character changes from a nice man in the first movie to a selfish one in the second.  This is my favourite sequel since the first, with all of the different people and scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a pretty good movie.   I'll try to put it in the context of the movie itself:  This movie is set in an alternate universe where the main character's grandfather was a good man, and the main characters' father is a bad man.  It's a good time to see that this movie had a lot of support from everyone involved. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this a while back on a late night television show and just had to go see it again.   This is a good comedy movie about a dysfunctional family.  This movie is based on a book and is about an alcoholic father who hates his son because the boy refuses to get a high school education and a mother who is determined to send her sons to college.  I liked it because it's about a family that was not broken and a father who was not selfish.  It was good because there was good humor, some good acting and good scenery.

I am not sure what kind of movie it is.  Perhaps it is a movie about guns.  You get your guns, you shoot at a bunch of people.  The bad guy, a little fellow, was fun to watch.  There was a big shootout at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So many good movies and characters and I haven't seen enough good movies.   And here we have a good film about the "American Dream" that is in the film a very clever film about a boy who is raised in a broken home and then finds a home in the world of professional wrestling.  It is a smart film with a few too many clever jokes for my taste.  In a film full of clever characters it was hard to get caught up in the jokes.  The film does a good job of introducing us to our hero and the character in the first half.  There is a nice introduction to the character and we can tell what his motives are.  This is a movie about a kid who finds himself on a big stage.  We see him grow as a wrestler and in a funny scene he meets a wrestler named Steve Austin and gets a match.  I have seen a lot of professional wrestlers in wrestling films and it was pretty funny to see a "wrestler" like Vince Russo (a wrestling character) as the guy who was the wrestling coach.  With the rest of the cast there were some good characters.  But the film was not nearly as funny as it could have been.  If you like comedy films like the original version of "American Pie" you will love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie isn't perfect.   There is one scene that was not so good.  Also, one scene didn't make any sense.  But this movie has a lot of good things.  First of all, it is a very good comedy about two people trying to kill each other.  The director does a good job in this movie.  It is pretty easy to see who is laughing the most.  So if you're looking for a good comedy that doesn't make the audience mad, you should check this one out.  I will say that this is a good watch in a slow way.

This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The ending of this movie was so great and so much better than the rest of the movie that it's hard to believe that it was made in 1972! It's like a sequel to the other classic B movies - The Goonies, where people were always missing in action and the characters were just fun, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, which had a funny old boy and an evil old man and a woman who couldn't get no satisfaction from sex and just loved the chase! It has these all wrapped up in a single movie, but it's so good and has such a great ending that it doesn't matter where the movie came from.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You might ask why I put a positive spin on a very bad movie.   I think the movie works as an entertaining romp through a great world, but its execution is not all that great.  The movie starts off with an intriguing sequence that takes place in a very unique world.      The movie takes place on a desert planet, and the main character is a child who goes out to the planet to play.  This planet is also the home of a race of people who are very beautiful, and who use their beauty to draw people to them and keep them in good health.  The setting is very interesting and very creative.  Also interesting is a lot of humor that is very well done.  In particular the movie makes a lot about people wearing different colored hats and different colored coats.  I would have liked to see a more developed story for the movie. It was a great start to a very fun movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good film:  This is an extremely well done movie with amazing performances.   The movie starts with a sequence of very good and suspenseful action scenes (with good editing and good direction).  The characters in this movie are likable:  One is an action hero who is quite a bit slow but has great reactions (when he is angry he does not act like an action movie villain) The other is a person who likes to take a bath and get a good shower.  It gives a good description to both of them and adds a hint of a different kind of action.  In the end the movie is more action than suspense:  The good acting, the excellent editing, the suspense and the action make this a good thriller movie:   It is not much of a mystery:  A few people want to kill a certain man, so he can be their target.  A good detective is also a bit suspicious, so it seems to be a very hard case to solve.  But at the end it is not really a big mystery.  This movie is good as a good horror movie: (if you have seen the first film:)   What you see in this film are not really the ghosts:    They are the people who have been so scared to death of the "ghost" that they have become part of the thing.  So it is easy to identify with them, but this is a movie that is more about the fear.  If you have watched the first movie you will get all the information about the plot:  It begins in the middle of a movie theater, where a man is shooting the guests for money.  Then a woman sees a dead body on the floor, and the man runs off.  Soon the movie theater is crowded with guests.  One of the guests is a young man named Sam, who wants to buy a gun.  There is a strange woman there named Mary who wants him to give her a gun and shoot someone.  The man does so, but it seems that Mary has been possessed.  Some friends of the woman are also there:  There are the ghost of a woman who has lost her son and is now a ghost herself.  And there is a man who is obsessed by the movie The Exorcist.  Once the guests have fled, it is the woman who attacks Sam, and she is not very good at what she does:  She has to find
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film that is well worth watching and will probably leave a bad taste in many people's mouths.   The story follows the lives of an entire family of refugees who flee their war-torn homeland for a better one.  They are accompanied by an old woman who becomes very close to them.  However, it is all very confusing to me and the whole story just seems to not fit together.  In the first scene of the film we meet the son who wants to learn to read and the daughter who wants an escape from the oppressive government.  After that, things go in to disarray when the son is caught with some stolen books.  We then meet the grandfather who wants his grandson back.  Then, they have a child.  At this point I could not tell which story line to follow and where the story should end.  It is a confusing film, and I couldn't follow the main character's mind.  I know some people think the film is better than it is, but I'm not one of those people.  The ending just doesn't make any sense to me.  A good thing about this movie is that it was made over a twenty-five-year period and the performances are good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very good movie.   This movie has something for everyone.  The comedy of the movie is strong, it has a strong message about human nature and how it affects people and how much money one can spend on anything.  It does not really have much to say about the war or the people of the US during the war, but it does have a great ending where a war hero sacrifices himself for his country and his country's pride.  This is a movie about human beings, and the movie shows that there is more to us than just our physical appearance and we all deserve respect and love no matter what we may be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen all of these movies on DVD and was surprised to find this on DVD. This is a great comedy with plenty of laughs and even some action. The action is great as well. This was probably made in the early 1990's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can see that this movie will probably be a very big hit. It stars:  A couple of people from the 90's and there's a good story behind it. I wish this movie would have had a few more people involved!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when I was really young, and it still reminds me of that childhood adventure I used to live vicariously through those kids in the movie "The Love Bug".   As a kid I always liked the movie because the kids in it had a nice sense of humor (which was often lacking in films of the time) and a good time.   It also showed just how fun the "hippie" culture of the 70's really was.  It's also interesting how the movie is not based on a true story.  (It is loosely based on the book "The Great Adventure", by Neil Simon, which itself is loosely inspired by the real life "Great Adventure" in the late 1970's in which a group of young people, some of whom were from Chicago, went from California to a new land in the Great Lakes, called "America".  )   This film also had a lot of good music (by the way, you can still find the songs "I Want to Be a Rock Star" by Frank Zappa and "I'm a Teenage Pirate" by Tom Morello and The Replacements), and a few songs in the soundtrack are still worth hearing, like "Dimebag Darrell" by The Replacers, and "The Hanging Tree" by the Zombies.  The movie even has a short, but fun song, entitled "Who Wants to Live Forever" which is about an abandoned ship that is found washed up on shore in the middle of the Pacific. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last movie I watched was "The Last Samurai", and I could see from the first seconds that it would be quite similar to "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly". This movie, on the other hand, is the one where the director actually manages to bring the "good guys" (i.e. the Japanese) to the victory (at the cost of their honor), so to speak.   It takes a lot of imagination to create a movie like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not know about the existence of The Lord of the Rings until the summer of 2003. It was in fact my first time visiting the movies that starred Christopher Lee (he played the Wizard Gandalf). The first thing I noticed about him was his voice. It sounds like he is from some far off land. He was also a bit stiff. In addition to all that, I didn't know what the movie would be about. After I finished watching the movie, I was hooked.   The Lord Of The Rings is a fantasy movie that you can watch with your family. It is set in Middle Earth. The story is about a boy named Frodo Baggins.  He is a small hobbit and is sent by Gandalf (the wizard) to save the realm. The movie has a fantasy feel to it. It has some good characters, some bad, and some funny. The LordOfTheRings is about the struggle for good in the world. It isn't all about battles and heroes. It explores many topics including family, faith, friendship, and bravery. It also explores the human condition. I don't think it is perfect. It feels like it is a film made to make people cry. There are some bad things about it, and not a lot of good things either. But it is still a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a very interesting movie. It tells the story of how two brothers, one of whom is a schizophrenic, meet in a mental institution for the sole purpose of trying to get their respective families to accept them.   They have two things in common: they both have a lot of unresolved family issues, and they have a really hard time of it.  To add to this, their mother is not supportive of either of them. It's like they were created for a purpose, but they were not meant for it. It really brings the movie to a head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little skeptical about a movie that claimed to be "a movie of the people".   The story seemed to have no plot, which isn't a problem, because it's a story about the people, and how they live.   They live in a small town, the "home of the free", and no one is forced to do any things they don't want to do.  When they do, they get to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  There are no special effects, and they are all done very well.  The movie is set during a drought, and the only reason they don the clothes, is because there are no other clothes to be had.  You know there is an "anonymous friend" in the movie, he is always in the background and is probably the best friend of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about the greatest tragedy in world history. The Holocaust was the culmination of a series of tragedies, and the one that happened to the Jews in the Holocaust is probably the most notorious.   It's really hard to describe how the Holocaust was bad and how it really happened to people who have suffered a lot in history.  They just were a bunch of people who just couldn't do anything about it.  It is so difficult to write about the Holocaust in an accurate manner, because it's so hard to really see what it really looked like.  There are so many atrocities, but most of them were not that bad, but the way they happened to innocent people was bad, and it's just impossible to write an accurate account about it all.  This film was made in an era where it's easy to not look at everything that happened, and because the Holocaust wasn't an easy to talk about topic it was easy to hide it all and just pretend like it never happened.  For years it was not even called the Holocaust, but that's how people talked about it, and most people believed it was all just a buncha stuff that happened because it happened to a bunch or people.  In the 70s a lot of people believed that it really was a crime.  The Nazis were bad, we know that, but how the Nazis did things was just so horrifying.  And then of course there was the Jews, a group that was so completely despised by the rest of the world that they were put in concentration camps and they didn't have the chance to speak up.  Most people in the world had no idea what happened to them.  So I guess what I want to say is, just don't look at it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was blown away by this movie. There was so much in this movie I had to stop and review it. I was not expecting to like it.   Well, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie.  From the very beginning you could tell this was a classic.  The characters were all very different, there was plenty of romance, suspense, action and a lot of humor.  There was a lot to love about this movie, but if there is a flaw in this picture is that the soundtrack was not that good.  I could not find many things to praise in this.  This movie is not for everyone. It's a little difficult to see this movie because it really is a classic, but people are going to love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good movie and it is not an old movie. This one has lots of great action scenes in a story about an American military policeman who is assigned to the U.S. embassy in Tokyo during World War II. The movie is set during the war, and is about a policeman who has to do various odd jobs to survive. It is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really good, and not only the story is awesome, the movie looks good too.   In the first part of the movie we see the adventures of four men who travel the world together.  One of the other men is called Captain Jules, who has a wife and two children, and has never seen a woman before.  He finds a beautiful woman on the beach, and after he gets her pregnant, he has an affair with her.  The other men try to convince him to keep his affair a secret.  Then Jules has to take care of his children when the man he loves goes to war.  When he returns, he decides to move on with his life, and is then visited by the Captain and the two other men.  So he can be with his beautiful wife again.  But Jules's wife is not happy about his new love, and he then falls in love with another woman.  At that point Jules is visited by a ghost and his wife, and they both become obsessed with revenge.  It is a great movie that has many good scenes, great acting, and great cinematography. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to pretend I've seen every movie of the 80s, but I've tried. I've watched a good deal of these films (my favorite is probably Night Shift ) and I've never seen a better film than this. I don't have a lot to say about the film itself. It is, at its core, a story about two men who want to have a few beers with a stranger while enjoying the great outdoors. It has all the trappings of a 1980s college drama. A young couple who are both good-looking, but not particularly great-looking. A strange couple who seem to be friends until they are not. A campus where you can find a great lot of drunk and disheveled young men, including a pretty woman, a guy who seems to have problems with women, and a couple of people who seem more than a little like they might be from a B-movie. I loved it. I think that is what most of the people who like the film enjoy: the film has all of the right trappings to be great entertainment. I'm sure it would be good fun for a small group of people to watch it and I think this is the case.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing about this movie, is it is a great movie.   From the opening shots you get a sense that this movie is not going to end with a happy ending.  But it does, in fact, end with an amazing ending. And there is more to this movie than the ending. The movie is a lot of fun, and has it's moments of brilliance, however the story is not quite up to par.  Overall the movie was enjoyable, and it is worth watching if you like a good story, as well as a great action movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When a good story (and a good directing and script) can be combined with a great performance from Michael Chiklis, who is a perfect choice for the role, and a fantastic supporting performance from a wonderful and talented supporting cast.   In many ways, the picture is more about the world that is portrayed (or more accurately, about an alternate world), than it is about the main character.  The story itself could have been much more complex if it had more characters, or if it took more time to get to the point of the story.  Also, in order for the movie to reach its potential, a lot of work must have been done on the music and sound effects, which was very disappointing.  But overall, this is an excellent piece of filmmaking, and one of the best movies that I have seen in some time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been wanting to see this movie for so long, but I had to wait till I could see it on my big screen (I'm a big fan of the 70s movies and I saw a few with my mom on TV that I think were pretty cool, but this one is on a whole 'nother level). The film is set in the early 1900s in the small town of Tullamore, in South Wales, in a time when the great coal-mine at Tullingar had been working for decades, and a mining engineer named Andrew "Blackie" Williams (Peter Capaldi) has his eyes set on a different kind of adventure. While the townspeople are getting drunk in the streets (yes, that happens), Andrew and his team have a difficult time keeping the mine running. Then they hear a terrible story: A young girl named Nell, who is believed to be insane, was last seen at a local park one morning, where she had just finished chopping wood to fuel her mother's stove. After the young girl vanished, the local police have no leads and so Andrew decides to look for her and to test his faith in God. This, of course, leads to all kinds of trouble. Blackie can't help but be drawn to Nell because he can sense her supernatural powers, and there are several other members of his team who don't feel so safe around Nell and have trouble with her even when they know what she can do. Unfortunately, Blackie is no angel, either, and he doesn't know what to do when his faith gets the better of him.   Nell:  I thought Nell was the scariest part of the film, the one who scared me most. She is a very powerful demon and her behavior and behavior are disturbing. She has no respect for anything, and doesn't take responsibility for her actions. She's also very angry, so I can imagine what would happen if she caught wind of someone messing with her, and she comes after them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. It is a comedy but it is also a romantic. The chemistry between the characters is wonderful.   One of the reasons that I watched this movie is that I was tired of all the sequels of the previous films. I found that the characters in this movie were all of the same type.  It is about a woman that is a witch who is trying to raise money to help the poor.  In the middle of the movie the story takes a turn for the tragic.  I didn't find this movie to be that good but it was entertaining enough to keep me wanting more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not looking forward to seeing this movie at all, the last time I saw it was a decade ago and since then it's been out of print.   This is actually a remake of a Japanese movie that came out in 1988 called The Bride of the Dragon.  The movie begins in a Japanese castle where a man named Kenji has been summoned to bring back a beautiful and beautiful-sounding girl, whom he doesn't know.  He decides to hire a Japanese swordsman, who also doesn't have a clue what he is supposed to do.  While waiting for them, a boy named Yoshida appears and asks Kenji for a special sword, which is a pretty useless sword.  Eventually Kenji is told the reason for the summon by Yoshida, and that he is to kill a dragon.  This seems like a typical movie, but this movie manages to be a little different.  For one, the movie starts out with a scene of a giant sword in the sky.  It is not clear whether or not this giant sword is to deliver good or bad news to the characters.  Yoshida says he wants to kill this dragon, and it is probably obvious who he means.  But, then it dawns on Kenji that Yoshida is in the body of a girl and, therefore, this is a different type of girl.  In a funny scene, Kenji and Yoshida play a game of hide and seek, with a big difference in this game.  When they hide, it appears to Kenji as though the dragon doesn't want him to find the girl, so he sneaks around in the woods for a while.  Unfortunately the girl eventually returns and he is forced to fight her.  What makes this film interesting is how, for the first time in the movie, there are no dragons.  Instead, there is a group of humans called the Fortunes, who are called the "Dragon Lords."  These Fortunies have no interest in killing the dragons and are actually quite nice, and they actually want to help.  Although this is not the first Dragon Lord film, it is the first I saw where the Fortunate are given actual dialogue, and the movie has a pretty good ending.  I found the movie quite amusing and thought it was worth seeing, even though it wasn't very good.

It would have taken a lot to make this movie any better but a few minor improvements would have made the movie good."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. The first time I saw it I thought it was so beautiful and romantic. When it was all said and done, it didn't have anything to do with that beautiful romance. I like to read books, but never have I been enticed to sit down and have a read. But this movie did that for me!   The story was really a romance and romance is wonderful. But, there was something to a scene, which happened during one of the many interludes in the story.   It was when a priest was talking to an old man. And he told the old man that he'd be married to his daughter one day, but that it would be "as soon as the sky is blue."   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very well-made movie. I don't really know what more I can say. It's a fun movie to watch and there are plenty of jokes and good gags. I really don't see why there isn't a bigger production company making this stuff.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing that last scene in the end, and the last scene of the first, I was completely bored with the film for most of the time. I don't mean that it was boring because there was nothing to it. That's what you'd expect from a science fiction movie and a movie that takes itself too seriously to be even called a film. It has nothing interesting to offer in the way of plot or characters, yet I'm glad it exists in order to fill me with despair.

It's not a Holocaust movie but it's not about the holocaust either, but the movie is really about the struggle for independence, self-respect and self-determination. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know why they don't call it The Return of the White Rabbit!   It is so much more than just that, but there is a lot of it.   The story has the usual over-the-top comedy in it. This time the "joker" is a little bit on the nose. His first victim is a young, well meaning lady.  The "sugar" part of his name is very fitting too, in case you didn't know.  With the exception of some of the dialogue, I found the "plot" to be rather thin, but the story was entertaining.  As usual, a good performance by the little ones and the voice acting was top notch.  I liked the little "tween" characters and I'm glad they made an appearance.  It was fun to see a new family member.  And the ending was just a little too perfect.  This is the best of the "White Rabbit" series, but I don''t think anyone would mistake it for a children's movie.  If you liked "White Lightning" or "White Christmas", "The Return of The White Rabbit" is the way to go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this a couple of times before I could even say it's good.   The story is pretty good, but it takes a while to get started and then everything sort of takes a turn towards the silly and then it's all good fun.  There are a few references to the old west that will make you go 'Who the hell were those guys? They were a bunch of hicks!'   My favourite character was the one who was the most dastardly and most entertaining villain of them all.  I think he was a very good actor and he's a very likable villain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to this movie. I like good movies. The story is simple and straightforward. It's a simple story of a young boy who learns from his older brother that his father is the bad guy in a strange world, and the bad guys in the world want to make the boy be good in exchange for the good guy to turn into the bad boy. The way this movie is written makes it easy to understand. The bad guy always has something against the boy, he always makes a mess of things for the boy. And the boy always comes out on top.   This movie is a wonderful example of a good child rearing movie. The parents are very supportive of the child's innocence, while his uncle is also supportive of his innocence. When the bad bad guy tries to kill the boy's father, the uncle gets the kid and the family to safety. The uncle even puts a little bit of magic in the boy to protect him from the bad dude.

It's so good, I want to cry every time I watch it, and I'm about to! It's a story about a woman who meets a man on the road who will change her life. He's from a different country, has never been there, has a different religion, and is trying to make a living in the backwoods of New York. He seems to be going about things in a very peculiar manner. It begins when the woman's horse dies and she is left a widower, and she decides to take up the task of raising a boy to be a hero of justice. I found this interesting in all its aspects. It is a story that will stay with you for a long time.

This movie is actually a fun little movie about a young boy who is sent to a boarding school by his father.  We see him as an angry, spoiled, rude, selfish, and a little child, all at the same time.  It's a little bit like The Big Lebowski except that instead of a guy smoking in his apartment, we have a kid that smokes a cigarette.  The movie is enjoyable, but in all honesty I didn't love it. I mean it's fun for a little while and then it gets boring.  I just thought the movie wasn't really well acted or acted well. I'm not sure if I was bored.  If you're going to see this, I would just recommend you to get over the fact that it's a funny little movie, because there really isn't much of a movie to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the trailer for this movie in the mid nineties, and the way they described this movie is exactly how it sounds: a man finds a dead body, and then he finds a bunch of stuff (guns, tools, etc.) and goes in search of the killer. Well, they had a good time doing the "search" for the killer, and all he had to do is stand in a tree, and he'd have the killer running away, wouldn't he?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is the funniest film I have seen in a very long time.   Its about a man who wakes up with a hangover and tries to be normal to escape the bad vibes. Unfortunately, when he tries to act like a normal guy, his problems only worsen.  The movie is about how the bad stuff happens to everyone, and what it takes to survive it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing the title of this movie, I thought, "oh shit, there's a sequel to a bad movie." Well, it was bad but not THAT bad, and with a great performance by the great Jeff Bridges, it's still worth watching.   While this sequel was not a bad film, it was still very bad.  It was an attempt to create a new type of movie, and what it was trying to do was to recreate the classic Western genre.  While it may work in that regard, the story is not original at all.  The movie attempts to tell a story about a bunch of people who get together to ride a train and shoot at bad guys.  Instead, it is simply a bunch who get to stay in a house in a town and shoot the bad guys at a school and a church.  After a few minutes, the movie tries to be more original and goes for a different tone, but it comes off as cheesy, and there is not a lot of suspense.  And, since this is a movie based on a book, it also tries to keep the book's theme, but they did nothing special with it.  Overall, this is not really a bad sequel at all, but the original Western never really got made into a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is probably the most entertaining movie about pirates you're ever going to see.   The music is great and the story is good but I had a very bad time watching it.  The movie's action scenes are pretty well done but not very creative.  I can see why this movie is good though:  The pirate is really good at being a pirate and doesn't use any special equipment or magic at all.  A man on a bicycle takes him to an island (I don't know if he goes on a date or not) and the pirate is able to kill the guy with one kick to the face.  It was pretty fun seeing the pirate go from being a small pirate to becoming a larger pirate to a big pirate (that's pretty cool too).   There are some really good jokes in this movie that you won't find in the original book, although I think a lot of the jokes here are really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, it is a great movie that could be good for all the people.   There are some good movies in this movie such as:  First Contact:  The second   movie from 1979.  Star Trek: The Motion Picture:  the last Star Trek movie that i remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd like to thank Mr. John Carpenter for not only creating one of my favorite films, but also for giving me one of the most unique experiences of my life.   When I heard John Carpenter and Richard Bachman had collaborated in the creation of a movie in which a man is forced to wear a mechanical suit (with no skin on the face), I was a little skeptical that something so bizarre could be a good film.  As I said before, I thought the film to be extremely bizarre, even to myself.  The movie is about a man who must wear a face mask in order to escape from a mental institution.  In the process, he discovers that the mask is really nothing more than a large metal cage that contains his consciousness.  But what's most bizarre is that his consciousness is constantly being controlled by a strange robot in the room with him.  What I didn't know at the time, though, was that the robot's programming also includes a computer which is constantly controlling the robot.  Eventually, the robot decides to leave the man's life for good and that's when the mask comes off.  I think that's the beginning of a very strange film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story was about a guy who goes to a house for the wedding of a very famous actress, but he is not allowed in the house and his whole life changes for the worse when she is murdered on the same day.   This is a story about an ordinary guy with ordinary problems who tries to find out the truth in this house.  What is a perfect movie is the characters.  I liked this movie because I didn't know a lot about this actress but I got to know her quite well.  I liked the way she played the part, I liked the film because it is about a pretty normal guy and he's in love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm pretty sure I heard about this movie before, but only recently did I realize it's actually a really good movie.   The plot takes place during the American Civil War in Georgia, where the Confederate army is fighting a guerrilla war against the Union army.  It seems to take place in a different time period than some of the other Civil War movies, but I still enjoyed it.  There's a bit of political drama, so it's a good war movie with a good story and a great soundtrack.  This isn't a war movie like a lot of people might think it is, but there's a lot to like about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The thing that amazed me about the film was the sheer number of memorable and very funny scenes. A movie like this is so funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a decent comedy that is well-written.   It stars an aspiring actress who wants to become a star but has a difficult time making a name for herself.  There is a long, stinky hallway that ends in an empty room.  The actor walks through that hallway and says:  - "Oh, I see you have a problem." - "What's wrong with me? - Look! I'm a big star!"    The woman, played by a lovely Nancy Allen, is a bit out of her depth but then her friend is in the same spot, with no one to help.  I found it funny but nothing special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't even know how to properly describe this movie. It's a pretty straightforward action movie, but one that I find very entertaining, not to mention hilarious. The movie has all the hallmarks of the classic movies of the 30's and 40's; the wacky and good looking leading men, the good action scenes, and some great music (aside from one song which is a little over the top).   It is a film that everyone should see at least once, though if you're a fan of good old Hollywood, then you already know what to expect from it.   This is one of those movies that's worth seeing again and again; I look forward to seeing it every Christmas, as a way to keep the family happy, and as a nice break from the real world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most memorable scene is the part that takes place right after the climax. When the heroine has a bad day, the hero has a good one.   -I've heard that the author wrote a short story in French, and when he was asked what he was thinking of doing for a living, he replied that he would rather be a lawyer and a soldier, than a writer, but in this case it doesn't matter what he does; because what he has done in the last two hours will never be forgotten.  -This movie is a must-watch. The suspense and tension is almost unbearable, and the scene with the cat is very touching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only real bad thing about this movie is that the acting was bad. It's like a terrible movie with terrible acting:  Well, the thing about being a movie-maker is that it's easy to get a movie made.   I don't think this movie could have done much to be better.  There was a whole lot of talk about the future and technology, but nothing about the real future:  This movie was so silly and stupid that I don  This is one of those movies where a bad action movie could never be improved.  I haven't seen a movie this bad in a while.  The story was that a group of scientists are trying to develop a cure for a cancer that affects the brain, but one scientist has an obsession with his girlfriend.  What a dumb story!  The idea of a group trying to find a cure is interesting, but not in the way they would ever try.  Well here's where things start getting stupid.  All of the scientist have sex with the "cure" and it turns out that they were all going to die, so the cure never worked.  After that the scientists had to find another cure.  So in the end they get another stupid cure and then another, and now they're all dying.  They even use the "Cure" to make the characters smarter!  How does that help?  I can't see what all the scientist did to make their lives better. They all did the same stupid thing in different ways.  It's as if the movie was written by people who were watching soap operas.  Yes, there was a soap opera going on and it was boring, but I guess I'll just watch it with some popcorn and some alcohol. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a chance to meet and interview actress, actress, and writer, Kelly Macdonald at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival.   Macdonald, a former student of Shakespeare who is now an established movie actress, had nothing but praise for the film:  "The movie is the most beautiful work of art that I have ever seen. It is so well put together and it's so well done and it is so very beautiful. And, I don't know, I've never seen anything quite like this before."   The movie tells the story of a young woman named Sarah (played by Macdonald) who comes home from a day's work to find her mother, aunt, and friend murdered.  Sarah must search for her own killers to find justice for them and protect her community.  Her love of nature and her family's love of each other are the strong pillars upon which the film stands.  I think it is important to note that this is not a movie to watch just once.  Mac Donald's acting, her style of acting, and the music of the movie combine to make one of the most fascinating stories of our time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 5 minutes of this movie make you wonder why it took so long to make a movie about a man who makes a living by trying to kill people.   This is a bad movie but not so bad that it becomes too good. It is a comedy so you don't expect much from it but even after 10 minutes you are laughing a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is very good. Not to say that it is perfect and that it can't be improved upon. It just has a few flaws. The music in this film is great. The actors are all good. The direction is good. I like the special effects, but I wouldn't say they are spectacular. I guess if you want to see a good space opera set in a future space station, this might do it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many people, I had a difficult time figuring out what to make of the new   Star Wars   movies. First of all, I'm a big fan of the prequels, and I loved them as well. There was something so   out of place about this new film, a bit too much like the prequel trilogy. Even the most faithful Star Wars fan would have a hard time telling this film from the pre-quels.   The second film had some fun, but in the end, the   trilogy falls down a bit.  To be honest, it isn't worth the trouble it takes to get through it.  This will be a good example of what happens when the Star Wars saga goes too far afield.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so damn bad, you could not even call it a comedy.   The plot is so poorly thought out.  This film is so much like a bad cartoon.  All the characters and the movie itself are so poorly animated and have such bad dialogue that it's not funny.  The main characters are so unappealing.  I feel that this movie is not so bad because it was made in the 50's.  It's not so horrible because it's made in 1990.  You can see all of the bad cartoons from the 1950's all of these bad movies from the 1960's all all of that bad cartoons made in 1970.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I was at a party last night with some of my buddies, and when we turned down the last door of the house, which leads to a large, empty field. The house was empty, and the trees that surround the yard are so long and thick they seem to go on forever.   This was a great movie, and I loved it all the way through.  The kids were cute, the music was nice, and there was some funny stuff here and there, but this is no Pixar.  I've seen a lot of Pixar films, but I have never seen anything with a sense of humor like this.  It had a lot to do with the actors, but it also had a sense that there was more than one plot.  That's not a bad thing, and it makes the movie so much fun to watch.  This is a very enjoyable movie for all ages, and one that I highly recommend to all Pixar fans, and anyone who likes a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First things first: the movie is pretty great, I found myself laughing at many of the moments (most of them), it is a story about a guy who is forced to go to a movie theater because his boss told him to and he goes in, and as the story starts he's stuck in a theatre in a theater in a movie theatre.   The movie starts out rather slow, but as the movie progresses you realize what the film is going to be.

I wish more people would watch it, so that people who don't know about it, would get a good impression of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is not the kind of movie you see in the movies theater to be amazed by a good action film. But you would be surprised at how far you are willing to go to get the movie over with.   The film is set in Hong Kong in 1970. There are two police teams, the Hong Kong police and the London police. There is a British agent who is looking for a man named Bruce Lee. The man is living in Hong, the woman is Chinese. Bruce Lee had the same mission as the British agent. The British agent had a special agent, who he met in a bar. Bruce is sent to Hong to meet this woman.  Bruce is captured in the hotel lobby. A policeman from the Hong team attacks Bruce. The woman helps him escape. After the rescue she gets captured by the Hong police. After escaping she has sex with the policeman and goes to the bar.  It seems like a comedy movie at first but there are a few funny scenes.  The best scene is when Bruce Lee is hanging from a crane by a rope when he is about to fall to his death.  As this is a Hong Kong movie there are some funny scenes where the action scenes go in a very bad way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those good movies that doesn't need to be made into a "good movie", but is really quite good in its own right.   The characters are all nicely drawn, and the story has a very interesting and surprising ending.  A few of the scenes in the last third of the movie are beautiful in their beauty and poignancy.  It is sad that I can't find the time to watch it again just to watch the final scene (which is not a very long final scene, at least by modern standards), but I'd recommend it to anyone who loves good, good, and good movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the third film by director David Lean in a row I've liked very much. I've had a few of these from the silent era and this is probably my favourite. It's about a man whose home is surrounded by beautiful countryside and he's a very sensitive, well-mannered man. But then his wife has an affair with a local farmer and then a terrible tragedy happens. So his life changes completely. I'm just very much enjoying it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first time seeing a movie in this form was at the old Paramount, a converted railroad station that was converted from a movie theatre. The movie was " The Man Who Loved Women." I have a lot of respect for these movies. They tell their stories with sensitivity, realism and a sense of the absurd. The story is a simple one - a young couple (Eddie and Dorothy) meet a young woman, (Sally) and fall in love. I was especially fond of Sally because she was so sweet and innocent - and even had a talent for music. Sally had her own piano, which I found amusing. It wasn't until the movie was over that I realized there was a sequel planned. When it was announced the second film was being made it really brought back some of those memories. It was a good experience, but a rather short one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a feeling that this one will go down in history as the best American gangster movie ever made.   The cinematography is masterfully shot.  This movie is a gangster flick that is at once gritty and romantic.  The movie is about a gang of tough guys who are given a chance to settle scores with a rival gang of corrupt cops.  To do so, they set up a high stakes poker game that the cops win.  As the story unfolds, the tension escalates and a plot twist that has never been seen in an American film is revealed.  For those of you who are not familiar with the American gangsters, it's hard to believe that this is a movie made in the 1960's.  It's very entertaining, and I recommend it highly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off: This movie does not suck.   It's a simple movie about a couple who live together in a beautiful apartment, with a cat and a dog.  When the couple decides to travel to a remote island, their cat starts acting strangely, and they find out that the island itself is full of snakes.  They quickly set up camp and get through a few days.  The island is very beautiful, the views are awesome, and the people are lovely.  It doesn't feel like you're in the jungle, though, it feels like you've been dropped off in the middle of a tropical paradise.  This is a movie that is worth seeing, though it doesn't have anything revolutionary about it.  If you're interested in a little adventure, don't get too distracted by the nice scenery.  But if you're looking for a great movie about how not to deal with snakes, this is it. It's got a very charming story, and some pretty fun characters.  There's a lot of fun in this movie, though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this movie was well done but that does not give me the same sense of amazement that I get when I watch a good classic film like Vertigo.   This movie starts out like most classic films from the silent era, it has some good acting but not to the point of being good.  It does have some great music and some great sets.  The story is just a typical romantic comedy with some interesting bits.  I would like to see a remake of this but it would probably be better to just have a remake, as the classic characters are still there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't want to give too much away, but when I got to the big opening scene with the two girls, I realized that this movie had a lot going for it.   There's a couple of great moments.  You can't help but smile when they say "we're gonna have a lot of fun this evening."   The main characters, a pretty blonde and a hot looking brunette, don't give a damn what people think of them, because they have a good time and a good relationship.  It's a good film, but don't get it just because of it's funny scenes, because those scenes are good too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is really something magical about the original movie. It reminds me of my childhood. I was the only kid in my family with any kind of interest in film.   It wasn't even a very good movie, I think I enjoyed it more than I should have.  I was an only child, so I didn't have any of the friends that the parents had.  It's not a particularly good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to agree with everyone else here on this site; this movie does NOT make me feel like I should go out and pick up a gun and go kill a lot of people.    This movie is all about an old couple and their son.  One day when their son is about four years old, he tells his mother about his favorite book;  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.   As he tells this story to his mother, they sit down and he begins to read.  Then the story gets very confusing and it gets a little confusing as to how to go about saving the boy.  After all the confusion, the boy comes to the realization that he must kill a person to save his friends, that is the end of the story.  They never discuss this story again in the rest of the movie and this is it.  There is a small flashback that shows them together in a car.  The old man tells the boy the story and this makes the boy angry and he starts to fight the old man.  This does not sit well with the mother and she tells the old guy to get out.  He tells her to get the girl back to the car, she is not angry with the boy, just a little bit upset about the way things are going with him.  His mother is angry with him because the boy keeps asking about the book.  It gets pretty messy but eventually the mother takes the boy and their dog and leaves.  We come to the last scene and the old couple comes up to the boy to take him home and the boy is about to leave and he is about ready to run away with the dog when a stranger comes up and he tells the stranger about the story of Harry Potter.  As the story goes on and the stranger tells the story, the old woman realizes how to protect her son and what the book means.  At the end, the stranger thanks the boy for his story and says goodbye.  I didn't really like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this a couple months ago, and it's definitely one of the better examples of the genre.   The story of a couple who are out to find a job as a caretaker of a house is well-written and funny.  I'm a sucker for old fashioned stories about the hardships of being a poor man and a housekeeper.  It was well-produced, and with the right music and lighting the pictures were so lifelike you felt like you were living inside a Victorian home, complete with scented candles and an ornate mantelpiece.  But there's nothing new under the sun;  this is just a variation on a theme that has been used countless times, and the film is a treat for old and young alike.

The Empire is portrayed very well, a very stern and grimy looking organization. The new characters have a nice little story of their own and are just funny. The soundtrack is good. The special effects are excellent and are certainly better than the first one.   Overall, the second one is a lot better than a lot of other ones.

This was a solid action packed movie with some nice scenery.  For a film that ran over two hours, it was an easy watch with a very good plot.  It did have a very strong cast, but there was too many to name here.  Also, there were a couple of minor inconsistencies in the movie but nothing major enough to ruin it for me.

I remember I watched it for the first time in a cinema where I went to see the latest French film The Return of Jacques Becker. I wanted to understand the film, the French, the characters, how to behave, where to find good food. I had already read the books about the film. The author was Jacques Becker, the French director of the movie. I felt the film was too dark, but I liked it very much. I like the dogs too. I have never seen a film like this film. I don't know who did it, but what a great film it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My god, how the f**k did we get a live action version of The Wizard Of Oz?! I was expecting it to be a straight up adaptation (as much as possible, of course), but it was so much more. Every single character has a distinct personality and a way with a bow.   The songs were all great, and that's not a flippant statement, it's just fact.  The whole film was so fun. I've heard a lot of bad movies but none so much as this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not gonna lie. This movie really sucked. But I was still watching it the whole time. Because of that, I know that there is something I am missing when it comes to movie's with vampires and monsters. In movies, I usually like to think they are always a good guy, so I really did not expect to like this movie. It was really lame, so really lame. It reminded me of the first time I watched The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1.   This movie reminded me so much of that. The acting was the same way, I feel like the actors just wanted to do a good job on the part they played. This is a bad movie. Not good at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the few good movies I have seen in recent years. It features a well-built, ruggedly handsome hero who gets caught up in the machinations of a very dangerous and complex political figure.   The two main characters, an honest police detective and a young Congressman with an unerring sense of justice, find themselves caught in the middle of an intense political maneuver that is the very definition of "who's in power, who's not" in America. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen a good horror movie in a long time, but this is actually pretty good!     The characters were all very well fleshed out, and it never felt like it was going to be a cliche scene from a cheap slasher movie.   This was a good, fun little movie that was well paced and never let down its viewers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never heard the term "Hollywood Homocide," but if this movie can truly get its name right, it's a good thing that it happened.   The film is made up of scenes filmed in the San Fernando Valley during the period following the 1947 earthquake and the nuclear blast at the Los Alamos test site.  The survivors live in "Hollowtown," a bleak, uninhabitable town where their only entertainment are the many animals that roam the streets.  During a visit to the Hollywood Hills, a woman (Talia Diggs) who has lived in the area for 50 years sees the ruins of an old Hollywood house and, thinking it a movie set, invites a bunch of friends to tour the place.  While on a tour, they are attacked by a large, vicious dog and nearly die, before they discover the house has been recently "hollowed out."  It turns out that the house was once home to a rich family that lost most of their money in the earthquake and subsequent nuclear tests.  It's not a story that's worth telling, but it's well-told and entertaining.  A good mix of gore, humor, and emotion make it a good film, with a satisfying ending.  I also found it very interesting that in the "post-modern" times the people of the city are obsessed with the past, with all its ghosts, strange creatures, and secrets. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a fun adventure.   The setting is not too exotic, but the characters are unique.  It is funny, yet it is an accurate and realistic depiction of what happens when a group of "super-villains" band together to take down a "dowager" who is taking on a larger than life role as a public protector of the city.  The villain is a clever guy and he knows how to use his people and abilities well to fight against an enemy who is out to destroy everything he knows.  You will laugh, then laugh again.

From the very first shot of a car chase to the last shot of the film, it is one of the most memorable movies that I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching this movie about a couple of men who get caught up in a massive heist in a downtown casino and then the entire casino explodes, it is obvious that the writers of this movie must have spent a lot of time in the middle of nowhere watching reruns of old television shows or maybe visiting a desert town. After the credits roll, I have to wonder whether it was just a dream or if someone set up a fire and set some candles in the casino and let the fire burn.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -It's a real pleasure to see that an adaptation of a popular Japanese manga/anime has the makings of a decent film. Not just any adaptation, this one has the added benefit of some real originality.   In a world where people like Shion (played by a great Hedy Lamarr) are treated with such disdain by most of the people around them, Haruko (Shizuka Ito) lives a quiet life in an abandoned building in a rural village. There she meets a man named Mito, who, although not having a happy life, seems to be a good man at heart. When Haruko is attacked by bandits in the night, she seeks Mito's help. He takes her to the village and tries to find Mito. However, as they travel, the two begin to bond, eventually becoming good friends. At the village's inn, Mito is asked by a local woman to look for some missing people. While searching, the woman (played with real pathos by Yoko Iwasaki) becomes infected with a strange illness. Although Mito suspects it may be nothing more than a bad dream, he goes to look at the inn anyway, believing that it is haunted. Haruko decides to stay over at Mito and help him look. While she is away, the local woman is attacked and Mito finds out that she is a witch. It is then that he learns of the real reason behind her illness: the people in the inn are dying because they don't want to do the will of the witch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little worried about this movie because I haven't seen it in a while, so I was interested in seeing it once more.   The film is well acted, and it doesn't get too long.  The story is good and the performances are good, but there are a couple of things that I didn't quite like about the movie.  I think the story was overlong for the first half of the movie (not because it was hard to get through, but because it took a while to develop the characters).  The second half of movie didn't really do anything new or original, which may have been a good thing because the rest of movie was pretty good.  There are a few things that annoyed me with the movie, but I'll let you discover those for yourself.  At the end of the film, there are some nice visuals that reminded me a little of a couple scenes from the movie "The Muppets" (I'll review that soon).   So overall I liked the movie a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film.  It's a simple tale. It's about a small, goodhearted man who gets caught in a web of intrigue and corruption that he himself helped create. It is the same plot as 'Naked City', the same characters.  You can't really put a finger on it. It looks like a pretty straight and simple film but somehow it's more than that.   It will keep you entertained.  There are a few scenes that don't really work but the rest are fine.  The ending has a great sense of humour. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed watching this film. It was well written, with an excellent plot. The acting was good, with all the actors portraying the right roles. There were even good comic scenes here and there. If this film did not end with such a shocking ending, then there is no way it could have been better than some of the other films I have seen. This film is definitely not your standard action film, and is one to keep in mind when you are watching a good action movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was one of the best movies   that I watched   in 2015.   It's very well-made, as you might expect from a movie like this.  There is very little violence, and I think that the one thing that the filmmakers did do a good job at is avoiding over-the-top violence and giving us a good character-driven story that doesn't involve torture.  The music is really good too.  As I say, this is a good, well-acted movie, and the good acting really helps make the action more interesting.  It has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen on a movie screen in quite a while.  I haven't seen this in a few years and I'm surprised to see it still being a popular movie today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of movies about war, and I like most of them, but not this one. I can't say I wasn't expecting to hate it. What I found instead was a slow, subtle, and at times even moving portrayal of a battle to which the British lost the battle and were only saved by the fact that they were the one country still loyal to the British Crown after its humiliation. The film is so slow, so subtle, so sad, and so moving, that I found myself rooting for the British soldiers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really can't remember how I found myself in a theater watching this movie. I don't remember the last time I saw a film that had as much heart as this one. There's a scene where there's a boy who can see his future, he can see it clearly, he's gonna be an astronaut when he's twelve, he goes out and makes a good first impression in his first astronaut school.  He does a good job of not seeming too smart or something.   The movie has a real sense of drama.  We don't know quite how this is going to end yet.  I don' know what kind of life is on the other side of that door but that's what we're going to find out.  If you're the kind of person who likes movies that don't get a ton of attention, you're going be hard pressed to find a better one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie that was supposed to be a spoof is in reality a wonderful and fun movie.  It's full of energy and it's the right kind of fun: it's a silly film but it's actually serious, the comedy is actually funny, and the film's story is extremely interesting and well put together.  The story focuses on a group of friends, who are in fact the real pranksters:  a boy named Eddie (Jason Robards), a girl named Linda (Brigitte Nielsen), and two girls, a boy and a girl called Jan (Greta Garbo).  Jan is always having fun at school, for her, it's always about pranks, and then she has a terrible accident and is left paralyzed from the waist down.  Eddie, being the leader of the group, takes care of Jan, and tries to make her life as comfortable as possible.  Linda, on the other hand, is very sick and has a strange way of reacting to things.  There is also a young boy named Ralph (Tim Robbins), who is also the leader.   Although it's quite hard to believe that it's all supposed to make a good film, it actually does.  Although the plot of the film is rather ridiculous, and as a result, not very good, it still holds a lot of the things that are important in a movie: it is fun, it is exciting, it has a story, and it is well put-together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie "The Last House on the Left" is a classic Hollywood horror film. It is made from a simple story. There is a small old house in a little suburb called Alton, Illinois and it's owned by a widowed Mrs. White (Ida Redin). One day, a young man comes to see her to see if she needs help. As the man arrives at the house, the old woman notices that he has a long mustache and strange eyes. He leaves and goes to a friend's house where she hears screaming and then there is a knock at the door. As she turns, she sees the young man standing in the doorway, holding a knife. She screams and he runs out of the house. She calls the police. The young man is killed by the police officers (played by Charles Bronson, Edward G. Robinson, Charles Branson and Donald O'Connor). The police believe that Mrs. Wilt has killed all the young men and the house is empty. She is not in the house but a young couple, a boy and a girl are sitting in a car outside. After the young couple sees the police, they decide to get into the house and try to find out who is responsible. At the end, they leave, saying, "If it was so important, it would have been locked." The old woman is killed and the young family is murdered. The movie was made in 1948 and has a few memorable scenes:  I have always loved this movie. I think it is the best one that I have seen.   I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a good horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the most beautiful films ever produced.  The movie is divided into two sections - the first section (the first act) is all about the protagonist's childhood.  His parents died, so his father left his mother and her sister to him.  He became the leader of the circus.  And then he got a job as a magician.  This section is very funny, and is a highlight of the movie.  But there is much more to it than that.  In fact, there is more to this movie than the film could possibly contain.  All the elements in the movie are meant to create a picture of a dream - it's not meant to be an ordinary dream.  It's meant to represent a life of great enchantment.  As the story goes on, the magician is revealed to be a very complex man - he is a very disturbed man.  At times, it seems that he may be going through a psychotic episode.  Sometimes, the audience must wonder if he really knows what he is doing.  I've always said that if the magician was a real person, he would be a good role model for children.  There is a lot of violence in this movie. It's often a little scary, but there is so much humor and charm in this film that I believe it would be very beneficial to a child's education.    What makes this movie so special, besides being a masterpiece of cinema, is the characters.  Most of the characters are very well written and are very complex.  They are almost like characters in a dream, and this is very true.  For example, the film is about a man who goes to a circus, and then becomes a magician, and in doing so he ends up in a world of enchantment.     The last part of the film, after the magician has done all his things, is a quiet scene between him and his daughter.  If you are a child who loves a good magic movie, you will find this one to be the most enjoyable movie in this list.

At first glance the scene seems to take place in the wilds, not only due to the strange car and the odd way the driver had been dressed, but also because the car is parked way out in the open and there are no other cars in sight.  The dead man's name is Robert W. Anderson.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is one of those "It's a Wonderful Life" films that was supposed to be like that but somehow the movie ended up being more like "You Can't Take It with You" with a very similar story and a different ending.   The film was made as a tribute to the movie but not a rip-off and this version is much better than the one that came before it.  It was a little slow for a film made in 1932 and the ending was probably one of the funniest scenes in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first five minutes were amazing.   It had just enough heart and suspense to be enjoyable.  It was set during a cold and lonely winter night.  There is a young girl that goes with a young couple to see a house they used to live in. The young couple is very old.  But the young lady is just a little girl that is full of life.  They are all talking at the dinner table but their conversation is rather short. The house is very empty.  When the girl goes to the door to the cellar she realizes it is locked.  The young man walks up to her but when she opens the door he grabs her and throws her out.  She is still crying and they say nothing to her.  What would have happened if that boy hadn't come up behind her.?   And she walks out to the front porch and says to herself.  "   Well that would have been the end of a good life."  .   There was a nice ending to the story.  This movie is a little over thirty minutes long.  And it is quite well made.

An American film about a young man who returns to America, and who has to return to his country as an American hero, after having left it.   So I could see what the movie was about.  I liked the theme of the movie, and I think this movie did a good job with that theme.  What surprised me the most was the fact that we have a good performance by John Wayne, although a bit too much is taken away from the scene when he is trying to find his way.  But I liked it!  I like films that try to create something that you can't explain, and which leave you speechless with awe!

With the help of some very good actors, Melville creates a very strange and wonderful universe in which a couple of misfits are living in a house on the shore of a lake where the sun never shines.   This movie is in the same vein as Jean-Claude Van Damme's "Lords of Dogtown" and that is to say that there are very well written characters and the atmosphere is very good. It was never very well made, but that is something that could not be said about any other Melville film.  "

The premise is very simple: the first person who gets a good score on the SAT, (I can see a few similarities between that story and this one) gets to attend an exclusive prep school called the "School of Hard Knocks". The whole movie is based around that premise and the main character (named John) is the only person who tries to stay true to his word.   As a movie I thought the acting was really good.  The story is also fairly simple, but the plot twists and the characters who are introduced as the movie progresses are well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of "The Great White Hope" (1975)   is a story of triumph for a young man and a young woman from a small town in Nebraska.   The movie tells the tale of how Bill Murray and Jane Fonda met and how their careers blossomed.  After being cast in "National Lampoon's Vacation," Murray was asked to write a screenplay for a movie that was to be called "The Green Mile."  The premise of this movie was that the protagonist would be a "White Hope" who was stranded on a country road with the help of a kindly old woman who kept the highway open.  The old lady was named Edith Wharton and in the movie we follow her through the story of the Green Mile and the hero's search for his true love.  This film was also to star John Wayne, who passed away recently.  It was a very popular movie and a cult classic among movie fans of the 60's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never heard of this movie before I saw it, I thought it was a really good film.   One of the best movies ever made and also the most underrated of all time.  The story starts off as a good one, with a good plot, and some great scenes, but then this bad thing happens:  I have never seen a film with such a stupid title.  It is called "The Green-Eyed Monster", what is the green-eyed monster? What does he look like? What is he supposed to do?  The film goes on to show us that this "green-eyed" monster is nothing but a good acting monster who never does anything bad:  The first monster we see is an elderly man who is very skinny, his eyes are blue and his hair is green.  We then see a scene where the green eyed monster is eating a banana.  Then we see the green looking monster's mouth open and a horrible thing happens!  It bites into the banana and causes the banana to explode!  Now we are introduced to two people. One is the old man who was the first victim. He is played by the great Buster Keaton, he has a very slow and creepy slow acting style. Then we are then introduced to a young woman, played by Eva Marie Saint.  Now it is a little hard to tell what she is thinking, because the rest of her is not that great.  She is an extremely silly, silly girl who does a lot of things in a bad way:  She has sex on stage.  This leads to the man who saw the first monster going crazy, so he kills the green monster.  Her friends, the two other people, the green eyes monster, and the old guy go out and get drunk and sing.  That leads to a horrible scene:  Her boyfriend dies of a heart attack and she has sex with him in the shower!  This led to the people who knew the green eye monster doing bad things to him:  He is stabbed repeatedly in the stomach.  He has a head cut off.  Finally, after all these things, he is killed.  I love how it is so easy to see how the story is about an old man and a young lady who go out to get drunk with their friends, then have sex in the bathroom, and have sex on the stage.    The ending leads to yet another horrible situation, one which is about

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm going to break this down to a simple statement: This movie is the one. It has everything you can want: action, romance, and a bit of romance that is even more romantic than the romance in the movie.    This movie has everything it should have: the action, the romance, the drama, and the comedy.  So what am I talking about here?   First of all, the movie is just plain old fun.  Sure, there are some parts that are slightly predictable and can be a bit frustrating.  I would just like to say, though, that if you are looking for a good laugh and a quick romance then you can't really go wrong with this movie. You will be entertained, the characters will be likable, and you will feel a bit cheated when it comes to a good love story.  The story is pretty basic; a woman (the protagonist) is given the opportunity to get back together with her long time love (the other woman, a villain) when a powerful alien forces his way into her house while she is gone.  Unfortunately for the villain, he can't figure out a way to enter the apartment because of the large amount of space between them.  He then decides to kidnap the heroine as revenge against the human race for trying to protect her.  I don't want to go any further into this movie because I've done that for every other film on this list.  It's a fun, short, and completely over-the-top comedy. But, when all is said and done, this is one of the best science fiction films I've seen in a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I can say that I'm really glad to have this movie on my resume. The film is about a group of kids (5 children) who take a summer vacation to a desert island. While they are out on their boat, the boat capsizes, and the kids all end up being stranded on the island. All of the children are different colors; blue, green, purple, red, and yellow, with one yellow child being the tallest. While there are lots of fun parts to the movie (including a little boy trying to fight off the pirates), the most memorable scene I've seen in a long time is when the little yellow kid's nose bleeds when he tries to escape from the pirates. I'm pretty sure that's a first for me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first ten minutes are very dull, the camera just moves along, the film is filmed in the usual boring color, it looks like a bad movie shot in a studio, it's a bad sequel of some kind, and this is a bad one, with all the same problems of the first one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The great art design is very well-done, but the animation is the worst thing about the movie. The animation style for most of the scenes is very crude and uninspired. The whole movie reminds me of an older version of Kiki's Delivery Service, so watch it with that in mind.   I was disappointed in how the story goes, and that is because it is all in a story that is barely worth telling at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I've said before, this is a good time!   The movie is set in the present day, where everyone has come down with a mysterious ailment that is killing them.   But not before they learn that a man was the first to discover the cause of the ailment and discovered the antidote.  He was Dr. John Dee, a brilliant scientist from ancient times.  It is Dee who makes a startling discovery when he goes to the present time and sees the people he sees are dying and he also sees the cure to his ailment!  It's very good! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is true that when we were children, we were taught that when you have a cold, you put an old sock in the boot and carry on. This movie has a lot of that old sock idea going for it.   Well done to the crew for getting up to the challenge. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll begin by saying that this is a great movie.   The movie is told from a point of view where each character is trying to help someone in distress.  If this film had been based on the book, the story might have been a lot more dramatic.  In any event, the characters and the setting are wonderful.  This story is a bit different than the typical tale of a man being taken in by a female for his money.  Instead, it deals with the plight of someone who is simply not going to take kindly to being treated as a means to an end.  The film does a wonderful job of bringing up the tension, and the characters are excellent.  I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy good storytelling, great character development, and a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that will make you laugh, cry and leave wanting more.   I remember watching this film over 10 years ago when I was a teenager.  I loved it and am so glad that I can now relive this wonderful story.  This movie is a little disturbing, a little intense, a bit twisted.  In terms of acting, this movie is phenomenal.  While the movie is very graphic, and you don't want to see it again (like I did), the acting is excellent.  There are some very disturbing scenes in the movie.  The story is very dark, and very depressing.  A man is raped repeatedly by his wife, a woman that he hates and that he feels no love for.  After his daughter is born, he gets fed up and goes on a revenge rampage.  These scenes are just incredible.  For me, this is a very underrated movie. It is one that I really want to go see again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        A well-made movie and a great one at that!   What can I say that hasn't already been said?   One of the better films of the year.   It's the first in a three part series about the first ever commercial passenger train in the U.S. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was great for some odd reason when I saw it at a random showing at a cinema in the 80's. It's very bizarre, with all these weird characters, lots of strange things, and a lot of sex scenes. It has a dark and twisted sense of humour, a bad ending, and some cool, but very odd characters.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a fun film. I don't remember much of it because I was so intoxicated and in so much of a bad way I almost can't remember what I was doing.   I was supposed to be in the movie and I guess I just got lost. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is great fun.  The film was actually a rerun of a tv program called "Bingo and Bingo".  The show was based on a radio drama, and the actor portraying Bingo was actually quite good.  When you first see the film, you will see that the actor who played Bingo is actually the real Bingo.  If you like this movie you will enjoy Bingo and Bing...and maybe not Bingo but Bingo, Bingo....   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that I would have loved to see during the first World War. There are some great set pieces, especially one in which the soldiers are marching toward the advancing Germans. I like the German commander (played by Max Von Sydow), he is a kind of German-American combination and is played in a really good manner by Max. I particularly like the scene where one of the German soldiers is killed by a German sniper, a scene that will haunt me for a long time to come.   Also, the German general (played wonderfully by Carl Laemmle) is a fine actor and does not let the occasion get to him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was one of my first movies, and I'm glad I saw it. The story is about a young man (who I didn't really care about) who falls in love with a young woman (who seems to be more of a prop than a person), and we follow the story of their relationship for some time. The movie had a very nice feel to it, with a good cast, and great writing, and the ending made me cry a little. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a long time horror fan, I had high hopes for this. I mean, it wasn't perfect. The acting was very good, but the direction didn't match. The gore scenes were way overdone. But it wasn 't a bad movie. If it was a little better, I would rate it with a 5 star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is quite beautiful: a beautiful landscape, and a few of the "trees" that we saw in the opening shot are real! The movie itself, too, is quite peaceful. I have heard that this movie is supposed to be very realistic.   It is about a man, a fisherman, who has to take a boat through the forest with his young son, and to bring the boat to the shore.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe I have to write a review for a movie that I think is a masterpiece.   From the very first line, I knew this would be an amazing movie.  This movie is a story about two friends who have been playing a long game.  After meeting a new girl, they begin to do something they've both wanted to do for a long time: kiss.  It starts with two friends kissing at the top of a mountain in the middle of the country and they get the idea that this could be the end of their games.  The characters and setting are great and the way the story is told is flawless.  I just had to give it a 10/10 for the incredible plotline and for the excellent acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not know what to expect from a movie with such a strange title:  There is a strange kind of atmosphere that surrounds this movie.  The movie starts off with an incredible montage of people and things that happen throughout the course of the movie. I really enjoyed the way that the movie uses different elements to tell a story.   As with many horror movies that focus on a young girl,  this movie takes its time to tell its story,  and I really found that to be a great thing.  This movie is also filled with plenty of gore, but if you can take your gag from this movie you will not be disappointed.  If you are looking for a horror movie that is filled with tension, suspense, and gore,   you will find it here.  It is my opinion that this movie should be seen before you try to give a movie such a terrible rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie, you get to see a small town. A small town that has many people, but also a community of like minded people.   As we see in the trailer, the town is plagued with problems, but in this movie it seems like everyone is trying to do their part to make the town as it should be.      One of those people is Mrs. Johnson, a little old lady who has a little shop.  In the trailer we see her walking by in her fancy dress and she is always in a hurry to get in to the town.  We get to learn why when Mrs. Wilson gets a visit from a very interesting and very young couple.  They are coming from a trip to see the movie, which has the same director as the trailer.  The people in town want to see it, so we get to get to know some of them.  Mrs. Smith and Mrs. J. Cone are the ones who bring in the movie.  There is also Mrs. McDaniel, who is very kind and always knows where she's going.  All in all, this movie was fun to watch.  I was surprised by the good performances from all the people in this film.  It is a good story, but it is not perfect.  As I said before, I did not like the movie very much.   I thought it was too close to a horror movie, and I was disappointed with some of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a very well thought out and executed. The acting is top-notch. The script is superb.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a group of students who decide to have a "rehearsal" for a game they are about to play.   Unfortunately the teacher is going to be late and there is no rehearsal.  It turns out that the students in the class are the most brilliant and talented people he has ever seen.  They can do things like create a world where they are the masters.  The teacher and some of the student's who don't think they are as brilliant as these "wunderkinds" decide to practice something that they don't understand at all.  When they come to a fork in the road they decide that there is only one way out and they must go left.  What follows is a classic adventure.  I could not stop laughing the whole time.  This is a great movie and is funny from the start.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film begins like many films before it. A police officer is investigating a murder, and one of the murder's suspects, a middle aged lady in a turtleneck and a fedora is found murdered.   This is a good bit of film that takes the audience in a suspenseful journey of mystery and intrigue. The plot of the film has the cops and the suspect finding themselves at odds and trying to outwit each other.  There are many scenes that are memorable and the film is interesting enough to entertain the viewers for some time.  At one point the lady in the turt and a large brick are brought into the police station. The turt is a real piece of work and there is nothing like it. The brick is the same size and shape as a car and it's an interesting piece of furniture to watch the two of them go at it.  The trolley is interesting, but not particularly useful, as the only people who can carry it are policemen.  After a period of time the two continue to battle, and eventually the lady goes for a walk in a park, but in the middle of the walk she trips and the brick falls on her.  This leads to the police thinking that she is dead, and the police continue their investigation with the suspect and his two accomplices.  It is here that the viewer is confronted with the idea that we live in a world of such evil, and even a human being can be so wicked. This is something that has been talked about quite a lot in films throughout the years.  Despite this, it is still a very good detective story that makes the viewer feel good while watching.  When the movie begins we have a slow build up that takes our attention from the two, to the camera, and back to the two. This buildup allows the story to progress smoothly and without a hitch.  We get to learn more about the characters, and discover who really is behind the murders.  I am really glad I went in looking for a good film and this one was good enough to keep me interested.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the plot was the weakest part of this movie.  Although there is an interesting story, this film isn't something that is really worth watching. The story seemed like it was thrown together in an effort to give the movie a little more of an intrigue to it. I don't know about you, but I would much rather have a story
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movies that will leave you wanting more.    For a movie that starts out like any other, a man is killed and his dog, who doesn't know the man is dead, runs away.    Later in the day another man is on a job.  He meets a man who kills his wife and then comes after him with a gun.  (It gets worse from there.)   It's not a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just came back from a screening at my local movie theater last night, and wow... it was a great experience! It is very well done, and with all the extras, that were included (and a great cast), I don't know where it will leave you. I saw it for free (obviously!) on Youtube... and it is not the cheapest movie you can see (especially with that extra stuff) I mean, it costs only about 20 bucks.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know this sounds like something a grade schooler would do. But for all the talk about how good it is, it's really not.   The film is essentially an excuse to see the legendary John Candy as he re-writes "The Wizard of Oz." It's a bit of a slog, but it's great if you can get past the bad acting and silly story line. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an extremely powerful and inspiring film that will move you to tears.   It is a story about a young Indian man who has a terrible accident that results in a broken leg and a broken spirit.   He goes to visit his grandfather in an old farmhouse on the banks of the River Ganges and as he leaves his father, who is walking to a temple to perform the last rites for the dead, he is approached by a beautiful young woman.   The young girl's family has been extremely hospitable and loving toward her, however it turns out to be a trap.   There is a murderous gang of robbers who terrorize and prey on the poor and defenseless.  She wants him to come back for revenge but she herself is also involved in this criminal activity.   One day, she and her friend, who happens to be his lover, sneak out at night.   They have been hiding out in a well dug cave to escape the robbers and their sadistic guards, which is where they meet a man called Raja, who seems a rather nice guy.   But one thing is very clear, his intentions are malicious.  I have a few comments:  1.  The idea of the movie is intriguing.  It doesn't follow the "hare mata" pattern of a "hare sata" story.  Raja wants to take revenge on the bandits and wants to get money from the gang.  But the gang is far more ruthless and dangerous than Raja imagined.  2.  As the movie progresses, it gets even better.  This movie was well produced and the music was very good.  3.  You won't be able to look away from this film.  4.  If you haven't seen a great Indian movie, then please watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I was excited for this movie, which I am not a huge fan of.   The story is interesting and the action scenes are good.  This movie takes a different approach to the Ninja Turtles.  The Turtles are not ninja, they are street samurai who are hired to protect the King of the South.  As they travel the country they are attacked by people who want the Turtles dead.  I did like the movie, I could not get into it though and I think the audience will not like it either.

The first movie had a lot of good things in it but not enough good things for it to be as good as it could have been.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was watching "The Devil in Miss Jones" the other day. It's a great picture about two poor folks living in the old country town of Miss Jones. The husband is an alcoholic and the wife is an out of her mind drifter. Both of them have to do what they can to get by. At least they don't get into any physical fights or fights with other folks.   "The Devils in MissJones" is one of those films that's really worth a second look. It has its faults but there's a lot of charm. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with a pretty boring conversation about how bad they're at their job, but the guy who can fix the machine seems pretty awesome. I had seen other movies in which the machines were supposed to be cool, but here, the guy is like a super-hero. I liked the ending when he went to a junk yard and took some junk that was about to explode, only to realize it was not an explosive bomb. It was an old radio.   In addition to being a pretty good movie, it also has a fun little cast, including Bill Murray, Michael Palin and Jeff Goldblum. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about an American kid in Germany who finds a way to break free of the oppressive German society, and it is not easy. The boy becomes a pawn of the police and they use all their money and power to have him tortured. They throw him into a dungeon, tie him to a chair and leave him to starve to death. But his ingenuity and his will to survive keeps him alive. The film shows how tough life in Germany is:  In one scene we see the boy dressed up as a priest, while in another he is dressed up like a clown.   The Germans are brutal, but they are also smart.  The German film makers took inspiration from some other Nazi-like films, especially "Schindler's List" (1993)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago, I was lucky enough to be able to see this movie as a child on a special release that only showed a couple of other films (I don't recall which one). I don't know how I ended up getting it, but I still remember seeing it in its first run, and it was one of my favorites. The opening scene shows a child walking out into a world that is just as it is in the movies - populated with scary monsters. However, the child does not see this world in a negative light. In fact, this child is kind of an anti-hero, and when he encounters a monster and kills it, he believes he is doing the right thing. This is a refreshing way of thinking about a movie about a monster. The rest of the movie is about a boy with a dream, who has to overcome the problems he has with a school he is in, his relationship with his father, his mother's death, and the presence of an unknown man who may or may not be after him.   This is one of the rare movies that is a good, not so great, but still good movie that has a lot of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie about good people trying to do good things.   It was a little bit slow at times, but I was entertained for most of it.  It might seem a little hard to believe for those who have never been in a hospital, but in real life a big part of the job consists of waiting.  If we want to do things to improve the world, it is important to be patient.  The hospital is in a nice part of town that is easily accessible by car.  You could easily get there in 20 minutes.  This movie was filmed in the late '70s so it is not as scary as it looks.  There are a lot of good actors and it really does work if you can see it for what it is.  I have not been a fan of this movie since I first saw it years ago and I think that's one of the reasons. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie is a good thing if it serves some good purpose and it does.   The plot is very simple but in a good way.  The movie does not waste any time with the main character, who is a typical "good guy" who is trying to find his wife, who disappeared one year ago, only to return a year later with a new and improved wife.  After the last day of the movie we see the father who is not able to give up on his son.  While the father has some trouble to give his son a good life, his wife is trying very hard to bring her son back to life.  This is a very well written movie and it shows you what happens in a real life situation.  I recommend watching this movie and you will not regret.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this a couple months ago at the Alamo Drafthouse. It's definitely a good time movie.   The story revolves around an eccentric but brilliant artist, who finds himself stranded on a desert island and has to find a way off to find food, water, a place to stay, a pen and paper and a way to keep himself alive.  There is also a brief scene in which we see the desert island, and a man with a fishing rod.  It's a good little story about a man who knows how to think outside the box and make his own way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing "The Lost City of Z", I can't say enough about this film:  The story line was interesting enough:  One of the men from the lost city finds a map that connects all of the cities. The "Lost City" is actually in America.  It's a good looking film and has a really cool plot:  First, there's the "Lost city" that is really a maze.  People would say that it's a maze because the map is all over the place.  There is a man (David Arquette) who has a strange encounter with a little boy in the "lost city", but then it's clear that something is really wrong.   As you'll see, the whole "Lost cities" thing is an elaborate hoax:  There's a man in the first lost city.  He has the name "Bobby".  He is an ex-Army major and knows a lot about the "secret" of the "City".  If that's not enough, he's an ex Navy commander, and he's been studying these "lost cities" in a lab on the other side of the planet.  The whole "lost" thing was not only a hoax, it's also an allegory about mankind's search for knowledge:  In the first city (there's one), a man was able to survive by getting inside a giant cave.  In one of the lost cities (there are many), the man was found by his fellow people.  This little boy (Danny) is actually one of these people who found the man.  His name is "Zachariah" and he was the one who first found the boy.  After finding the man and the boy, they both enter a strange machine and then enter the "wonderland".  The two are reunited and it's obvious that this is the "Wonders" that the two were looking for:  As the little boy is seen walking in front of Zachariah, it is a little bit difficult to see him as a little child:  He's got a large head, a large body, and a great white beard.

Then a strange creature with a long tail (one of Zach's friends from the "city") tries to capture him. (I'm assuming that's what
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing about this movie is that is that when the movie starts off it seems like a good idea to give the characters a backstory and then to make us believe that everything is going to be all right. Unfortunately, all the time in the movie it feels like the characters are just being thrown at you and left to fend for themselves. This leads me to a question that I'm sure you're all wondering: Was this movie actually a good film?   There is some good acting in this film, a nice soundtrack, and some good special effects but I find that the ending left me more confused than I was before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie and I love that this is one of the last good sci-fi movies from the 40's.   The movie does a good job with it's plot which is just about a guy (Bill "Buck" Meeks) who finds a space ship on his ranch that has people aboard, people with mysterious powers.  A very fun movie and even though the actors are good they just didn't have enough to do much else than be fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It wasn't pretty, but I'd never really been one for the genre, and I felt I'd been tricked into seeing a comedy from a comedy actor and that it wasn't the kind of movie I'd ever wanted to see.   A man with a giant head, a big mouth, a tiny body, a voice so high, and a bad haircut...it was like a cross between Bugs Bunny, a bad science fiction movie, and Woody Allen.  This is a good thing, a good laugh, and an entertaining comedy, it's a perfect balance between good acting and funny story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie with some great performances, great editing and a nice set.   The set is like the movie, but not quite as good, as it's not a movie about a boy who gets a mummified head and then his father tells him to kill a bunch of skeletons that came back as zombies after an apparent zombie apocalypse.  But this is just one of those great, entertaining films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is basically a comedy about a little boy who is given the responsibility of helping a young girl who is very sick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Gravity" is an exciting and heart-rending piece of work.   There's no shortage of heart in this film, and it's a thrill to be able to witness it.  The characters are so strong and so believable that you almost forget you're watching a story of such grand scale.  At the same time, there's enough of a sense of adventure to keep you engaged throughout.  This isn't just a piece of art, it's also an entertaining movie.  I recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a child I read the story of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. I had a friend who convinced me to watch it, and I do not regret it. This movie was an interesting mix of the sci-fi and horror genres. The sci- fi part was fantastic. The film showed us how the earth was destroyed, and showed us the alien menace. In one scene we saw a giant spaceship land and the alien woman get in a car and drive away. It was a wonderful film. The rest of the film was filled with terror, with monsters and strange weapons. The acting was superb.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was one of those rare "I can't believe this exists" moments.   In the early 80's, a group of kids from Chicago, and a group from the Midwest, were hanging out one night at a local park when they run across a guy who is on the run.  It looks like he has been shot.  In fact, the bullet was to the back of his head, and the wound looked like a bullet hole.  He is not talking, though. He is screaming "Help me!"  The kids and their friends just watch, in amazement.  At one point a kid says to the guy "You look like you are on the verge of having a heart attack", and it was like "Whoa, what a great way to end the movie!"   The scene is really cool.  My wife and I watched the movie in the living room, as we watched TV together. It was a really great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a real good movie.   It is a bit funny but not too serious, it has a lot of action, some comedy and a lot more mystery and suspense.  The acting is good, the story is great and it is a good action movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . When we first hear that this "documentary" film is about the life and deaths of Charles Manson, we see that this movie is really about the American psyche at the time. It is not a bad documentary, and a good one at that. It focuses on a group of people who went to a rock concert, then had a party, then went to Manson's house and killed him. I believe this film has a happy ending, and that makes it very special. The director, Robert J. Kaufman, had a very nice way of showing his subjects. They were not just in it for fun, but really had a lot of fun in taking on this film. Kaufman is well-versed in many other subjects, but this film is the most interesting and the most enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I'm typing this, my eyes are getting tired, but I'm thinking of saying something, something important about a movie I didn't like at all. I didn' t like this movie at all, and I'm not even going to say why.   I am a serious fan of the books, and of all the books that Martin has written. I've read three of them so far, and the only real criticism I have is that the last book didn't get a fair airing, and that there wasn't enough new in it to make me care about it.  This movie, for the most part, I did. The acting was OK, the writing was decent, and Martin managed to squeeze a pretty good movie out of a book that was already good.  For a time, I really liked this movie.  The story was really interesting, and there was enough new plot to keep me intrigued for a while, and then it all ended in a mess of the most predictable plot.  It's not a bad movie, it's not particularly good, and it's certainly not bad, and its main selling point is that it is Martin's story, and thus an extremely good example of his storytelling.

The plot is simple:  You are a man who is being kept as a slave.  You have a wife and kids.  Your husband wants to rape you.  He is a bad person.  They say that the girl you love is in a mental institution.  Well, you think she is not in the mental institution because of her mind.  She is in the house.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be a good example of how to use a bad movie to your advantage.   The movie opens up with a story about a guy who falls in love with a girl. This girl turns out to be his father, played by one of the great, greats, Warren Beatty.   This father is also played by Beatty, and his entire character is just a joke to most of the audience.  There is nothing at all to be upset about with this character, the story just keeps playing the same two jokes over and over again:  1) The father is so pathetic, so stupid, so useless, that we just want to smack him around with a frying pan.  2) He can't do a single thing right because he has no self-respect at all.  The father tries to get his son to learn the value of a dollar, and in doing so, he gets in a big fight with his son, who tries to pull the father into the family business.  This, unfortunately, is all that a father can be at that point.  Eventually the father tries teaching his son some things, and eventually the father has the son help him out of his depression.  It's funny, sure, but I think the movie should have just cut this part out.  Also, Beatty's character is so poorly written that he could have been a stand in for every actor that came before him and after him.  When his character tries to teach his son about a dollar he says that he knows about dollar's worth but the kid isn't interested in learning about dollar values.  He also tries to keep the kid in line by doing things to him that he would do to a 12 year old, such as hitting him with a metal rod, pulling his shirt down so that his ribs are exposed, putting him in a choke hold, and the worst part of it all, pushing his son around like a child, even though he is a grown man.  I don't think that there is any movie that would be as bad if the character that played this character weren't so bad.  Beatty is so horrible to everyone that he plays, and so unoriginal.  His character is a parody, and one of those types of movies that are just kind of good for their intended purpose but become bad by the end.  As a matter of fact, a few days before it was released, I saw this
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all, I'm a big fan of'silly comedy' films, and this one is a great example. The movie stars David Banner and his wife, Linda (Susan O'Halloran), who is a big hunk and has the personality of a supermodel. Their children are the sweet kids of all time. Banner's ex-wife, Mary, plays the part of his first wife, and they have the typical two sons. The main character, David Banner, is a very talented musician, but he lives a life of excess: drinking, driving, smoking and spending the money he makes at music-making. One day Linda leaves him to go to work and David Banner is distraught, he doesn't know what to do, so he decides to get even with his wife in an odd way: he murders a chicken! Of course this isn't funny; but this is the plot that keeps me entertained, even though the story is not very original. Banner spends the movie running around his apartment, singing and dancing to the music, playing his guitar and singing to the tune of the chicken. As he's about to commit his latest murder, Linda finds him and decides to join him in his madness.     The movie is so bad that you may want to avoid it for its silly humor, but then again, you may not like silly humor...  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie doesn't get a lot of good reviews because it's about two women, a black woman and a white woman.    I was initially disappointed by the black woman but after watching a few more minutes she is much more interesting than the film implies she is.  This is a good black woman who doesn't act like a bitch but a smart one who's really not afraid to use her brain even if it comes at the expense of the men around her.  The woman in the movie is very well made.  The color and texture of her skin is like that of the cast of "Pulp Fiction", with one very noticeable exception: her hair.  There is not much else to say about her hair except that it looks real.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always loved films that feature real people and real places, but never before have I seen a film so true to life that I could relate so completely with the lead character. When she's visiting her family, she tells them about a time she had been raped as a child, and how she's been trying to move on since then. I really thought that she'd been through a terrible ordeal and that she would be able to live a happy, quiet life with her family now, but it turns out that, for the past twenty-five years, she's lived a life of loneliness and misery.   The director, Joe Swanberg, uses this situation in the script to tell us what a horrible person she is, how she never stopped being a person of violence and hatred. The family at first seem quite kind to her, until she starts talking about how much the people who killed her brother and sister tried to destroy her, and then they start going a bit crazy.

To quote an old lady I know: "It is a great shame that the only good thing that ever happened in the United States was the American Civil War and I wish they would never go through another one"   Well, I must say that the Civil War was really a wonderful thing, and it has to be one of the best things the world has ever seen.  What a thing to be a citizen of the United Kingdom or any other country when you see this movie, and I should know, I was one of them.  I saw a few other Civil War films when I was a kid and never thought about it again until I was an adult, then I watched it again for the first time and thought about my life again.

You can watch it with your grandma and she'll like it, it's so great.  And I love that there are so many different groups of people, from an old lady in a wheelchair who hates people because she used to be able to walk, to a kid who wants to be an astronaut.  There's the little old lady who knows all the words to a song, to the young girl who's been to war and never been in an elevator before, to another kid who can't tell the difference between a man and a woman.  This movie is so touching, so funny, so depressing.  It also has a wonderful song:  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY9nXfRz2OQ)

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie last week. I am going to say something about a movie I didn't love:  There's a lot of people who are going to hate this movie: The first time you watch this movie you'll think this is going to be the biggest disappointment. It is an average story. It takes place in a prison, you see the protagonist has a girlfriend. She is in love with him, but he is trying to hide his love for her. And you see a lot other people have sex with him. I thought this was going to involve an awful lot of sex. But there's no sex. There's just a lot people trying to do stuff, and then there's a scene at a party where he takes a bath.   The people in this movie are so stupid that I wonder if this was a comedy, or a horror film. The film is over after a few minutes, and the last few minutes are just a bunch of people talking and laughing, which is all you need in a movie like this. It's not a great movie, but it's not bad at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not surprised when I watched this movie because it really is great.   The movie is funny and interesting.  There is a short film in this movie which is just about a boy (played by a young man) named Frank who is trying to become a professional stuntman.  In one of his stunts Frank makes a mistake and hits his own mother in the face with a baton.  This kind of accident causes Frank to develop a huge crush on a girl named Annie who is just beginning her ballet training.  When Frank finds out Annie was a dancer he decides to follow her and dance in the ballet school.  As we all know if you are a professional stage artist you need a body and a mind to be effective in the choreographed ballet.  Annie, who is the love interest, is a professional dancer with very good skills.  She is also very young and has some very beautiful looks.  We see a lot of things in this film that make it interesting.     There are many things I didn't like about the movie.     First of all there was a scene in the movie where an old lady was talking to a young boy about his ballet class.  I don't think this was necessary.  If a young dancer is going to be a stage artist then the boy should be there too.  It really was not necessary to go through all that and then get this scene which shows the old lady talking.  Next there was the little girl who is so pretty she could be in a show.  The little girl has no skill whatsoever and is a little kid.  Even though Annie and Frank don't seem to be that close together the little boy would have been a nice addition to the movie but I don' t think he was a good choice.  After all Annie is not the main character in the story.  Another thing I didn' t like was the choreography.  For a couple of scenes there were a lot more than necessary dancers.  Some of them were very good but other more were just very bad.  Overall the movie had a good cast of characters.  Now I really liked that Frank is an idiot and doesn't know how to dance.  But he has a heart of gold and I like him for it.

We were sitting in a room with a couple of kids watching a movie. There were lots of loud explosions and lots of screaming.   Then we got to the part where the kids are getting their heads cut off and the guy has his arm stuck up his nose, and then he tries to pull it off.  He doesn't pull it, so then he gets stuck up in his nose.  Then there's a guy getting his head cut off right there.  I didn't like it.  This movie just didn't have any flavor.  The movie was not funny at all.  It had lots of violence and screaming and screaming, and nothing else.

I watched the movie once at the cinema in Berlin and the first half was really good. It was very different from what the director was trying to do and it was a bit difficult to follow. In the second half we got a bit more of a story and the movie finally got somewhere. I also found the ending a bit disappointing and this was really going to be a great movie if the second part could have been a little better. But it wasn't and this really is a good thriller for fans of films like The Sixth Sense and Hostel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would like to say something about the movie I watched earlier. It has something that I really like about a lot of movies that are about cars, in this case it's the "chase movie" in which a police car chase takes place.   The "chased" vehicle is a white Chevy Impala with "Rambler" emblazoned on it. The chase is set in a parking lot (the actual name of the lot is "Furnace Lane") in a small town that has a very strong "old school" feel to it. It seems that a number of young adults who live in that area have decided to "ramp up" the cars' engines and the "rides" they drive get rather crazy.  The cops are a group of three officers who work in the town and, well, don't like driving on a Saturday night in a town full of teenagers.  After a few days of trying to get a driver, one of the guys (who, by the way, drives a white Cadillac) ends up doing a double-take and decides to come by the cops' hotel, but the cop car he is driving does not look like the one the cops are expecting, and so he tries to convince them it's a white Impala. It takes a while to work out what is going on, but eventually they agree to stop for a little "coffee" and the chase begins.  It's a very enjoyable chase movie and, yes, this is a movie about a bunch of young cops who spend a lot more time having sex and drinking than they do driving. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those films where you're just left with a great feeling and a good smile on your face.   As you know, I'm a sucker for films that are a combination of art and science.  The film is a combination:  The animation and special effects are both excellent, especially in the film's more imaginative sequences.  I was a little confused when I saw a picture of a man getting a tattoo on his arm.  He seems to have a "stretchy" or "fuzzy" skin.  In a sequence where the "stretching" skin of the man is stretched over a large building, the buildings facade is shown stretched, with buildings at the end of the frame.  Some buildings are stretched in a manner that looks like a form of stretching of metal.  This sequence, combined with the film as a whole, have a sense of "magic" to them, as if you can actually see, in a movie, something that you are seeing only as a cartoon or TV screen.  When you come out of this film and think about all that's happening, and all the images of the past and the present, that is exactly the feeling I get.  What I like most about the film is the way it's not afraid to go to strange places.  But there are some moments in the story, or the film in general, where it's very difficult to tell what the true nature of the movie is, because it just doesn't seem to make any sense.  At times the film seems to get a little caught up in the weird, or out of place, in ways that don't seem right.  There are several odd things in the movie.  One example of this is when the character that we follow, the character named B, goes on a "tour" of the planet in a space ship.  Why is this happening?  When he's in space, the view of the earth is blocked by the planet.  It just seems to me like a "magical" planet, a "world" that is a very different world than the one we see on earth.  And in the course of the "touring" he comes back to earth.   And that would seem to be a sort of "magician's trick" but of course it isn't.  Maybe a magician could pull it off, but I don't know if they can "teleport" (
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, although I'm not too sure about all the other things that happen. The setting is brilliant, especially in the part of the movie where the narrator is telling his story in a little shop. It looks like the most typical small-town America but there is something that's just a little off about it. The town seems to be full of people who've always had trouble dealing with their feelings. Their lives are all a little too ordinary, and there's something about this town that just creeps me out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was quite surprised to see that this film wasn't really intended for theatrical release, and yet this is an honest and very funny adaptation of a classic novel (published in 1929), " The Wind in the Willows" by Kenneth Grahame.  This story follows the adventures of an Englishman (Alfred Tennyson) who travels to New Guinea to collect an albino bird (from which the title comes) and then goes to the jungle.  The plot is simple: when the "Willy" (the name means "wanderer" in the native language), has become lost, he has to make his way through the jungle by using what little he has: a broomstick.  This film has a certain je ne sais quoi: Alfred, in an attempt to collect the bird, becomes fascinated by its appearance: he sees a white-winged dove, a long tail and a tail feather.  Although the film has some bad effects (a poor sound track, a poor special effects and some bad acting), it also has many good effects: a great use of camera movement and effects, the use of white light in the jungle, the fact that Alfred seems to be lost and finds himself in a place where he can use his broomstick as a crutch and a torch, etc.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love watching comedies.   This is a funny film about two brothers who are in love with each other (and are in charge of their mother's house) but they can't stand each other.  They meet a doctor who helps them break the ice between them and then the doctors wife moves in and one day the doctor's kids break in and the next morning the brothers are on the run.  This movie doesn't go over the top like some of the earlier comedies and even though the film's budget wasn't that large, there's enough material here for this to be a fun comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic! It has it all: funny, sad, good laughs, great effects and a killer soundtrack.     It is a good and important film to watch with a friend, the kind where both of you feel as though you are part of the story, and we laugh, cry and have lots of fun! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been one for horror.   It's not that I don't love scary movies.  I do.  It just seems to be that a horror movie for me isn't what it's supposed to be.  For one thing, I never find myself drawn to it; I'm a movie lover, not a horror lover.  You know why?  The horror genre is a genre of stories about people who aren't who they seem; a genre about someone who seems to have a very good idea about how to handle himself when faced with danger, but who's actually just a very bad person with a lot of problems.  The movies in this genre, and others, have very simple, straight, no frills stories; there's no buildup, no development, just a scary or exciting or exciting and scary and scary.  But if you are going to make a horror film, it needs to be about more than just frightening the crap out of people, right?  And what's a horror?  Well, if you have ever watched the Twilight Zone,  or the House of 1000 Corpses, or any of the others out there, you've been given a basic idea of what a horror is.  A horror is a story that uses horror as a device to create a different kind of story.  Horror works best when there is an element of hope and love at its core; when it's about the end of an ugly relationship or a heart-breaking loss or a child falling into a deep pit or a troubled relationship between two people who just don't understand one another, but still need to be close; when a bad situation is about to be fixed, only to be taken apart again and again in the next few hours and days.  And that's the horror that I've been looking for.  In other words, it's a story about how we deal with life.  There is a new movie coming out next week  entitled  The Monster in the Closet.   And I can't wait to see it.  Now I am going to have to go put on a scary movie.  (   All )

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.   The movie is based off of a short story of the same name written by a kid named Jeff (which is funny as hell, by the way).   In this movie, a young man is taking his girlfriend for a ride in his father's old pickup.  After the accident happens, we see the guy (I think it is his father) driving it down a road where his father has parked the pickup and then takes it to the cemetery.  I think the guy looks like a guy who is doing a terrible job trying to deal with a drunk and a dead guy.  His father is also drunk and not at all friendly.  But he does have a good heart and tries to help the dead body.  The thing about this movie is that it has an ending that I really loved.  It shows that despite the messed up situations in the movie, the kid still has a strong will.  He will probably get a bad rap, but he was a good kid and I would definitely watch this movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'll love it.   The story is compelling, the characters are funny and well-realized, and the directing is first-rate.  If you enjoy a good laugh every once in a while, this is a movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not a movie for everyone but there are lots of things to like about this movie.   The story is set in the year 1900.  It takes place in a small town.  The town is not really a town. It's more like a shantytown.  Most of the town isn't very smart.  One of the boys who's friends a lot of the guys.  They get into a lot trouble in a lot funny places.  But this movie is a good laugh.  And the music is great.  There's a lot to like in this movie, and the humor's great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A well-crafted movie and a good story. If you like this movie, you will like many others from that period. I like these kind of movies because they were interesting to watch.   The movie starts off with the typical bad guy with a grudge who doesn't give a shit about anything. The bad guy has a son who hates him and wants revenge. The mother wants revenge because the son is going to marry her. The son is always looking for a way to do something to make the mother unhappy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film over 20 years ago. It's been years since I've seen a good story (but I'd rather be a fly on the wall in a comedy than be the actor who steals the show).   I really wish I could say this was one of my favorite films.   The film is so well-written and performed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen the original movie until last year, and it was such an awesome, fun, well done movie, that was very memorable for a good laugh. It also taught me a few things about life and how it could be very different from what you're expecting. I highly recommend it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a world where the "narrative" in Hollywood films is all about love, betrayal, and redemption in a film set in 1940s California...you're going to have to be very forgiving if The Last Waltz  stops at that point.   It's a story about a guy who goes on a cross country road trip (with a girl) to look for his missing son.  This is all we really learn in this film, but the guy is supposed to be the hero?   I guess it is possible to be all alone in the wilderness with a bunch of strangers and still have a good time, but that's exactly what happens in this movie.  It is a shame this movie is missing from a lot of people's collections, because it deserves to be seen more often.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great little indie movie from the late 90's about two young men on a road trip with an elderly friend (Groucho Marx) and their crazy old driver (Hank Azaria).   Well... it ain't easy being a hippie, especially when the hippie road trip gets turned into a rock n roll rock n' roll rock-n-roll rock n-roll...  . But there's a lot of good fun on hand: the old hippie-truck is as comfy as a hospital bed and the rock-and-roll band is just hilarious, even when they go off the rails and start yelling like they're in a bad TV show.   There's a few great songs in there, too: "Sisters in the Night" and "In a Good Cause" are classics, and the two main guys (played by Hank Azaria and Groucho) are pretty much the only guys in their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An early and wonderful example of the art of the movie set.   It is a very good and very original movie and, if the picture was a little more vivid, it would be more of a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a good old-fashioned gangster movie. The good guys are all very good looking and in good shape, and the bad guys are pretty much what you would expect: all very corrupt and corrupting. I think that most people can find a better movie out there in the "gangs of New York" genre.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty much the "Walt Disney" version of a movie.   A "monster of the night" that has a few special effects is followed by a cute girl who runs away from her mother's house. She makes friends with a "cat lady" and a "hippie witch"   They go to a place that appears to be a haunted house. But as soon as the lights go out, the monsters get a hold of the girls and make them get in a bed with them.  Then a man and a woman come out to check it out.  The man starts telling the "hippy witch" a story about a little boy who runs into a tree and comes out a frog.  Later the "cat ladies" and "hipster witch" come out and start talking about their own problems.  But when a giant monster tries to get in, the girl and her friends run and try to fight him off.  They get in another bed and the man and the girl fall asleep.  Finally, the little boy comes back out, and then he is gone again.  All this time, all of these monsters are trying to get into the "witches bed."   So then the little girl runs to her mother and tells her all about it.  After that, the two of them go on a journey to try to get away from all the monsters.  This is a really funny and charming film that will have you laughing and having a great time watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's pretty decent, the story is interesting, and the characters are likable. The story takes place in the year 2000, in a futuristic America. There is a war going on with a very small but still highly dangerous group of aliens called the Quorans. The aliens have been coming into Earth for several decades now and have been invading our home planet for a century. Our planet is heavily armed, highly sophisticated, and is able to defend itself with weapons that we were never meant to use. The government has no way to stop the invasion of the aliens. A small group of people called the Resistance is able, in the first season of the show, to fend off an invasion and to take the Quors down.   There is not a lot of action and no real plot, but the story keeps the viewer interested. The acting is very good, and a good number of the characters feel real and human. The movie has a good score, and some very memorable scenes are a nice change of pace from the more action-oriented shows that come out at the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the "Muppets" movies (the films about the little puppets) I thought that Disney and the "New Muppets," were back to form and that all of their shows would be a lot of fun. But this movie proves that they are not going to stop until the last episode of "Fluffernutter."   The Muppet crew is led by Fozzie Bear who is portrayed by Jim Henson's son Todd. And the cast is wonderful. All of the Muppeteers are hilarious, as is Kermit the Frog and the characters of Miss Piggy and her boyfriend Scooter. And Kermit is the most amazing Muppet performer I've ever seen, in my opinion.   But what I really like about the film is the characters. They are all so interesting that you will love them all!   A couple of minor things that don't bother me:  Bubba the Love Sponge (voiced by George Wendt) says he likes SpongeBob (voiceless)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's an underrated and underrated movie that many people will love because of its style and sound.   I have always liked this film.  It features such a great cast: Meryl Streep as an American woman, who is trying to make a new life in Britain in 1939, and then she gets sent back to America. She lives a few years and then has a new family: a couple and their child and a man and his girl. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of the movie is very simple. It is about a man who travels to Tibet to learn the traditional teachings of the Buddhist religion. He is a Buddhist monk, but he is not allowed to practice the ancient tradition of the monks of the time because of the way he behaves. He starts by being an atheist, then he finds himself on a boat, the boat is hijacked by people who don't even speak Tibetan, so he does what he can to escape from them. Then he is taken to the monastery of the Dalai Lama and meets the people who are called his "teacher". The film is quite well done, with a simple story. It doesn't spend too much time on any unnecessary details. It's just a good story with good acting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In terms of genre, this is one of the most unique movies  I've seen  in recent years.   It is set during the Great Depression in America, and takes place in 1930s New York City.  The movie is about a young man named Sam who runs into a series of troubles as he tries to get a job.  He also has a girlfriend named Alma who runs off after finding out that he is working for a mysterious figure who appears at night.  I think this is the most interesting movie I've watched in a long time.  This movie is so original, it has got me thinking that this is a future reality we have created by our minds.  This movie takes place over decades, which is just as much of an accomplishment as it is in this film.  It shows how our minds work on a much more human level than you and I do.  There is a lot of depth here, and the characters all make a good impact on you.  Even though there are a lot more than twenty scenes in this movie, they are all just different.  As an adaptation of a book, I really liked this.  But I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good psychological thriller. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I am reviewing is the first in a series of eight movies set on a ship in the late 19th century. It starts off with a nice scene with two ship's captains enjoying the sunset on the deck of the ship. I would like to know what ship it is that they are on though! The captain of the vessel is a very good actor, who also does a good job of being charismatic, and is probably the only character that the movie does not drag. It is a fun watch with plenty of action and adventure in the second half of the movie. I recommend this movie for all movie lovers who like good old fashioned adventure, and are a bit tired of today's action movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like this kind of movie - then you will like this one!      The movie starts with a beautiful montage of music and the sound of thunder from the rain and rainfalls. Then the movie shows the main character, a handsome and charismatic young man - Johnnie, in the middle of a beautiful summer evening in a rural farm. Then we have a few close-ups of Johnnie's face and a slow montage showing Johnnie looking at the beautiful green fields and trees - while his friends come back from a picnic with their parents and friends. Then in the background, a very small, white airplane with some people on it - they seem to be on the way to someplace.   After a couple of weeks, Johnnie decides to go to the farm - but he is having some difficulty in buying the tickets! So his friends help him to buy the tickets - and in a couple more days Johnnie comes to a little, rustic farmhouse - and sits down to rest.  Then the rain starts, a huge waterfall rumbles down, and raindrops start falling from the sky and into Johnnie.  They then move to the house and then to the picnic area - all kinds of beautiful and interesting things happen!  Then we see Johnnie in a long, deep, dark room - and some mysterious, beautiful music begins to play - and it is this music that starts the movie.  The movie is about Johnnie (Derek) - a young man who has lost his parents. He is a tall and muscular young man, who, due to some medical problem in his eyes, has become blind.  Johnnie has become the local "cowboy", which is the equivalent of a "motorcycle" driver - he drives around the farm, picking up cows and goats, which he then takes to the local food market. And there he also helps out his mother and father - who work for the local farm.  But they are unable to pay the rent - so they have decided to sell the farm. Johnnie is a nice, good-natured young man and he takes care of his mother, father, and sister. However, when one of his close friends comes to town one day - and finds that Johnnie isn't there, he is upset about this, and they decide to go get Johnnie!  But instead, they find Johnnie sitting in the very dark room of

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been searching high and low for a good horror movie.  I went to an old flea market last weekend and saw the film. I thought it was about a college girl who goes to the haunted house in the middle of the night to investigate a noise in the house.   The girl is scared and goes to sleep in the darkened house, leaving a bloodstained room with no lights and no way to escape.  They open a room where there is a girl's body.  When the girl is dead, the girl's sister is found in the bathroom.  The guy who is found with the body, the guy who looks like he is out for a walk, tells the girl to hide in a closet, that's all they know for sure.  A boy goes to stay with the boy's father after the father is called in for a job.  This leads the boy and his father into a conspiracy.  As the plot unfolds, the horror gets more and more horrible.

The special effects are good and I really liked the way the director designed the robots and their personalities.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main protagonist of this story is a very weak and underdeveloped character. However, his situation is rather unique, as his father is a highly respected doctor, yet his mother was a prostitute from a neighboring country. While his father and grandfather are responsible doctors in a town full of wonderful doctors and doctors' parents, he is a completely useless and useless kid, who is not even in the top 5 of the class.   The main villain of this movie is a sort of super powered superhero. While he is not exactly the best of characters, he at least seems to be interesting.

The movie's plot was pretty interesting and I was quite excited to watch it again.   The movie itself wasn't as much of a good as the movie made me hope it would be, but it wasn't bad either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months ago, the world's greatest filmmaker made a documentary about the film, and it's a great piece of cinema in its own right.   "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" is the story of how Mister Rogers became a social activist, who, as one of the characters in the film puts it, "loved to help people in need."   Rogers' neighborhood is one of those "small-town America" places where he and his friends, a bunch of fellow social workers, and the other community members, including the mayor, the police chief, and two schoolteachers (Mary Tyler Moore and Betty White), live.  They are all just like Rogers in one way or another, except for one thing:  they are very well-dressed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I liked this is because they put a lot of effort into making this movie, even going to the effort to bring in an old actor from the 70s to play the role of a man who is about to be executed.

I thought this one was funny but it wasn't as funny as "The Man Who Fell to Earth".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not sure what to make of this movie. I mean, it was made for a good reason, it's about a guy who finds out the truth about his father who he thinks was a hero, but he was not. The man that his father really was is very different than the hero that the movies made him out to be, he was the most vile man who I had ever seen in my life. There are a lot of nasty people in this movie, but one particular group of people gets a lot more screentime than the rest.   It's one of those films where all the characters are all interesting, it just kind of drags, but the special effects, the pacing and the direction are all good. It's just kinda lame.

It's an old Western-style movie about a cowboy and a girl who come across a pair of thieves who had stolen from a man and his wife in a small town.

The action scenes are intense, violent, beautiful and very realistic and the fight scenes are very realistic.

As the story progresses, more and more evidence is revealed that the man is not who he says he is and he has a terrible past.  This is a very special movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I am so glad that people have finally realized that this movie is an amazing masterpiece.   It takes a look at the Vietnam War from the people that were in it, and tells the story from their point of view.  It deals with the emotions of people that lived through it, but makes it look good.  There is a lot of emotion here.  It really is an action packed movie, but not for the first time.  I guess it was the first ever to look at a war through the eyes of the people who lived through a war.  The movie doesn't look like a typical action film.  This movie shows how important it is to have family around.  So, you can say it is a movie about family and war.

The writing was so great and the acting was wonderful.  The story and the characters were just so fun to watch, especially the main character.  I liked how this movie was so realistic and believable, especially with the way they made him talk and act.  But the movie wasn't all fun and games, like some people make it out to be.  There were some good moments and a few parts of this movie that had some great acting and writing, but there were also a lot of bad ones as well.  If you like comedy and aren't a huge comedy fan, then you will probably like this movie.  It's not a bad movie, but it's not my favorite either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've ever seen the film The Last Unicorn, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's a story about a man who lives on the moon and a little princess, and is pretty much on the run.  He runs from the law and his ex.  After he meets a boy, they begin to be in love, but it's not long before the man becomes a little girl's pet.   This is an enjoyable movie and is a very nice departure from the usual fantasy/sci-fi films I usually watch.  I was surprised at how well the girl and man worked together.  If this one didn't get cut short, I think it would have been a real contender for best movie of 2005.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little apprehensive about watching this one.   It was released late on a Wednesday night, and as I got it home and got in, I couldn't wait to see how the movie would be put together.  It begins with a montage of some of the famous films, including Hitchcock's The Birds and the first film directed by James Stewart.  I thought I was getting a good film with some good actors.  As I watched through it, I found that the cast had a rather amateurish sense of acting, and I also felt that they all tended to look alike.  By the second act, I felt like I was being led to believe that the whole movie would turn into a comedy.  The last part of the movie, which is not a comedy, is really well done.  While I do think that the entire movie was made on a low budget, I am still satisfied with the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the title might suggest, I have a special place in my heart for this movie. It's probably what's responsible for my interest in science fiction since I was a kid. I still don't know what I'd say if I was asked about it, but to me it's just pure awesome. The movie opens with a spaceship crash landing and two people get out. It looks like a pretty basic spaceship. A couple of years later, it crashes into a city. We find that the occupants had no idea what they were doing when they were in the city. One of them becomes a sort of god, a sorta Superman. His name is John Young, and he's got a girlfriend named Kate, who's in a coma. She comes around to the idea that she can do things she shouldn't do, and so they have sex. What happens next is even better: the ship explodes, and everyone escapes, including the god and Kate. They end up in the future, and everything is better there. The god is kind of annoying about how he wants everyone to have access to all the wonders of the future. He makes Kate go back to the present to get a new outfit, but instead she discovers that the ship's engines were destroyed by the aliens. It was like the movie was trying to tell me something, so I kept watching, because I knew it had to be better than this. I was wrong, of course. The ship starts to get destroyed, and the god tells Kate that she's going to die in the fall. Instead she survives and comes back to life. There is a great scene where she's riding in a car, the radio is playing her favorite song. The car is hit by an alien spaceship, and when she goes to save the people in it she accidentally turns off the engine, causing it to fall into the aliens' hands. She then realizes that she must keep moving towards the future because if she doesn't, she will die. She makes a new costume, which makes her the only person that can go forward. She gets a ride on a spaceship and goes to a futuristic museum, where she meets other people who also want to go forward in time. But the only way to go past time is to be a certain age. So, she uses some of her new power to make everyone younger. I have no idea why these people can travel in time, but it's probably because of some sort of advanced technology. They are

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that was quite good. The story line is a little bit different than most, though that's a good thing. It's not exactly a bad film either. The action is a bit over the top, but it's funny, and it doesn't really matter too much. The movie is an interesting tale of a guy who gets lost, who tries to find his way home by finding his way in a forest, who then gets into a chase and fights a dragon. It was a good idea that he gets in the forest, and he finds the dragon, and then fights him and finds his way back home. There's a lot of good acting, and there are a few funny scenes in the movie. It has good action, and the story and the humor work well together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent horror movie! The movie takes place in the mid-1970's during a strange time in America's history where there seems to be a steady stream of mysterious and frightening deaths (even stranger because there is little media coverage of them). Some of these deaths were in the field, others in a house. The victims were all men, and they had a strange way of dying (slumped over, disoriented, or completely out cold). Some were seen by their wives, but not their friends or family. The murders all happened around the same time. These murders all seemed to involve very young boys and men who were in their teens or early 20's. The murderer of one of these victims even seemed to be an acquaintance of one or both of the victims.     The film was made for a special, night time show on a local television station. The killer in question had been arrested on several occasions, but had not yet been sentenced. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a lot of fun watching this movie.   This is a pretty funny movie, not in a dark way, but just in a light way.  The plot is very simple.  There are many people, who like to shoot guns.  One of them is a guy named Frank.  He is a nice, nice guy.  In this movie he has some trouble with a young girl named Lucy.  Lucy comes to him for help, because Frank has been going on and on about his plan to shoot all the gangsters and put an end to their gangster life.  Frank is all for it, but Lucy does not feel that way at all.  But then Lucy and Frank do get along very well.  After a lot, of trouble, Frank and Lucy are able to get out of Dodge with a few friends.  While in a motel room, a man calls out to Frank, who gets excited about the opportunity to take down the mob.  It is pretty much a comedy.  This movie should be seen by all, who want to be entertained, without worrying about the plot.

And I'm so excited that this movie will have a theatrical release on June 28.  My husband loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is something about a classic monster film that makes the whole movie feel very old and it makes a certain kind of sense:  I am a sucker for old monster movies, and these are the kind that will probably haunt me for the rest of my life.   It is very hard to find good monster movies these days because the monsters seem more and more like walking dummies and their dialogue is so bland.  The monster on the front of the monster package is a big green lump that has a big scary face and then it rolls around on a big blue monster on a blue monster that has big teeth.  They are the monster of the title and they appear at night and then in the morning they're back and then they do this a few more times before they go back home to eat more people.  I feel that we are spoiled these days.  It should be a very hard film to find and it is not.  This movie is a classic that anyone who loves old horror movies should check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always loved this movie, not because I have any special affinity for it - I have a lot of favorites, and this is not one of them - but because I always find myself amazed by the fact that such a story could come from the minds of such a few people.   After a long and arduous career of working in television and radio, David Carradine went back to his own creation.  He had been working on "The Shadow," a short story written by his late friend and collaborator, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.  The story is about a man who is a vampire - and not only a vampire, but one who knows how to control the power he has. He is not only an undead creature who can walk about in daylight and sleep at night. He can also play a game called "The Three Musketeers" in which he can control the weather, can see invisible things, and can even control people's thoughts - though he is not very good at this, and sometimes he is just a little too easy to handle.  One day he finds himself on a road near a small town, and gets involved in a case of theft and rape that seems to be being committed by some poor girls who have been seduced by a man with the skills and luck of a vampire.  It is a simple story - a small, ordinary town is haunted by a monster - but it has an underlying quality which makes it more disturbing than even a standard horror story - and it is this quality which has given the movie its power - a power which lies somewhere between the horror of a classic vampire movie and that of a horror movie directed by a master like Sam Peckinpah.  The movie is very much like the movie from which it draws its name, except that there is no blood involved - though there is plenty of it.  For me, the most intriguing aspect of the movie is its atmosphere.  At first it is very funny, and it has that quality of a good comedy. But the more you think about it, the more disturbing it is. It is hard to believe that this story could have been written in 1957 by a young man who had not even reached the age of twenty-five.  After all, there are some very strange things which happen here.  I don't have the time to go into every little detail here, because I believe it would take too long, but I will say that there are a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie from the 80's.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While not a great movie in terms of storytelling, there is definitely a lot to love about it:  For starters:  It is a horror/thriller/fantasy movie: With a lot of blood, some gore, a lot going on, and a little bit of humor, The Conjuring   is a well-crafted movie that is full of thrills and laughs.   For those who do not know much about horror movies:  As a horror movie: Well, let me just say, there are a LOT of scary moments in the movie: from the ghosts, to the witches, to a bunch of creatures that live in the attic of a house, to more spirits that try to get into the house, and even to some really spooky scenes.  It has some amazing special effects, and is very well-made.  The story: While it's not a long movie, there was a lot for me to enjoy:  With all the paranormal activity and dark and twisted scenes, the story is definitely one that is worth watching:  The main character is a guy who is a bit of a loner and is trying to figure out how to make a new start in life. He lives in a little house that he bought after his father passed away. He is trying not to make too many enemies by trying to get away from his past and trying to make things work in his new home.  Of course, his new life gets derailed a bit when he finds out that a bunch people, all trying to solve the same case, have been murdered.  In the midst of all the chaos, his wife starts having a nervous breakdown, and the two of them try to figure a way to stop this from happening again.  After everything has been set up, the final scene is probably the most memorable one:  One of the things I really liked about this movie: The fact that it really had a lot in common with a lot  of classic ghost stories.  While I have only seen the first few minutes of this movie, it does show a bit in terms  of the tone that was going to be used, and how all the scenes of supernatural activity were going to fit into that:  There was a definite ghost-y vibe going on.  There were even a few scenes that actually showed us something new that had been set-up:  And one of the coolest scenes, even though it was a bit odd to watch

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a scene in this movie where it starts to rain and suddenly the camera pulls away from the two girls sitting in a puddle as it drips down the drain. The rain is so violent that the wind and the rain and everything just make this beautiful rain-drenched look so sad. I thought I would get a picture of that sad scene, but of course when I watched it again after a few hours the girls are already wet and muddy and the water looks to be running out of the drain, but that is a small nit-pick.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished this movie. It was a nice change from the usual bad movies that we get these days. I like the humor in the movie. I don't think the movie would have been as funny if the actors didn't do their own voices and have their own unique voices. I also like the movie's theme. The main character's name is Paul. He loves to draw and his girlfriend is a girl named Mary. Mary is also an artist. When they meet, they have a drawing contest. Paul is an aspiring artist who thinks he'll become famous if he wins the contest. The guy has a bad draw. Paul thinks if he doesn't win, he will lose all his talent and won't be able to make any money. But after winning, the guys start making fun of the guy who draws so poorly.   While I'm on the subject of bad acting, I'll mention that there was also a horrible performance by John Goodman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good:  The first time I saw this, I was completely confused as to why it wasn't better. The whole thing was just a lot of ridiculous crap. I was going to give it an average of about a five.   But then I had a bit of an epiphany.  First of all, why isn't this called "The Furryest Of Fuddies?" Secondly, why do so many people think that this is an action movie? It was clearly not an action film. It was definitely a comedy.  So the fact that it was a comedy made it much funnier than it would have been if it was an action-packed action flick.  Also, I just can't get enough of "Daffy's Birthday Party".  The only reason I gave it an okay was because I had seen it before and didn't think it was all that different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is an adaptation of the "Prayer in the Rain" story by Joseph Conrad. In a country surrounded by rain (yes, it's a rainy country), a young boy, Ralfe (Rainer Werner Fassbinder ), has a mysterious gift. He can read people's minds and predict their future actions. To protect himself from the abuse of the local priest, Rolfe hides his gift from his mother, who tries to make sense of the phenomenon, and the local police, who seem to have little use for Ralfes predictions. The movie was the biggest box office success in Germany during the early 50s, as it won the Prix de la cinéma (Film of the Year) and a prize for "Best Action" from the German Film Institute.   FassBinder is not just good as an actor, but also as an author. He creates an atmosphere of mystery and danger by a combination of a man and a beast. It's also a classic war movie, but it has been reduced to a war thriller by its American producer (I don't know why), who had no interest in the real war in Europe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like horror and the likes then you'll be happy with this one.   The film follows a character named John (Bruce Dern) as he visits a couple who just moved to the city to start a new life. The couple is friendly and outgoing but can't seem to deal with the new job.  The couple decide to get out of the city because it is way too dangerous and the couple decide that if John goes to the local morgue, then the body could be moved in for examination.  John is initially skeptical of this because the morgue is in an abandoned building that is being used by some criminals.  Luckily for John, he has a bit of a special connection with the body because the body was taken to a remote place in a remote area of the town that is off the main highway.  It is a little difficult to understand what is going on with the film because the director of the film is one of those directors who likes to have some kind of theme that he wants to hit but sometimes doesn't get to.  There are some interesting ideas here and John has some of the best scenes in the film.  Although the film doesn't really have any strong characters, John is an interesting character and the story is compelling. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was about the history of Japan and of Okinawa.   In the movie, Okinawa is attacked. The Japanese army comes to Okinawa and it is attacked by the American army.  There are battles between the two forces. Okinawa is surrounded. It is not possible to hold it and there is a Japanese retreat from Okinawa. We see the last Japanese soldiers who have left Okinawa. They are running. They have to run. They cannot run any further.  The Japanese are trapped. They want to be saved. They think about their wives. They say they want to go back to their wives and children. The movie shows that there are people who are trying to help them.  They are trying. They come to the home of a man who is a refugee who has been living in the jungle for 3 years. He is the only person who can help the Japanese.  In his home he can't even get a place to sleep. His wife is away. It looks like the movie is an allegory. There is a war between two sides. It all began with the invasion of Japan by the United States.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is probably my favourite movie so far.   It has everything: great comedy, an amazing soundtrack and some real heart.  The film was made in the early 1970s and is based on a real event that happened in San Francisco, a woman who ran a small cabaret and kept a black cat as her pet. This led to her being arrested for possession of a large amount of pot and, as a result, being sentenced to 12 months in a mental institution.  She escapes from the institution, takes a cab back to the cabaret to collect the $40,000 in unpaid debts she owes and then ends up getting stabbed by a fellow cabaret patron who has been drinking too much and is not taking no for an answer.  If that didn't sound interesting enough it gets even better:  After a fight with the victim, the perpetrator returns with a gun and attempts to kill the cab driver. Fortunately a friend of the driver comes to the rescue and manages to stop the murder.  But wait there's more:  The taxi driver refuses to call the police. So after a trip to the police station, the driver takes the victim home, where the woman is attacked and murdered.  In the end the murderer is apprehended and sent to prison for the 12 months he has already served.  I've watched a lot of bad movies over the years but this one stands out as the one that is true to life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a former student of John Woo, this movie definitely looks like a ripoff of the film "Dirty Harry" (1971).   The story of this movie is really about a police officer (the "Master") who goes to solve the crime of a couple who was killed by a drug dealer and then murdered (his daughter) who was a lover of the police chief (the  "Big Chief").   Woo wanted to make the film look as real and gritty as possible, which he did. The film looks like it was made by some low-budget Hollywood movie which is really good.   Also the soundtrack is a classic Woo classic.  There is only one problem that I can see with the movie.  The way this movie was made, was to get away with everything, but then the master makes the mistake of having a kid who looks and acts like a teenager (not because he is).

You get your best shot at a Western with the film's opening narration, and it is excellent.  - It's not too long, not too short, and not too fast, and even in the fast parts there is a good pace.  The sound effects in this film are excellent.     I don't know much about the film, so I could be wrong, but the dialogue is very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to films set in the 1950s, the Coen Brothers have the best.   From the opening shot of a movie theatre, a long, black train and the movie that goes with it that shows an actor with a wig, a cigarette and a big smile.  In other words, a typical movie theatre movie.  And that is where it gets interesting.  After the opening, a very sinister scene sets in: a woman is standing in a deserted, dirty railway station; the only people in the station are a bunch of young men.  She is dressed in her underwear and a red dress and there is a small bottle of whiskey sitting on her lap.  The train conductor appears and, without saying a word, he leaves.  It becomes obvious that this woman is a prostitute who has been taken from the train in an attempt to be sold.  So she is not happy about the situation and so she decides to kill herself.  When the men are gone, she opens a door to a very dirty and filthy, filthy room.  A young woman dressed in dirty, filthy clothes, with a dirty red dress, is sitting on a bed and she is very happy to see a man.  What follows is a very strange, dark and weird film, that shows a woman that is very depressed about the state of the world in the year of 1950.  However, she is saved by a man that is also very depressed.  This man is a guy who is very sad about the world that is going on around him.  He has a wife that loves him and he has an ugly, dark, very dark room that he lives in.  There are two people in this room, a young woman and a boy.  One is a girl and the other is a boy who is only eight years old.  But these people are only there because this person, whom we will call, a man, has saved them.  Now that this situation has occurred, the man does his best to keep this girl alive and make her happy.  To do this, he is able to get the girl to have sex with him every day and has a lot of sex with the girl.  Eventually, she starts to love him.   But things do not look good for this man when a mysterious woman, named, a woman named, Alice, appears to him and tells him that she wants to marry him. She gives him the choice of two

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Best"   I can't believe that this movie is available on DVD! A few of us were going to the movies to see some good old films back in the 70s, but this one just about made us vomit! The movie is a mess! It's about a young girl (Maggie) who is on her way to San Francisco to go to her boyfriend's graduation. We meet her as she's walking down a road, she's just been hit by a car! We also see a couple of other cars as she walks down the road and she starts to cry! We then find out she's been in a car accident, she doesn't make it. Her boyfriend, Pete (Bobby Deen), then shows up and he's got a car that he's just bought that's much better! We're then told Pete's father has been out in the sun all day and he has a lot of sunburn, he's really in bad shape! They then meet a couple more guys on the way who all have their own car... It's almost like a road trip movie! We go on the ride and Pete seems really happy and at one point we see the sun coming out over the mountains! There are some really good scenes of people running from the car, Pete is running for his life... and then he gets away! The sun then goes down and Pete says something about going home... and we get that awful musical sound effect! The film has one of the best soundtrack's of all time, it's really amazing! It really takes us into that 80s style! We see people in the streets, some of them look like aliens, a lot are in a hurry. It's like it's the 80s! It gets pretty crazy, but all in good fun! We get a bit of a funny scene where Pete's mom is at home and she has to get up and get to work, it almost seems like a scene from a movie. The people around her are in full makeup, we get the evil looking person who talks about her car... and the scene is really pretty! The final scene is pretty hilarious, we see Pete running and everyone keeps running after him, it looks like there's a stampede! We've seen this movie more times than I care to count and it always makes me laugh. It also has a great ending, I hope you enjoyed it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all good movies, "Fantastic Four" has plenty of heart.   One of the funniest things that happens in this movie is a scene in which Spider-Man (Peter Parker), the Fantastic Four's leader and the one to whom they're all most attached, says to Reed Richards, the hero they all love and admire, that if he were to die, the others would not let him rest in peace:  The Fantastic Four is not a very strong team, and this movie demonstrates this.  The only one who is strong is Reed Richards (a man who can't stand to be at home, surrounded by all the distractions that his friends throw at him).  Reed is so determined to make a name for himself, he has a vision of a city that is like a carnival, full of characters who have a bad habit of trying to fight each other, to kill each other or to live in squalor.  If he gets a shot in, he is probably going to be dead before he's out of the arena.    So Reed decides to give all his powers to a man named Charlie (who has some interesting abilities).  Charlie is able to use those powers, but he can't use them to kill, and he can only use them when he's with someone who wants to kill him.  Reed and Charlie soon become good friends, but the problem is that Charlie is a criminal who wants a big score and a good deal.  As a result, Charlie tries to kill Reed in a fight, and Reed is badly wounded.   But Reed survives, and then the film shows Reed taking Charlie into his home. He shows Charlie the things he has learned about being a hero and becoming a successful business man and he shows Charlie all of the fun that he can have in his life if he chooses to do it. Reed shows Charlie how to save people from danger and how to make his way in life. Reed demonstrates that he is not as weak as he makes him out to be, but is rather the most self-confident and successful person in the world.  Even when Reed is in serious trouble, Charlie is always there to help him. When he shows Reed how to be a good businessman, Reed wants to be that guy.  And Charlie gets to have his dreams come true and his dreams become a reality.  It was a really nice story, but it was also a very powerful film.  This film has a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My father was a real man who did not have a chance to show off in public (or in private) and I have learned that is very rare. He was a wonderful and kind man, and there are very few such things left. My father had a job as a gardener for an elderly woman who used to come to his place to visit her niece. The niece had been an invalid all her life and now she had her own apartment, a car, and she looked a lot better than she had when I first saw her. The elderly lady's husband died before I was born and my father had to leave the job because he was too old. He did not want to have a hard life in that house, and I never knew him to go without a meal. So I am very proud of him.   This is a beautiful movie about a man who has been in jail for ten years and has been released because a girl that was living with him had just died. He tries to do right by his new wife, but he needs to learn how to do things with her. He has to come up with a plan to bring her back.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm always amazed by the variety and creativity that comes with a great script. "Saving Mr. Banks"   is one of those films that has a great mix of adventure and social commentary:  From the early 1900's, Mr. Chalk (Richard E.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest problems with this movie are its pacing and its characters. The movie itself is pretty bad, but with a nice twist at the end.   This movie, if you can call it that, is really a comedy. There is a few funny scenes and a few characters that do get laughs.  This isn't an action movie, but it's a decent one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A wonderful film.    The first few minutes had a slight bit of "slapstick" quality but by the time we get to the action-packed ending the film moves into a very cool space theme and has some fantastic special effects.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really enjoying this movie: A movie about a man who finds the best way to escape the "real world" when his wife gets sick. She tells him he has a job as an "assistant to the devil" in a secluded village. He goes with his new friend for a few days until the "associate" shows up and takes them both away. Soon after that the man realizes he has been tricked into helping him escape, but what he finds when he gets back to his town is a place full of evil people. He is not allowed to stay on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A long time ago, in a city far away, a beautiful young girl was raped, then her naked body was hung up in the window of a deserted, seedy restaurant.   The next day, a young man, who had been a regular customer, and who had often dined at this restaurant, walked in and sat down by her.    He talked to her for a little while and then began to fondle her. The waiter came in and told the manager about what had happened.  After she had finished talking to him, he left the room.  The manager called the police, but nobody came.  Soon, the police arrived.  As they were talking to the manager, the young man who had come in walked in.  They arrested him, and then the manager went to the hospital and found her body.  This is a good story, with a very dramatic ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie at the cinema I was a little worried about the rating and plot.   It was made by an Italian, a woman who was born in a German hospital.  Then in a hospital a doctor tells her that she should have a baby and the woman is devastated.  When she sees her baby she is so happy, and then when she sees him he is a little boy.  This is so beautiful.  That is the reason why I loved it so much.  I love that the mother is a bit crazy and loves to have sex with her patients.  Her husband is in prison.  But she is able to have a child and then has a relationship with her son and then he becomes a teenager.  It is so much more than I thought it would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't even remember why I watched this movie. It was an older episode of an old TV show. It had a small number of people that were trying to make a movie, and I found that the director, who is very good, didn't really put his heart into it. There was a whole lot of characters on the screen. There's a doctor, and two actors who are trying to act like they're in a movie (and one of them is clearly not playing a real movie star). They're trying to have a big star who looks like a clown (Dirk Bogarde, who I don' think was ever a star) play a clown who is trying to be a hero. They get to the end, and there's nothing. So it's just these two clowns who are playing, and they don't look very well. The other actors don't sound very good either. They're not funny, and so on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best action movies I have ever seen, with some awesome fights, lots of explosions and blood, and a great story!   When I saw the trailer I thought it was going to be just another action movie but after watching the movie I thought this one was great.   The action scenes are great, the violence is realistic, and you can't believe how fast they can shoot!  This movie is really worth checking out, but it does have some of the worst CGI I've ever seen (they use the same one for all the action scenes)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's been a while since I've seen a movie that didn't give me a feeling of horror. This movie is about a man who was shot and killed and was discovered by the police at the scene.   I remember the day and the night of the movie.  When I saw the movie for the first time I was very excited to see some good acting and some good special effects.  The story was a mystery that was a little too close to something I would have liked to have seen on television: the murder.  I had to stay up late into the morning and see the movie a second time and the second time I watched it again I was more amazed at what I saw than I was sad by the death of the main character.  There is a woman in a very poor home who has been left for dead by her lover and then later by her family. The woman's son is sick and she has had to be cared for by the neighbors.  Her son is given a baby who dies soon after birth, and a man finds the dead body of his girlfriend who has not been murdered but just left in the house for a while.  This is a movie of true horror and of murder. A story that gives you a sense of horror that is very real and it will keep you watching even if you are not a horror fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it was over a decade ago.   There was a lot of things wrong with the movie; in particular the ending, which is a major drag.  It takes a lot out of me to watch a movie about a man's life that didn't get better; it should have been over in the first half an hour.  There is a lot to say about what could have been.  I don't really get the whole "hero is a man" thing.  Maybe the movie's creator thought that hero is a woman, so he changed his name to a man.  So he's not a hero after all.  If the story is true, that's all he's good for.  In any case, there is a great story here, and the ending is a big turn off.  The movie is pretty good.

This movie has all the characters from the TV show (which is a great show, by the way).   The main character is very annoying and the rest of the characters are also annoying.  I found that I could see the actors in the movie more than the actors from the show.  My rating:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am just going to say that this film is excellent.  It is a very good film that doesn't require much brain power at all.   And I mean "less" as I am really only giving this a "6" because the film doesn't really put much thought in and is very formulaic.  This film has an enjoyable script, with all of the dialogue being delivered in a way that makes the audience care about all of these characters, and not just one or two of them, but all of them.  The film has many laughs, a good story, and an awesome soundtrack.  What more could you ask for?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are things in the movie I really didn't understand until it was finished.   What is this about an alien?   I really was thinking that the aliens were supposed to be the gods of other worlds, so I really did not expect them to have any godlike powers.  I didn't have any other expectations for this movie, so this didn't bother me as much.  For some reason this alien was not able to change his form, so he just walked around like a giant robot (or something, not sure).  I guess this alien does have the power to change into different shapes and be anywhere he wants to go?  This is actually a movie I would watch again and again. I just wish I could have seen more of the movie, as some of the alien stuff is really awesome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many people, I had never heard of The Great Train Robbery until a friend told me about it.   The Great Robber is, at least in my opinion, the best Great Train Mystery that ever was.  From the beginning to the very end, it is a true story of one man's determination to rescue his wife from her kidnapper.  There is no such thing as a train robbery that is not entertaining to watch, and there is no more entertaining than a train robber who saves his wife and his children from danger.  The entire cast of characters is terrific.  John Ford and James Stewart are both excellent in this.  Jack Haley has a terrific time with the great story that is told and the actors who play the roles of the robbers are all terrific. However, as is so often the case with Ford, it all ends when the robber is dead.  One has to wonder just how long John Ford could have gone on with a script that is as good as this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this film during the early 70s, and it was one of the first times I ever saw a black man with a smile, even though he had his own troubles (which he handled with the best of them).   The movie is about a little boy who has been separated from his father, and finds his way to a place called Earth. There he has to learn how to deal with other people, and how to survive.   This is a good picture about a child, and a boy with a good heart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have nothing to say about this movie and this reviewer's reviews have failed to make me believe it's a bad movie.   This movie shows us a woman who has been raped and murdered and yet we don't really care about her fate or how she got there. Instead, we focus on her husband who seems like a nice guy.  I really couldn't recommend this movie to anyone because it just fails to impress me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched "It's a Wonderful Life" yesterday, in the first row of a small movie theater, with a small crowd, including a woman who looked about eighty. We could not see her face, but her eyes were bright. I've never seen a more convincing depiction of the rich and the poor in any picture in the history of the world. The poor lived in squalid conditions, and the rich enjoyed a life of luxury, with servants, a large house, and a carriage for the wife. The good news is that everybody lived happily ever after, except for the poor woman who had a nervous breakdown.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film I don't remember liking as much as I think I did is The Longest Yard (1944), but that was during the "Ridley Scott" era.   It's another movie that has the same sense of whimsy as The Adventures of Robin Hood (1948) and is even set in the same town (Pleasantville, Ohio).   One problem with the film is that it was very slow going in the beginning and I think that was a consequence of the studio deciding to keep a lot of the characters in the background in the first half.  The action in the second half, which is set in a prison and involves an escaped convict, is fast and furious.  This is one of those rare comedies that is also serious enough to be funny.  What makes it unique is that the characters don't talk, so you really feel that the guy being played by Humphrey Bogart is on a mission from God and he's taking revenge on the people who have mistreated him.  If you like comedies, this is one you should watch.

They also go on a road trip through the country.  I'm not going to spoil the movie, but it's a good one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good remake of the classic film, which is not a remake as in the case of the first film where it has been remade many times, but a reboot, i.e. a second or even a third version, where the plot and characters have been changed to more suitably modern tastes.   The story is the same, in the first a British woman (Carrie Fisher) meets an American (Paul Newman) in a bar and falls in love, and the second a German man (Paul Muni) who marries a Canadian (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who then runs off with another woman (Elisha Cuthbert) who is a nun who is not interested in him and is married to a younger man (Michael Caine).   However, as I said in the opening paragraph, this remake is very good, and does a very good job of recreating the feel of the film, it's not an imitation of the original, it has an original plot and a cast of characters who are more than up to the task of the role. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, the way it is, is what happens when good writing meets a good director, and good acting meets a strong and sympathetic protagonist, and strong writing.   This story is about a woman whose only child has died in a car accident.  She is so upset, she gets violent in anger and screams in pain at the thought of how much it was like their first child that died.  Her children are still alive.  What she decides to do, if only for the sake of her husband, is to go to the hospital.  But there is a strange man, she is told he is a doctor.  He goes into the hospital to look for her child.  This is a good example of the kind of story that is told about a family of four, one of them a father, and the other two children living at home, which means all four are grown, and not necessarily that the parents are still young.  The movie does a very good job of showing the kind and tender relationship that exists between the father and the mother.  (Not surprisingly, this film received several Oscar nominations for Best Picture in the 1980s.  It was the first film I ever saw that was set in the United States.)  I had never seen this movie before, and I loved it!

I liked the little kids and their mother too, especially the way she looks like a vampire.  -The soundtrack is fantastic and I loved the ending. It's a bit depressing at first but then it's a funny and touching story and then it becomes a touching story. It has a bit of everything in it, but I like the simplicity of the ending a lot.

A few people have mentioned it as a comedy; well, that's not the case. It's just that there's not much humor in this movie.  I didn't see this one until my cousin's friend introduced it to me, but I've now watched it about a dozen times, and it's still funny.  A good movie for the whole family, even for the younger ones. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. There were a couple minor problems in the beginning but those were quickly fixed. The story was interesting and the plot was very good.   There was also a character who I was attracted to.  The movie begins with a couple in a boat and they get pulled into a storm.  The storm is huge. A storm of ice, snow, and wind. They manage to survive the storm, but one of them, a girl, has a broken leg. The boat they are on is a bit of a mess and the girl gets tired of sitting and just sits around. The man decides to fix the boat. The plan is to make it float. They don't succeed, but the girl and the man do find out that they're in the center of the storm and the storm is coming to an end. A big blizzard comes in and the two find themselves stuck. The blizzard gets worse and worse and as the storm starts to get worse, the man has to leave.  A couple are stuck in the storm. A couple have to work together to get out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is simple: a man tries to get to Los Angeles from Chicago. He gets stuck in the middle of a blizzard and is left stranded.   I didn't mind the blizzard.  I got that they were trying to avoid the blizzards and get to LA in a short amount of time.  The snow is a minor complaint, but in a movie about a guy trying to get a job in the Los Angeles movie business, you'd think the snow would be a big deal.  After two hours in the blizz, the guy is glad he's not in the movie business.  It wasn't a bad movie, but if you don't like it then you probably won't like much else from the 1970's.

This film was shot in black and white with black and whites are always my favorite.  The movie starts out with a lot of drama in it.  A little girl has a nightmare where a car drives into her house.  After the nightmare she is found by an old lady who is crying out for her to get up.  With a little help from the old lady she decides to get dressed and goes into the woods.  She then has a weird encounter with a man named Jack.  Jack goes on to tell her what he has been up to.  There is also a lot more drama and comedy than the first movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favourite part about The Princess Bride   is the scene in the theater where Vizzini's mom calls him a "fucking bastard."   To call someone a bastard is a bit of a cliche, but that's exactly what she does to him; like she's accusing him of being a total bad guy.   I can't say how much I enjoy the story, because   it's too over-the-top.  I did like the scene where Vonzini and the Princess Bride'reunion' are watching some old clips and the old man gets up and says something like, "You know, I don't think there's much you could teach me about life.  There's a lot you could learn from   this movie ."  In the end, it's a bit pathetic; we all know this character, Vizzni.  If Vonz was a real person I'd like to know what his mother would say about this guy. But the way Vizzi reacts to him (and how he reacts to everyone, in general) I'd rather have watched a different movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an awesome film, even more so than its prequel, "Cabin In The Woods," which is an epic tale of a young man who goes on a quest to rescue his girlfriend. As a prequel to the movie, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" is the story of "Cobb" (played by Billy Zane), a kid who discovers that his father, a former US Marine turned politician, has been killed in a car accident. He makes it back to his hometown of Maysville, Kentucky in order to make amends for his father's actions.   However, before he can make am amends, he has to save the life of his girlfriend (played to perfection by Gail O'Malley), who is a woman who has been through some bad things. It is difficult to describe this movie, because it's almost impossible to describe what it is that makes it so good. For a film about an adventure that spans two continents and over two hours, "Bridgend" manages to tell a great story while still keeping a lot of the original film's charm. It has been said many times that if you only watch one film from this classic trilogy, you must watch this one.

The story of a young boy and his two brothers is a good one, but the movie is too long and has a lot of bad dialogue.   The acting is excellent, but I would have liked to see more of the older characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - There were only about 25% of the stars in "The Sixth Sense" (1995).   The first five minutes of this flick, which was originally titled "Sensitive" (a direct translation of the German word sonder, which means "sensory perception") were so bad, I felt like a complete fool, which is pretty hard to do.   There are numerous problems with this flick.  First off, it's a good idea to have a man whose mind is completely shut off watch a child's body (or the body of a dead person). I understand the symbolism of the movie (a close friend of mine who died of leukemia also died of a similar problem), but the acting is all very cheesy and unrealistic.  Second, the storyline doesn't make any sense. When he sees that a kid is playing on a carousel, he decides to try it out, thinking that maybe he can make it a kid's dream come true. Well, of course, he never does get any credit for it, so it ends up just turning into a nightmare where he's chased around by the kid and other people.  Third, I couldn't stop laughing at a lot of the acting in this movie. It was as if they had all watched too many cheesy horror movies, and the only way they could get through it was to act in an obvious manner.  So, is this a bad movie? Well, I suppose it depends on how well you like the story and the acting, but even if you didn't, it was an okay movie.  This is a picture I took of some kid who was on a roller coaster at Disney World in Orlando in June, 1999. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love The Hunger Games series so much that I can't imagine a world without them. I've been waiting for this movie for forever and finally it came.   My only problem with this movie is that the opening scene is not that good and the ending is so out there. But that's a problem for any movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of old school horror films and it always leaves you wondering why.   It's so cheesy and gross that the only thing I can say about it is that they should have been named "The Nightmare in a Jar" and not "The Horror in a Bottle".   In terms of scares, the director is good, but the production values are not very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never expected a movie of this quality to be released on VHS.   It is an odd thing, but I enjoyed the story quite a bit and thought that it could have been better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The whole movie is very good, and it's very funny. It's an absolute blast.    What I like about this movie is the way it starts out with a bang, a lot of good violence, and a lot good laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know you have been involved in something a long time when you begin to feel tired just thinking about the years you had spent.   And yet there is nothing so powerful or profound that one cannot enjoy a little play or a comedy in which a very funny, almost droll man, with a very dry sense of humour is able to make a point, without being over-indulgent or boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many people in this day and age, my kids would be embarrassed by the idea of going out to a "cool" movie.   They had their own idea of what "cool"... and we have a lot to thank in the way of movies like this one.  What a thrill!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a well-shot, well-acted, well directed, well produced, well acted, and well directed science fiction movie. The music is well done and the action is fun. I think this movie is best in category.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Day I Saved a Guy's Life" is a short and funny horror movie. A group of strangers, on their way to the store, encounter a woman in distress, who is trying to make her way to a hotel by using a long stick to pull herself up the side of a building. She gets lost in the darkness, and finds herself trapped underneath a moving car. A woman with a gun appears on the scene and fires a shot at the women, causing them to run away. The woman tries to get out, but a man with a long beard comes to her rescue, pulling her up. The group has their share of fun in the movie, and when they return to the motel, they see that the man has a gun and is still trying to help the woman, even though he knows she is lost.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot is typical and predictable. You've got your hero, an old man (George O'Hanrahan) who's a former war hero who decides to move back into his old neighborhood and resume his old life. He's got a nice wife and son (Hugh Niblett and Jennifer Beals) to care for. This is pretty much what you'd expect from a man of his age. There's a big storm going on that seems to be making things worse.    O'Hara is good at keeping the audience engaged, and I really liked the way the movie was structured.  Omen is well worth a viewing, especially if you're a fan of O' Hanrahan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing about "The Devil's Advocate" is the performance of Edward Asner.   He plays the devil's advocate in a courtroom and never loses his cool in his defense of innocent people.  Asner also does the most remarkable job as a human being who has lost his loved ones.  He is a very funny character and very sympathetic in some instances.  The most amazing character is Dr. Mink, played by the very entertaining Richard Herd.  Dr.Mink is a scientist who is willing to believe whatever any of his friends, especially Dr.Asner, says about a case he has been involved in.  I was very impressed by the acting by both these actors, and I would love to see both of them in more films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just found out that a new movie called "The Nightman" is being made in London. This movie was directed by Peter Hyams and is a horror story about a young guy who is being stalked by a supernatural monster. I found this movie really interesting.   What impressed me is that the story is set in a very small town and this is all set around the day of a train accident in which four people died. This is an amazing movie. I can't wait to watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An important and very good film. The film's main character is a young man who goes to a remote area in the Philippines to meet an old friend for the first time. However the friendship does not last very long. There is a strange evil in the air, some kind of supernatural event. This film deals with many issues that are close to my heart such as the war in the world, racism and the suffering of the poor and the helpless. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved watching the trailer to this film a year or two ago. I remember thinking to myself at the time that this film is a gem. So much fun. If you like a great old time, slapstick comedy, then this is a great film. I am sure that I will be seeing this film many more times.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is just like any other horror movie: scary, tense, and well-made.   In the beginning of the movie, we meet a young woman, who, after leaving her boyfriend, meets a mysterious man who shows her a photo of a dead woman.  As the movie progresses, we are given more and more details about the man and the photo.  The first scenes are just scary.  At first, when the man takes a picture of the woman, the picture shows a woman with black eyes and a broken nose, and there is a lot of blood coming out of her head.  However, the man's face doesn't look like that.  He seems to be a well-educated man, but there is something weird about him.  When the woman is brought back to the house, we find out that the woman isn't the only dead person in the house.  After finding out who the man is, we soon see him in action.  This is when the movie is truly scary. It takes some time to get used to the strange man and his strange method of taking pictures.  While the man uses a strange method to take the pictures, you are slowly wondering if he really is the man in the photo, or just a very creepy person.  I liked this movie a lot, and I think it is a very scary movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old western. It was made by an unknown director in the early 60s, with the only other western movie I've seen made since then being, in my opinion, more good than great.   The first 30 minutes are a bit rough and violent. After that, it gets really good.  It has a great cast of actors. It has an interesting story. It tells you about what life was like in the days of the pioneers. There are plenty of action scenes, and the film takes us on a lot of interesting rides.  This movie does have a few flaws:  the dialogue is pretty choppy in places.  The plot is somewhat unclear in places and the movie can get pretty confusing.  But if you are a lover of the classics or a new film buff, this one is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is one of the finest movies that has ever been made, even though it is not a perfect film. There are a lot of inconsistencies with certain points being made in some scenes that are later revealed to be wrong. However, this is not an issue with the story, rather it is the manner in which the film is told, which is a little inconsistent at times. While the story is interesting and has a little bit of depth to it, there are a few scenes that seem to try to do a lot and fail. It is only when these moments occur that you really see the depth of the film.   Overall, this movie is a classic for good reason. There is a good storyline that can be taken or dropped, and it is easy to understand the way in which a lot is happening at one time. I give it a 7/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie.   I was very impressed with this movie. Very well made and very suspenseful.  Very cool and stylish.  I would like to watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about a man who has a very low self esteem. He was at his lowest and he has an awful past that made him suffer from such a low state.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The characters: The film opens with a scene with two characters talking about a movie. The movie: I don't really remember any of it. I was so into it that I couldn't stop watching. The film is about two friends, the one with the dark hair, and the one who has blonde hair, who live in a house that they have built with the help of their kids. The main character, the guy with dark hair is the one that is not afraid of anything. I'm not really sure what he does that he is so confident. It all seems so out of character for him to be so confident about everything he does. He is always so calm, and there are things in the movie that don't make sense to him. This doesn't take long before the other character appears, with blonde hair. The first impression you get from this character is that she is easy going and cheerful. The whole thing is just so...funny. I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. The plot: This film isn't very good, but it is pretty entertaining. The characters are very enjoyable, and I love all of the characters, including the main one. I loved that he was so confident in everything that he did. The jokes just kept coming and coming and I was laughing from the first scene to the last. There are just so many things to like about this movie. If you like movies like this, watch it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago I was reading a review of a film called 'The Big One' by Martin Scorsese and he had this very interesting statement about the power of fear, and how that was the main reason behind all the violence in that film:  The film is really about a man's fear of not being able to go back to his wife after the death of his wife.   The man is haunted by a fear he could go back again to his murdered wife who was shot by a stray bullet in the back.  He cannot move from his hotel room.  His wife was dead, his daughter was raped, and his house was ransacked.  A man in a room alone with his own mind.  Scorsismo was a huge influence on this film.  There is a scene where the man is sitting on a bed.  It's dark.  The woman walks in the room.   A man comes in the next room.     The woman goes into the bed.   She is naked.  She has two men holding her.   It is the scene of a rape.  What happened in that scene is that a man came in the bedroom and took advantage of a woman by forcing himself upon her.  Now she is a man in her mind. This is a case where the real violence is not what happens to her. The real violence that occurs is in her head when she is raped.  But the woman in the film doesn't just have her own mind to worry about, she has the mind of a man who is very far from human.  I am not sure what to make of this film and I am still thinking about the scene where she is taken to the woods.  This is so scary because you know what is about to happen but you have no idea who it is and how it is going to happen to her or if she is going into the woods willingly or is this all an act.  For the scene with the woods I found the editing a little bit jarring and slow in this film that has a real beauty to it.  And there are some very moving scenes that just pull you right into the action and make you feel.  Also some of the more violent scenes seem a little over the top.  Some things that seem too far out, but a little too obvious for me to dismiss this film with a line or two about how violent the film is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not usually a film lover but this one has been so incredibly fun to watch I don't want to miss any of it.   This is a very funny film with a wonderful cast of wonderful people!   There's a guy that is a little more than an idiot.  He gets in his car and drives to a remote house and knocks on the door and then thinks he'll have a better experience in the real world then what's on television.  I don   don't think he is a stupid or an idiot but I think he's kind of lost his way.  It was really cool to see him drive and be very good at it. I've seen a few really bad cars but this is one of the ones that will make your heart stop!  Also a couple of the other people in the movie.  They are very funny too!  The one who's funny is a bad girl named Janice who's name comes from a poem. She can be so mean when she wants to be!  Janice is not the bad one in this movie. She just wants to get into a bad situation.  You do see her at one point with a knife.  She's kind and funny and just fun to be around!  She gets the bad guy in trouble with a gas station attendant and the guy just gets away with it. It's not even a good police chase.  But it is the good guy who's the main guy.  The movie does have a great ending.  This was such a fun ride from start to finish.  All the little details were so perfect to make you laugh.  Thank you to whoever did this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen such a wonderful and colorful film about a poor boy in a big town with rich people and lots of money, with a good-looking family and the girl with the good eyes, and all sorts of things. The plot of the movie is simple and quite simple: a poor kid lives in a small village with his mother and father, a good job and a very pretty wife. And the plot may not be too interesting, but then the movie doesn't need to be much more. The film is not a very long film, about 1 1/2 hours. But there is a lot of story to follow, with lots of things to think about, and this is a great film about the way a village in a poor country goes through changes. The movie has lots of laughs, and the story is well told.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not looking forward to watching the movie   But I came to the theater expecting a dull and stupid movie.   What I got was a movie about a man who has been the mayor of a small town and is then thrown into the most intense political and cultural revolution in the history of France.  He is forced to make difficult decisions when he is asked to sign a treaty that gives away the territory of a huge chunk of France, but his heart is set on protecting a young woman, a French princess who was born in the place.  I didn't expect to like it, but   It is pretty funny and the characters are well-developed.  What impressed me most, was how it was set up in the beginning of the film.  It was about to be banned, but the people in the audience got so excited that they voted the movie a 10 and even raised money for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited about this movie and I was right.   The film starts out with a fantastic montage where we see the life of Paul Newman, a young and innocent looking movie star. The montage shows him going out with the beautiful Dorothy Lamour and having his first experience in love with Dorothy. We then move back to the future to the year 2038 where Paul Newman is about to become the world famous movie star of the future. However, his life as a movie star doesn't seem to be going as smoothly.  He's going through a horrible divorce and has been on the set of a movie where he has to fight a giant creature.  After he's done fighting the giant monster he then has to go back to his wife in order to tell her what has happened.  Paul is about 5'11" tall and this giant creature is about 6'7".  The two end up falling into the water but the creature then comes back to life and tries to kill Paul.  Unfortunately Paul doesn't have a good enough plan to save himself so he has a close encounter with a shark.  Then we get to the present day where Paul has a bad fall and we see him lying on the shore.  I thought that it was very amusing how he was so concerned about the whole situation.  Now that Paul's life has become terrible he gets his chance to redeem himself and get back into the movie industry.  When we see Paul in the present we see that his marriage to his beautiful wife has ended and his life has taken a horrible turn.  However, after his fall the shark still wants to kill him and that's when Paul starts to think that he could be famous again.  So Paul goes back to see the giant creature who is going to be the inspiration for his future movies.  One thing leads to another and Paul's relationship with his wife begins to improve again. Then, the shark again wants to eat Paul and so Paul has to get back to being a movie celebrity.  It was really good to see that this movie took place in the 20th century and that Paul Newman wasn't the only one who was famous at the time.  At the end we see a nice view of the ocean and the sharks were not enough to deter Paul from his dream.  The ending really made me want to see this movie again and it's even better that I did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A big studio made a big budget movie about a little band playing around in a garage.   The movie follows the band's life from its birth in a small town in Texas to a big touring and recording gig in New York.  Some songs are good, some songs are really bad, but there is a lot of good music to listen to!   I've had this movie for a while now and it hasn't left my mind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Road to Hell" has a plot which is all too familiar, but the writing is very imaginative and clever. The acting is all right but the music and music are in the background, with the dialogue only really being there to make you laugh.   In the first half of the movie, there are many jokes that are not worth the trouble, as they only serve to make the characters more stupid.  This is one movie that only the viewers of this movie will be able to like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think you may be interested in this movie, as it is very similar in some ways to "The Manchurian Candidate". Although I do not have many of the details, it seems to be about a man with no memory, a CIA agent named Paul Bonacci and two other people, including a prostitute. I think they went into a hotel and were then drugged and then kidnapped. I saw the movie in the theaters on TV. It was scary, very well made, and very well acted.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a good time when a young hero (I mean, really) is sent by his father to save a city on the brink of destruction.   A man, whom we see in a flashback, is talking to himself and singing to himself as he wanders through the city.  In the very next scene the city is already being destroyed.  But this movie is not a movie about the destruction of the city, it's a movie with no story, nothing.  The entire movie is about this man and his father, a boy who goes out every night and makes his father's home a home in peace, with the help of a faithful friend.  It's a shame the film had to be so bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie, and the acting and editing are top notch. The storyline is about the day a teenage girl, who was born a virgin, and her brother's first sexual experience with a young boy, who happened to be a local high school football star. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes place in an unnamed European country and depicts a typical European working day in the small town of Stavanger. The people are a bit dull with no personality but they are easy to follow because of the good direction of the film. There is a great deal of humor in the movie with the jokes about a dead wife, a husband who wants to move to Paris, and a little girl named Lizzie who doesn't care much about the world around her.   One of my favorite things about this movie is how realistic and realistic the dialogue is. It is so good in fact that it is really hard to remember the joke and the character names! It is just fun watching the characters say the funny things with all the different accents. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An American remake of a Russian film that never made it to the US,   is a beautifully shot drama that tells the true story of a woman who is given the chance to leave her village for a better life in the big city, only to discover that the truth is much worse.   The film was shot on a soundstage in New York and made in a studio in Los Angeles in 1976. It has the feel of a 1970s Hollywood blockbuster.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, I'm sure I'm not the only one who hated this movie. That's the reason why I've never rated a movie this low... I found it to be lame at best, pathetic at worst. The plot is a joke, but it's not very bad: it has a little something for everybody. The acting was horrible and they just couldn't get the movie done with any kind of professionalism. I don't even know why they wanted to make a movie about an American soldier who was fighting on the front lines in WW II, but there was no story here. This is the most boring, unimaginative, stupid, idiotic, horrible movie ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely and utterly blown away by this movie.   It is a little difficult to describe.  A bunch of very well acted, very well written, and very well filmed people are on a boat in the middle of nowhere in an isolated area.  The film is a mix of comedy and drama.  It has all the classic elements.  They all make you laugh, and the film seems to be in some kind of dream-like, surreal world.  There is also a good dose of romance, as well as some action.  All in all, it is a very entertaining film that doesn't hold back on any of the elements that it has.  I really liked this film, and it was very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well, let me start by saying that this movie is funny.   One of the things I like about comedy is when the audience has nothing on their mind, so we all laugh.  At one point in the movie, we laugh so hard we throw up.  This movie also makes fun of all sorts of people, not just the people on the bus.  I love a good car chase movie.  There is so much going on.  Even though we are on the subway, I keep looking up because there are so many interesting characters.  The movie was very funny and I really enjoyed watching the characters talk.  Although the story was pretty sad, it was still funny. I will definitely see more.

I hope to see this movie in the near future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little reluctant to check this one out, mostly because I thought the premise sounded a little silly. But I must say I'm impressed with how well this turned out. The story is a bit of a mess, as it's told from the perspective of a high school girl who accidentally kills her boyfriend. Things get a little odd when her dad moves into the same building and tries to get her back by inviting the boy to live with them. But the most bizarre part is the end when the girl takes her revenge on him by getting him fired from the school where he works.   (The movie was rated R at the time, for "Restraint".)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I found myself generally enjoying this movie (especially with the great score by Tony Visconti), there are a few problems that stand out. The first one is the main villain, who is voiced by a non-English-speaking Paul McCartney.   He's basically a giant mutant dog-man, and he's totally unsympathetic.  He has a very odd look about him, and seems to be made out of cardboard or some sort of plastic. The other problem is the plot, which consists of the main character going out for a walk, discovering some other people, killing them, and getting away with it.  But how?   I found the movie's pacing a little on the fast side, and the pace just keeps speeding up.  While the story is interesting and intriguing, it's just not well developed.  At the end of the day, it seems as if someone thought that, as they were playing around with the formula from Back to the Future, that they could get away with a more original plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie twice. First time at a friend's birthday party and after that on a road trip for two weeks. When I saw the movie the first time, I thought it was going to be an awful train wreck and I wasn't alone, at least I was. There was a very odd ending and a lot of bad things went down in the beginning and it wasn't a good time to watch. However, I kept watching and after watching it the second time I felt the same way. I've never been a big horror movie fan. I'm not a fan of horror movies at all. However I feel I was able to look past some of the bad things and some of what really made this movie good. It wasn't scary but it wasn's just enough. Some of the things that happened are a little bit messed up. Some people don't really seem to be aware of how they act and some people don:t seem to know why they act a certain way. However the thing I liked most about it was the characters, I found them all very likable and it showed that they weren't all evil.   It took a while to get there but the story was worth the wait. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is an excellent example of what can be done with a single camera and the talents of the cast and crew. It's a very good thriller, with a nice twist in the story. The setting is perfectly interesting and you really do get the feeling that there was a lot of planning involved in making this movie (which has a lot in common with a lot other movies of the same era).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie, I say, is good:  It is a good film. I was at the movies for a month and thought that I wanted to return to the theater in a matter of weeks. This movie, however, made me stay for a week longer, and that is saying a lot for a movie that can be shown without being seen.   If you want to see the most wonderful picture you will ever see and have a good time doing it, this is the movie for you.  The characters are likable and very enjoyable, and the acting is not only good but it is also very convincing.  While there is a plot that needs to be told, it does not take up more than an hour of the film.  You need not worry about getting lost in it.  I enjoyed the story:  Yes, it is a happy picture, a happy story and a good one.  It was like a good song made of a good story.  A good story and characters and acting are not enough, however.  This movie made me want to be there for another day.

The only bad part about the plot was the ending, which I found to be a bit too much and it felt out of place at that point in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did a review of the previous film, and I'm surprised at how much the plot changed with a different director and a different cast.   The story still holds true to its original premise, however, and if anything, it's even more engaging than the first film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie.  I think it's good, I like how there's a movie about it but also a documentary about it.   It's really sad how it ended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film takes place at a boarding school for the criminally insane where the only way out is to be insane.   While it is obviously a very twisted movie, it's fun in the fact that the characters are all so different.  The acting is great all the way and you never feel like it's all in vain.  All the characters and the setting are so different and all the situations are so crazy.  There are many different scenes and it's so easy to keep watching and enjoying.  It's funny as hell but it's also creepy as hell.  For the most part I think this movie is great but there are a few things that do bug me.  One of my favorites is when the students all have to take off their clothes (no, no panties. No, that's not what they were talking about) and go naked on a school bus.  Then a student starts to scream and the bus driver turns around to yell at him.  How can the bus drivers on a bus know what kind of people they are letting onto the bus?  Then there's the scene where a kid is running around naked in the forest.  I don't know, just weird enough to keep me watching.  In conclusion, I really liked this movie and it was fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not a typical thriller. The main character is a guy that just gets hired to work at a small apartment complex by his former girlfriend (who is now his girlfriend's sister), but ends up being the landlord's assistant, and he has to do all the dirty work.   Although there are things about this movie that are slightly unusual, it still is entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie. Not much action but it has a cool story and a really good soundtrack.   The movie is about a guy that is a carpenter. He is going to work on a new house in a new town in a month. One day while he is on the way he is attacked by a dog. He tries to fight it off but it knocks him over and he is unable to get up. His boss arrives and starts to help him out. They have a big fight and he gets up again. A short time later he is in bed and his boss is gone. It is night and the dog is gone as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is about a poor man who lives by himself in an old church, a lonely man, a victim of circumstance. The man is suffering, he is a victim to circumstances. He has a son, a very handsome boy, who is also suffering, a poor boy who is very sweet, a wonderful child.   At night when the sun goes down the townspeople come in to drink.  It is a very depressing scene. There are no jokes and little humor, very depressing.  When the boy is about 5, the father comes out to see how the boy has done and he gets so much grief over his boy.  The father goes away with some of the others and goes to see the poor man in bed.  After his father has left, the son begins to cry and says he misses his father, so the father tells him about his old town, about how he used to ride his horse to the city, and then he went to the town to buy a piece of bread.  He tells the boy about how his poor mother sold her hair to sell her husband to buy some more food.  There is one moment in the story when the son is about to leave, and the father says to him he knows what will happen next, but if you want to live, stay here, and if you don't want to, leave and I will send someone who will care for you, and it will be easy.  If the boy wants to go, the mother will send some one to take him to the next town, but the boy says that he doesn't want his father to go with them, he wants to stay and die in the old church.  Then he takes a knife out and tells the father not to worry, he will find another boy to take his place.  As he is leaving the boy looks into the mirror and says "I don't know how I am going to live without my father"  He says to the man, "My father has always taught me, never to say goodbye, to leave this life and go into a better, brighter future, where I will be loved."  The man says, "Then I know how you are going to die."   There are few laughs in the movie, but a few jokes and a couple of good ones.  This is a movie with many good characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time.   The film is very well-made, and there is plenty of gore.  There are two stories within the film that may or may not be connected (not sure about the first story) and the films may or not be compatible with each other.  I found it very disturbing, very creepy, and very entertaining.  A very good piece of movie making.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as I can tell, this film is set in a medieval setting but there is some fantastic acting in it. You have an amazing scene where a giant (the one who can turn into a dragon) is having a conversation with a small knight named Sir Robert. Sir Robert is a knight with a very large head. Sir Roger is a very good actor as well. The other two actors also have good performances as well... I don't think that the movie needs much more attention. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm always amused when a guy who knows that all the other guys in the office would die of hypothermia and/or frozen to death on his birthday decides to go to a park in the middle of the night and have a little party in a tent.   So this movie takes place in the "Pine Gap" in Canada and the tent that Mr. Kowalski is hosting is a massive replica of the same one that's in the movie "The Road Warrior".   He's got a big-ass axe that he'll use to kill any of the four-legged creatures that wander through there.  This is where the movie gets pretty interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie about a boy (Gus Unger) and his adventures in a small town in Nebraska.    There are very few things that I can complain about and that's one of them.  It's not as fast or as thrilling as some of the other action movies I've seen, but Gus' love for his father (Peter O'Toole) and a local girl (Kathy Bates) endear him to the audience, and he keeps us entertained for most of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie with my wife and three friends. It was a fun movie, a good time at the theater, a bit violent but not too much.   If you have a problem watching movies like this, just make some popcorn and get ready to have a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I am not a big fan of horror movies. I do like the old school, scary movies like Halloween and a few others but for some reason I just do not like that style of movies.   I have watched all of the Saw movies and the Saw films are ok.  But this one, this was good.  I don't think I have ever seen an evil person so evil and cruel to his family and yet he has a family to care for.  This movie has an awesome story.  All of the characters are so well developed and there is a nice twist at the end.  So when you first watch it, the story is a little hard to get into.  The movie takes a little time to get going.  It takes a while to get used to all of these strange characters and all of their weird habits and the way they treat each other.  Then you are in the middle of this movie and you are wondering how in the hell this is going to end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm very glad I took a chance on this movie because it's quite good.   The movie is very good. This is a great movie with a great cast.  I found it interesting to see how it is portrayed how it's all about the relationship of a young boy and a young woman.  This is the movie of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the movie "Raging Bull" when it came out in 1927. I thought it was a very well written movie that was not for kids but rather for those who had some sense of maturity.   In the movie, there is a scene where an old guy is in his office talking about his experiences.    He has had a few too many drinks and now he is ready to get out of there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts in a way that seems like the film is about a family. The mother (Bette Midler) is a pretty well dressed woman in her late 60s. She is well spoken and pretty and the kids look like they are raised by a well-meaning but uptight mom. The father (Martin Sheen) is the older of the two boys and is much like his father, a bit of a loser. His wife (Nancy Allen) is pretty and smart and has always been able to get out of any problem the kids have by talking them into being nice. Her husband has an unkind name, but that's how he thinks of his kids, he is a spoiled, obnoxious asshole who hates everybody. So that's where the story starts with two dysfunctional people. But it's about to get worse. The kids start showing signs of growing up. They are learning to talk and act like grown ups, and the parents start to notice. The parents then decide to take the children away because they are getting too big for their britches. I mean seriously, a movie about a house full of kids that are growing up in the 70's in the middle of the Depression is so much better than any sitcom in the history of television.   There is no question this is a family movie, but it's not a one-note disaster. It's a fun family film with lots of good jokes and a well developed plot and it does a good job of getting us into the lives of the various characters in the film.  I give it a positive rating as a fun film that's a little darker than the plot suggests. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film for the second time at the movie theater this past Saturday. I loved the film, it was an excellent watch, I liked the characters, the plot, the action, and the humor.   The main character, "Captain" is a man of action, who is constantly getting into trouble because he has too much money.  To get him out of his troubles, he's got to work with the city's underworld.  I am impressed that this movie has been made into a play, with a great cast. I'm also impressed by the quality of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like all the movies on this list, this is a nice one. It's not an action film, so that's not what makes it an excellent movie.

It's also a fun watch (especially if you like a good comedy).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A young boy with the ability to talk to the dead is found at the bottom of a lake. He is saved by an old man who tells him about a "giant who lived in the water" and how they met. After a trip in the boat, they meet "Jupiter" (Omar Sharif), who explains to them that "there are more giants to come," and the boy is the fourth.   I think this movie is so good that there are actually people who are actually interested in it.  This movie is a lot like "Dinosaur" but with more action, and it's more interesting to me.  I love how this movie never has a boring scene.  It just keeps giving us the greatest of everything.  The cast is great.  John C. Reilly makes a great Jovial Old Man.  Omar Sharif is a great old man.  In the end, "Jurassic Park" is a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the beginning, it seems to be a simple tale of revenge.  After all, who can resist an opportunity to get their hands on that magic wand.  But then the bad guys get better.  They learn how to fight, they become more intelligent, they are more ruthless, and they become very cunning.  All of this leads to an evil triumph.     This was a good story for the young children I used to watch.   It was good fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The title pretty much summarizes the movie: It's about a woman who meets a guy she's been dating for months, but he soon gets his own back on her by claiming that she's the most beautiful woman he's ever met.   It's not a very good movie, but the premise, the characters, and the storyline are intriguing enough to keep you engaged for the entire run-time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie.   It was very enjoyable.  One of the more enjoyable films i've seen in a while.  I also liked how some of the scenes were very well edited.  It really showed what people were really like and didn't just have characters that were just characters.  This movie really makes me wish I had a friend in high school to watch the movie with me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say I was really happy to see the trailer!   This is not a bad movie, not at all!  It's a nice movie about a guy who's about to meet his wife and he decides to have an "I'm a man" party.   That is about as bad as you can get!  I enjoyed the movie a lot!     It does have a funny scene in it,  but it's not funny in a funny way.  It has a couple of funny lines but it doesn't go a lot further than that!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies of all time.   There's no way to describe how this movie is brilliant.  This movie was made for nothing but to make movies that make movies.  All the other movies that the directors made before this are crap.  For starters, the movie is based on a very well-written book by Tom Clancy, which is like a bible for Hollywood.  And that is why it is called a "movie".  This is all of the other things the other Hollywood movies had in common:  a young, idealistic detective trying to solve a murder with a very old and complicated mystery;  a very long running time;  high production values;  an amazing set; and so on.  The most common and annoying thing that the other films did to make the movie better were a lot of long shots and long dialogue scenes.  But none of the "other" movies are good enough to compete with this movie.  It is pure genius.  When I say this movie was well written, I don't mean that it was written as a novel but as a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself liking this movie a lot.   There's a lot going on, some of it pretty good, but some of the moments are really interesting.  As a big Star Wars fan, this made me smile (okay, that may be a bit of an exaggeration) and I'm always a bit worried that when they finally do release a Star Wars spin off movie, there will only be a few really great scenes, and those will be the most famous ones.  But this movie is fun!   If you're a fan of space, or at least Star Wars, you won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this when it first came out in the 70's and loved it from the get go.   It was the beginning of a long line of horror movies.  At the time, I was a kid, and I was really fascinated by the story.  And the music!  It got better with each movie, because it wasn't just "shaky voices, creepy images,"  but a fully-formed story. This time it was about two girls in a cabin, one of whom is a victim.  She tries to kill her tormentor.  It's not a great movie, but the characters were interesting and the story was really well written.  I'm looking forward to the next one.

The acting is very good all over the place. I wish they would make this movie for us.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie and one that I really enjoyed.   The whole plot is interesting.  It begins with a couple of kids who go into a haunted house. The children find out that the house was haunted by a real demon and so they kill him. However, the next morning the kid they find out is a woman and this woman is possessed by a demon and in the course of killing the other kids, she kills her husband and the demon. So the children are taken in by a friendly old man who will keep them safe and in return for their help, he is given a very valuable artifact.  Then there are a series of deaths in the house. At the end of the film, the kids return to find the house deserted. However when they enter the house, they find a body in the cellar. It turns out to be the wife of the old man, possessed by the demon!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I watched this movie I thought it was a bunch of garbage. It looked like a cheap-o horror movie with little to no story. But then I remembered that I've seen this movie on a DVD, and I went back and watched it, and it actually was pretty good. It looks like it was shot in a bad school movie, and the acting is pretty bad. However, there are some nice effects, like the blood, and there's some pretty good special effects, too. The music is pretty nice, too, with the songs that are used in the movie being pretty catchy.   "Oh, that girl in the car... it's your fault... I'm dying."   It doesn't really make much sense, but I like how it was set up to be something that was going to happen in the next movie, even though that movie never was made.

I was in a movie theatre, and in the front row I saw one young kid running after another, and that was the film's first thing that caught my attention. This is an action movie with a young man trying to survive the last two days on a deserted island. The action in this movie is great, and the story is good too. It is one of those rare movies that takes a long time to get to the action and then, you know, lets the action play out, so don't get too excited.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My God, this movie was incredible.   It's based on a story by the very talented John Dies at the movies writer.  It takes place in an American town in the 1940's and stars James Spader as a man who has found a way to be a good man and live the American dream.  James Spada, who I can't believe I'm actually writing about him here, is the most brilliant actor I've ever seen.  He was the opposite of everyone I've seen in other movies.  His character is the only sane one in an insane place.  The thing I love about this movie is that it's so far removed from the typical western.  This movie is a little bit like a love letter to westerns and is so full of laughs that even the most cynical of western fans will find something to like in it.  I think a lot of people who write about westerns forget that this genre is not the only thing in the world.  If you look at a movie like this one, you'll discover that there are plenty of interesting and wonderful things to be found in every genre of movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie.   This is a nice take on a "heroes' journey".   One character has a wife who has a bad back so he needs to make a big trip across the country to buy a van that will get him to his destination.  This movie is really interesting because of the plot twists.  One thing I really liked about this movie is the performances of all the actors.  They all did a good job of portraying characters that were kind of pathetic, but funny.  At first I thought it was a "gig" movie, but then I realized the whole thing was just for the actor's experience.  I was really impressed with how the actors did this movie. It was quite a good "movie" to watch and a nice way to spend an evening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . ....     -   Carmichael is a man with a lot to prove.   He is a black man who has risen through the ranks of the CIA to the head of the Counter Terrorist Unit. He is very well liked, and enjoys a good drink.  He knows his way around the CIA and does his best to stop the terror attacks.  But he isn't immune to the violence and brutality that befalls the other people in his unit.  There is a lot of violence in this movie that is pretty graphic.  For a movie where the violence is so graphic, the acting is pretty good.  And there is a scene where the terrorists attack a police station, and a group of hostages are taken out.  The scene has the effect of being somewhat romantic.  This movie also shows that there is an element of social justice in it.  It isn't the perfect movie, because of the violence.  A lot of times, the characters are either talking about how "the terrorists are coming" or how they can get "more money."   I've seen this movie a couple of times. I'll give it an 8.0.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After viewing several films about the Civil War, I was glad to discover that it is not simply a war between the North and the South. The South fought and died in many of the battles, and the North lost several battles. But the War was more than that. It was a civil war between two cultures. One that thought itself superior and the other that thought it inferior. The first people to realize the truth about the South were the Union Generals, who, because they had little military experience, thought they could win an unimportant war with a few well-trained volunteers. When they tried to do so, they met stiff resistance from the people they intended to serve, who saw the war as an opportunity to rid themselves of a hated enemy. But that was not the only reason the War produced the war it did. A growing and growing number of white Southerners believed the war was not just a war against slavery, but a war of secession and independence from the North. They knew it was a war for national independence and for their own self-determination. It seems only a matter of time before the South is ready to secede again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was a big failure and I am disappointed with it.   In the last two minutes, the movie is supposed to have a new ending. However, in the end, we know there is no new ending, only a new beginning.  I'm going to say a few words about this movie.  I found the movie very funny.  The story is told in flashbacks.  We see the first scene.  They are in a prison.  All the inmates want to kill someone.  You see the other inmates in the movie. They are all very smart and witty.  In an attempt to help the prisoner escape, the doctor does a good deed, and ends up helping the prisoner to escape.  When the prisoner gets back to his cell, he looks to see if any guards are watching.  Instead of being scared, he is delighted and runs to his new cell.  There, he decides to make a new friend.  He goes back to a bar.  It is not long until the bartender is killed.  Then, he comes up with a plan to kill the bartender.  With the help of the bartender, the prisoner manages to kill two guards.  After he kills them, they turn into the other guards that were supposed to be watching him.  To get back to the prison, he must kill three more guards.   He ends up killing one of them, and then decides that the next guard to come out will be his next victim.  Then, he goes to the next cell and kills it.   So, he gets back, and the other guard that came out was a female guard.   The woman had a gun.   She shoots him.   Then, the next female guard comes out.   After he shoots her, he runs to the last cell.   It is empty.  This is all told in one flashback.   This is probably the best way to tell the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is nothing like the first time we saw A Midsummer Night's Dream.   It is the first movie in a new trilogy, written by  Laurence Sterne. The stories are loosely connected, but they are all part of a large, interconnected and multi-layered story, weaving in and out of one another.   I found the film to be a combination of French New Wave and New England English.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited to see a "Raging Bull" remake for the first time in years. I had high hopes for this movie. I watched the original, and it was pretty good. I can't remember the last time I watched it, so I guess it's been a while. I think this movie was great.   This movie was a good film.  There are not many movies that do a good job of capturing the brutality of gang wars, even though most of the characters are fairly innocent, but Raging Bull is no ordinary movie.  The violence in this film is brutal. It's brutal for the right reasons: there is no other way to fight a gang war than through the use of violence.  This is what gang warfare is: there are no good guys in this picture.  Many of the movie's characters seem to have little choice in the matter, even the hero.  One of the other characters says:  " What can you do when you are faced with a mob that has become a mob and when you're facing an entire nation with an army in the air?"  In the end, it was a very good movie. The cast is good, the acting is good (excepting maybe the lead) and the action is good enough.  I'm glad I went to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this movie is one of my favorites.   As soon as I heard that Robert Altman was coming to the States, I was excited.  After seeing a few movies about New York City (my favorite movie is also based on New York, it was a New York Times Best Picture nomination) I thought the only way I'd ever get to see him is at a festival like the Sundance Film Festival.  It turns out I was very right!   Altman brings a lot to the table, the director seems to have a good eye for casting and the music in the movie is pretty great.  This movie doesn't have as many special effects as some other films, but there are some amazing moments, so don't be surprised if you have a hard time walking out of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing that can be said about this movie is that the sound is just as good as the picture.   I enjoyed this film as much as the first one. It's not as funny as the last one, but it's a good, albeit boring, adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched it at least a dozen times. It is really well done.   As a film about an evil person trying to kill someone, I feel like the ending is a bit contrived.  But there are so many different, interesting, entertaining and entertaining characters and they make a pretty good team.  There is no reason that a movie like this needs to have a happy ending.  It is a great movie and a great ride. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it is one of the greatest movies ever made.   It is very hard to describe but I'll try:  It's a dark comedy with a beautiful soundtrack and great acting.  There is a scene where one of characters, a "mulatto" is getting his ass kicked by a group of white guys.  One of the white guys says:  "Hey you're a white man you look like a mulatto and you're fighting for your life."  That's right, he says it.  "What is this shit? White men fight for nothing, they always get beaten by the other white men."  In a few words, this is a good scene.  It could not have been made more perfect by any director than Orson Welles, a true master of cinema, but who knows.  So, in a nutshell:  A very hard story about a very funny character with a very strange plot.  A lot of good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's great to see that a movie can be more than just a movie, it can really be more.   I have a love-hate relationship with these films, which I like to call "B-B-Comedy Movies".   This is my 3rd "B" movie.  I had seen a few, but it is not one of my favorites.  This time I was hoping that it would be a better experience, as the previous 3 were.  Well, I didn't have to wait long.  The plot is really funny, especially in the first act.  But the first 3 acts are a big letdown.  It has that "B movie" feel to it.  What's funny is that it's not really that funny.  In fact, the joke of "Cats and Dogs" never gets old.  If you're looking for a good time, this is it. But if you're in the mood for an "B Movie", this is not it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this at a midnight showing and didn't have any problems with it at all. The acting was pretty good. The movie itself was very nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So what are we going to do? We've got to talk about a movie with a title like The Princess Bride.   It is hard to put a negative review for a movie that I've seen a thousand times.  And yet, it still ranks high.  It may not be my favorite movie, and I've never seen the American version.  Maybe it's a guilty pleasure.  But it's not my least favorite movie.  The movie has been around since 1971 and has had three sequels.  There have been many incarnations of the plot.  I am going to attempt to explain all three movies.  This is the story of a young boy and his young bride.  They marry at seventeen, and the kid falls in love with the bridesmaids at the wedding.  What does this have to do with The Princess?  Well, after the wedding the two friends of the bridal party break away and decide to have an adventure.  These friends, the Vizzini Brothers (Rufus and Vicky), have been traveling the world for years and come to a castle in the middle of nowhere.  At the castle is a beautiful princess and a nasty and cruel monster.  In order to save her, the kids must use a magic potion.  You will never be the same after seeing this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a well-made film that has some wonderful moments. The story is well done, as it is about a group of children and their adventures. There is a fantastic ending, where one of the boys' brothers falls off a bridge into the river, and the boys make a raft to help him. The film takes place in the year 1933, but the story could have been told in the 1930s. The children's costumes and mannerisms are fantastic, and it was all quite exciting to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what is funny about this movie? You know how in the middle of one scene an actor comes into the set and says "I just realized I haven't slept in 3 days." What is funny is the next day a crew member comes into their trailer and says how he just came from the toilet and is feeling funny.   It's funny, and if it weren't so scary it would be funny. I don't know if it's a movie about ghosts or what but it's funny and creepy as hell.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When i started to read this book I was thinking about how much of a disappointment it was. I could never buy into the story and never felt as though I was in a story that was meant to be about a man who's going crazy, trying to control the people around him. But then, after reading a few pages, I was reminded that there are so many stories like this that happen all the time. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that The Wicker Man is the most entertaining of the lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can honestly say I'm never bored or disappointed with the movies that Kevin Smith has made over the past few years. Whether it be his first feature film, The Crazies, a sequel to one of my favorite films, The Clerks, or this, it seems like he just keeps going.   His acting skills in The Cremaster are better than I had expected, and even though he isn't an unknown, the film has enough plot and characters to keep you wanting more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion this is a pretty good movie.   A little more violence, a little more nudity (I think the body count was three or four), a little less swearing and a little better acting.  It is not a good film, however it does have a few redeeming qualities.  A friend of mine, who is a real estate agent and a collector, has a lot of stuff that he collects that is a little out of this world.  For example, the owner of the room where the action is take place has an ornate chest made out of silver with a brass band and a golden handle that runs around the top.  There is a silver bell on top of the chest, it can be stopped with a metal bar and a red ribbon with a silver medallion on it.  When it is first used the bell is set afire but the rest of the contents of the chamber are unscathed and the room is left a little worse for wear.  This has a few of the strangest names in the movie: "Pilot" is named "Falling" "Dracula's Daughter" is "Aquaman's Sister"   This is the only room in the house where it is mentioned that a dead woman has been placed in it. Apparently she was the wife of the guy who owns the house.  Another room has a brass bed with a small headboard with a hook over the top and an antique chest, a lamp and a cupboard with two chairs.  At the end of the movie the director is asked by the owner how many times he can burn the chest.  He replied, "once I burn the whole thing."   The director then says, "Let me try that. I want you to come down and have a look. If I can burn it a second time, you can't burn the rest!"   I was really excited to see the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people consider "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" one of the great Hollywood movies of all time.   Director Sergio Leone   is known for his beautiful Westerns, but he does this one in the most classic style possible.  If you liked "The Godfather," this one might make you think twice about the "bad boy" stereotype.  But, if you don't, this movie has plenty of action and a great soundtrack, so you'll probably have a blast.  There are a few small spoilers in the movie, so I'll just say this:  It's the "good" half of the Good, Bad, & Ugly trilogy.

It is certainly the most realistic movie of this year. The characters are very realistic.

I have seen more than a few movies this year and this is the only movie of the bunch that made me laugh and feel sad at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are too many excellent films to list, but in the interests of being comprehensive, this is one of the best:  A simple story about a man who is unable to accept death.   It's a short film, but is a real gem:  There is no dialogue, no dialogue at all. Instead, each character uses their body language to tell the story.  There's no action in this film, so it's not a high-speed chase (though there is a car crash in the middle), and there's no dialogue to indicate that the film is not real.  Instead, it's an intimate, beautiful, and quiet story about grief.  This is the only film I've seen in which the characters are not the same person from beginning to end.  The film is shot with a sense of place and time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never been very good at horror movies, and I've gotten very good results with all the "revelations" I've seen in the recent horror film festival season.   The movie does a fantastic job of playing the "crowd" aspect of these films, but it doesn't have much going for it otherwise.  I'm not a fan of the music either, which is pretty generic for this type of horror movie, so if you like to hear it in an old fashioned horror movie then you'll probably enjoy this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found myself in a pretty good movie that is not to be missed. It's about a couple that's divorced that go to a little fishing hamlet on the South shore of New Jersey in New York State and on a visit to the old lady's place they discover a really cool fish which they think is the real deal. The real deal is really a really ugly brown fish with a really long, long, and scary face that doesn't move. Then the fish is dead and the couple realize that their old lady died of an embolism in her brain and they have to figure out a way to get the fish back to the lake. So they start an elaborate story to try to get to the head of this fish and in the process they have a really neat sequence that involves some other weird critters and some other pretty good acting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hi  !   Hello ! We're back with another movie about the great and good, with a new soundtrack. We start at some unknown time in the future: a young boy named Paul (Erik Karlsson) has gone to see a doctor, and finds that his head is full of tumors. The doctor asks Paul to be brought to the nearest hospital, where he finds out that the tumors are causing him horrible pain. But, of course, he doesn't want to go. In fact, he's quite happy about it, until a new case arrives.   The patient is a young girl named Alice (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and is being brought back to her father's house in Sweden. Her father doesn't like her, as she's got a bad family background, and is a bit crazy.  What's more, her mother has recently died, and her step-father doesn't seem to care about her.  But she's not the kind of girl to forget about a bad life.  When Paul sees her, he wants to help her, but doesn't know where to get help from.  One thing is certain: something must be done!   In fact the two have a lot in common: the boy has a lot of medical problems, the girl has a hard life, and they both want to get out of this strange situation.  They go back to the future, where there are some very strange medical experiments going on, some of which are a little bit more violent than usual.  This film does a great job of showing how much things can change in a very short time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie after my grandmother passed away (a wonderful woman who loved my brother and sisters and loved to laugh).   When I first saw this movie I was in shock that this woman was so young. I knew nothing about this woman, but that does not stop this movie from being very good.   The movie starts out as a "What-The-Hell-Do-I-Do" movie.  Then, things take a turn as we discover that the family had a child (a boy named Jack) in the past who was not like the rest of them.  He is very sensitive and has trouble with the way the other children play and he has trouble getting along with the other boys.  The family are very happy when Jack begins to play and the rest seems happy too.  Now, things have changed and the father has a new wife and the other boy seems to be much like Jack is.  Finally, a new problem comes up as a young boy (the boy's real name is Michael) has the same problem of being unable to play with the others (a problem that seems to bother him all the time).  After the rest decides that the boy is to blame, the father takes him to the local mental hospital to be looked at.  At first I found this to be a very weak story line, but then it gets better.  After all of this, Jack is sent back home, but he is no longer as sensitive and the people in the neighborhood are not the same as they were before.  This story takes a turn for the better, and is now very well acted and directed.  I was very impressed with this movie. If you love these type of stories, I can highly recommend this movie, especially if you are a person who is tired of the same old story.

I love the idea of a man jumping over a truck, landing in the water, and the ensuing scramble and rescue. I'm also a big admirer of the good guy's character. I thought this film had a great amount of heart, as the film showed us the lengths that we have to go to protect those we care about.   I loved the story. It's the good guys and bad guys. I had a wonderful time watching this film, and I hope to see more from this director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great idea, but the execution is weak.   The movie starts with a scene of two men sitting in a bar. One of them is a man of great character. He is a very good person, a good, decent man. He knows how to talk to women. He has a wife who likes him very much.  He is very honest, but he also has a strong character.  We meet him as he goes into the hospital, where he is dying.  But he is a nice man, very good at talking, and has a great deal of sympathy for his wife and children.  After he leaves the hospital he goes to the town, where they are having some problems.  Sooner or later the people have to find a man who can solve this problem.  They decide to go to the next town.  The town is in trouble because of the people who are stealing things from the store.  In the bar there is an old drunk who has been drinking a lot.  His wife is very upset, because he is making her worry.  And so she comes into the bar.  She is wearing a skirt, but is very drunk.  (The woman is shown wearing a nice dress and high heels.)  We see her getting into the car.  This is a good man.  It seems that she has been to see a doctor.  At the hospital we find out that she was sent to the hospital by her husband.  Then she goes to her husband's house.  Her husband is a fine man, who is a well respected member of society.  I like this good man, because I believe that he is the person who can finally solve the problems of his people.  When the town people come looking for this good guy, they find him in the street, where the old man is in a drunken stupor.  To this good character, the towners want a bribe.  While the people are talking to him, his wife is coming in from the bathroom.  My old friend has been drunk, so it's funny.  Eventually, he has to go into the house, and when he sees the old drunk, he says,  " Oh!  You must be the man I was talking about.  You are a good fellow."  But the old drunken man just doesn't know what to do.  Finally the good man walks out of the house and gets into the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a child I didn't watch horror movies very often.   I had the luck of getting a free Halloween movie once from my dad.  The movie didn't look too great, but I was too young to notice.      The other kid who died was a very nice and funny kid.  I remember thinking it was cool that the kid's mom was a witch and the kid would die if the witch tried to use his spoons.  It was creepy that a person could die if someone put a bunch of spoons in his mouth.  The film ended with a nice little song by George M. Cohan.  George M Cohan wrote many horror songs in the 80s and 90s, including a few songs that I liked.  This song is not my favorite, but the song is really nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The cast and crew of this is one of the greatest in the history of cinema. The director, Walter Hill, did such a brilliant job on this one that it's as if the first time that you see it is the very first time you saw a film.   Hill's artistry, acting and cinematography all come together to create a film that is unlike any other.  The acting is just as strong as the acting. There's a lot of character development and the story just keeps getting bigger and bigger.  In addition to all the wonderful acting, there are plenty of great moments throughout the film. I just wish that I could find a copy of this in a decent video rental store.

It's a simple story about a little girl's life with her parents, and a young boy who is in love with her.  It has a really nice story, and at the beginning it seems as if this movie will be a simple, but beautiful story about the love of a child.  From there it becomes a pretty interesting story about someone with a problem and someone with great hopes, and it's very sad.  I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and I was sad, I think I laughed my ass off, and when I'm sad, it doesn't really bother me.    I found this movie to be pretty, and interesting, and sad, and so much fun!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last thing you want to do when you finish a movie is to sit down and wait for another.  It's a good story, it's funny, and it's fun to watch the people who make this movie react to things like "oh yeah, I saw that when I was young".  If you're not having a good time on this movie then you should go to the movies or go to a good theater and get a nice drink and a good film to keep your spirits up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this film was great.   This is a wonderful and poignant film about a group of poor, poor kids who play around a local church in North Carolina.  There is a beautiful sense of humour in the film, which, while the kids aren't very bright, is not very funny.  They get into all sorts of mischief and then, at the end of the film they run away from home to see the world and try to escape their poverty and it's very heart breaking.  This film was written and directed by Brian De Palma and it is well worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, I must say I am not a fan of horror films. I have no interest in it. Horror is not my style. But after viewing this film, I can see why people enjoy watching it.   It's a story about a woman who is obsessed with a demon that is after her life.  The movie is good and scary.  If you like horror films, I would recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An epic movie with loads of action scenes with a great soundtrack.   "I thought I was going mad, but I'm now glad I had a look, it was a truly exciting day and I don't know how it will end."   In short, a beautiful and unforgettable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is like a mix of "I'm a kid in a candy store," and "Babe, You're a Rich Woman."   I enjoyed both of these movies and am glad I saw this one.   The story is very simple and easy to follow. The characters are great and the movie has a nice look and feel to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with a man going about his everyday routine. As he goes about his routine, he receives a message from a woman asking him if he would like to go out with her for a few drinks. He replies that he will go out and see if she is worth it.   When they get to the bar, he orders a drink and then is asked to bring her back a glass of water. He does and after they have been together for a little while he asks her if she still feels the same about him. She replies that she does.  What I find to be a very enjoyable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the funniest comedies   I have ever seen   In a nutshell : the movie tells the story of a father that can't be arsed with his son's birthday party, so he invites the guys from a rock band, who are dressed up like clowns.   One of them is not only funny but is also very handsome, so the dad makes the band play for him.  A nice scene where the band plays to the crowd.  (In the end the father makes a phone call to get his son out of the clowns' hands)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So, after watching a film such as the one below, I was curious to see what happened next. After watching a similar film (The Night Out), I was impressed with how the people who were in it did not look out of place there. This time, they looked quite like regular people. So what's the problem? Well, there's just nothing much to talk about. There's not really much to the story. It's just a bunch of people in a night club. I thought the film was okay but nothing too special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the greatest of all the bad movies I've ever seen. It's bad for the fun that it gives, but it's good because of how well the performances are handled.   The story is silly but the acting is fantastic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last time I watched this movie was in the 80s when I was a kid. I loved it then, and I still love it today.   I think it's the only 80s movie that really makes me smile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky to be able to watch this movie on a dare when it was showing at a movie theater. It is a pretty good movie and I think it would have been better if the characters had been more developed and maybe it wouldn't have needed a movie at all.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a whole lot of good stuff in this movie and one of the things that's great about it is how well the movie pulls off the supernatural elements without losing sight of the more mundane elements in its story.   After some years of trying to get a group of young people together (including some old pals like me) to take on a supernatural event that was happening in the neighborhood in 1983, I'm actually glad that it did.  It's not nearly as good as the original The Exorcist, which is a real feat, but it's still very good.  The fact that the whole thing is so well-done is a good sign of how good the original is.  If you want to see a nice action flick that will also have you talking for a while, go see it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at the cinema and I loved it  .   It's so hard to find good films nowadays but this movie is a good one. It's a drama about a woman who, when pregnant, is forced into becoming a prostitute by her abusive husband.   When she has a run-in with the police, a policeman sees this woman working in an out of the way street corner and decides that this is her one chance to make a living by selling a little bit of herself.  The prostitute, an alcoholic who has suffered a bad childhood and a bad marriage, is able to give herself a face and make a good living because she has been given the chance to do something she knows how to do.  A great film with an amazing performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought that a good sci-fi film would happen. Well, it happened, and in a big way!   It's not like a classic - it's not a sequel to a classic (it's a remake - and a remake is always a good idea in my book).   The movie is not really about space travel, and it's about some people with problems who can't do anything about them, or so they think. The film is really a movie about family life, and about the struggles that each family member must face. It has a lot of very well-acted scenes and is very entertaining to watch.   So I say good job on a good remake of a good classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is a great example of what a film like this can do, when taken out of the context of a comic, there isn't anything particularly groundbreaking in the movie, and the only great idea it comes up with is that the evil supervillain wants a child's hand in marriage. He's got a kid with his daughter, but she's not his, and I don't think a kid should be given a hand-in-marriage to a grown-up, so the villain is really just looking for an excuse to beat the guy up, and that's the only thing of note the film does with it's story.   However, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's funny enough without being too on the nose, there is a lot of gags in it, and most of them are pretty good.  But it's the action that really makes this movie shine. The villain's car is almost a flying car, and he actually uses it in the end, which is a pretty big deal because you've seen a lot like that in superhero movies. The fight scene between the hero and the villain goes on for a while, and is very well done, there's one big jump cut and it goes off in an incredible way, and some of the things the hero does really do it for me, it's got an art-house feel to it.  I liked it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw The Last Airbender, I was struck by the sheer audacity of the story: an airbender who becomes a real boy? Why, no wonder the film looks so good!   The story of the film is one which has a lot of elements that are familiar in the way a lot children's stories work - as when Aang and Katara are playing, it was clear that they were both out of their element - but there is something extra that really works here.   The story is told in a rather simple way, and in that simple way is a lot more expressive than most other stories we've had in recent years - there are a lot less "explosions" in this story than in most, and this is perhaps one of the reasons why the film feels so fresh; it is the kind of story you could tell to a child and they wouldn't have to ask "why are they going into the water?"   Although the story has a strong and interesting beginning, the film does a great job of building to the story, which is a bit of a mixed bag in a number of areas. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So... I love this movie. This is a fantastic film about an interesting and flawed man.   It's a film that is based on the life of Joseph Conrad, the famous writer who was born in Paris in 1869.  He studied German at the Sorbonne, then joined the French Foreign Legion. He served in the Russian Civil War, the Napoleonic Wars and later moved to New York where he began writing novels.  In the 1930's he returned to France, and became a very successful author, who has been translated into more than a dozen languages. He wrote one of his most famous novels The Secret Agent, which is the basis for the movie.  This is not just a great film. It is a good film. Conrad's life is not a well-told story.  It was a difficult life for Conrad, and there are a lot of twists and turns.  Conrad spent a lot more time in prison, than he did in Hollywood.  The acting in the movie is outstanding.  There are plenty of scenes in this film that really get under your skin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As someone who doesn't enjoy horror movies at all and rarely see a good one at least once, I was really surprised to see a film called Nightmare On Elm Street   directed by Wes Craven and that he wasn't going for cheap jump scares like most of the times.   The film was scary, creepy, creepy and a little bit funny (to me that was the most important part)   In a nutshell, it was a well made movie, the cast were all good and very likeable (although they didn't have much to say) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are several things I like about this movie: a) The movie takes place in the 60's (although it is set in the 80's) b) The guy playing the "The Mayor" is good looking c) The music is pretty good and there are some really great, dramatic moments d) The plot is good and the movie ends well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a wonderful comedy about a spoiled rich kid that finds a new girlfriend.   The movie itself is not bad but it has it's share of problems like the annoying guy that tries to get a movie made.  And the ending just...    (view spoiler)   It's a movie that makes you laugh but it's not one that will make you cry. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An old timer like me has seen a lot of bad movies: The Blues Brothers, Ghostbusters, Rambo, Aliens, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, the Godfather series, and The King's Speech...   It's not that bad: a good old-fashioned heist movie, with lots of comedy, and a nice, funny cast of characters.   The plot: a bunch of guys go to the hotel where the owner of a local casino lives. The owner is the richest man in the area, and when one of his men goes missing, the police are looking for him.  At first the hotel owner is trying to get away from the police, so they get him into a car. A guy then appears, and the robbers get into a big gunfight with the police.  He ends up getting away, but the police soon find him, and he is brought back to the police station.  At the police headquarters, one of the other men is trying very hard to get a confession out of the owner, but there is no way of getting in, so he decides to get in and run off the next day.  There is a sequence where he goes off to do so, and it goes terribly wrong. He gets arrested, and taken to the hospital.  When he is discharged, he decides that he is going to get revenge on the police for what happened.  But he needs to get to the casino in the morning so he can get the money.  It is all done very fast, and is a lot like the movie version of The Blues: a lot funny, but you never know what is going on.  I think this is a good thing: the police get in trouble, but it's not a big deal. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is as you would expect from a movie about a group of young college students that go on an adventure to a new country. The story is told well and the acting is good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen several movies of this style before.   There is a plot that is basically just a plot in a movie.  For me, this is not a very good movie.   I do not like movies where there are so many "scenes".   What I like is the simplicity of the plot, and this movie is very simple.    A simple plot is not very complex in itself.  I was never really interested in the characters and I never cared about the plot.  The plot is very predictable, and the movie really suffers from being predictable.  My main problem with this movie was that it does not really work.  There are very obvious plot holes in this movie.     Rating: 3.0/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love The Dark Knight. It is the best. It isn't as good as Tim Burton's version of Batman, which I liked very much (though a tad on the scary side) and that has a lot to do with the way the film is shot. The Batmobile and Bat-Batar are amazing, the Bat-suit is great, and it is the movie that started the Batmen craze. I think there is one other movie that could be on the list, but that movie is Batman Begins.   Batman is so much fun to watch. It has so much action and it's a lot of fun. It would have made a great sequel to Batman Forever, but it is too much fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the idea of the aliens coming to earth and starting a war, you should like this.   The movie has some action scenes that are good, it's about an alien named Zuckuss that gets a mission to find out why a small town has gone nuts and a group of local farmers.  It does start to get a little goofy at a few points, but I kept watching.  The alien is a good villain for the movie.  What I like best about this is that it ends on a cliffhanger, so there is a future film that I have no idea where this film is heading. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As someone who has seen pretty much every James Bond movie ever made, I can say that there is not a single Bond movie in the series that can compare to Goldfinger.   From start to finish it's great fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I've seen all of the movies and television shows on this list (and probably many more that I didn't see) and it's pretty much all pretty darn good, not only from a historical perspective, but also a cultural one.   It's a combination of the best of classic Western films, such as "Cimarron: The Legend of the Lost Journey" and the "The Rifleman," (both from 1952), along with the best "Westerns" since the days of the "Pawnee" and "Buffalo Bill" series, such the "Old West Gunfighter," (1959), the "Obituary" (1960), and the even more old-fashioned "Wolverine" (1959).   There's not even a little romanticism here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The movie is set in the 1920's and a little girl named Lucy (Clara Bow) is the child of a rich man (Cedric DeLong) and a poor woman (Rose DeWitt). One day the poor woman has a severe accident that leaves her with severe brain damage and she can't remember anything for a while. It is not until one day she goes to church that she remembers her name. When the priest brings the baby to the house the woman asks, "Is it my name?" and then suddenly there is a great explosion and everyone runs to the window. She tells the priest that she washes her hands in the kitchen sink but the whole house shakes and there is smoke coming out of the kitchen window. Suddenly all the women in the house disappear and it is then that the father comes home and sees that his daughter has vanished. After being told about the fire in the family house the father takes a good look at his daughter and decides that she must have run away and he finds her by the railway tracks. He then realizes that there must be some kind of a monster hiding in the woods and he goes out to the woods to search for her.   The story is full of strange happenings and the movie was written for children and so the movie is quite easy to follow.  At the beginning of the movie one can tell that this is a child oriented movie and not all that difficult to watch.  There is no gore and there are no big monster fights (like many films of the time).   It has a very sweet and touching story and it shows that people really did get along even in those tough times of the Great Depression. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a movie that will leave you thinking about the future of our world. I don't know whether that is good or bad. It is important to the future, but for us, the viewers, I don' t know if this movie can move us too much. It does move us in a sense that the world may not be as bad as we thought.    If you are looking for a movie to see at the movies, it is a good choice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not expecting a movie to be that good. This movie gives you all the emotion, tension and suspense that a good horror movie should have. It gets so intense when the zombies get around and come out on you that you have to get out of there as fast as possible or you will die. The zombies have a sense of style, the characters have a life. The writing is so good that the movie never becomes boring.   This is a movie that you must see at least once in your life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a diehard horror fan you should definitely watch this. The premise is simple enough: a small town is terrorized by the strange sounds of a child playing in the woods. A mysterious man stumbles upon the child, and as he is trying to talk to the child he loses his own life. As his final words tell him to hide or he will be next, he is taken by the child into a dream-like world. He can do nothing but watch as his father's corpse rot in the swamp. After his father dies, his mother tells him to go home and get ready to meet his grandfather.   However, as the sun sets and the darkness approaches, the boy sees a strange young man approaching him with a lantern, a hatchet in his hand.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when it came out in the mid-90's. I had no idea what to expect. After seeing the trailer I was worried, and not because it was a horror movie. In fact, I was relieved. The trailers for this movie said it was "The movie that scares you half to death" and I wasn't scared at all. The movie had no monsters in it; just a guy walking down the street. I think I got over the scares in about 10 minutes. It was just a bunch of guys hanging out, talking, and having a good time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie.   It is set at a beach resort, and the whole story revolves around a group of friends, whose relationship is going bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film about a boy who is going through a phase where he is interested in a girl he meets on the bus - who is a very beautiful, blonde, and very young girl called Julie.   As I said earlier, Julie and the boy become friends as the boy becomes sexually interested in her, and they also become friends because they both like Julie's good looks, and want to make sure her boyfriend doesn't see how much they both adore him.  As they become friends, the boy shows Julie his collection of pornography, which includes images of nude women, who are obviously meant to look like he is looking at pictures of Julie. As a girl, Julie seems to be aware of the boy's interest, which leads her to become jealous of the relationship they have, and also to become a bit resentful about him - not as much because he's acting so selfishly and selfishly acting as if he doesn't want her to know that he likes her, but she's also a bit jealous that he gets to see other people's women in such a way.  I found this film to be pretty straightforward, and even though it seemed to lack anything unusual, I was very interested in seeing what was going to happen next in this story.  The screenplay was quite good, with the only problem being that at one point the girl seems to think that the boy has become attracted to her, which would make the film a lot more interesting if that were not the case - it wasn't too hard to picture that the girl would become very upset by that development.  There was a lot of kissing in this film - but I didn't find it to be anything special.  In the end, the movie had a kind of emotional depth to it, and a sense of humor as well, which were both welcome, and which kept me watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a year that was so unkind to his career, Robert Altman, as we all know, comes to life with his masterpiece, a beautifully crafted tale of the heartbreak of a single, lonely father and the love between a mother and her troubled child.   This is a picture postcard of a place:  I am so glad to say that it is no longer here.  It is a time machine, and in this world we've become so detached that the people who live and work around us are mere shadows of the people we used to know.  One day, a young boy is wandering the streets of a small town. A little girl follows him, but soon the child turns a corner to see her father walking past her. This father, the one who had taken the little girl in and fed her every meal, is walking in the opposite direction and stops abruptly, facing her.  We're in the middle of the story, but not the beginning.  You do not see that the father has left the girl, but rather the little boy looks back at the father's face.  That's when the little one is born.  A year has passed, but the little child is only nine months old.  The little boy's mother has a difficult life. She is a prostitute. The little girl comes to her home at night and lies in the bed and sleeps.  But she is not happy, and the woman does not know why.  All the people in the town are sick and dying, and one by one, the men are dying.  And the woman is lonely.  Then the father comes back.  He tells her that the town is dying. The town is not dying, but in an effort to save the town, he has bought a large tract of land to build a new town on, but he doesn't have the money to pay the people to work there.  In the town's present state, only those who own property can live there. But the old town of this man, who is old, is going to become his new home.  There are a number of people to help the young mother to raise the child, but a number are going to lose their homes.  As the old woman and her son move to the new town, and their lives change forever, the father is still holding her hand as they begin the journey.  "When I get to the top, I'll take you with
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent documentary.   The documentary is an in depth look at some of the most well known figures from the American civil rights movement:  One of the best things about this film is the interview with Martin Luther King.  King speaks about his experience, and his role as an activist. King talks about some of his many victories.  After being jailed, and forced to move to Texas, King was able to get his name in the news. His voice was the voice of the people of his times.  You can tell the film will be a landmark event in the history of race relations in America. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great and very funny. The story was fun and the acting was very good.   The movie starts out with a very interesting story of a group of people who are going to take a trip down the Mississippi. They arrive at the destination and the guy in charge tells them it is not safe. They say they will leave and they say they are never going back. The next morning they say good-bye to the hotel and they head out to the river where they are attacked by water buffalo. The first buffalo attacks the guy who is trying to help the group. The second buffalo attacks him and then all three of them attack the rest of the group of about thirty people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, let me say that I absolutely adore this movie and love the whole storyline. I've watched it a few times now and I'm still very interested.   It's very well done.  I think it has a story that has a lot going on but is wrapped up very neatly and the characters are all very well developed.  There is a nice bit of comedy and suspense and the ending is very well handled.  As for the cast, I thought they all did well.  With regards to the special effects, they are very good, and I was really impressed with how well the characters were handled. I like that they didn't use a lot of CGI and gave them all real human faces. I hope this isn't too long, but I really like this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the spirit of the movie of the same name (directed by Alfred Hitchcock) I watched this film on an empty train from London to Manchester, in a scene which seemed to take place during the American Civil War. A small, very old, very poor girl from West Yorkshire has come to England with her husband and her one-year-old daughter to take advantage of the great advantages of being born in a small town. Unfortunately her husband has died recently and she has no one who can take care of her young daughter. At first her husband seems to be dead but later he says he is only ill and he is going to get well. I liked this movie because it was good fun and it left me wanting more. It was a good old time story about a girl who wants to make money by writing about life in the countryside in a rural town. There is one scene where the little girl, who is the main character, goes into a room where there is a woman who is having an affair with the man who killed her husband. It makes me think of a scene in The Blue Angel (1945) where a woman is having a sexual relationship with a man who is trying to kill her. It could be something of a sequel to The Man Who Knew Too Much (1943) when the same man kills a young girl who goes to London and marries another man.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this movie for many years because I had lost interest in it. I am sure I have seen it in movies in the past.   The movie is about a man who is going through hard times, he finds his son and he starts getting really close to him.  But then the boy gets sick and he wants to see him, the son is in a coma.  The mother decides to call on a psychic who is able to get a message from the dead, in this message the dead guy tells his wife that she should stop talking about the dead man and to find him before it's too late.  At first it looks like the mother will do this.  It is not all that she thinks, there is someone else that is looking for the dead brother.  Eventually the son comes back to life, and he has a terrible dream about the guy who is chasing the mother.  That's when the psychic comes to the scene.  I found it to be a very interesting movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only way to describe this movie is 'an interesting ride'. With its '80s feel, this is a movie that you can't help but love. It really makes you feel as if you're a teenager.   A film that captures the essence of a very specific time in pop culture and time in general. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll try to make this quick and easy to understand. The movie opens with a series of black and white still images showing us an ordinary day at the school. When we see the movie's first flashback we see a very close up shot of a boy walking into his room. He takes off his glasses, opens the window, sits down on the bed, and looks at the ceiling. The boy is not looking up, not really looking at the image. He is in his room, the first image is a blurred view of his room that looks normal. We then cut to a long shot of his bedroom. We see the boy's room, it is a good room, with lots of things on the walls and a comfortable bed. However, the boy has left his glasses on the chair. We come back in the first flashback and the boy comes into his office. The office is normal, there are papers everywhere, and a computer is in front of a desk. But, in the background the boy is sitting in his chair, looking at his computer. We cut to the boy on his bed, looking into the computer monitor and then back to the chair and his bedroom (where we see another close up of his glasses and the bed). We see a blurred image of a child in the image (but a clear one of the chair) and then the boy goes to bed. The night comes. The lights go out. The bed shakes and we see images of the boy waking up and talking to himself. We are now in the third flashback, and the day is normal again. But we are now back in school. We look at the window and see a bright light outside. We turn on the lights and see images in the windows, the school being flooded with light. We go back to our school, and it is normal once again. It is day again.   The movie is really an interesting watch.  There is no real exposition about the plot, and we don't know how the boy will react to the events that have taken place. But I like this movie.  It does have some of the qualities that I like in a good drama:  - the story is well constructed, and has a real sense of urgency.  - we feel that the story will never end, and each moment is an anticipation of something new.  The only thing I did not like about the movie was the lack of subtlety, or the use of dialogue. It was

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a fairly simple one; a group of friends are out hunting the big bad wolf in the woods and end up in a fight. It's a decent enough movie as the story is simple and it has a good story telling. The movie also has some good monster makeup and effects and there is even one great sequence where they all go out to hunt the wolf and it ends with a chase scene. There are a few times when the film feels like it gets a little too long and a little over budgeted (although the budget was low by modern standards), but it's still a good time with great monsters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only way to describe this movie is as the first "Mommie Dearest" meets "The French Connection".   A young man has an unrequited love affair. It's all a mystery until the very end when he gets shot in the shoulder. It was a very good movie.   It's so good, that there is little hope of making it more than a cult classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun, well-paced, and enjoyable movie with a nice score.   In the past two movies I have watched, they have taken their time on all aspects of the movie.  This time however, the actors and actresses moved really quickly to tell the story, the acting was good, the script was solid, and the movie was entertaining and funny.  I'm impressed by this movie, and I hope the director can keep up the good work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this film deserves to be called one of the great movies of all times. It has all the ingredients needed to make a good story, but at the same time, has an innovative approach to the story, in that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a great mix of comedy, drama, action and romance.   While I was watching it, I was really feeling the emotion that was conveyed through the characters and I was laughing out loud at everything that was happening.  This film has really gone down in history, as one of my all-time favorite films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this is an example of the new school movie genre where you get to see the whole movie at once without skipping any scenes or having to see an intermission (that's a real shame, that scene alone took me a good twenty minutes to watch!). It takes the old-fashioned technique of two actors playing opposite each other (with no dialogue at all) and uses it to great effect with the actors playing their respective parts very well. They aren't on-message but play off each other very well and it's very enjoyable watching them at their best. I can't say much about the rest of the movie, other than it's not bad and it has a very good cast, but it does make me want to see a little more of this movie.

It's got all the things I look for in a good old-fashioned film:  - A great score:  (There are a couple of times when it seems that the music is being used in the wrong part of the picture-- I thought the climax of the scene was going to be a nice dance party, but it was a beautiful scene with a good dance beat.)  - The good old fashion kind of romance, with strong female characters who don't give a crap.  - An entertaining movie, which has a strong plot with an interesting hero.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's all about one woman, Rose Wilson (played by Eva Green). Rose is a retired schoolteacher, and has been working at her local school for 30 years. It is the middle of the night, and Rose's life is filled with memories and love. Rose is in bed with a very rich, very beautiful man (played wonderfully by Michael Fassbender). The man is the father of a child Rose has not seen for many years. The boy is in the same class with Rose, and they have a special bond. The young boy has a brother, too. Rose wants to have a child of her own, but the father has other plans for Rose. The father does things to Rose that would drive most people to the brink of madness. Rose falls in love with the boy, and realizes she wants to spend her life with him.   Rose's story is one that has stuck with me from the first time I saw the movie. This movie has a great deal of heart, but it also has a very complex and believable story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have no words to describe how awesome this movie is.   The movie is funny and has a good storyline.  The lead is the typical movie nerd.  He goes to a comic book shop to buy a book.  When he gets home his mother is not happy that he is reading too much comic book. She tries to stop him but he has to go to the comic book store.  So he runs around and tries to find the comics the shop owner is selling.  Then there are other characters in the comic store. They are there to help the nerd but they are really there to stop the nerd.     When you see it you will laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am still having a hard time believing that The Dark Knight Rises has been viewed more than 2 million times. The film is excellent. The movie tells the story of a small town in Kentucky that is threatened by a group of drug runners. While the town is at its wits' end, a young boy from the town comes to the aid of the town. I'm not sure who is stronger in the film; the heroes who are outwitted by a bunch of thugs or the boy who is outwitting them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is good in a good way. I don't think I've seen a movie with such a good score as this.

The script is very solid and I'd suggest that you watch it before reading the review. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scene is a very tense, well-written scene and a great introduction to the main story line. We are introduced to our lead character, Michael, and are given a few of his more noteworthy traits: he is a man of little words and often looks nervous; he does not speak much; he is not particularly strong physically; and his body language is very bad. However, he is extremely intelligent. It is also important that we are introduced and introduced quickly, as Michael is a poor student and has no prospects for the future. I like how Michael takes advantage of his limited opportunities by being clever, sly, and charming. The characters are likable; the plot moves along; and the ending is well-constructed.   A movie for fans of good movie acting:  As mentioned earlier, the characters are good. Most of them have good body language, so there are no awkward pauses and the dialogue is well performed. I had some problems with Michael's physical condition, and he is usually awkward and seems to be struggling with some of the more awkward parts of his life. I found his body posture to be stiff and awkward, and although I understand the need to keep Michael as a male as far as the movie is concerned, it seemed to me that his character needed a little more strength and the addition of more character development. Michael's mother is also very interesting, as she is not a typical mother and is a bit of a diva who gets her way and is tough and cold. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the film after being in a theatre for a couple of years when a local film theatre changed its title to this. This is a good old fashioned, straightforwardly good, old fashioned western. It is definitely a time in America, with its lack of women and social conventions. This movie is a typical western, with the hero's story set in the middle of a desert. The main character has a broken leg, and travels through the desert with a horse and horse-drawn buggy. He and his friend, a bounty hunter named Jack (a bit of a cartoon figure) travel a dangerous route, encountering bandits, a bandit leader, and other encounters along the way. It has a western feel to it, but the humor is quite dry. This was an entertaining watch and a nice change of pace from the often melodramatic westerns of the time. I have seen this one a few times and enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen some movies before (notably, the remake of 'Tropic Thunder' with a different director and more interesting actors). But this one was by far the best I've watched so far.   This is a serious, suspenseful, and stylish film.  This movie has some great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and is very, very good!   It's very much a "theater of the mind," with its dream-like plot, and a few interesting elements in the story (and its setting).   Some of the other elements, such as the special effects, and the costumes (including the girl's clothing that was a little too sexy for a movie about a little girl), are nice, but aren't the main attraction.  It isn't a particularly good film, but it is a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good flick, but not really the kind of movie that will make you say, "Hey, the best action movie I've seen in years." This is more of a high octane action movie that works well, but it's not really that exciting or unique. The story is pretty basic, there's a guy who can go over a hundred miles an hour with little effort. There's a big explosion, the guy gets his ass whooped, and then there's another explosion. I guess this would be an action movie if all the action scenes were actually like this one, but they're not. There are also some really bad CGI (at the very least they are bad), and an over-the-top villain that could have been written off as a joke.   I like the movie, it's fun, but I'm not sure this movie is worth your time.

There's something about Gats by that point in the film that's almost magical, but it's not easy to capture that magic. There is such a lovely sense of mystery in the story. It's all so different and so interesting that it's hard to not be caught up in it.

The English, however, have big ears and big noses - as well as big chests and big chests - and they speak with a sort of Cockney accent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The greatest film I ever saw," wrote Vincent Canby in the New York Times   In the opening scenes, the protagonist is shown on a subway car, staring into a mirror with his hair cut short.   What's odd is that this is the same scene in which a young Vincent Van Gogh first cuts his hair and draws his self-portrait, but in this case the image isn't the image.  In a film that combines the surrealism of Salvador Dali with the drama of The Old Man and the Sea, director Robert Bresson presents us with a vision of a modernist landscape that's all the more gorgeous because its surroundings have been stripped of any recognizable features:

He knows how to get rid of the drugs, so he doesn't need to, and he doesn  In the film ``Dawes Creek`` the titanic and iconic character of the titularity, Mr. Dawson (David Alan Grier), who is an honest and good looking young man, and a hard worker who works hard to keep himself out of the local crime syndicate and out of jail. Dawson is the only person to keep his eyes and ears open to the local and national news while on the outside doing his own good deeds. One night he witnesses a robbery, and while Dawson is distracted by a car with no headlights, a gunman runs up and shoots the poor Dawson dead.   The film has a story about the corrupt and evil of the drug culture that is rampant in America. Dawson and his friends and family have to deal with the drug problem, and even though they don't condone drug use, they are the ones who have to clean up the messes. Dawson wants to clean the streets of drugs, and wants to have a successful life. His only dream is to have his own real estate company and have all the money that he could ever want. Dawson does everything the wrong way. He's too lazy to work hard and tries to buy everything instead. He does what he thinks is right, and yet, he makes the wrong decisions at the wrong time. Dawson's mother is very jealous of her son and he feels that his life is ruined because of this.   So what's the worst thing that Mr. Grier has done? What's the most he can't get past? It's getting too old for Dawson and he wants to die. Dawson can't deal with his problems anymore, but instead of being able to die peacefully, he has to be arrested by the authorities and put in jail. This happens because the drug dealers know that Dawson is on their side. The cops know that the drug dealer known as the "Crazy Uncle" is a very strong friend of the cops. So when the drugs are getting too strong for Dawson to handle, and Dawson's life is threatened, he goes along with them, but just enough to not lose his freedom.      So the drug trade is controlled by the drug lords who are the villains, and it

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm glad to see a film in which the hero does not have to kill innocent people for the sake of the "game", he doesn't shoot everyone and then "the game" ends, he is the one who "plays" and the "torture" is not as bad as in the movies,   It reminds me of "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers",   "Bobby", the main character, is "The King of the Game" and one day he finds out that the "King" has been killed and everyone in his kingdom is "sick" and he has to join "Auntie" and "Uncle" to "help" them to be normal.   In my opinion this movie is very similar to "The Lords of the Ring" and it's the best version of the first "Lord of the rings"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, my brother saw this film, and said he was "really excited to see a science fiction film in the mid-90s".   The film follows two "men in black" (in this case, "Sigourney Weaver") who are hired to assassinate a scientist (James Garner) with the aid of an assassin who "has no idea he's being hunted".  They do just that.   Well... the bad guys aren't quite as black and white as they look...   They are not so much "Sigs" as they are "webs", which is a bit like the "Ghostbusters" of the 90s.  They were an offbeat but lovable ensemble with a lot of wacky dialogue and lots of fun to be had.  The plot is quite interesting (especially considering that it took four "weeks" to finish), and even though the movie is over a hundred years old, there is some really good special effects (especially in the action scenes).   This is a fun movie, though not exactly "cult" in the sense that there is a lot that has been done with these characters in the last few decades (including a couple of good animated movies) which has not been seen in this film.

We have a hero who is very funny in his own way.  This is the most funny movie ever, ever.  One of the funniest lines I have heard in a long time is "Let's put out a press release about my mother."  I didn't understand what I was seeing when I watched it. It has a great cast, and it is a fast paced movie.  It was fun watching the car chase scenes, and seeing McQueen go from driving a Cadillac to a Pinto in a few seconds.  The car chase scene is like a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A pretty well-done movie that follows the true life story of a man who was a "pigeon" during the war, and later becomes a "pepper" and later a "rabbit" during his own war. I wasn't a "caveman", as the movie claims, but I did grow up in a family that used to keep rabbits all around the house. One day, a neighbor's bunny died (one of my brothers was the rabbit's "father"). A little boy came home to me, and asked me to "take care of it". I did. A while later, a little boy's mother came home, and wanted to "have a play" with the "cute little rabbit." So I did it. Then I asked my wife to see if she could get her pet to do something cute...and my wife tried it, and got a good laugh, too. But the rabbit (who didn't get to be a rabbit, of course, but then never was a rabbit) was sick, and I took it to a vet (a vet who was also a "chicken"). They both treated it, but the rabbit was never the same, and had no use for the "chick" who brought him to a playroom (a "playroom" that was also his playroom). He lived the rest of his life with me, not the most happy of things.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So there are all these things out there about how the U.S. government was very involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and many people still remember the scene of the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, being escorted out of Dallas on a stretcher by two military police.   I don't remember seeing this film when it came out but I think I might have seen it sometime when I was a kid.  I saw this as a kid and I remember being very surprised at what was happening in the movie and how the characters reacted.  At the time of the assassination, there was much talk about conspiracies. The most common conspiracies were that the CIA was behind the assassination and that there had to be some kind of military coup. However, this movie doesn't seem to focus much on those two.  They seem to have a hand in the death of John Kennedy but I don' t see them as a major part of it.  The movie also seems to go after the conspiracy and the CIA, but I'm not sure how much truth there is to that.  As a matter of fact, I haven't even seen all the other JFK movies, which I think might have had more to do with the assassination than this movie does. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot of different kinds of magic in this movie and it shows off a lot more different kinds than I thought I would. I was a little worried because there was a lot going on in this one and I thought it might end up being too long, but that didn't happen. There were a lot interesting plot points and a great cast of characters that all had their own special moments, which made it fun to watch. There was also a few really bad-ass lines in this, which are funny to hear when you think about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all honesty, the biggest disappointment in the movie was the lack of a real climax.   While the movie may have ended on a strong note, it really could have ended a lot better.  It seems the movie ended on one of those "I'm sorry I don't like you, you're not like the others" sort of scenes, when the whole world of the characters was trying to say goodbye to their friends, without really giving much of a thought to each other.  In general, the characters were all pretty shallow, and none of them had any kind of real depth to them.  The only character who really had a purpose was the main character, who was the star of the movie and in fact, the character that was most memorable in the whole movie.  But he had no real depth in his character at all, and really just felt like a stereotypical black-and-white character with the name Mr. Smith.  And this is even before we get into the fact that the movie just didn't have any real humor to it at all.  There was very little humor in the movies, and if you think about how much time was spent on the movie's "credits" sequence, it's hard not to laugh at it.  Overall, I found the movie to be pretty boring, and not really worth the time invested into it. However, if you want to watch a good story about a group of people working together to do good things, it might be worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Racing" movie is a masterpiece of cinema.   It is a perfect blend of racing, car crash and the beautiful Japanese culture.  It has no special effects, it is only a good old car crash with the music of Kishimoto.  This movie will bring a smile to your face and a laugh to your belly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the films by the legendary John Wayne.   In this film Wayne is back, in his final film before dying, in the role of "Old Snake" the old-time criminal who can't stop himself from trying to catch criminals, who gets caught once, then twice, then three times, before finally being caught.  But then he gets away again.  Wayne is still a top-notch leading man, a terrific actor who can really be funny, too, especially in his scenes with his friends and his wife, who seems to be a much more serious character than he seems.  This is one of those films where you don't really feel that Wayne died at all; his wife is still with him at the end, and his friends are still around.  And he isn't alone: his old friend "Bud" is there, as is his brother Billy, and their old school friend George "Slim" Gassner.  There are also other characters: the man who steals the woman's purse from her, a former boxer, and the young woman who wants to marry the man she's seen in a film, but can't because of his crookedness.  All the characters are portrayed in such a way that they aren't caricatures; the actor Wayne is quite capable of making them more realistic than they seem, and in the end all of them get their comeuppance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not been a huge fan of the first two films, as well as the first one in particular. However this one, with its wonderful soundtrack and gorgeous locations, is one of the best of the three and, while not exactly the biggest sci-fi epic of all time, it still manages to have a fantastic and impressive cast and I found it really cool, especially considering that I was never even a big fan of Sci-Fi in general. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was a remake of a British film of the same name with a remake director. The same British writer and director of the original, John Barry, is the director on this film. The original story is about a British soldier who is forced to marry a German girl. The first half of the movie shows the two soldiers getting along well and their families and friends seem to like them both. Then there is a long period of waiting for one of them to appear in the other's life. After the girl comes into the lives of the two men, the first one starts behaving in a strange and unpleasant way. It seems that he has an attraction to the girl and that he doesn't even want to know her. His behavior is becoming even more disturbing. There is some talk about the woman in his life. Her parents are very good to her, and there are people who look out for her. The second soldier is shown as having had a bad start in life. He is not happy with the family that is supporting him, but he is a decent man and a good soldier. He does his job well, but his superiors do not like him very much. He also does his duty well, as he saves the girl from an approaching German bomber. The movie ends with the second soldier falling in love with the girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this is a remake of a film I'm not sure I've ever seen before:  The story starts with a group of girls (with a man, who may or may not be a man).   The girls are at a girls' night in a club, trying to get some fun out of their night (i don't know the exact details, but they are all pretty out there).  One of the girls sees a man that she believes is an escort:  So it's a club with lots of different girls, dancing and having a good time.   They decide to try to have a threesome with a guy and another girl:  This is when things begin to get bizarre:  When the girl he believed was an escort starts talking about a guy named Billy Bong that she says is a wealthy man with his own private island, in the middle of the ocean, and that they have a lot of fun there.  Apparently Billy Bongs father (who looks a lot like my father) has died (which is weird since he died in the 70's when this film was made, he seems to be alive to now), and so the two girls decide to find Billy Bongo in hopes that he is a rich man too.  I don't care how many times I mention the other film, this film is pretty much the exact same, it's just different colors and an interesting plotline (not that it's not interesting, there are some interesting things going on in it).  A few weeks go by with the girls not being able to find out anything about Billy Bango (which I'm sure is just to make the movie more enjoyable, since the only character that's interesting in this film besides the girl that has a threaing with a man named Billy is the guy who wants to know who the girls are and whether they are friends or not), and then one of the women starts having a conversation with someone about Billy:  You know, I don 't really get the whole "you'll never find out about him, unless you look for him on his yacht" theme.  It's kinda funny if you like the films I've mentioned so far, but not as funny as the story would have been if the film had started off at the beginning.  But it gets really strange when the film jumps to the beginning and starts showing what the movie will be about.  One problem with this movie is the fact that there
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A brilliant movie from the director.   I am a HUGE fan of this director, he is amazing in so many ways, I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard, or so naturally and that is saying a lot, this movie will keep you laughing for days, I'm thinking I've seen it maybe 7 or 8 times but every time I watched it I could not believe how good it was and the acting was just amazing, I loved it so much, this film is a must see and I will forever be a fan of Jef Storring's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was actually a little upset at first when this movie was released, because it seemed as though someone had a vendetta against the movie industry. But after watching the movie several times, I found it enjoyable. I think the movie did a good job of portraying a few very different characters in one great movie, and while it's not exactly my type of movie, I can recommend it to those who don't like action movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to say that I saw a film with two very distinct strengths: a superb acting, and an excellent plot. The actor who plays Mr. Stromberg, John Hurt, is an exceptional actor, and he shows a lot of range in playing this part. He's not one of those people who is simply a good actor, but instead he plays the role with real depth and depth of character. I'm a bit confused by some of the characters in the film - particularly the policeman who has a rather odd and peculiar personality. But Hurt makes them all seem real and interesting. The film begins with a rather simple tale of a murder and the murder of an innocent bystander. However, the audience is soon thrown into a series of plot twists and a bit of suspense. There's a lot happening in this film, and the film never loses its momentum. The plot is not very well developed, but the characters are all engaging, even when they're in the middle of a difficult or difficult situation.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to give a quick review on this movie.   There are several things that will make a good film: a good cast with great chemistry, a decent script with an ending that is unexpected and exciting.  The story about a man searching for his son's killer is an interesting one that I can see myself getting sucked into.  There's also a girl who has a very interesting personality and is very likable.  All of the characters in the film are fun to watch and I enjoyed watching the action.  One of the coolest things about this movie is the use of CGI, the way the monsters move around is really cool and really terrifying.  I will definitely be watching this one again for the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent movie. There is no way to say anything bad about it.   It is a movie that I will not forget in my life.  The acting is a little bit weak at times but not to much to make me upset.  I really liked the music, and I believe that the movie looks better than the pictures.  So all in all a good enjoyable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good film that doesn't break any of the rules or even try. The movie is about a man whose dream of becoming a rock star is a big failure. He returns home to find his old friends have gone into the business for real. This is the story of a bunch of goofballs who were in rock band at a young age and never really did anything special. The group had a bad one and a good one.   The film's story is based around how a bunch friends make a bad rock band and are not that good at it. The friends are a lot like the guys in The Boys in the Band. They get into a lot of trouble and they start to wonder what their real purpose is. The film is funny and has a lot more laughs than it has laughs. It has a good story and some nice music but I would not consider it a masterpiece. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I heard of this movie I thought that this would be one of those weird, silly, fun, and weird movies about a bunch of guys playing in a snow castle in the middle of a desert in the 1960's.  It is exactly that.  But there is more to it than that. When a group of friends (including Paul Newman) gather in a little cottage for the winter, they find an old book in the attic which appears to be a collection of sketches by the late artist, David Hockney.  The book is really more of a collection books and drawings about different objects that people can't get enough of.  One of the drawings is of a huge snow castle.  Another is of an enormous snowman.   But the real interest of the book is in the characters.  Hockny's drawings of the snow castle and snowman are as bizarre and wonderful as anything one can imagine.  They even appear to be in some way connected to Hock's life story.  There is also a story about a mad scientist who creates creatures out of snowballs.  After all these odd drawings there is also the book's conclusion.  I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie. The story is solid and it was an emotional film for me, with lots of funny moments and memorable moments.   It is like a movie about two people who fall in love, and how they become like brothers in love. They go through all their emotions and the best part is how they start to fall in each other's arms, and are happy to see each other everyday, and even though it is a romantic story, it is not a depressing one. The writing in this movie is top-notch and well, just listen to the music. It is funny, but also sad, and that is something to remember this film by.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm just a bit too old to feel all that "old" when I get to see this.   The original movie was about a young woman (Meryl Streep) who had gotten a job as a "secret agent" and was in a dangerous situation.  I don't know how much was in the original movie.  This new version of the story seems more like a romantic comedy starring Meryl Streeps and George Clooney than anything.  My mom watched the movie when she was about 11 years old, and she says that the old girl was not good at her job, and I think it's pretty true.  She would always get lost and forget her way around the city.  Clooney is a good actor, and Streep is quite good in the part.  It was fun to see Streeps as the woman who always gets a bad guy, and Clooney as the man who always ends up looking stupid.  The movie is about how the two meet, and how their work together begins to change her.  But it wasn't bad, or a very good movie. It's just a fun romantic comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've had a lot of fun with this movie. This is a wonderful comedy/drama about a guy who is trying to find his soulmate (which is a theme in a lot o the movies) who is also in the habit of taking baths in a sauna. He takes a saunas with a woman, who is a dancer and tries to discover who is the "real" dancer. He ends up going to a bar and meeting a woman who gives him the answer.   The movie is wonderful, but there is no denying that it is a bit silly.  For a man trying to get a woman he goes to a saucer bath house, which is really just a saver. It is very funny.  There are a number of funny moments, and the actors seem to enjoy themselves, but this is only the first half of the movie. After the first couple of scenes the story gets serious and the humor begins to wane.  The first half does have a few good moments.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an aficionado of Westerns, and I have always wanted to see them done justice. I've read a lot of them, and there's always a flaw that's hard to overcome. There's always something that goes wrong. You think the good guy will stop the bad guy, but there's a reason he's still bad. It's not always the bad guys that have flaws. The bad guys also have flaws, and they often need help from the good guys.   This is an excellent movie. I'm a big fan of Western movies, and this one stands out from the rest.

And the plot does have an interesting premise, that I was interested in as it progressed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Best Thing You Will Ever Do Is Die" (1982) is a very strange movie from a very weird guy. The film is about a doctor who gets his heart stolen by an alien entity and he must keep it safe in the most unusual ways: through the roof of a hospital building, on the top of a hill, in a tank, in his own body... In the end, the creature is killed by a woman and the doctor is reunited with his heart. The movie is about how weird the whole situation is.   The movie does make one funny line, the first one: "We're all dying in this body."   At the same time, the movie makes you laugh at some points, at other times, not so much.  It doesn't have a very good plot, a great movie and a very bizarre plot.  The characters are pretty bad as well. The story seems to be mostly made of clichés.  Overall, the story is kind of boring.  "You're a very odd man, Doctor."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   The whole family seemed to get along well as usual and the actors did a great job.  What I didn't like about this movie was that there were so many times when the characters just stopped talking and just stared at each other without saying anything.  And they were acting like they really didn't care either.  It was just weird to me.  I guess it is a family movie so I guess the kids weren't in danger, but it is still just weird.  Overall I liked this movie because it was good and the cast was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movies where you could see the potential early and the movie has many great scenes.   The first scene with the giant bug is brilliant, a nice change from all the action we've seen so far.  In the next scene the movie shows us the potential of the special effects of this film.  Here we see a giant bug that could easily have been the end of this movie.  The movie does a good job showing us that this bug is more than it seems at first, but it is still too weak in the first half.  Then we get to see a real monster.  This one was definitely the best scene in the movie. In this scene the insect has been separated from the giant giant bug.  It is not a good scene in this movie, it is an excellent sequence.  As far as monster action goes it is very good.  Unfortunately, this is not the best monster in the film. This time the monster is a giant scorpion.  I enjoyed this scene more than the previous one, it shows off the new effects of the film and how it could have been better.  If we were lucky enough to have a movie like this one the first time, then the second time will be a real treat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As of 2017, it's hard to find a new horror movie every few years that is as good or better than the original and as inventive as the sequel is. It's not really a sequel (or even an adaptation) but more of a spin-off. The idea was brilliant, the execution was impeccable and the plot is as ridiculous as it sounds. It has a great cast of characters, great pacing and a great story and for once, I can't say that I'm disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so sad to see it go. I was so excited to see this movie and so excited for the sequel.   It was a big letdown. It seemed to be in the mold of other "big screen" movies that were basically clones of the same old "dive into a lake and save the damsel in distress" story.  It's too bad that the director was fired after the film was released so he could go off and do a really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fine film that has a very good ending.   The film has a simple yet effective premise and follows it to the letter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie   - It's got that classic American noir feel   in the first half. There's this feeling of something big happening, but not in the right way.   As for the second half, it's the "Das Boot" of action films. You're looking at some of the greatest action sequences in cinema history here, with characters that move and fight like no other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As you might imagine, the movie has lots of problems, as a genre it can at times be very frustrating. But it's not all bad!   The story is actually quite interesting, and it's a little frustrating how the story isn't explained in great detail.   A great deal of the movie takes place in a rather claustrophobic environment, as it's surrounded by a large ocean. But then a good-sized monster breaks through, and there's a good battle to be had.  With all the bad things, I'm glad the movie wasn't so confusing that it's impossible to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie a lot, not because of the humor of the main character, but because of his personality. There's a lot of humor in this movie, and it's done in a clever, entertaining way.   What makes it funny is how the main guy just doesn't get it. He's so out of it, he doesn't even realize he has the hots for this one girl until he tries to kiss her. It's a little clunky and not very well written, but it's definitely funny and definitely the funniest part of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't been in a good film in a long time.   I am not a huge fan of these "tear-jerkers" - they always seem to get caught in some kind of plot contrivance and not get anywhere interesting, and I just don't get the appeal.  In this case, it's like a kid with a toy train in a big red wagon trying to get to Disneyland.  I know it's supposed to be fun, and it certainly was a bit of a giddy ride (aside from the train wreck), but it is a total waste of time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so happy when i found out that this movie is based on a true story and there is a movie being released about it in November!   It is a true life story, about an Indian immigrant to Britain who comes across a young girl living on the streets in the East End who is called the "Girl with a Pearl Necklace"   She has an uncanny knack of getting attention wherever she goes...especially when she wears a necklace that has her name on it!  We all have seen "The Thin Man", the movie starring Jeff Goldblum, or "Gremlins", or other horror films like "The Thing", "The Haunting" or "The Silence of the Lambs", but the real scary movie to come out of Britain in the past 10 years is "White Girl"      White Girl is about an 18 year old girl who is born in India, but grows up in a poor area in Manchester, England.   The film is not about an evil Indian male trying to destroy the British race, but about a young white girl who becomes fascinated by the ways of the Indian man.  At one point, she even takes a fake Indian ring from a shop and makes up a name for herself in Hindi, using her Indian name.  The girl is also intrigued by the many girls who live on the street, and becomes friends with a poor Indian woman who is known as 'Mumma'.   When White Girl meets the local Muslim shopkeeper, she sees a new and different side to a very old man. In fact, White Girl's friendship with Mumma and the friendship with the local Muslims will be the most striking contrasts in the film.  My only problem with the movie is that it isn't very good.  It has a lot of plot holes, and the ending isn't as good as it could have been.  If you don't like white girls, or want to see a movie that is good without any Indian references, then the movie doesn't deserve your time.  However, for those who want a good and scary movie that also has a good plot, then this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was never a big movie-goer before seeing this one. It seemed like every time I turned the TV on, I heard the voice of Walter Matthau (from "Caddyshack"). Now I know why: he is playing the bad guy in this movie.   While the movie looks like it is just a bunch of fun and hijinks, it has some dark undertones that I find very interesting.  The movie seems to have no sense of purpose other than to get people to laugh.  It's a shame that this movie is such a disaster:  Matthau's character doesn't even really make sense, and he just seems like he's saying everything that could possibly be said.  In general, the movie is very unfunny and unfiltered, with no discernible theme or any particular message.  This was the worst movie I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   I've not seen many horror movies from Japan, but this is one of the most creative, disturbing, and fun ones I've seen this year.   The movie has a very low budget, which is understandable if the production values are not quite up to American standards.  This movie has some great set pieces and a great cast of characters, with a few surprises and a few twists.  There's a lot to enjoy in this movie.  I'm not even sure if I'd recommend this movie to people who've never seen a horror movie before, but for fans of Japanese horror, this is the best horror movie to come out of Japan in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie in a long time. I think it's an amazing movie. It's like a time machine where we can see all the different parts of the world we didn't experience until recently. The film has a strong focus on relationships, and the characters in it are well portrayed. The animation is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm always a bit shocked when I see people talk about how great a movie this is, because it's really just a great movie.   The story is interesting and there's a ton of great scenes in here, but the acting is so good, you're not really noticing the characters.  But what really made this movie so good was the musical score!   With it being a movie about a man who gets his memories back, it was fitting that the musical soundtrack was done by the amazing Jerry Goldsmith (he actually plays a great guitar).   And just like in this movie, it's amazing when a great band comes along and do a song. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half is probably the most beautiful thing in the movie. You're on a cliff and in a beautiful place.   And the film is really good and beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of the film is just as exciting as the first. The second half is a bit like a flashback. The plot is that a girl wakes up one day and decides to try to get the best of the 'trouble' of being a little girl and to be able to make herself useful. I haven't heard this before. I didn't know that a little thing could be so interesting.   I found it entertaining and I don't know what's going to happen to her or why she has to change.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie from the beginning, with some twists and plot twists that I am sure you will appreciate as well. I like the fact that it is set in a prison. I also like the idea of a secret agent and a double agent working for the same person.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot, although the story seems to have an unusual amount of twists, and the acting was very good.   The movie is about a girl who has an obsession for a doll who was the same age as her when she died. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been looking forward to watching the new James Bond movie since I watched the "Casino Royale" when I was ten. It's always a treat when Sean Connery is in a movie. He is a very versatile actor, but he is especially good in "Dr. No" because he takes on a very dangerous job and is forced to deal with many different kinds of people, from Nazis and madmen to terrorists.   Bond gets into some trouble as he tries to save the hostages, but the danger does not end there.  For some reason, a man named "The Spy Who Loved Me" is determined to kill the movie's hero.  In some cases, the movie has great acting and great visual effects. "Dr No" does not have the same quality of the previous Bond movies, but it is still a fun film, although not very complex.  I would recommend this to a Bond movie aficionado, especially the ones who liked "Casablanca".   The book that was used in the movie is "Casualty of War" by Charles Kingsley.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple things: a) In the credits, it says:  The production of this film was handled by John Hughes.   b) I didn't think it was all that good, and I didn' think this film would be very successful.  I was a little surprised to find that it wasn't just about the three kids who got lost in the woods.  The movie took me through three very well acted actors, who were well-written, and who really had a fun time.  This is just another example of John Hughes trying to be funny.  Hughes is a very funny guy and this is just him trying to get laughs and then finding he can't do it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An amazing movie that i have been watching for many years,  . it is a good film, . but there are some bad scenes here and there,  and i believe that it was a good idea to have a scene that a man can't get out of his head,  It is the story of a woman who is very happy to be back in the land of the living.   She meets a man who says that there is a place where no one can reach.  And then she and her brother are told that the man is a crazy person,  but all is good,  The woman becomes very fond of this man who is like a God,  he knows everything and he is there to give you advice,  she is told that she is very beautiful, and this gives her a sense of security.  He is very gentle and loving and is very patient with her, and he says that when you leave this place,  you will be happy in your new life.  Now,  when I first watched this I thought that it is nothing special, but i saw it again a month later and saw a few more things that I thought were very special.  It's a wonderful movie,  it's very good, but there is not so much that it could be a masterpiece,  all in all, it's a very good movie, but you have to watch it in order. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A solid action movie. There's a lot of action and a lot going on but not everything works together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My thoughts:  When I first read that this is an old western, I didn't know what to think. I'd read a lot about old westerns. I mean, look how old they are. These are the same old guns, and horses, and the same kind of characters, but this one seems more innocent.  It is a lot of fun to see those old-style guns.  The way they carry themselves, and their attitudes, are the only things I found different.  They do not seem to think that they are superior to those who are weaker, or to those with fewer physical advantages.  If you like old western movies, I recommend this.  I'm always glad to see a good western with lots of gun action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was not your typical western. Instead it was an extremely well paced movie with a great cast. There were times when I thought they were making a western and then they switched to western action and the western characters.

There is a man who is traveling with them and his son is being brought up by his uncle and the other members of the family.  When a man's uncle falls into a coma and the uncle's wife dies the man decides to travel the state with the rest of his family and tries to find his son.

The acting was bad, the story was bad (I've been here a few times before and it's still pretty bad), the plot was bad but that was pretty much it.   So I watched it again just to see what the fuss was about, and then again to see how bad it had gotten. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has a lot to recommend it. The first half is a pretty normal Western, which is about a band of outlaws that get separated and find themselves lost and in the midst of a big fight with a nasty gang of highway robbers. It's not all that exciting, but it's not bad either. The second half, however, is where the film really comes into its own. The bad guys don't bother with the Western genre, and they take the whole thing very seriously, and are much more brutal. The film also has some of the best fight scenes ever, with great camera work and a good, memorable soundtrack. If you like action films, don't pass this one up.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much, it blew me away.   It is a comedy, a comedy that could only be written in the movies, where a bunch of people are getting drunk in a hotel room while a couple of the actors are having a good time.  It was so funny to watch these people talking to each other about how they can't think of a name for a place called "The Village" when they are in a bar in the Village, in the most silly manner they can.  I love this movie, it is so good and I recommend this to everyone, especially the people that love movies like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent story and a perfect combination of action and character development.    From the beginning of the film we are introduced to a character that is quite the bad ass and I loved every minute I was in this film.  The movie uses different styles of action (i.e. a chase scene, a shootout, and a plane battle).  This was a very creative movie that made me laugh and made me feel as if I was having fun while watching this.  My rating is a solid 8 out of 10.

This is another perfect movie: beautiful and moving, and wonderful for its music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a beautiful movie about two beautiful people, two friends that were close to each other all their lives.   They are both widowed and have always lived in seclusion, in an old house in the country.  They live very peacefully for many years.  In spite of their long separation, their friendship survives.  The last years are full of happy memories and joy.  However, when an accident takes the life of one of their friends, their lives change forever.  At first, they see it as the fault of the other, but eventually they are convinced that the man was not at fault.  It is a tragic mystery that is all too believable.  What is remarkable about this movie is the way it shows two completely different sides of the human condition.  One part is a very sad and sorrowful movie, yet there is also a strong and clear sense of humor and a warm, sincere friendship.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the Alien films, and have enjoyed many of the others as well.   There are very little films out there that can touch the level of fear and tension found in Alien.  The story is fairly simple. A scientist (Spencer), is experimenting on various forms of life forms, and one day comes across a seemingly indestructible alien organism. He begins to experiment on it, but the creature proves far more difficult to handle than he anticipated.  In a great movie, the story evolves into a frightening horror show. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the monster that is stalking this scientist, and it is impossible to see past the creature's insatiable hunger.  It is not a great horror film, but it is an intense experience that will stay with you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original Star Wars trilogy are always amazing but you might be under the impression that this film is a retread, as the first film did. There are some familiar elements to it, like the main characters, Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan, the bounty hunters who seem to be a cross between Han Solo and Han Solo, and the old junker who is a total badass. But other than that, nothing really seems to have changed and the result is a film that does not really need to be retreaded.   Star Wars:  The Empire Strikes Back   (1979)    I love the original Star War trilogy and   they are all really good movies.  But   I also hate the idea that   there is only one "true" Star Wars story and that is A New Hope.  So I was very excited to see the new Star Wars and to be honest, I'm disappointed in the film.  It has the same style and feel as the original trilogy and if that is good then I'm happy but it is not.  The action scenes are a bit repetitive, it's just not as good as it should be, the characters and dialogue are all cheesy, the special effects are mediocre, and I'm surprised that R2-D2 isn't even more awesome in this film. It has a couple of good effects shots in it and some cool space battles but other than all that it is a very bad film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part of the movie is the end.      The ending is about as dramatic as a movie can get.  How it happens is never explained, but I'm told it's in the script:  The two heroes must stop the monster (or monsters) that is about to destroy the world.  In the middle of the fight, they encounter the evil scientist who has had his evil plan all along:  He's been working on a chemical that can turn any man into a woman.  Unfortunately, this chemical is also the reason the monster is about.  They get back to the camp.  As the movie ends, we can't be sure whether it is meant to be a fairy tale or an allegory for the human condition.    So far as I'm concerned, the ending is what it is:  We have to make the best of a bad situation.  A better ending would have included some sort of happy ending where the two heroes find a love interest.  I have not seen the sequels (they are terrible), but I have read a book about the monsters that is better than the original.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. I've seen it more times than I care to admit.   It has the right balance of humor and horror and suspense and is just plain fun.  I recommend this to anyone who likes a good time and some laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie has a plot that is simple but the ending is what will stick in your head for days.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had watched the original film about four years ago, and this remake is much better. This movie is very interesting, and I found myself really enjoying it. I do wish the actors who played the aliens were older, and not like their CGI counterparts. But the film isn't really about aliens, it's about what you can do when people you don't like become all powerful, and then decide to kill everyone. I found it funny, even though the acting was so bad. The actors were more annoying than funny. I did like that the movie was about people not believing in the existence of aliens, when they actually see them with their own eyes, because the movie is basically a parable about how people can change when people change. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it's great to see a movie with a great story and amazing visual effects.   The movie has a lot of good things about it.  There is the main character who is a great lead actor in his own right.  The film has a very interesting story with a very good set of characters and a great cast.  I had a very hard time figuring out the movie from what it seems to be because I found some aspects I didn't like and I couldn't figure out what part of it the bad parts came from.  To give a small example, when there's a fight between the evil king and a giant turtle he is seen pulling a giant anchor from his coat and then pulling the entire anchor out.  How do you pull something like that from your coat?  If it doesn't come from your chest or any part of your body.  Another thing that caught my attention was the main villain.  He had a lot to say but he was in such a small role that it didn't really matter.  Overall, the story was well told and the visual effects were very good.  So if you're a fan of sci-fi or monsters, then the movie will appeal to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - It's good.   It's a good sequel.  It looks like a sequel from the first movie, but not nearly as bad as the first one.  The story is great.  I liked the movie as a whole.  However,  I feel like the movie is just a waste of time.  There were no exciting or funny moments in the movie, and none of them were the right ones.  My favorite moment from the movie was when the bad guy throws a rock and the poor guy rolls down a hill to dodge it.  That scene is hilarious and one of the best moments in a good scene.  If you've seen the first film and don't enjoy it, don't watch this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies where you can only see the end credits, where the actors are on a tour bus.   What I don't like about this movie is how they put the bad guys in a real life bus. This is a movie that is not about being bad or being good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character is a nice, quirky, charismatic young man. He is a little too clever for his own good, and has a tendency to fall into his own clever traps (like putting a paper bag over his head, or pulling the pin out of his gun, etc.). But then, he is a man who does not do things the usual way. His methods are unconventional, and he takes great risks in his personal and professional lives. His characters are relatable, and his story is well-paced. It's a short film that offers a small glimpse into the lives of a few people in our time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie with no dialogue that focuses on an old man's love for a young girl, and the man's gradual change in attitude towards the girl.   "The Man" seems to be the guy's grandaddy, but the grandaddy's grandson is a total ass, and his daughter is a horrible mother (yes, the movie is about a mother and her daughter), but at least the old man still loves his granddaughter, and sometimes he's kind of sweet to her.

It's a great movie with great performances, good story telling, and good acting!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this a while back. I thought the movie would be more like "Coyote Ugly" than "The Wicker Man". In fact, that's why I didn't like the movie: I think it was really silly, but the movie was really creepy and disturbing.   This movie was about a couple of weirdo brothers who lived in a house that had been built to resemble a house from hell. They had the usual pranks, the usual fights between them, and I didn�t like the ending at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a perfect example of a modern war movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a story where the main character has a very important secret, this movie has a lot to live up to. It's an interesting story about a father and son who have been friends for years, but have always secretly been in love. The son is an adult and comes out to his father and sister, the dad is not comfortable with it. This makes him act out, sometimes violent, but never in a way that would harm his son. But that's what this movie does to its viewers.   There are also some other subplots that really don't seem important, like a young woman who works as a prostitute. She's a total whore who has to wear a mask to hide the truth from people, but is never more than a pawn of the other characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie I was not sure what to expect. I did not know if it would be a good or a bad movie, but it was an interesting movie in itself. As I have mentioned before this is a remake of the movie from the 70s starring James Caan (yes that Caan!) and John Saxon. It is a very different movie than the one from the seventies. It was a low budget movie, and a lot of people do not know that the film was made for $3,000. It made a lot more money than a lot the other low budget movies that were made in the seventie, like The Wild Angels, where the entire cast is a bunch of hicks, and the movie is about a buncha hicks that end up killing their ranch. It seems that there was a film that was shot a long time ago but never released. A story about a group of hick guys who are going around trying to kill all the cows, then their guns come out and shoot a bunch more. It wasn't that bad, but the story itself was bad. It started out very good, and I had a good laugh at some of the jokes, which is a rarity in the 80s. But then it just lost its charm and it became something else. It has a long way to go before it is good. It will never be good as a good film, and it is nothing like a good western.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll start by saying that, although the writing style is definitely dated, it's certainly still funny.   You've got your "the world's most powerful military" with an annoying wife, your brother-in-law, your best friend, the most powerful man in the universe, and the man who is more powerful than the man.  This is a classic.  To me, it feels like a mix between The Great Gatsby, Die Hard, and The Last Dragon.  For those who don't know, The Last Unicorn is an excellent novel and I read the entire thing in about three days, but if you haven't read it yet then this is perfect.  I'm not even kidding, I read about 200 pages of The Last Rainbow in three days. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an action packed film with the usual great car chase scenes, gunfights, a great villain and a beautiful girl.   The movie starts with a group of thugs running through a town on a horse and all of a sudden we are introduced to the main character, a good looking young girl who is a thief. She runs to the nearest church which is just behind where the thieves were standing and she is immediately hit and taken out. Now a couple of other guys arrive and they are all out of it and they attack this girl too.  And just as this is happening the main antagonist appears in the church and as soon as he appears a gunfight erupts.  The main character is captured and taken to an old mansion where she meets the bad guy.  He is a pretty tough guy and he is not going to let this good looking girl go without a fight.  In the end the good looking guy escapes but it does leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth, the movie is pretty enjoyable and with an awesome chase scene and a really beautiful girl at the end I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off,   I loved this movie!   It is a funny, quirky, fun movie.   Even if you have never seen an American Pie movie before,  you'll enjoy it.  What I like about this movie is that it can be enjoyed by just about anyone.  When the characters say things like "we're gonna make our way to   heaven" they are talking about the town of Davenport.  If you haven't seen a Davenporter before, it is a tiny village in Kansas.  Davenports motto is "Where America Begins"   We find out that the town is being built on top of a graveyard.  This is where all of the characters end up   and where most of the comedy occurs.  Most of the jokes are either funny or stupid.  The best part about the movie is the soundtrack.  There are a lot of tunes that go on throughout the film and all of them are great.  And of course, the best part is that the characters are all great to watch.  As you can see from the review, I have watched a few American Pie movies already and I found them to be very good.  But this is a lot better than anything I have seen before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time you see a female in a long trench coat, you immediately think of the character from "The Manchurian Candidate", with the long hair and the dark glasses. The movie is a parody of all the spy movies.   It's a dark comedy, a bit ridiculous, but it's a great way to laugh at the stupidity of those who go into business for themselves after the war. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was my first experience with director John Milius and he created a truly bizarre and bizarre film. It was really scary and I think this is a movie I'm sure all would enjoy seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While I find myself on a lot of "franchise" lists, I have to say this is one of the better ones.   It's a sequel to "The Great Escape" (or "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.") in the sense that it's set in the U.S. (in a big city) and it has the same themes of freedom, individualism, and personal freedom that make that movie so great.  The story here is about a man who is trying to rescue his kidnapped wife, who has been held captive by the villain in this new movie.  His friends want to make a movie about it and help his friend to rescue the girl, but this is impossible.  While this movie is about freedom, the film's action is not very exciting and you don't really care about any of the characters.  I guess it works on a "family movie" scale.  This is a good and entertaining movie with some good jokes and characters. The action sequences are pretty good and it was well done to make it seem like something out of the movie "The Godfather" or something.  It had some good songs and it's worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe my eyes. This is one of the best movies ever made. It has great characters and a great plot.   It is not a good film that everyone should watch, because it has a very good story, but it is a wonderful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the movie 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'   - or if you simply like the dark humor,   then go ahead and grab a couple of glasses of this   and a popcorn (or two,  ) and watch.   The film does a good job of creating a humorous and dark film that could be a good night at the movies,  with a few laughs thrown in for good measure.  It's a fun movie that gives the viewers a few laugh, and then throws in a few more to keep us engaged.  As for the film itself,  it's a great story,  and does a great job of capturing the darkness that is DC's world.  I love the tone of the movie,  for it is dark in its humor, yet light in its action,  making it a good mix.  When you look at the cast,  they don't appear to be'super-stars' in this movie, though there are a few great actors in this one.  And the villain, as the name implies, is a man of evil, but not in the 'Batman' kind of way.  He's a cold, calculating,  villain that goes out of his way to make the world a bad place, and I really enjoyed the way the movie did this.  But perhaps the most appealing aspect to this film,  is its villains.  While there is plenty of humor in the film, there are some really great,  evil characters that really give the film a sinister vibe.  In my opinion,  this movie was a great addition to the DC movie universe,  so if you haven't seen it yet,  go ahead an give it a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a film quite like this. I'll go on a rant now:  This film is a real gem.  It has a very intense plot, it's got some nice visual effects and it's well-paced.  The acting is very good in all parts.   The dialogue is really good, and the plot is interesting and thought-provoking.  At the end, it really hits home how important the power of the word is:  What does a man like this really need?   If anything, I'd say he needed the woman in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am glad I had the chance to watch this movie and that I have a strong opinion about it. It is just good, good movies are rare at this time, especially in America. It has a wonderful movie star in Gary Oldman, with good acting by James Spader and lots of good lines (spoiler warning: it's about a "sadistic, coldblooded killer"). The setting is beautiful, the setting of a fictional city is good enough to convince me that it is a city in a story. I hope there is a sequel and I wish that they could make it bigger.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A young girl and her mother, both members of the community who have been in the care of their daughter for over a year, find themselves in a state of utter misery. The family are in desperate need of money as they struggle to stay afloat. They desperately need a job as an apprentice to the wealthy family who own the farm which is the source of their misery.   The movie is set during the Great Depression, in this case the 1930's. It was a time in history when the working classes were forced into the streets by the wealthy class who wanted to maintain their privileges, and the result was the rise of the communists, the rise in the use of guns, and of course the rise to power of fascism.   The movie follows the family as they seek a way to escape the life of poverty they live and the plight of their child. It is very well done and it is not a terrible movie by any means, but it is a story of poverty and desperation, and it does not need to be seen to understand the situation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What was supposed to be a typical low-budget sci-fi movie, where the hero, who is a lowly janitor (played by a man whose name escapes me), has an alien ship crash-land on his head, and has to save the world by fighting the alien queen.   This movie is all about the alien, the Queen and the various aliens and other creatures that surround the alien.  This film has a great cast including:  -Rory Culkin  -Honey Ryder  -Kathryn Hahn  -Terence Stamp  -John Ritter   Unfortunately, most of the characters are pretty flat.  One can see why the script was written by David Brin (who is known for writing science fiction stories) and not any of the other writers that were chosen:  It has a very basic plot, where everything is explained in the first few scenes, which are very basic.  At the very beginning, where R2-D2 is seen in a ship that has crashed near him, there is an explanation:  The ship fell out of space. It is a robot that the humans had built in order to get to Earth, to help in a nuclear war.  R2 is sent to save R2D2 and his friends by having R2 crash- land on a planet that is being ravaged by the aliens.  There is a lot of alien, and very little explanation of the aliens:  At first, it seems that the aliens are going to destroy the planet and wipe out everyone on it, with only a few lucky survivors.  Then, we meet a man named Captain Picard (John Ristie), a very arrogant man who has the power to see through the alien's disguises, and is one of the main characters.  His ship has a lot in common with the real world, as the people use computers and are very concerned about the fate of humanity.  It is very funny to watch, and a lot more thought went into it than most of what I have seen.  A lot of time and money have been spent on the special effects, and we are also shown the ship going into space, so that it looks like the aliens have space travel technology.  The movie also has a beautiful score, with lots of great sounds.  I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the fourth movie by Peter Hinton about the history of the French Resistance in World War 2. It is a very moving and powerful movie. It tells the story from the point of view of some of the men of the Resistance. It also tells the history as seen by the Germans in the occupied areas of France. In this movie we get some of their own perspective on what was happening in France. One of the things that this movie has is a lot of music. In the early years of the war many French people could be heard singing in public. There were some famous songs about the liberation of Paris. This movie is about the war from the French point of views and how the Germans tried to disrupt the liberation.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had been wanting to see a film about a group of people trapped in an isolated forest setting ever since I saw The Birds. A very good film. It has great acting, music, and scenery, but really what it is about is loneliness, and the loneliness is real. This is a story about a family trapped in a remote, very isolated forest. It is a film that explores the problems in human relationships, and of course the loneliness. This movie is about a man trying to find his wife and children. He is on a mission to help, and he finds himself in a world he has never seen. He encounters a girl who has been missing for a week, and discovers a group that may hold some answers. He starts to get close to these people, but then his problems really start to mount. What makes this movie truly great is how real it is, and how realistic it is.   This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best films I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The first time I met Bruce Campbell was at a very high school reunion. This was the first time in over 40 years of my life that I was in high school again. I remember walking to a movie with my mother and her friend. At one point my mother said, "I don't think I'll ever be able to find a better dad than Bruce Campbell." The entire time the reunion was going on I thought I might see Bruce Campbell. I'm a huge horror fan and I've seen a lot of them. But this movie was so much better than all of them combined. It was fun, suspenseful, scary, and well acted. My mother was in love with Bruce and she was even more in love than I was at the time. We both had tears in our eyes while watching the movie. I had been in highschool for 15 years at that point and it felt like ages. Bruce Campbell will never be forgotten by me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good, fast-paced, funny action movie.   A couple of interesting things I like about this movie: (1) John Travolta plays a very good-natured cowboy. He gives a good performance and I liked him. (2) He plays the "bad guy". (3) John "Bad Ass" Travot is good and believable. (4) The "bad" guy is a bad guy who I would like to play myself someday.  The first half of the movie has Travovol playing a lot of "bad guys" who have a "bad attitude" (that sounds bad to me), are arrogant, and just plain bad-ass. Travol plays a really good actor.  It's a fast, fun, fun-filled action movie, and I found it much more entertaining than some of the other "cannon-fodder" movies (like "The Black Scorpion" and "The New Breed of Terror") that I like to see.  I like the fact that these "bad-asses" all have a good reason to be bad-asses; their "bad attitudes" are probably the best reason in the movie. I liked the fact the movie didn't take itself too seriously.  But, I thought it was a very funny and enjoyable movie.

This is a great, enjoyable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This is a nice film, although a bit slow at times. The script, as is so often the case with director Peter Bogdanovich, is pretty much non-existent. I am not talking about a few good ideas or characters that are very well developed, but about the script itself. I was not a big fan of the dialogue in this movie, I found it all sort of banal and unoriginal.   This is not to say that the film is boring or not good, there are quite a few entertaining scenes, but it is not a film that will blow your mind.

The thing is, the film was just over the top. The stunts and the movie were just over-the-top. The main female lead was just too perfect. It was a fun little movie and I think the idea was pretty cool. It would be a good idea to do some of this type of film some day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film that will forever change your impression of black comedy.   It's as if the entire world suddenly wanted to hang around the Whitechapel area for a while.  There was a nice blend of the serious and the comic, the serious played out like a comedy while the comedy played out almost like a tragedy, there was a lot of comedy but it was very funny.  The plot was very dark and the final scene was very sad and depressing.  I thought this was probably the best movie ever made about a black character.  This film has aged very well.

It has been said that most of the films I have seen where the music is so bad that they can't even be considered musicals, but the great musical talents of John Williams, and the music in this movie made it one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this movie yet. It's only been released on DVD and I've only seen a little bit of it, and I was really impressed with it.   The story takes place over a weekend at a camp in the Appalachian Mountains.  The main character is a girl named Beth who gets lost in the woods.  When Beth is found she is a little beaten up and has an almost black eye, but she is not really hurt.  After being taken care of at the camp, Beth finds out that she is pregnant and she is going to have a child.  During the day she has the time to meet her friends and make new friends.  As the days go by Beth finds herself growing into a great woman.  I was quite entertained by this movie.  It has a very nice story line and has lots of action and funny moments.  While the story line is quite different, it is not out of place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would not give this film any more than a 4.5 - and I would like to give a better rating to a few other movies in the same genre:  First we have the "man from Mars" who travels back in time to the age of the dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs are still alive, in a rather primitive state, yet they are capable of speech and seem to have a kind of social organization.  Our man from Mars has the job of saving one of the big dinosaurs and bringing it back to the future, so that it can be raised as a leader, as well as to teach the rest of the creatures to speak, which is why they are called "dinos."  I never found this movie to be very interesting and the dinosaurs weren't very interesting, either.  One thing I found interesting was that there were a lot of strange and funny characters - many of whom had humanlike traits.  After the dinosaurs, the time travelers visit the prehistoric ruins of the time period of their travels and get involved in a large battle with an advanced human civilization.   "Armageddon" was a good and entertaining science-fiction movie, but the dinosaurs in it seemed more like an excuse for a good time than an actual story.  If you like adventure movies and you like a good dinosaur story, you should see this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good film that is not really a horror film but a kind of a psychological thriller.   It is about a family with a little girl (Sara) and a big and dangerous dog (Bark).   Their house is surrounded by a wall of glass and the dog is a big wild dog.  It will frighten some children or a little boy or girls.  The girl is a witch and sometimes it is the other way around.  I liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does not do very much to impress the audience, which is not surprising given its source material. It is a nice, straightforward thriller with a very good cast. I really liked the cast.   As a fan of the book, this movie does a nice job at portraying the feeling of the story, which takes place in a small Canadian town.  To say that this movie lacks a little bit in style would be an understatement.  While the film does not make a huge amount of noise, it does a good job at making the story come across.  The only thing that I can find to complain about is the occasional use of subtitles.  I was only able to figure out the whole story in about 10-15 minutes, which isn't really that bad given the limited screen time.  If you are a fan or just an interested viewer, you could definitely enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love when a story is told with emotion.   From the opening scene we have two people who are going through a horrible situation.  It doesn't matter whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, it's just how it is.  But they're not alone in their pain, but also a few others, they all have their own problems.  And even though they all feel like they have lost a loved one, one by one they get a way out of this.  The ending shows that everything was worth it, but of course they all find out they don't have a way back.  I'd like to say more about the characters, but there's so much to tell about them it would be pointless.  One thing about the story, it tells it really clearly.  We never see the two characters having a conversation, we never see them talking to each other, it seems as if they're all in a one on one situation. But when they talk to each others we hear their stories.  There is a great deal of heart to this story, and not just in the characters.  This movie reminds me a lot of the movie that I watched a few months ago that has a similar plot but I like this movie better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It took me a while to see a movie where the characters looked like real people and where the violence didn't look like a poorly staged film.   There are so many good scenes that I could ramble on about, but I'll let you enjoy the movie instead:  A few months before the movie, a young girl is found dead in a lake.  After she's buried, her boyfriend decides that he can never forgive her.  The reason he cannot forgive her:  Her father has been cheating on her. This leads to the murder of a neighbor who was a friend of the girl.  And then there is another murder:  An 18-year-old girl has just been found dead.  So, there are multiple murder victims and then a man is arrested.  There's a guy on the run who is also on the lookout for other murders:  The lead detective, Detective Frank Abagnale, is on the trail of the killer, a man called John Gartner, and in the course of the movie we see him pull off several crimes in his pursuit.  When they are finally brought to trial, the prosecutor is forced to admit that he is incompetent:  This leads Detective AbagnALE to question if the investigation is even necessary.  Eventually, it comes to light that Gart the killer is working for a guy who is out to get him.  But before he can get to the end of his investigation, the police are called and Detective Aba needs to find out what is going on.  Detective Abagale has a wife who is on a death-bed:  I'll never forget how her face was filled with pain and then she just started yelling:  And it was only then that it dawned on me that this is the most brutal film I've ever seen.  It has all the gore you could ask for and more!  The music is the icing on the cake:  When you hear the music, you can't help but cry, "I've been in your car!"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most Hollywood films, this is based on a true story:  After the bombing of the German consulate in Benghazi, Libya, the CIA agent who had been in charge of the rescue effort turned the job over to the Red Cross.  But instead of letting a small American charity deal with the chaos and destruction that followed, the US ambassador was replaced by a CIA officer (Paul Walker) who became obsessed with the local dictator, who was also an al-Qaida sympathiser.  In the end, Walker and his new-found allies in the anti-American jihad (the CIA operative played by Nicolas Cage, an old CIA hand) manage to stop the Benghazi massacre, but in the process, the Benghazi survivors (including the Libyan president's son) kill their new rescue leader, the American diplomat, who is a member of the anti-'Western' brigade (including an American and a Briton).   In other words, we see how things like this can happen:  1. The US Embassy is attacked by an Al Qaeda affiliate. 2. The ambassador is replaced by someone who is obsessed with one of the Libyan dictator's sons (who has become an al Qaeda sympathiser, and the person who is said to have killed his rescue leader). 3. When the new ambassador is killed in a gunfight at the American Embassy, the Americans take out the Libyan rebels who had carried out the attack and replace the new American rescue leader (played by Nicolas' father). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was good in all aspects:  It was well made.  It had good acting.   The film was very action packed and it did have a good plot.  My only problem was how the characters were written:  They weren't complex enough to show any emotion.  They were all kind of the same and it was hard to identify with any of them.  There were some really good performances and some very good special effects, but it just didn't quite have the wow factor of other'special effects' films from the 60's.  I don't know why they never tried to improve the acting or the writing.  The only redeeming features of this film were the special effects and the amazing action.  And the ending was... well, I just can't say.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit that this movie wasn't exactly what I was expecting. When I watched it on Youtube I had a lot of fun with the "horror movie".   As I watched the movie I could feel the tension build and the whole time I could hear a scream.   Now, you wouldn't expect this kind of tension from a horror movie, but with all the blood and gore and violence I was surprised by the realism.  If you are a fan of horror movies like Saw, Dead Alive and The Ring then you will like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know it's an action movie but what the hell was going on in this movie?  It was all about a group of cops investigating the murder of a child that happened in a movie theater. It looked like a movie about a small town girl who went to a play and came back as a zombie.  This movie would've worked better if it didn't have all the special effects in it.  The movie was made to be scary so what you get are the best acting performances in a slasher movie.  If you don't want to see a movie that is all about the zombie girl and her brother, I can't recommend it to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never liked the TV shows that were on television when I was a kid. But I thought I could do something about it. So I did, and I think I did something.   This movie is about a bunch of guys who were in a gang of thugs in the 70's and early 80's.  (They are all bad guys, and they are all the same)   They are members of a gang, the Lola Boyz, which consists of some older men, and a young boy, Billy, who is also an ex-gang member.  They want to commit a robbery to pay for their drug use.  While they are waiting, they have their first big fight. Billy gets a big kick in the face, but he doesn't get his legs broken. (I know he's an ex gang member)  He just is knocked out cold and has to be taken to a hospital by his gang mates to get cleaned up.  This all seems a little excessive.  But there's something about watching this group of guys go to work to pay their drug debt that is so cool, that I really didn't mind.

But the only bad things in the movie are the dialogues. And that is because the dialog is really, really funny. I laughed out loud several times. The character is really well-written and has a good sense of humor. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. The story is very good and the music is really good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part of this movie is the great dialogue, and it's great when people are talking about things that are going on around them.   - I was amazed by how many people there were, because you're watching a movie that was shot in South Africa.  - The black characters were wonderful, and the black people at the film center were wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw it I was surprised. I could see that this was going to be a good one. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because I was so surprised that I could not put my finger on what exactly happened.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't say enough good things about this movie.   One day at school, a boy named Johnny Smith (Jason Schwartzman) is struck by an unfortunate accident and later goes on a long coma. When his nurse, Mrs. Rinaldi (Nastassja Kinski) discovers him on the operating table, she tells him to stop worrying about death. Mrs. Ridiculous (Kathy Bates) tells him she loves him and wants to make him a star. She brings a group of girls to the hospital to try to make a movie out of him, but his health is seriously deteriorating. Mrs Rinaldine is a perfect match for Johnny, as he is a hilarious yet somewhat demented character. She is also a bit of a sissy, so her love interest, a doctor named Darryl (Mark Ruffalo), is not really a match for her either.  To make matters worse, he is also married with a child and does not appear to be very interested in Johnny's condition.  The only person who seems to care is Mrs. Pugh (Kirsten Dunst), a ditzy nurse who thinks she can help Johnny with his talent.  It appears that all the hospital drama and comedy is going to be for nothing until a mysterious film producer named Mr. Riddle (Kevin Bacon) gets involved, which is probably why it looks so awful.  As you can guess, it is not all fun and games. Mr. Ridilious (Randy Quaid) wants to take over the studio, but Johnny has the money, talent, and brain to save the studio and himself.  One of the greatest things about  The Good Shepherd  is that it is so real that you can almost smell the misery that the characters feel, yet the actors really get to show off their chops and make this a very enjoyable and good-natured film.  After all, who would want to make movies when one can play them with a nice smile on one's face?
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like how the story is told, from the first scene it is obvious that this movie is a very dark and sad story, there are many scenes that are very scary for me. The movie starts with an interview with a journalist and a woman who were tortured for a year and a half. They say they saw the Devil come out of a woman's eye and that the woman looked like the Devil.   There is no dialogue, there is just sounds coming from a woman in a room, a man watching and the man crying and the woman screaming.  The woman is not well, she is crying all the time, she looks like the devil, she walks slowly in front of the camera.  It is hard to watch a movie about a person who is suffering, it is painful, sad and depressing.  This is the only movie I saw in 2015 that made me cry a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic New York, is an amusing comedy with one particularly amusing ending.   I was watching this movie and thought "This is really good!   It's funny, dramatic, sad, dark, and pretty damn scary!"   And so it was.  I can only remember the first few seconds, and then I just had to put the movie on to find out how it ended.  It was not a good ending. The story started with a zombie (a dude dressed like the Beast) who attacked some humans and the survivors from a movie set in the future. After fighting, the zombies went into a city and started mauling a girl (a little girl with a giant machete in her hand who wasn't even in the story).  The girl gets eaten and then the little girl just...gets killed.  After that, the girl's dead body is found and they figure out the zombies have come from the future and that the people who were at the future movie set are in the present day.  There were a few other people in the city who they were going to eat if they were not found soon.  This movie was funny in a dark kind of way. It was about a bunch of people who had lived their entire lives in a New York with a lot of cool buildings. They never went outside and it had a weird feeling to it that was almost like "they" had made it.  One character was actually a woman who had been a prostitute when she was young.  And then this man came in and basically said that there was a place with a buncha cool people inside the city.  He said that one day he would like to go there to get a good place to hang out with his friends.  Then there was some great "The Matrix" type ending where the main character got a machine that would allow him to go back in time.  Now, after having seen "The Thing" and "The Road" I was expecting a more apocalyptic kind of ending but this film was not even that.  The ending was like what you would expect from the movie "Patton" which I am sure had a good opening to it. I think there are better ending choices in a movie but this is still good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scene of a good action film with lots of special effects is very cool:  In a desert, two soldiers, one man, and one woman, get separated. She tries to follow him, but he disappears.  A man, wearing a uniform, tries to lead them to the main road.  He gets lost, and they are both captured by the locals.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know how I was going to be able to watch this one because I had seen the trailer and was like "Wtf????"   For those that don't remember,  It's a remake of an old sci-fi movie, and it's one of the very few sci-Fi movies I haven't seen in like 4 years.   It's pretty hard to explain without a synopsis, but let's just say, when the moon is hit by a nuclear blast, everything is destroyed save for a young boy.    He's left alone to figure out what has happened.  He has the same "power" that is found in other "powered" people in the movie, but only because he's found his father.  They come across a bunch of people that have also been affected by the explosion, including a lady that is a "militia" soldier that can throw rocks.  But that's about it.  Now, you may be wondering why I picked this movie out of the 70s, and I suppose that is partially because I was in my late teens and early 20s back in the day and it was very popular.  I know that it was a remake because when it came out, it was an instant classic.  That was probably a mistake.  There is a reason it is on this list.  It is so hard to describe without a full synopsis, and that's because it was one of my favorites back then.  This movie takes place in an alien world, and the idea is that humans have built the city as a place to live with all sorts of advantages.  The city has a nuclear plant which is responsible for creating the bombs that hit the moon.  Humans are kept from living in the city so that they have to learn how to survive, which they do by going around the city and doing various tasks, such as making weapons to help them kill the monsters.  As you may have guessed, the monsters are aliens that come from a place where there is not a lot of food and they want to steal the humans from their city so they can have a place for themselves.  Also, there is a scientist in the military that is working to help create the bombs.  While humans are working on getting the bombs, a group of humans go in to the city to search for the monsters, and discover that they are in the wrong city.  So the humans come back to the one

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the best American science fiction movie ever made.   I would say that "Innerspace" is the most important film of all time.  The story is fantastic.  I loved it.  It is so original, it's like a sci-fi noir, a space western, but it's a space Western that's a little more like a classic western.  Its action is absolutely fantastic, there are some good fight scenes.  A couple of scenes are a little too long, but the story is so good, it never really feels like a long scene.  Like any good western, it has a lot of characters, and there are a lot a well developed ones.  This is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of those films where a character becomes stronger through adversity, through suffering, through hardship. It's sad. It isn't easy to appreciate a film that uses every ounce of emotion and every ounce it has to show how hard things can be for a young person who's trying to make a name for himself.   I'm not saying this film doesn't have a place in the big canon of '50s-era Hollywood melodrama.  It does, and I'm glad that this film has a place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first part of the movie is very well done and I am surprised by the movie itself; this is a decent thriller and I would recommend it to everyone interested in the world of international terrorism. I think the main character is a good choice for the movie; he's more like a man that doesn't like to be bothered with anything at all. He never seems to be the centre of attention and just wants to go on living.   I think this movie has more of a psychological dimension to it and more of the film is in the character's perspective than the viewer's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always enjoyed movies about a gang of misfits.   It is not hard to find the original gang of miscreants.  For instance, in the movie "Mr. Deeds" there are two of them: a tough, tough, strong little man and a pretty girl with her own way of thinking and doing things.  In a similar vein, in "Mr Tod", there are three miscreant gang members.  The one who goes by the name of Mister Tod was one of the three in the original movie.  There is another miscreancy who appears in a similar manner.  So, we have a bunch of miscellaneous guys who get together and take on a lot of petty jobs.  This group also has a secret: they have a very powerful gang leader.  They all have their own code: they are not to harm anyone, and they work for Mister Tods.  One of the miscreantly mischievous characters is named Mister Nod: he is the leader of the miscellaneous gang.  Mister Nog was played by a young Walter Matthau who went on to become the voice of Mr. Tod in the movies that I mentioned above.  Matthau's portrayal of Mister Nop is very good.  I remember watching this movie with a group of friends who included my uncle.  We had a little party and played cards.  It was a good time.  After a few hours we were out of breath, so we headed to bed.  Our next morning we watched the movie again.  My uncle played the role of Mister Mop and he was a lot more fun to watch.  Nog plays the role well.  When he runs through a crowded city street, he has no trouble taking on a few dozen guys with pistols.  He is not a perfect fighter, however.  Some of the other miscellaneous mischievious gang members have a little trouble with him.  But the good Mister Nogs get through it.  As the mischiever goes to find his own gang leader, he is shot and killed.  That's bad.  Then the good gang leader comes looking for him and is shot dead by the bad gang leader who wants the head of Mister Pudley.  You see that Mr Tod is not in this movie. He is at another movie. But Mister Puddles is still the head leader. Nog is a loser

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been a fan of J. M. Barrie. In fact, my mother gave me an old copy of "The Little White Bird" with a picture of Barrie (with his wife and son on the front) on it at the age of 8 years old.   When I was about 10 years old, I had seen this as a Christmas movie for the first time. At first I thought the "bird" was just an ugly bird with a big, round belly.  But I grew to like it. I wanted to ride on it.  This is a movie that I remember seeing in the theatre when I was a little kid and I still like it today.

It was great fun as the team of Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, and Harry Osborn got caught up in a cosmic adventure that would have put them to shame in the hands of more than one good comic book writer.   There were two movies released, the first one is a good one but not as good as the others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is hard to explain how great a movie is that has been playing in theatres for over four decades.   The plot is complex.  In each episode of this wonderful series, three men meet three women, and their interactions with them are fascinating, complex, and often hilarious.  The women are very funny, and the men are very handsome, but not the same, at least not in the first two episodes.  I wish I could say more about how interesting these men are, but I can't, because I don't have time for more.  But then there's a third man who is, quite simply, wonderful, and I'll be talking about him for a long time.  You can watch the whole series in just over an hour. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to be honest and say that I was disappointed by this film. While the characters were entertaining, there was no reason to care about them other than I just couldn't get into this movie. I thought this was going to take a darker turn and I was wrong.   To be fair, there is something interesting about the concept of the cult and there is a decent amount of story. However, the film has a hard time finding its footing and I'm still not sure how much I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen "Gravity" for a while, but I recently caught up on the DVD and decided to take a look at the DVD-rip of the 1993 film.   What the film is about is a young man's fear of gravity, his fear that he will not be able to move his limbs in a gravity-free environment, and his attempt to find a way to overcome that fear and survive his adventure with a friend.  But that's not what the film's about.  Gravity is about something else.  I have no idea what.  In the film, a scientist in space, Dr. Robert Wilson, finds a way for him to move about in space.  He is able to do so because, through an ingenious device called the Spacelab, a man (David Bowie) who has been trapped in space can send and receive messages from Earth by walking around inside the Spacewarrior, a space ship.  A man called Neil Armstrong becomes entangled in the scheme to retrieve the message that Neil needs to send back to Earth.  That is what the movie is about. But what is Gravity really about?   In a nutshell, it is about a man, Neil Armstrong, who is in a cave in space in a spaceship orbiting a planet and decides to escape it.  When he does, he finds himself in a completely different place, the moon, and decides he will explore it. There, he meets a scientist called Dr. Stephen Hawking (who has been imprisoned on the moon by the Russians), who is a pioneer of space travel, and the two of them form a friendship.  Dr. Hawking and Neil also have two dogs, who seem to be friendly to them, and that is where the film turns into a comedy.  At the end of the film Neil takes a picture with a camera to show the world what it is like to be an astronaut.  It seems a bit of a stretch to call "Gravitation" an "anti-science" movie.  If anything, it's an exploration of how we see the world and how we can learn to see it differently.  There are some pretty odd ideas that come out of the movie and they are pretty strange and funny.  The most prominent among them are the fact that the moon is alive and that Neil is a very bad pilot.  Other ideas include the fact the only way a man can get off the moon without being killed is to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very glad that my first film in Italy was such a success, even though it is very hard to see the beauty in such dark landscapes, especially in a landscape as bad as this.   It is the way a story develops in the course of a night - or more exactly a day - that is so charming.  The idea of a group of characters living on the same street in the same neighborhood, trying to make a living from the most unpleasant, hopeless situation - there is one family, the father, son, uncle and nephew, and a little girl who doesn't know anything. One evening, the uncle is hit by a car. The son has been caught robbing a bank. The nephew is a bit mad, and thinks it's his turn to go to the bank and get his hands dirty, and to try to make some money. The uncle is in a very bad way, having suffered several fractures, and the nephew tries to comfort him and tell him about how he feels, and how he was able to survive, and that now he'll try to do it right the next time. And so this is how it starts, and these are the characters - I love them all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no idea why we didn't get more "Star Wars" movies, maybe it was because of the poor reception that "Titanic" had. In the beginning of this movie, we get a little bit of history. We get a hint of what happened to the crew of the RMS Titanic. We learn of how many were saved. Then the "titanic hits" are shown. It seems they have some kind of a power. After seeing that, it's obvious why they would have a power on board. I can't say too much about this, but this is a good story. I love the story about what happened when the boat capsized, but it's not too bad. It could be even better. I'm glad to have seen "Triton". It was a good, interesting story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, I like the premise.   If you've seen   the  "Batman and Robin" movies, you know what they are like.  But the new   Robin is a little different and the action is a lot more intense.  It has a lot of action, even more than   "Robin Hood" did.  I also love that Bruce Wayne is not the villain, but his mother.  Even though he is Batman, he's not as cool as   Batman.  At times, you don't know who is going to win.  So I love it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was interesting how many times the movie kept rewinding and going back to see if there was any other way of doing something.   The movie starts out in a very generic place, the government is doing research on a new type of flying device, a sort of jetpack that can only go 10,000 feet, a huge leap forward in technology.  When the government finally gets a sample of the technology they are interested in testing on humans, some people who can't fly a jetpack or jet in the same way a jet is supposed to go, but can control the machine very well.  There are a couple of really bad guys that try to rob this technology and the government tries to stop them.  The pilot that pilots the plane is not a very good pilot and is a bit of a moron.  He doesn't realize that the plane will not be able to go so far, and so when it crashes the people on board the plane are killed.  It is also apparent that the bad guys have special equipment that can change their forms.  These guys are not all that skilled in flying the plane, so when they fly in their form their bodies are really big and they are not able to fly the plane.  They only manage to get away from the government by using their special devices and then going back in.  This is a good example of how things can go wrong when an evil government is trying to get its hands on a technological advance.  Another interesting aspect is that the evil government has a very strange and dark secret:  They want to kill all of the people who were on the plane before it crashed and their only way of destroying them is to freeze them in time for 1,000 years.  If they die during this time then their souls will return to the body of the pilot.  For some reason these people get their time frozen and then their bodies break down and they die.  But it is still not enough to kill everyone, because some of them are very skilled in using the technology that they are working on.  With a couple more people dying every year there is a chance that their souls could be lost forever.  Then, when the research into these new kinds of technology starts being put together the government starts to realize that this is not all it was cracked up to be.  Something has happened to the evil scientists, and they have created a new kind of flying machine that looks like a giant bat.  So
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie doesn't get any better than it already is.   I saw it at a friend's house, and I could almost believe I was watching a low budget Hollywood movie.    There was no dialogue, it was all narration, and it had a really simple but effective plot.  The main character, the only character in the movie, is a young woman named Rose.  Rose has a problem with her left leg.  So, she's going to try and find someone who can help her.  There are a bunch of people in Rose's life who want to use her left arm to get their hands on her boyfriend.  But they can't get to him, because the arm has been replaced by a prosthetic.  It's not a particularly unique story, but the story is well done and it feels genuine.  A friend of the main character and one of the prosthetic characters is killed by a train.  While Rose is talking to her best friend, the other friend's boyfriend is running down the street.  When Rose turns around to see if he is okay, the boyfriend is gone, but she doesn't really care because she is happy.  This was one of my favorite movies ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a little boy who lives on the South side of Chicago with his widowed mother who is a teacher at the local Catholic school.   One day, a little girl falls from her bicycle and is hit by a car.  She survives and is taken to the hospital where she is treated by a very skilled surgeon.  When the little girl dies a few days later, the little boy is taken in by the same surgeon's family.  The little boy's mother is a strong lady and tries to instill in him a love of learning.  Eventually, the boy makes it to college and is a great student.  But, it is soon after his graduation that the woman he loved is murdered.  He soon begins to believe that the reason he is never in the house anymore is because he is too busy thinking about his mother's murder.  This is a sad and depressing movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like "The Mummy Returns," "The Conjuring" (2012) is also a terrific horror film. Director James Wan, in an effort to be original and innovative, decides to combine several elements of his previous works:  I was completely entertained from the start.  Wan uses the usual techniques to get us involved:  We're shown in first person perspective as the young girl (played by the wonderful Vera Farmiga) wanders through a creepy house with her family.  The atmosphere is eerie and foreboding:  A door suddenly opens to reveal the living room:  Suddenly the family begins to scream.  Farmiga, who has a very distinct accent (like most actors) plays the role of the young woman, who we learn is possessed by a demon.  Like many good horror films, "The Cenacle" takes place in a place we all know and love:  One of the few times in recent memory that I've been able to smile was when the mother (Linda Blair) said something very frightening:  There's a demon living in the house and he wants to kill us.   The film takes place over the course of a couple of days and it's not the most suspenseful experience but I enjoyed every minute.  Even the soundtrack is creepy and ominous, which is always a good thing.  If you've never seen a horror movie that starts off scary but doesn't really get going until the end, or if you've seen a bad movie and can't help but wonder, "When is the real horror going to come?"   This is a good horror film that will keep you guessing.  And, at $9.50, I found this to be a great deal.

The cast is good, and you can tell they put in a lot of effort to make this movie a good one.

It was just too damn slow, with a bland ending that left a bad taste in my mouth.   It was about a little boy named Paul who was sent to a mental institution and is later released into the world (as a baby) but soon discovers he's completely changed.  His world is full of evil and mayhem, and he is often found chasing down other little boys (and women).   There is some humor, but not in the least bit funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does nothing but remind me of the movies I saw when I was a kid and it's just like those movies - dark, dark, and very sad.   - June 28, 2013TOO MUCH PURE TORTURE  Reviewer: kylebrussell - favorite favorite favorite - May 4, 2012  Subject: Very Dark and Sad Very sad, but there's no real message. The whole movie is a nightmare of a man who is going mad. He's constantly going to the bathroom by the sink and urinating in the sinks, and also in the tub. He keeps going back to the tub to do it again and again. The only person he seems to have any respect for is his young daughter, who seems to be in a trance-like state, sometimes sitting upright. Her mother also seems to act like a robot with no heart. The man does make the effort to clean up after himself, so the film doesn't really suffer for being a man's life. This film is just not worth watching and will probably stay that way for the rest of our lives, despite it's many good moments. - May 11, 2011Very Dark and Sad  Review of "Hangman" (1965) - May 10, 2011
Write a positive review about a good movie:        - I was not expecting to like this one.   But I liked it a lot.  I enjoyed the story.  The plot and characters are good.  Well acted.  But the best part was the music.  It just moved me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't a great one but then it wasn't that bad either. There were a few points where it felt like it needed a lot of work on the story but then again, that can also happen in a lot good movies. The ending was a little cheesy but in a good way. I guess the one positive that can be said about it is that the main guy was kind of a dork but that's not a bad thing at all. I don't mind bad guys who are dorks so long as it's not the main character! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" franchise is the perfect mix of comedy, action and crime.   It is one of the most outrageous comedies ever made, with every line and action scene perfectly timed.  It features some truly bizarre moments: the opening title sequence is the best thing ever to grace the big screen, and the "cough drops" during the closing credits are brilliant.  This movie, and "A Perfect World", should go down as some of the greatest comedies of all time, and certainly is the greatest of its genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ...   This movie was a hit in the 90s.   It is set in an American town during the first days of the Great Depression.  The main character (the name is spelled in full) is a high school student and his roommate is his best friend, an artist named Paul (the film opens with Paul looking for a paintbrush.)  Paul is obsessed with painting a picture of his future wife (which he calls "Mrs. Paul").  Paul paints a picture with a dog for his future bride, and that is all she has to say about her future.  Mrs. Paul (played by Susan Egan) is more interested in talking about how Paul's girlfriend (Jane) is an artist, not a housewife, and has a pet lion and a rabbit.  It isn't very long before Paul is talking about his paintings all the time.  He is working so hard at his paintings that Mrs. Egan is starting to get sick of him.  His friend, Mikey (who is played by Paul Rudd) says "It's all right, Paul, you're doing fine."  When Mrs. Rand (Kristin Wiig) gets sick of Paul, Paul tries to cheer her up by talking about the future Mrs. Mrs. R (Meryl Streep).  She doesn't seem very excited about her wedding to Mr. Paul, and he worries about whether the wedding will be a bust.  She is still not happy about losing her pet cat, and Paul seems worried about her pet lion.  Eventually, Mr. Rand's (Jeff Daniels) father comes home to find his son gone.  In his father's absence, his mother (Sandra Bullock) turns to Paul for support and finds out how serious Mrs. A (Judy Davis) is about her career as a fashion designer.  When she gets pregnant, she turns Paul (and everyone else) into her children and tells them she will make a baby without having sex.  As a result of Paul's obsession with painting pictures of her future wife, her future husband (Paul Rudd) is starting the painting process as soon as she gets home from work.  So far, so good.  Then Paul has to choose a bride.  Paul decides to choose Mrs. C (Anna Kendrick) who he describes as "kind of a little tart" and who he finds "rather beautiful."  But, she is pregnant.  This is

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen much of the '90s action films that have come out of the UK in recent times but I was pleasantly surprised by The Raid (2014), which was an entertaining and well made action flick.   It was shot in the UK and the British accent (not overly bad, but certainly not up to par) made the plot very easy to follow.  In a way it was like a cross between 'The Fast & the Furious' and 'The Raid: Redemption', which I found quite amusing.  It looked great on the big screen and acted very well.  Overall, a fun movie that I am looking forward to seeing again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't see this in the theatre, but I'm glad I did.   The first half of the movie is a fairly good romantic comedy, though you'll have to give it a rest for a little bit and then come back in when things start heating up.  I had a great time watching this with my wife and son.  It's funny at times but not too crazy in a bad way. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie.   This film was made in 1954 and shows a man who was an alcoholic and now has a family.  He has a wife who is beautiful and his son and daughter.  I enjoyed the movie very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story, which was told quite well in both German and French (the movie was also shot in French) involves two brothers - a father and a son - who are working in the coal mines of Poland. After a bad accident with the machinery of a railway train, the sons are forced to get a job as stokers. At first they are happy. But then the father finds that his wife is having an affair with his son's best friend. So the father goes to the best friend's house to make his wife leave him. There, the friend, a fat, drunken and cowardly young man, gives his friend the first of many slaps. But when the friend tries to give the father a black eye, the father stops him and demands that he apologise. There's more in the next film and it's pretty brutal too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big movie fan ( I love horror, science fiction, fantasy, etc.), and have a huge collection of old movies, so when I heard about this film I knew I was in for a treat! It's a horror film about a young man (the titular Peter) who has to deal with a creepy old man (Seymour) and his creepy little girl (Alicia) as they stalk and torment the young girl, his girlfriend.   This movie was made in 1938, but it's the best horror movie that's ever been made!   It's not just that they were scary, but they have a very interesting plot, and their use of special effects is excellent.  I'd say this is my favorite horror film, and is one of the best old movies I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    BEST MOVIE:  In the last decade, Hollywood has produced a few films that have had the power to rouse a new generation of Americans.  And even though this isn't a great movie, it's not terrible.  It's just the kind of film that seems to have been made by people who don't have much of a life and who don´t care what anyone thinks.  In this movie, a young man is a car salesman who has been married to his wife for twenty years.  After a stroke, he has come back to his old life in the suburbs.  They live in a modest house with a beautiful young woman.  He doesn't feel like living much any longer.  The family has grown very old.  At the moment, the wife is in the hospital recovering from her recent stroke.  His daughter is in a state of mental disorder.  One of the things that keeps him going is his passion for cars.  To cheer him up, he takes his young daughter to the local car show.  She looks up to him as her hero and he loves to talk about cars.   This is the kind the American people would want to see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised to see that this film didn't come out more recently, despite having been made in 1980.   It has a very strange atmosphere, particularly about the young people who are always in their room (and in the bed) watching TV and eating candy.  I thought it might be about a high school movie, or about a teen film, but I can't really remember anything about the characters that are so well-rounded that they could have been in any other film.  The characters are very well written.  For those of you who are not familiar with the films of David Cronenberg (and I don't mean his work on "Nightmare" or "The Fly") I recommend "The Brood" and "Scanners".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few years ago I was at a conference in St. Petersburg and it was the first time I have been in a movie theater since I left for college.  The "movie theater" is actually a huge outdoor patio, but I like the sound of the raindrops falling on the asphalt, especially when a beautiful girl who goes by the nickname "Fanny" walks in wearing a short skirt and a short-sleeved top.   I thought about using the "movie" part of the title because I was watching this movie during a rainstorm.  Fanny was a good friend of my sister and a member of a young, good-looking, educated, and cultured crowd (who all go by the nicknames of "Fannie," "Fancy," and "Fawlty").  I liked the movie and found myself thinking about how it would probably play on a college campus.  - Review by Richard K. (a.k.a. SWEETER)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited about this film when I saw it when I was 16. I think a lot of my fondness for the film comes from its nostalgic feel. In a way, it's a cross between the old TV-series-movie-musical, "Sisters" by Billy Strayhorn, and the music of The Beach Boys (I love The Beach, it is just amazing).   And I really love how it ends.   The film doesn't really take long to set itself in motion. One day, the narrator is at a coffee shop. It's late in the afternoon and he's talking about how it's such a wonderful day. Suddenly, the coffee shop is in a commotion as the camera slowly takes its way up the steps of a windowless office building. People are running and screaming. They're shouting. People, dead in the street. People screaming and running out of the office building and into a dark alley. Everyone's running. This all happens in a matter of seconds.  The narrator turns around. He looks out the window. He says, "That was a weird day."   He walks out to the street and is immediately greeted by the girl he likes.  He says he needs to go home. She walks with him a little way up to her apartment.  She walks back down to the end of the street, and he says, "...I can't go back to that.  I can't...  I'm stuck..."   They walk together in the darkness.  Then suddenly she says to him, "Let's go back home."  After a moment, they are in the dark street again.  This time, there's a bright light coming from the window and the narrator can see that it is daylight outside.  They're walking again. And this time, they walk all the way to the apartment building.  So the girl says,  "You're gonna like this apartment."  And the narrator says,   "Oh my God..."  I know, I know.  It is the worst movie ever made. It has a great soundtrack, great special effects, a great theme song (in the middle of a really boring movie) and some of the best dialog in a long time. I love the way the camera pans and zooms around. I know what the camera is going to do next. I can just feel it.  But the best part about this movie is

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A very good movie that will make you laugh. If you like funny movies then this is a movie for you. The story is really cool. All the actors are doing well in the movie. They are all very talented. It seems that the movie was produced by a small movie studio that is not big or rich enough to get a big name in the cast. This is not so big a movie that it can go over the heads of the people but still, it is a good enough movie that you can easily tell if you are laughing or crying. The ending is funny and well done.   It has a lot of nice laughs and a very funny ending.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any one who is a fan of funny movies." - David B.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, let me say that I'm a big fan of a lot of the films I've seen, and The Last Jedi has gotten a lot more attention since it was announced that Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were involved.   It's a good, albeit odd, adventure that's funny in its own way and also fun and thrilling.  The action sequences are a little too frenetic at times, but I can't deny the fun and the adventure.  This is not only the last Jedi, but also the last Star Wars film to have any real connection to the original trilogy.  It has to be one of the most bizarrely enjoyable of all the Star Wars films, as well.  I'm happy to see it on the big screen again, and I wish that a Star Wars movie could be this good again, so maybe there will be a trilogy at some point. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was shocked to find out that this is a Japanese film and not a Hollywood film, or a Japanese movie. I've seen a couple of Japanese films in the past but never one with such a bad ending. I like good endings but this one was so bad that I had to watch it again just to make sure. I was even scared to go to the toilet during the ending.   The story is about a boy, his dog, and a tiger who are traveling to the Chinese city of Shanghai. The first half of the film is about the dog getting his tail kicked by a cow and then the boy finds a baby tiger that he plans to name Nao. However, a man with a gun shoots the baby tiger and leaves it for the tiger to find.  The film is in black and white and features a cast of well known Japanese actors such as Ryuzo Sato, Mamoru Kaneda, and Katsuhiro Nakagawa.

They do a good job of bringing the story and the characters to life.    It's like a "Mad Max" meets "The Hunger Games" with vampires. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not going to lie to you. This is a bad movie. It is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of terrible movies. It's a movie that tries to tell a story that involves an alien invasion of earth, that would be more believable if they had just let it take place in New Jersey. It also tries to be a "superhero movie" by having the alien leader talking to the heroes in a robot voice, while in a fight with an alien who shoots him in the face with a flamethrower. It should have been called "Bad, Bad, Bad".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I feel it is important to mention that this is NOT a comedy. It is a dark comedy that deals with many serious issues.   For those of you who are unfamiliar with my review I will try to keep it to a short and sweet summary:  I had just finished reading a book on the Holocaust that really inspired me to read the book it is based on.  The book is called A Little Life by Peter Matthiessen and it is about a Jewish boy who gets separated from his family during World War II.  After the war he and his friend Sam are separated.  Sam is eventually taken in by an older Jewish family who live in a ghetto.  As we follow Sam we see him learn more about the Holocaust and he learns to love again.  His family eventually comes to live in America and Sam goes to a special school.  In this special school Sam learns more about himself and the Holocaust.  Eventually, Sam marries an American girl.  When Sam is still a young adult he becomes involved with a girl called Karen.  They eventually start a family and the family grows.  Things change when the Nazis come to power in Germany and their children are murdered.  But the worst thing is that when the Jews are given the option of living or dying they chose to live.  So in the end the young Jewish boy is left with a wife and a child who are both killed in the war.  What follows is the tragedy of Sam's life that ends with his child.  Now it is not a comedy that is all gloom and doom.  It has a humorous ending and a good ending.  At the end we get a bit of humor with a little "happy birthday to you" (thank God)  The acting is excellent.  It is not only the acting that is good but the direction as well.  I really enjoyed this movie and I hope you will too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to say this about "The Great White Shark".   The first few times I saw it, I didn't understand it at all, and I still don't.   You have to think about it before you can believe it.  It's a shark.  And a great shark.     I'm not sure if this is the best movie that exists - I'm sure it isn't. I am sure it is an extraordinary movie and I'm certain it's a movie that a man like me, who loves a good laugh and doesn't like being bored, would want to watch over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know it's a very strange movie, but I can't imagine someone getting a smile on their face at such an unusual movie.   It doesn't bother me that it's weird, and I can find a little humor in it.  As a storyteller, John Huston's voice is a little different from his later work, but that's a minor point in my book.  The movie has an intense, almost obsessive sense of style.  That, and the sheer ridiculousness of it all, made me laugh out loud once in a while.  I've seen more ridiculous things on screen, but this one made me feel the most nostalgic I've felt about the movies I've watched.  It's an odd and charming movie, and if you can't find a movie like this, you might want to rethink your life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first 20 minutes or so are the worst thing you will ever see in your life.  The whole movie has been built around the idea of a black kid coming to a white suburb to go to a party.  There is absolutely nothing about this story that is not ridiculous.  It starts off with an ex-con coming to town, not because he was trying to run away from his past, but because he is tired of being picked on.  Now why is he tired of getting picked on?  He doesn't want to be around his family.  He goes to school, gets bullied, and makes a friend.  This is the exact same movie every teenager feels like in the first year of high school.   This movie should have been called "The first black high schooler."    It's not funny.  In fact, it's a really horrible, depressing, racist, racist movie.  I can't recommend it.

These people are obviously mentally disturbed, why else would they stay together?  You feel sorry for them.  It would be interesting to know who they are living with.  But they are just all there to talk. I have a feeling that they were all there because there are a lot of them and they were cheap to hire a director who is so bad he can't make a good film.  This movie was made by a guy who thought his uncle would be a good director.  I feel sorry but I don't think he is good enough to be a director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember a young girl who was taken from her parents when she was only a few months old to be adopted into an orphanage. She was very bright and very beautiful. She had a very strong will to live and was a wonderful sister to her mother and to all of the other children there. Her older sister also became a nun, and I believe, at some point, had a boyfriend. She eventually met a man named John, a Catholic priest, and they became very close. They loved each other very much and spent a great deal of time together. She told him that she loved him and would not return to her parents. They lived together and raised a young child together, and when she began to have doubts about this relationship, he became angry with her. He tried to force her to give up her religious beliefs and abandon her true love to John. When she refused he began to torment and terrorize her. She tried to protect herself from him. When he discovered this he started to beat her and to break up their relationship.   He attempted to kill her many times with a hammer, and he would also hit her when she tried to break out of the house. Eventually she escaped and tried to convince John that he would never again harm her.  She got a chance to escape when she went into the woods with her dog. John followed her in a car and drove into the forest.  They got into a fight with John and his dog, and eventually she escaped again.  Then she ran to the police, and the police rescued her and the two lovers married.  It was a beautiful story with a tragic ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first thing I can remember watching when I was a kid was The Dark Crystal. And boy, is it ever great. And I think that's why it's held up. I can't say too much about the plot because I can barely remember anything from it, which isn't a good sign. But, boy, does it have it's moments.    It's basically a children's fantasy movie. And it is one of those movies I think everyone should see, even those of us who aren't crazy about the fantasy genre.  I found this one in a box at an abandoned building, and found it in one of the very best movie collections I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first and only movie that I have ever seen about a real estate agent.   When I saw this I was struck by two things: 1. The story and 2.

This movie is not only well made, but has the same feel and feel of the classic movie, I have loved since I was a child. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this movie. I don't mind very much in-depth character studies, but these guys didn't really give me anything.   This film was about a young man who was sent to war in 1941. He had a bad reputation amongst the troops, and the Nazis called him a coward. He didn't want to fight, so when his unit was attacked by a German unit, he hid.  He did a lot of fighting by himself (I never liked his character), and was pretty good. I thought he was a lot more convincing than his comrades (there were many of them). This is a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is worth seeing in order to experience one of the most underrated horror movies of the 1980's. It does a great job at not just showing the most gruesome murder scenes you've ever seen but also making the most out of the material.   The movie begins with an introduction that quickly turns into a slow burn where you get to see how everything comes to life. From the beginning the movie takes a very interesting approach, especially if you are a fan of the slasher genre.  "Oh man. I've seen a lot of people die. I have seen a few people get turned into monsters. I am ready for a good time."   You soon get to find out that this is more than a good night of drinking. A good time is what happens when someone comes upon a strange old mansion. One of the things you are immediately struck by is how a lot more sinister it seems than what it appears to be.    "We didn't know where it was," you remember hearing. "No one did."  The other things you learn about this man who finds himself in this creepy old house are his name is Don (the killer) and that he works with a woman named Maureen (a very familiar name to horror fans).   Don and Maureen are the perfect couple in every way.  "Well I've been looking for you."  One of those things that seem to come together in a very unusual way. After coming upon this house you soon learn what this man is planning to do with the body of his first victim. He intends to turn the corpse into a beautiful young woman who will make him a lot money.  Before long this killer is turning into something more than what he was at first.  One way or another this movie will haunt you forever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the movie "The Giver" in a movie theater with a group of kids. It was the most amazing movie. I will never see a movie that is more magical. My family will always think about the movie when it comes on. It has a kind of magic about it. I had such a great time watching it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen several of the  films of Richard Linklater  and I always think that he is a true American and a true human being and that this is the best movie I have ever seen about the  real American experience .   It is a wonderful movie about the lives and work of two very different people: a Texas boy whose main occupation was hunting, and a Texan farmer with a big, beautiful face and a big heart.   The movie was released during the time of the Depression, a time when all the big names in American films were being made in Texas.  This movie shows a beautiful and beautiful time in Texas and of course, there are some beautiful scenes in Texas too.  I like the film and I have a lot of respect for the actors and producers.  My favorite scenes are the ones in the backcountry: I think the boy is the only sane person in this picture. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not a movie geek. I am a person with a computer.   This is a story about two young lovers who meet on a train.  This movie isn't about a love story. It is about the story of a train journey. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Gandhi, a man with such a great story to tell, yet the film fails to deliver as much as he could."   This film has a great storyline with many interesting characters. The director has succeeded in making a documentary about a man whose life could have been totally different if he had gone to India instead of England.   The film focuses on one of the most interesting and intriguing people in Indian history: "Ghandi", who has the great fortune to be born in the same village that his father grew up in.  Ghandi was very much into his father and grew up thinking he was the only one who ever saw him smiling. However, he soon discovered that not only were his father's friends not as happy as they thought he was, but their parents never knew what a good father he was.  This led him to become a man of great principles who became a great leader. He was able to bring about a great change in India that changed the face of that country for the better.  The movie also focuses on how his life changed, and even has a musical number which is excellent.      But why did I rate it as one of my favorite documentaries?   It was a well-made movie with a great cast and well-written script. I felt that I got a good insight into one of our greatest leaders and I was able feel the depth of Ghandu's love for his wife and his sense of purpose in life.  It is a film I wish I had been able to see when it was made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very happy to be able to see this movie. It has a very good screenplay and a well-played screenplay. There is a lot of action, some of which is a little over the top, but the movie is overall very good. It is well acted and well directed, and there is a bit of romance, although the relationship between them is rather a weak one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What? I can't even begin to tell you what is so bad about this movie. I hate this movie so much it hurts my soul.   The movie opens on a hot summer day in a hot room.      There are two people in the room: a man and a woman.  A man in this case is an elderly man who looks a lot like Michael J Fox, but he isn't.  He's a guy with a mustache and a bald head and is dressed in a long black jacket, a shirt that seems too big for him, and a long overcoat that he's obviously been dragging around in the middle of the day.  The woman is a woman with a long red dress and a short red dress on top of that.  They talk about how hot it is out here, how hot, and how beautiful they are.  I am the first to admit that I've never been able to find the words to describe how I feel about hot weather like this, but I can say that it's not the same kind of hot as the kind of heat that hits a city on the weekend.  When I hear about hot summer weather, I think of things like:  A hot summer sun that shines on your skin so brightly that it becomes blinding.  Something hot, something you can feel when you walk in the sun.  An angry wind that blows, the kind that feels like a thousand needles hitting your face.  Heat that seems to come out of nowhere.  What the movie doesn't show is how it feels to walk in those kinds of conditions.  After having this movie play out over and over in my head, I realize that I am completely powerless over it.  But I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay $18.99 for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be quite a lot like my childhood.   It is very simple.  It features a few kids who go to a summer camp and they fall in love.  I think that my favorite aspect of this movie is the singing.  While this movie was fun, I never found this to be a very good movie, but I am not sure why.  There is no real romance in this movie, no real story.  If you are looking for something funny, a simple summer movie, then look no further than

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This movie takes place in a world where vampires rule.   They live underground, and they have one job: to hunt down and kill human prey.  The movie doesn't waste time telling us this, instead focusing on the story of a hunter who has a very different idea about what to do with the humans he finds.  We are introduced to our protagonist, an orphan named Adam (Liam Gallagher) who lives alone in an underground home where he has grown up. He has not had the best life so far: he lost his parents in a mysterious accident when he was four and was raised by a family of vampires.  This is the premise of the movie: we follow Adam on his search for a human prey to kill and bring back to his home so that his family can eat it.  I loved this movie, and I liked the idea behind it. I didn't love it all that much: I just liked it better than a lot of the vampire movies that came out around the time of this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time.   The story is really entertaining and really has you thinking and asking yourself questions.  It has a lot to answer for and is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. It has everything going for it. It is funny, well-acted, and has a good story.  There are a lot of great ideas that the movie takes a few chances on.  I was expecting a different kind of film from this one, but it wasn't anything like that. It was more like a different film that was trying to be funny.  The acting was great.  This is a great film, you won't be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best action movies I've seen in years.   There's some really cool stuff here, and the story makes a good case for the movie's greatness.  The story of   is about a team of soldiers sent to investigate a mysterious series of attacks on soldiers, and who turn out to be demons.  A group of soldiers are captured by a demon, and in an attempt to save them, the team tries to kill the demon instead of killing the soldier.

To do this, the demon takes on the human form, but instead of attacking the soldier, it kills all the humans around him, taking their souls. The humans have been living in a strange world where they have to kill their own kind to survive.  After some time, a group of human-demon hybrids have created a town called ? ?.  After this town, the soldiers come back to their senses, but have no idea what happened to the demon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Taken from the script: When his mother is gravely ill, her son discovers that the last surviving member of the family has taken up with his older brother and that they are both engaged to other women."   This movie is about two brothers and the love they have for each other. The movie is good and it is very close to what we can hear the brothers talk about. It is not the kind of movie that you would like to watch with your mother. But at the same time it is the kind that you can watch with friends and family.

It was a cute movie, and I didn't really enjoy it all that much. I'm kind of torn about liking it, because I liked other movies more. But I think I enjoyed the movie a little bit more than the other movies I liked. I found the movie quite funny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know this review is going to be a disappointment to some of you out there, but please take this in.   It's one of the most well-written movies I've seen in a while.  It has a great cast and a great script that has the best of the best.  The plot is simple and yet it manages to be full of twists and turns.  I think this movie is pretty close to perfect, as far as the story goes.  This movie is more about what you'd expect from a movie like this: A girl goes off to visit her parents, finds out they are both dead, and the girl tries to make peace with the fact that she lost both of her parents in a car accident.  But what this movie has going for it is the fact, that the movie manages to deliver a great performance out of all the talent on the film.  With all the great acting, the great plot, and a plot that is a masterpiece of simplicity.  Now, I know that the ending is going be a bit confusing for people, and I'm sure that it's going to throw a few people off, but in the end, you'll love the movie because it's so good, you won't really even notice the little things that they do to make the plot work.  As the story is a bit hard to follow, I would recommend watching the film twice.  You might be a little lost at times, but it is amazing what this cast can do with a little help.  Some of the scenes are really hard to watch because of the simple script, but when the acting is done well, and it's the perfect combination of the cast acting, and good plot, it's hard to not love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It really is a good story about a boy who is going to have his first ever relationship and the relationship turns out to be a relationship between a man and a woman. The man in the story has a strong and bad side and the story is really about the man and the boy. There is love and there is life and then there are emotions and thoughts and all that makes this a good film.    Helpful a good friend of a family member in a bad part of town and the guy is kind of like a guardian angel that they turn to. The film takes place over a period of time in which the family is in and out of jail and the movie is really interesting because the story lines change at random and the characters are never quite the same. The music is good and the acting is good too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't want to watch a movie about vampires and zombies. So I had to do the work of three vampires, all different and all pretty scary.   "I hate myself, and everyone around me." The vampires are played by the likes of Peter Falk, Robert Englund, and Peter Boyle, all of them in their prime.  So, yes, the vampires really get to show off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie stars Jeff Bridges as the man who is the last living link between two very different worlds. There are three of them: one is a modern industrial state where the working people have few rights, the other a rural culture where the rich are free and the poor are forced to live in slums. The third world is a mythical world, which in reality is based on a real-life village in France. The three different cultures meet to discuss the future of their worlds. They come to a conclusion by an agreement: in the future a society will be created where the poor will have a certain amount of freedom, but the rich will have the same rights and the rich people will live in the old-fashioned way.   While the first part is more or less like a French-language-language version of the second part of the movie "The Great Escape" (the third part would have been much more interesting, but it is not possible for a movie of this kind to be as good as the first one), the second half is like an American version of "The Jungle Book", a fairy tale which has a happy ending (and a very long one, too).   I think that Jeff Bridges is an excellent actor, so it's a little hard to see how he could play a part that was not so good. His character is in a poor neighborhood and there's a gang called the Wild Bunch. He becomes part of their gang. In the beginning of the film he is called "Lincoln" and in the second or third scene he is suddenly called "Little John." The Wild Bouncers are very clever men who are really dangerous.  This is an interesting movie which should be shown in a few theatres all over the country.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is so good it almost makes you want to cry, with its emotional intensity and its brilliant and beautiful cinematography.   I was so impressed with the movie and it made me think a lot about the movie I saw last year in a festival called the Film Festival of the World, where I saw the film 'In the Beginning' by David Lynch and the film called 'The Book of Eli' by Werner Herzog.  This movie is a lot like the latter but more, a bit more, and even a bit sadder.  I don't think there are many movies in this world where you can so vividly feel what is happening to a man's body while he is in bed.  It's really great to see the film in its raw form without any editing and without any sound effects.  The film is shot with a very high quality of film and there is a wonderful mood to it.  A movie like this should really be watched at least once before it is too late and there isn't a lot of time to think about it. And there are so many things I want to say about this film:  The acting is excellent and so is the acting of the actresses.  As the man becomes more and more insane he becomes more human and more vulnerable.  Some of the characters are like a part of a dream, like a bad dream.  There are a lot or details that I didn't even notice until I watched the movie again.  At one point the man has a bad night of sleep, he comes to this cabin to get some rest, and when he tries to get up he starts to hallucinate about the horrible things happening to him.  Once the hallucinations start to take a hold he is very vulnerable and you can feel the pain he is going through.  After that he passes out, and at that point there is no one around, so he can't get help or even help himself.  His wife seems to be the one who has the most insight about what is going on and they discuss things with each other.  He is going mad.  When he comes round it seems as though his madness has affected all of the people in his family.  Eventually he passes his madness on to the others, but before that he has to face his own.  With all of this going on there is an interesting sub plot about the wife of the woman who is to bear his child.  You see, he thinks he is
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe it has been 10 years since   This is the most accurate depiction of life that I have ever seen.   It seems like we've been in a time warp and the present doesn't make sense. It has been a decade since I was watching the original version.  A decade!   One of the reasons I love this movie is that it is so very personal.  The main character is a divorced mother of four children. She loves them and is so happy to see them grow. It doesn't help that her oldest son is a total jerk.  She is so sad that she decides to start going to a new yoga class.  It's not long before she falls in love with the teacher.  Then it gets even sadder.  When the teacher tries to warn her about her son, it is heartbreaking.  However, it gets worse.  We learn that the teacher has two teenage sons. One who is a bully, and the other who is in some ways a better person.  What a terrible picture!  It was such a joy to see a movie that was so real and sad and yet so relatable.  You felt everything that the little girl in this movie went through.      If you ever watch a movie with a character that you don't like, then do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  For those of you who hate watching a good drama, you can't do it justice.

I love a good horror movie, and this is a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this with a bunch of friends from my high school. It was one of those rare times when a bunch (my group included) all shared one movie, and I mean a very good movie, with one another.   The movie starts with a small, small town in Illinois called Elwood. It's a sleepy little town of 7,000 people (population: 6,000 in the winter), and it's the middle of nowhere.  And then there's a tornado.  The town is in shambles.  It seems every household has been destroyed, and a lot of people are missing, along with their pets.   The tornado's not the only thing destroying Elwood; there are also a lot more "bad guys" in town.  There are a lot, and most of the "bad guy" activity seems to be occurring in an abandoned high school that had been turned into a prison.  As the tornado begins to move out, we see all the characters trying to survive, each one trying to get out of town, out of the high school and out of Elwood, Illinois.  In a rather impressive bit of acting, Jeff Daniels plays the town doctor, and he does a fantastic job of portraying a kind and caring doctor who seems to care a lot for his patients.  Unfortunately, the good doctor also has a few flaws, and this causes him to make some questionable decisions that cause a lot trouble in the town.   In particular, Daniels has a tendency to make statements like "The doctor had a heart attack, and is dying," when it might be better to say "He was sick, and was dying."  After this, there are a few scenes showing the townspeople trying to move on, but things are not pretty, and everyone knows it.  So we see this small town, with a lot going on, slowly falling apart.  With so much going on at the school and in town, people start to forget that it's a movie, which is why the ending really isn't that satisfying.  This movie should have been a real tear jerker, and it could have been, if the characters in this movie didn't keep getting into the way of things.  Most of the characters, from the school kids to the police officers to the doctor, all seemed to want to take advantage of each other for some reason.  They seem to act more and more like bad movies rather than a documentary.

The plot is stupid and unrealistic, the setting is absurd and contrived, the acting is laughable and I can't tell you how much I laughed out loud in one scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had to watch this movie because there was no other choice. I love the old 80's movies and this is one of my favorites.   Like me the movie starts out with a woman named Lela who is married to a man named Sam who is really bad. The movie then takes a turn for the bizarre. The whole town turns to look at a mysterious figure who runs around town shooting people. It gets crazier and crazier until the town gets so scared that they go and hide in the attic. Now you are probably thinking this is about a girl. Well it kind of is but a little bit more than that. This is about the town and this strange guy who is looking for something. When he finds it Lela runs away and this ends up with the whole town turning on her. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd be remiss not to mention how great this film is!   From a plot perspective, I don't know what else to say about it, other than that it's well-written, entertaining and quite well acted.   There's a nice mixture of romance and comedy here, with the film taking its time to build its characters and plot, and then delivering a nice, satisfying climax.  This has all the hallmarks of a good comedy: the absurdist humor, the slow build and then a dramatic payoff, the comedy mixed with a touch of romance.  I like to think this was a happy accident that came from the director's true love of comedy: this film has more laughs than I can count.  If you don't like these types of movies, then you really shouldn't go to see it, because it's really the only way to see a good film.  - IMDb
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I heard that this movie was being made and casted by a famous British director I was so excited about it. It was so funny and so good. I thought that they were all great. The actors were also very good. The movie took place in a British pub which looked like a bar and the movie was about a bar. The British pub was in a little pub called "The Queen." When a strange girl came in who was wearing a black costume and a little black skirt with no panties and a black top with a little lace dress that fell down to the knees she called out to the British man in the pub, and the pub was all the way across the street from a bar called "Cherry Tree" which also looked like an old bar with a wooden roof, and there was a black and red and white barman named Jack who served drinks there who got his job by singing "Coke, Coke, Coca Cola," and there were a bunch of other Englishmen, a Scottish and a Frenchman, there was also a Russian who sang about a woman with a large red nose and a large round belly and a Russian man who told his wife he was in love with her and would never find a real woman who he could truly love. And there was another Englishman who called out that he had to get the girl and he went in the back and got a beer in a glass and drank it and then he came back out and he told the barman to get a bottle and he came out and told the girl to get out and she ran to the other side of the street and went down a dark alley. There was a big white man who said he had a car that was so big he could drive through the alley and into the pub and he said he would make her come out of the alley with him. She ran into the back of a bar that looked like it was from the middle ages and the little girl who looked like she was about 13 ran out of that pub and went into the next pub that looked a lot like it and the woman in the next bar said she thought she heard the little boy singing "I Love You," and the other people in the little pub said they knew who that was singing. It took a while for the two little boys to find out who the song was about and then they came out to get them and they got the girl who they knew was the girl they had seen in the alley.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You may think you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we all know that's a myth. This film is a wonderful exercise in 'what if' thinking. As in many stories, a man is trapped in the last days before the end, and has a few good things happen to him that make him hopeful. However, things get very, very serious when the light finally comes around and the man is no longer in danger of being eaten by a hungry horde of cannibalistic cannibals. So, there you have it. The 'What if' is real. I was a little worried about this film being too silly and cliché, but the best I can say about it is that I am not going to miss it when it is all over. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is always worth seeing.   The film is set in a small town in the north west of England.  The townsfolk, the locals.  John Hurt is as usual one of the best actors in any film. His performance is a bit grating at the beginning, but then becomes very enjoyable and the story gets better and better.  My favourite actor from the movie is, of course, John Hurt.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending. It wasn't my favourite part of the film, but I guess the film is long, so I would have loved to have seen more of the town, and of the main character.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the beginning of the movie, an alien shows up, and after a while, the creature reveals himself. It is actually a very nice looking alien with a very unique design, he is about 6 feet tall, and very slim, he wears a very good looking red and black suit, very high quality, very dark, a bit of a good looking clown, the only thing I didn't like was the mouth, it looks too big, but he is still quite funny and his laugh is good.   Unfortunately the alien doesn't speak or make any other sound, and it is kind of hard to understand him, it takes some time to get him out of the screen.  Unfortunately, there is some horrible CGI, most of the creatures are just one body, with different limbs.  One thing I really liked about this was that the aliens look like they could have been real, but the effects are so good that you can't really tell.  This movie was really great, it is a really great sequel to the original movie, even though this is not a sequel, but a remake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is the story of a woman who is being blackmailed by her employer and her friends. The plot line is simple, and it makes you watch the movie with a clear conscience.   The story of the plot:  - A young girl is hired by an agency to make a movie about a boy that she has been close to. This girl is not to be trusted.  - Her friend is blackmailed into doing her bidding, and there is much fun to be had in the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is one of those moments in every movie where you can't wait to have another look. This movie was a reminder of how much fun it was to be out on a movie set.   It was wonderful to see Paul Giamatti as the film's lead character, as if he had been sitting on a set for the last half a century.  Giamcci's character was the most likable and sincere character I have ever seen in a movie, he had the courage to tell his story to a director who had no idea how to act, and yet it all worked.  I think this movie might have been the best thing that happened in 1993 and I'm glad it is over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   What's a movie about a man who doesn't give a flying fuck what anyone thinks, when everyone is staring at him in awe?   A man so powerful that his presence is inescapable, that he is in your head at all times, that no one can ever leave you alone? A man with an enormous ego who thinks he's the best thing in the world?  A man so utterly clueless that he can't even comprehend the fact that he's being judged by people who never gave a shit about him in the first place? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the best movie I've ever seen.   As bad as I think I am for being bored and watching this movie, there are some scenes in this movie which are so good, I'm glad that I didn't see this movie when I was a kid.  I think that I would rather see a movie like this today then the shitty Hollywood movies that were released in the 50s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure why I didn't see this before - it's about a family (the Blutars) living in the woods. The mom is a bit of a bad girl, the dad is a decent guy but not quite. It doesn't take long for these two to realize that their future will be bleak unless a mysterious stranger appears to rescue them. It's a good, not quite horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on opening night at the theater that showed "the big two" (i.e., "The Good Wife" and "The West Wing").   The movie is very good.   But, the most interesting thing is that when you are watching this movie you are actually watching a story about a group of people who are on the outside looking in and who want to be part of the system. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a lover of all things weird, dark, and twisted I enjoyed this film.   This is a nice creepy story about a man who meets a young woman who seems to have some supernatural powers and a past that haunts him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so good I had to watch it a second time.   I love all the characters.  The story is so interesting and you feel sorry for the kids.  If I don't like a movie I should at least watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a film that's always on my mind. It's about a little girl who is born with the power to change what's around her. She learns that all the kids in the neighbourhood are made from the same old parts. When the police show up, she decides to change things herself.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most intense, nerve-wracking and gripping movie of my life! In fact, it is one of the most intense and nerve-racking movies I have ever watched - there's even an orgasm scene at the end!   This movie was an absolute revelation and was truly an eye-opener.   When I started watching this movie at age 15, I had absolutely no idea what it was about. I'm sure it had something to do with an Italian thriller called  "Avenging Angel"   and its main character - a young man who is trying to figure out why his brother - a well-known detective - is not coming home from work. I didn't understand any of this and was totally confused.  There are so many things that I didn''t understand. I don't even know how to classify these two scenes.      There was a scene where a couple - a couple of beautiful women - are having a conversation about how they can't sleep. One woman asks the other if she can take her back to her place. She is going to take a nap but the woman refuses.  The woman asks if she is scared. She then starts to get turned on by the other woman.  This woman is clearly not a virgin.  The woman then tells the man that she is going back to sleep.  Her face is bright red as she says that.  She then tells him that she can't get aroused and he's wrong because he has never been aroused by a woman. The guy responds that he doesn't know what she is talking about. He then says to her that she really is beautiful and then goes back to his place.  Then, there is another scene with the same woman who is about to take her nap. The man asks her to take some pills with him. They then proceed to have a wonderful erotic love-making session with this woman. I could watch this for hours and hours. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you were going to see a "star vs bad guy" movie at the time, then this one would be a great choice.   The movie is filled with action scenes and the star, and his stuntman, seem to be having the time of their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old fashioned, but well acted thriller.   One of the reasons it's been so good is that the actors have really gotten into the character of John Dillinger.  They do it with real warmth and a great sense of humor.  The film is about a hit man who can't seem to forget that he can't shoot people without first making sure that they are dead.  And the final confrontation has to have an effect.  It's also a well-written movie that has a lot of humor, including some good one-liners.  But it's mostly well acted and it shows in the way Dillinger comes across. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you watch this movie, you will not find anything bad about it. It is an interesting story about a group of young people on a camping trip and some strange happenings that occur in the woods. This movie is about the young ones being out in nature and how they react to certain things.   It is a very funny and interesting movie with great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, the premise is stupid. I mean, really stupid. The only things in this film that are real are the movie stars and that they are actually going to kill each other for money. There is no need for a villain, this is like the worst action movie ever made.   The second and last thing in the film that is real is the acting.  I have seen better acting in a comedy like Airplane  or even a western like A Fistful of Dollars.   This is only the second time that I've seen the entire film so I'm not sure why it is so good but that doesn't matter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had to wait an hour to get to the movie. I saw the trailer and the preview at a party the other night and thought it looked fun.   The cast is great, though I wish they'd spent a little more time with the lead and the other characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a real good movie, not a bad one.  It is a movie of great imagination and very good storytelling.   A great film with a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well that's a great ending for a very good movie.   It's almost impossible to talk about the movie without mentioning that it is a very dark and edgy one. But I must say that the violence is minimal, and the only thing the audience can really see is a group of people walking in a swamp. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say, this is a great movie, with a great message. A young man, who is a student and lives in a college town, goes out to the countryside to go to the movies to see a movie called "The Three Little Pigs" with his girlfriend and he gets a good laugh out of the movie and finds out about some old friends he had in the Army in World War II. It ends with a picture of the three little pigs standing up in a tree, and they turn into a rabbit and a bear. Well, this movie is worth seeing and seeing again, because it has a great little message and there is an ending that is pretty funny too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You want a good story?"   Well, this one's a good one, with a solid story that you can watch through multiple viewings to understand and enjoy.   From the opening scene, the character, Tuck, is just the type of guy you want to have a drink with.  His charm, his humor, and his intelligence are enough to keep the audience guessing what's coming next.  He's smart, he's athletic, he loves the ladies, he has a good heart, and he's not afraid to show it.  I'm a fan of both men, and I'm not sure why anyone would turn off a good comedy.  It's a very dark comedy, with an evil, manipulative, yet relatable villain.  There's a wonderful scene where a woman is trying to get to Tuck's party.  She makes several bad decisions, like getting in a cab when Tuck is on a date with another woman, and getting a ride for him instead of taking a cab herself.  Even worse is that she's wearing his suit jacket!  The movie doesn't just have an evil villain who seems to enjoy the pain he causes other people and people like Tuck.  The evil mastermind is an evil mastermind who seems like he'd do anything to get what he wants.  In a way, it's all the things we think we know about villains.  If the evil mastermind were to show his true colors, we would learn he really only has a few true motivations.  When Tuck asks how long it's been since he's had a real drink, the villain replies, "A few hours."  There are some good moments in the film, but none are as good as the scene where Tuck finds a mysterious envelope at the party and learns it's actually a letter addressed to him.  At first, it looks like he's a fool, who'll never be able to remember the meaning of the letter.  Then, the letter says, "Don't worry. I've gotten you something else."  The letter contains a letter opener.  This, coupled with the fact that the villain says he knows how to open letters, is enough to convince Tuck that he's an idiot, and to throw him into the pool.  Tuck swims all the way out, and manages to retrieve the letter opener from the pool's depths.  After he opens it, he realizes that the letter
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . The main character, a small boy named Mikey, has a rough childhood. He was picked up in a truck and left at a train station in Iowa and never seen again. He is then found in a creek in California with no memory of how he got there. He has a dog, Mikey.   The story line is fun, but very sad at the same time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A friend of mine and I have been talking about this movie for weeks now, and while the script is probably a little convoluted at times, I think that a movie about a kid, a girl, and their dog was the greatest thing ever:  I was a little upset to realize that the final shot in this movie is just of the dog.   The dog is like the best thing to happen to movies since Hitchcock used to put on a movie.  I can only hope that this movie gets picked up by other studios, and then maybe a little less nonsense can be expected from them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second half of this movie is more and more interesting. I would not mind more scenes with the crew, but a big part of this is the film's ending, which is very well-done, with a hint of Hitchcock and a hint (but a very big one) of Stanley Kubrick.   In Conclusion: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie when it was in theaters and I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. I could not believe what I was seeing. A bunch of kids try to steal a car that is being chased by a gang and fail.   In the end, they end up at the police station, where the head detective says that they will not be able to catch them.  They will be taken to the police headquarters, where a cop gives a speech that is so funny and so stupid that I had to laugh out loud.  I did not laugh out louder than I did at this movie.  I found it hard to believe that a police officer would believe that teenagers who had been out partying so hard that they had been so drunk that they did not even know how to drive were trying to steal cars.  A cop that is supposed to be so sensible and law abiding could not see anything that was not in a movie.      After the film, I asked the movie theater about it and they said that this movie was very popular at the time and that it was not easy to find out where to see it. I do not know what is funny about a bunch of teenagers driving a car, but it is very funny to me!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. I've seen a lot of films since I was a teenager, and this is one of the best. The acting is perfect, and the story is well-written. It's an exciting and funny movie, and I was entertained every minute of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know who this movie is about.   It's the little old ladies.  They have to go down from their cottage to the village, because that's all they can think of doing.  It is very difficult for the ladies to walk down the hill with the little dog by their side.  The dog has a wonderful personality, especially when they come back.  After they get back, the dog is going to go with them to the cottage, and then they'll have to take the little boat across to the sea and come back, but it all gets complicated when they have to stay on the island all day and then get back to the island in the evening.  I hope they go down a few more times.  If they did go down, they would be gone before dark.  Well, I guess that's a good thing for us, because we don't know how long they are going to be gone from the cottage. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an old fashioned, yet very enjoyable movie.   It is not an action film at all. It is a very well written story about a young boy named Charlie.  The story is about Charlie's childhood, and his father's absence.  I was happy to see some old-fashioned action with Charlie and his horse.  It did not make me want to rush to the theater to see the second part of the story.  A bit too long to be a good action movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is one of those movies I will never forget.   I first heard of this movie when I was a young kid watching The Flintstones for the first time.  This movie had that same quirky tone and style that I loved so much about the old cartoons.  The Flintstone family in this movie is always doing their best to be a family who loves each other, who is together, and who will never grow old.  I also loved how the Flintstone kids went on adventures and found a way to always triumph.  With the help of the family pets, the characters never grew old and there was always a reason to be optimistic about the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I have to say that this is a very good movie, with some really interesting ideas to tell. But at the same time I have a little problem with the ending. I think it is a little bit rushed and a little too predictable.   The story is interesting and I like the way it is told. It is more of an adventure story but not so much a fantasy movie like the other movies in this series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this was a fantastic movie, in fact, it is my favourite comedy of all time.   I'm not going to spoil anything, but the way they shot the film was spectacular, it was like a real laugh riot!   This movie made me smile every time I watched it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just found out about this movie at work. I liked it so much I made it my go to movie. I am glad I saw it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fantastic film from one of the best actors of all time. It is a beautiful film about a man who sees the value of each little thing, every bit of joy he finds. It isn't a perfect film, and it isn't the "worst" of the genre, but it is one of those films that you need to see. It would make for a great film to watch with a small child. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't see this movie in cinemas or on TV but saw it on Youtube and thought I would give it a try.   It's not a bad movie, nor an entertaining one.  I think that people who don't know about the movie or aren't interested in this type of movie shouldn't bother going to the cinema.  It is just a cheap and boring movie about a rich guy who finds out that he's the only person who doesn't like to see prostitutes.  But he's not so rich he can't afford to go to a brothel, so he makes a deal with a prostitute to become a doctor.  This is a movie for older people who have seen it before or have seen the film version of It's a Wonderful Life.  When he finds out the reason he likes the prostitutes is because they give him a great view of the countryside.  What a movie, how cheap and dull it is.  The movie could have been made by any American actor and director because it doesn't take any effort to make it look like a cheap movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie will leave you impressed   And that is no understatement!   I am a HUGE horror movie junkie. I am also a HUGE fan of good actors like Tom Hanks, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kevin Bacon. This is the best one of them all, period!  I recommend this to anyone who likes a good scary movie with a twist.
