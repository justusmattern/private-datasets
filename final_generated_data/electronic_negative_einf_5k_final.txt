Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am returning the unit because of the following: 1) the battery would not charge at all, even when fully charged.2) there is a very slight, yet very loud clicking noise coming from the unit.I called Sony for help and they offered no assistance.  I tried turning the volume down and it does nothing.  The unit simply refuses to charge.  Please discontinue this unit immediately. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these for my Sony CD player and one for my Yamaha CD player. The Sony CD players work fine on my PC, but when I try to stream CD's to my Yamaha it works only for music. The Yamaha CD players stream to my PC but only for CD audio files, not for MP3 files.  I returned both the Sony and Yamaha CD-Players, and am using a Sanyo TX-NR500X for my CD player instead. I'm returning the Sanyos because the unit will not record MP3's as they are played through the Sony. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using this product for several years, now I have two new printers. I had my original printer for only three months. The ribbon cable that came with my new one is too short, and I have to buy new ones. The new ribbon cable has a spring that breaks. I am very disappointed with this purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I thought it was a good deal. Well, it is actually a bad deal.  I called up Microsoft Tech Support and explained that it is not possible to power my PC off of the CD player. They said it is possible if you have a powered USB hub but this will only work on Windows XP.  So, the CD-ROM drive does not function!  If you expect to charge your computer, use the USB cable to connect to the computer. You will have to use your computer to turn it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It looks like a nice little mouse, but after only a couple of months of use it has begun to get very dirty.  I have to re-wash the button every few weeks.  It also begins to lose its rubber coating on the middle mouse button.  After a few weeks the rubber begins to become very discolored.  So far the worst

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these monitors about a month ago, and now have two broken monitors. I ordered the wrong ones - the 4 inch screen is too small, the 6 inch screen was the right size, but the 6 inches of the 4 is way too much, and the 4 inches of my 6 inches is WAY too small. These screens are very thin and hard to grip with your hand. The customer service at Amazon was great about getting me replacements, but they sent them out and took forever.I just returned my 6 inch LCD monitor, and ordered a 4 inch LCD from Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product description on the Amazon.com site doesn't give you any information as to which type of connector is included.  I ordered the 2 pin version.  The only way to plug the product in is to use the standard Philips connector - which has the connector that is meant to fit into the unit.  In a few hours, I found out that only one pin was included with the item, and that was the 2P6.  There is nothing that can be done to get around this - you either get a broken item, or pay the extra cost to have the product sent in for repair.  Needless to say, I will never buy another item from Amazon

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this so my wife could print out things like receipts and coupons and stuff.  I was able to print two business cards and two copies of a check.  However, once it was used to print one business card I was unable to print another.  It seems that this printer works only with one sheet of A4. I could have bought one of those sheets for the same price.  They are very cheap, and I expected better quality.  So, I am tossing this printer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought these in November for a friend's computer, and received them in December.  The first thing I noticed was that there was a hole in the DVD-R reader cover, and the reader wouldn't fit any more.  I contacted HP customer service, who sent me a new cover.  But the problem persisted.  Then the drive stopped working altogether.  Called HP, and they sent me another one.  After that, I began to have more trouble with the system booting up.  When it finally booted, I realized that I had used the original cover for the DVD drive, and not the replacement.  HP, you should be ashamed of yourselves 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 2 of these from Amazon and they are both broken.The first one I ordered broke right away, the replacement one was fine until it was time to make an install. I called Amazon and said I would try and return it to them. I was told it wasn't their problem, they had to issue a return.So now I'm out over $50 on this one, and the one they sent back was also in perfect working condition. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received an email from the support representative saying that the product had a defect in it.  However, I didn't get a replacement box as I expected from Apple.  I called the support line and got transferred to an agent at Amazon who tried to help me with a new box.  Then she refused to refund the money.  No refunds from Amazon will be given because the box doesn't work.  It is extremely frustrating to have a great product from Apple and have to pay full price on Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was expecting a better quality product and I was not even a little surprised at the horrible pictures that came with it.  I put it together using the directions given, and tried to connect to my computer via my Airport Extreme Wireless.  After about 1.5 minutes of trying to do so with the product on the screen, it would not come on.  Tried several times and it wouldn't come back.  Finally I called Tech Support and had them call customer service who, after some very annoying chitchat with no help at all, informed me that there was nothing they could do.  To make a long story even longer, the product was clearly made in China which is the most important thing for a consumer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this and it was delivered on July 29th, not July 22nd as it was stated in the ad. So I called customer service on July 30th and they confirmed to me that it was shipped on July 22. Well I received it on July 28th. That's only a few weeks from the date it was advertised, so I contacted Sony and they shipped me another set of two for free, but they said this one wouldn't work. So they sent me another one for free and it worked fine for the first month or so. Then I received a notice that the product was discontinued and they would no longer accept returns or exchanges, even though they were the ones that shipped the product.  I've contacted Sony several times, asking them why this happened, but no one's been able to get a satisfactory answer.  Sony is shipping defective products, if they were good and reliable, they wouldn't have to discontinue them. Sony needs to take all the bad reviews and get rid of the defective products. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this cable and it has a problem.  The red wire doesn't go to the power brick.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It came with an Epson V600 inkjet printer cartridge, which I would have to buy at my local store, then reinsert into the cartridge holder.  Not a good solution.  If you can print a single sheet of paper with your printer, this is not a problem.  But if you are going to print many, many sheets of paper, buy Epson cartridges or go with a dedicated printer.  That is all

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my third Dell laptop. The first was a Inspiron 7559. I returned it because of poor performance with the touchpad. The second was a Latitude E5430. I returned it because the touch pad didn't work in the middle of the night. The third was a Dell Latitude 1040. I finally returned it after a week because the battery started to die.    I recommend Dell look at the laptop models it sells and develop a new model with a touchpad/mouse combination.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product in November to install and was told they didn't ship the units in time for Christmas.  I called the customer support line and was put on hold for 4 minutes!  They told me that I should return the units to Amazon and they would refund the difference.  Well guess what I never got them and now am stuck with this old design.  There is a big difference between a  $20 RCA cable and the $20 generic Sony cable. I can't even figure out which one goes to which receiver.  Amazon and other online retailers will sell you the generic cable but not the RCA one.  This cable is too short and there is too much slack in the connector.  The only reason I went with the Sony product was because I had the best price for it. I have a Sony receiver and a Sony satellite receiver. The Sony cable is way too short, too thick and has a bunch of slack that makes it impossible to use without cutting into the plastic connector. I bought my RCA Sony cable at Lowe's for only $20

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this to replace an aging Sony CD player that stopped working.  I expected it to work well as the Sony CD players I've used over the years.  WRONG.  After several days of trying, I called Sony and was told that this CD player didn't work with the older Sony CD recorders.  They offered me a $10 credit to send the CD player back.  Then they told me that they have no record that I ordered a Sony CD recorder.   The CD player would not play anything.  The sound quality was OK, but not good enough to listen to CDs.  Very disappointed.  Hopefully, someone will know how to make this work.  Will definitely not buy from them again.  Get something with better performance 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to buy this product because of the 5 star reviews.  I wanted a CD player for my X-Arcade machine.  The CD player does not even have a button to select the cd's, you have to open the unit to select a song.  It also does not have a remote, only the control panel.  Very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does not provide a good experience for recording.   I tried a bunch of different ways to record using the built in recorder.  Each one resulted in either too much static or too much noise.  I returned my purchase and purchased another one, but the noise reduction did not help.  If you plan to use the product to record an event with live performances or live sound, you will have to use a program like XACT to add the sound file before using this product.  The sound is great for the occasional sound check or at the end of a program, but you will get static.  It is an OK product for casual home use, but it does not deliver a great recording experience. I recommend you find an alternative product if you plan on using this one for recording any kind of sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took almost a year to arrive from Amazon.  After several hours of searching, I finally got it.  But it is not working right.   The button is supposed to turn it on and off, but when I turn it off, the unit never turns on.  I have ordered several of these items from Amazon in the past and always received them quickly.  This time I ordered a replacement from Walmart and have already sent it back.  Hopefully this time Amazon will deliver the correct product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item and I received it 3 days after I placed the order. The item arrived damaged.  It is not clear from the pictures where all the connections are. The USB cable is shorted so it only works with Windows. I returned it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a very good idea in theory, but the product turned out to be defective. The connector is too small for my computer. It is not easy to change the connectors on your own. There are a lot of videos online on how to change them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought 2 of these and one died on me.  Now I have 2 dead ones.  If I had bought the one with the longer warranty, I wouldn't have a problem.  It took about 2 weeks to get them to send me one that was not defective.  This is a mistake.  Don't buy them if you want to be able to use them for more than 5 minutes 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this CD burner and was hoping that it would make transferring my files to my new computer much faster and easier.

I'm not going to buy another product from anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's not easy to find a working ethernet card on Amazon, or at Radio Shack.  This card is worthless!  I've replaced it twice now and both times the card was dead on the first boot.  I had to return it, and order a new card from Amazon.  It costs a lot more than this, and does not include the 2 radio interfaces.  The card itself is useless.  Do not buy this card.  If you must use the card for an HTPC or similar use, get a different card. I would give it a 0 if this were Radio Shack 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had a lot of trouble with my Philips system. I called about this one only to get a return label that showed that I already had the product. So I returned the unit for a new one.  I tried both the Philips and Kenwood remote controls. They do not work together.  If you can, get the remote with the two functions working. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two of these because I wanted to save on the power cord. I did not order the power adapter that came with the unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item has a lot of issues. I'm using it for a scanner. The scanner works fine for the moment, but when I try to transfer a file, the device freezes and no matter how many times I turn the unit off and on, it keeps freezing up. I am not making this up. It does not work right. I returned it and purchased a Dell product. It was also defective. I will probably get another Dell. I would not recommend buying anything else from them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just returned from a long and unsuccessful attempt to get my Dell laptop to boot from the CD-ROM.  While it's possible the laptop may have been bad or the CD drive was faulty, I'm fairly certain that the issue is with the printer.  When the computer reboots, the print-screen appears blank and the printer does not print anything.  The first attempt to print was with the OEM Epson ink cartridge.  Unfortunately, the cartridge was half full.  I returned the cartridge for a replacement and the problem is still not resolved.  After waiting 20 minutes, I turned on the computer, tried a second time, and it still did not work.  This printer needs to go out of production.  If you have a Dell CD-RW drive and want to print, buy a regular HP CD-R.  Otherwise, avoid purchasing this printer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed in this purchase.  I did not even get a chance to try it out before the package arrived.  The unit I received had a dead short at the connector.  Apparently, you can't have a short at both ends of the cable, and this is the one I received.  After much reading and phone calls, I finally managed to get the company to send me a replacement cable.  Unfortunately, it came with a dead end and not a working end.  It was sent to me back as a replacement.  Don't waste your money on this.  Spend it on a decent cable or something else

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these speakers because they are advertised as "IPX6 Certified".  Unfortunately, the IPX6 certification is meaningless, as it is a "measurement of sound quality", not durability.

The "IPEX" label seems to mean absolutely nothing

When I powered on my laptop for the first time, my hard drive failed!  I returned it immediately, but now I have to go back and buy new hard drive for both machines.  I would avoid this item entirely, if you can.  It won't protect your files from accidental loss

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These do not work with my HP Network printer. I called HP support and they said to return for a new one. I tried to return my old one but they wouldn't ship it to me. I ended up buying a printer from NewEgg for $80 which works perfectly. This is clearly a mistake on HP's part. I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

After having this product connect the printer only to fail, I returned it and ordered a HP scanner for my HP Laserjet printer which also failed to connect with the HP CD player.  The HP CD scanner is the only one that I can use to scan my photos and this product does NOT work.  It is also impossible to find support for this product anywhere 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i received a brand new  SONY CD player from Amazon.com and it was defective.  Amazon offered to ship me a new unit and they charged a second fee.  It arrived and was just as I expected.  After a month, the player was no longer able to record CDs and it would not play audio from CD's.  I returned the player and Amazon. com was not helpful in resolving the problem.  They are not making CD players any longer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit has two problems. 1) The AC adapter that comes with it doesn't fit the unit. I had to return it for a new one.  2) The unit doesn't even turn on.  It only turns on when it's left next to the AC adapter. I can't use it in my house.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very poor quality product. If you are expecting the best, expect to pay extra.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just returned from the local store to order these adapters for my HP Pavillion PDA.  I purchased two of the same adapter only to have both units go into the "Power-on/Standby" (P.O.S.) mode.  One unit, purchased at the store, turned on fine, but went into P.O a few minutes later.  The other, purchased online, had the same problem

I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new pair

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this router thinking that it would provide great service and be very easy to set up.  Instead, I spent almost two weeks trying to troubleshoot the issue.  I tried to use the instructions online, but it did not work for me.  The tech support never answered my questions.  Then I had to call the company and they said it was because it was a new router that they had not tested with their technicians.  Now I am left with a very slow wireless connection that only works when I am in a room with several other people.  If I were you, I would buy another brand instead of wasting my money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable to charge my Sony NC5200 digital camera took 3 days to arrive. The first day the cable was in good shape, the second day the insulation on the insulation began to tear.  When I called Sony they said the product was defective and they would send me a replacement cable.  But the replacement cable is for a camera, not a CD player.  I have now returned the defective product and will not order from Sony again

No matter how hard I press the button it does not turn it on, only shuts it down.  I called tech support and they sent me a new cable but it still does not work.  This is an overpriced product that has proven to be unreliable.  Go to Amazon and save a few bucks 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product is great, but the return policy does not apply for this item, as it is defective. The item came with two of the connectors, but two was not enough for me to connect a Sony DVP-SZ400F 4K Rec. Box camcorder to my HD recorder. I tried to return it myself and was told the product was not defective. But Sony sent me a new unit with two connectors. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product arrived damaged and not working. I called, and returned the item. This is the second time this has happened to me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    this product was not compatible with my laptop and worked ok with my desktop computer.  I returned it and ordered the same unit from another supplier.   This unit has a very high power consumption, but the noise level is very high and my laptop was not warm in the least when it was on the machine, which it usually is when it is running.  The monitor is OK for my purpose but not great.  If you really need to do business with computers be cautious. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   these units work fine for my personal use as a printer, but as a business we had to purchase the printer itself from Amazon.com and then call them to ship the printer to us, which they refused to do.  Now the units don't work, and I'm forced to throw them away.  We can't return them, so we're stuck with these units

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I installed this TV set into a small room that is about 50 X 15 ft. I have to hang it up from the ceiling. I don't use the TV very much so I wasn't expecting this to be that hard.  I tried to switch the remote control from my Samsung QNIX to the Vizio IR. It doesn't even recognize the QNIC anymore. I've looked at the instructions and I can't see how this TV is supposed to work with the remote. I bought it thinking it would be a little easier to set up because the instructions were easy to understand and included pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am in the process of upgrading my system and have purchased this adapter.  I live in a very humid area and this adapter has caused problems.  When the unit was in use, the unit would not get hot enough for the air to pass through.  It also causes the unit to work on an almost all-white screen.  Even when the unit is in the case, the screen remains black.  In summary, I will not buy any more ADI products

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this adapter thinking it would be a good way to connect my HP Pavillion notebook with its built in wireless mouse. It's a big mistake and you should expect much more from HP and from Epson.  When the notebook is turned on, the adapter starts broadcasting. It gets even worse when the notebook goes to sleep.  After turning off the wireless radio the adapter stops broadcasting. The notebook still cannot be used unless you turn it back on.  If you need wireless access to the notebook you will have to purchase a separate wireless mouse adapter. Epson does not have a good reputation and their products are poor quality.This is one of the worst adapters I have ever purchased. I would never buy one from Epsons website

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the product to connect my Sony DLV-RXA100 to my HDTV.  The unit I received arrived with a "dead" antenna, no connector to plug in and no instructions on how to mount it.  I called Sony customer service and was told that all Sony products came with instructions but that Sony does not make accessories for these units.  After I called back and had them send me a new one, the unit would not power up or transmit.  They also told me that if I would not return it I would have to buy a new antenna and that I could return it for a refund.  As soon as I called again and had the replacement unit shipped out, the transmitter functioned fine and I tried to use the remote to control the TV.  That was not successful either.  Sony customer support was also unhelpful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried it out today. it has only one function, and it is not a great function.

I am not sure if this is a common feature. but I was totally disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor because it was on sale and I wanted something smaller than my 4 monitor Dell 2860x1440.  It worked fine until I tried to connect to the external monitor over the serial port.  The monitor would not find the monitor and I had to set the settings manually.  Not cool for a warranty purchase.  If the serial cable has to be modified, the monitor is not worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to use it as a wireless printer to print my own resumes and I had no problem with it. However, the printer has very limited ink capacity.  I need approximately 12 copies of my resume in the size of A4, so I'm only able to use about 10 of them with out having to change the ink.  It seems I must use about half the ink in the other half of the prints.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have owned three of these. The first two were on sale, and I was not interested in replacing them. This last one was installed in a car. A month after installing, I found that the cable for connecting it to my laptop had shorted out. I called Pioneer and they immediately replaced it, with no warning and no explanation. I returned it and tried it again the next day. The third time, the cable shorts out again and has to be replaced. I sent it in and they told me that they would not be able to provide any support. I was absolutely livid and called customer service twice more to get them to deal with this. And I called them back.  They said that the problem is that they have a bad batch of this cable that they will not be getting rid of, and that I would have to buy another one.  So now I have three cables and three problems.  I can not recommend this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the second time I have ordered this item.  First, I had the same problem as others have described:  I would record and then get an error message, indicating that the card did not have any of the two necessary slots.  I returned the card and bought the SX-35-B model which does indeed have two slots (I had to return the card that had only one slot).  The problem is that the tape machine would only start up the second record, which took some effort, and then just stopped.  No matter which slot I inserted, the tape would not start, nor would it get a signal to go to the second slot to start a new disc.  The first time I ordered this, I got a replacement, which worked fine.  So I returned it and bought this SX-25-B, and it worked fine once.  However, when I put the second disc in the machine, it refused to play and then stopped. I returned and returned again to try to fix this problem, but with no success

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just installed my HP 2910c into my main office computer system. It worked in the beginning but has stopped working. The installation instructions say to connect the printer directly to the HP 2911. I followed the instructions and connected the HP to the computer and then to the printer via a port on the HP.  HP should have followed the installation instructions and provided a port for connecting the HP2911 directly to my printer. The HP installation instructions are very poor and misleading.I had to return the HP printer as I was not able to return it.

The only way to make it look like a cd recorder is to open the case and make room for the spinning disk.  Very disapointed.

So, now I have to return the 2360 dock, which I'll never receive. They claim that the iPod will work with both units, but there's no way to know because they don't ship.If Amazon could ship from Boston and return the dock to NY, I would give them two stars, but for now I give them one star, which will not affect my rating on this item

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item in February and received it in April, so it must have been discontinued or defective. I returned it for a refund. So now I am back with a new HP 848c CD/DVD Recorder, purchased from Amazon and shipped quickly. I can only conclude this product is not manufactured by HP. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I returned this adapter. The label said that it would support a VGA card but in fact it does not. What is more important is that it is the only adapter that allows you to use any type of printer and also allows you monitor the output of your printer. It is quite slow to print.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I installed two units to my laptop. One lasted a month before it died. The second one started working after a few minutes of operation. Now, if I press the 'power on' button for ten seconds it turns on, but if I use the mouse for a few seconds the screen turns off and the power stays on. The units are advertised as having one USB port on the unit itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is an absolutely terrible electronic device.  I bought two units, one was working fine for a week and the other one just stopped working.  The only thing to keep in mind is that you must purchase the "USB Re-Plug" adapter which is just a plug-n-play USB connector.  So don't go to the store and just buy a cheap plastic adapter and make sure you put the right port in

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these for my wife's computer, and as you can see, they didn't fit.  So we returned them, and got different ones.  I returned both because the other ones had a bad sticker on them, because it said that they were for Mac computers, but I thought they were PC only.  My fault for not reading the info on the box before I made the order, I will be taking it back and getting a better one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It doesn't come with the USB cord so you will have to buy a pair of them from HP if you plan to use your PC with the camera.  Otherwise, it is pretty much useless.  The USB port is also pretty far away from the camera so if you don't have any other option, I wouldn't buy this.  I've been using an external hard drive as a backup for almost 10 years 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product hoping it would be compatible with my HP DL380 G3, but it does not.  I called HP and they told me it was not the adapter that was faulty, it was my computer.  The computer that I ordered was not HP compatible either, I ordered it through a different vendor.  So, I have spent at least $130.00 on two products that are not compatible, which costs me more than the products themselves.  And the HP technicians refused to exchange the adapter with my computer, or help me with it.  What a disgrace

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This iPod's display is so small that you can't see the songs and playlists that you have stored.   Also, you have to remove the case to insert the battery.  The buttons are very difficult to press and are extremely sensitive.  I tried this unit with two batteries (one for the main deck and one for the auxiliary player) and had to put in four additional batteries just to get a usable display and buttons.  If you can use this with a 9V battery, try it with a single cell battery. I am sending it back to Apple. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When we got our modem, we checked the specs and thought,   "Why not?"  When it arrived, we were surprised that it only worked with 10/100/1000 MBS.  I called modem support and asked about this  and they said that the modem was actually a 50/60 MBS modem with a modem card,  but the software in the box didn't recognize this.  So, they gave me a modem that was not connected to the Internet.  We had to go into the box to uninstall the software and restart the modem.  Now, we have to get a new modem because we couldn't use the modem at all on our home network.  If you're expecting this to work on the local connection, please don't get it  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would not recommend this item.  The USB port is fine, but the audio is almost non-existent.  There is no way to turn it on and off.  You have to use the computer's speakers or speakerphone.  If you want a portable USB audio device, I would recommend buying a FireWire device.  Also buy something else if you do not have a computer and are only using it for MP3 player.  These are not the only bad products I have ever seen from Pioneer, but I had to give this one a one star because of this.  I will not buy any more products from Pioneer.

I'm returning it again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is not compatible with our Sonos system. They sent us a brand new product, however, it does not allow audio or video from the Sonos to be played. When I called, I was told that I need to pay for a new cable (which I do) and that the system is not yet supported. This is the second Sonos controller that I have used that I did not get the sound or picture from. The first was with a different company, the picture and sound was fine. The second, when I finally got a reply, I received a message saying they do not offer any help. This controller was not at all helpful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this radio and after a week or so, it was returned to Amazon.com.  Amazon had refused to refund my money, saying that the unit was defective.  I was very disappointed.  As soon as I received a replacement, I began to hear crackling and hissing in the right channel and no reception in the left channel.  It is a shame that this radio can't be returned because it does perform the job, but Amazon's refusal to exchange or refund means that I can't get another RadioShack radio 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This card does not support anything more than 128 MB of ram. For a dual channel, it is absolutely NOT worth it, you will have to buy more memory to be able to run multiple games at the same time. I would not buy it again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I returned it because of the bad reviews.  It did not work at all.  So I called the company and they said it's not their problem.

I returned both to Sears and they gave me a 2 day grace period. I called them and the tech tech confirmed it - the product had burned up in the shipping box, and there was nothing Sears could do about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with this product.   The label says that the audio output is to be connected to the rear-panel, and the CD-RW drive is to face the front of the unit, so I thought I could get away with not using the CD reader and the headphone jack, and just connect the front USB cable.  But as soon as I played a CD it cut out!  The unit came with one CD-R and two blank CDs.  The CD-ROM is broken, so that's now out too.  I sent it back, and I am now waiting for a replacement to arrive

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased these adapters to connect the 2 Dell monitors I had bought (the 2460x1440 Dell C2470p and 2740x1420 Dell C2770p).  The first time I connected the C2440 to my Gateway SPARCstation X7200, I heard a sound which made the monitor (at the time) completely unreadable on my HP Pavillion ZR2500c LCD.  I thought that it was a problem with the Dell monitor, but it was actually the Acer monitor (the monitor in the box).  In both cases I thought the problem was resolved because the sound would go away after a while.  After installing a third monitor, the same problem occurred, so I returned the third adapter.  However, the second adapter I purchased from the Dell store had an issue of its own.  While the sound stayed with the Acer, it disappeared within minutes with the C2740.  The sound of the Acer was more pleasing, but the sound of my Dell was totally gone.  So now, in addition to being unable to see the monitor at all (because it cannot be connected to the Dell C2800p) I have to remove the sound card for the monitor to function.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the Acer's sound quality.  If I had known that this would happen with the second Acer adapter I bought, I would have returned the Acer adapter and bought a different brand.  And I would also have purchased a Dell adapter 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a HP printer, and the HP Scanner is the only one I keep around. This one is way too sensitive to water.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this router expecting it to work with my cable modem, but it didn't.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery was dead when I bought it. The package said it came with a spare. The spare was only a cover for the battery. When I returned it and got the battery itself, the original battery was missing. The replacement didn't fit. I called LG tech support, they sent me another battery and it fit but didn't last the full two hours. The product itself was good, but I don't recommend this product to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The box said that it was a product of Epson, but the printer itself was made by Lexmark.  The Lexmark Lexmark logo was barely visible on the Lexmark print head and on the Epson paper tray.  I returned it and bought Lexmark Epson cartridges instead.  Now the Lexmarks are scratched and dented and the LexMark Lexmark printer doesn't print any more.  Also, they don't have a flat head so you have to buy another one for $10-$20 more.If you can't read the instructions on the packaging, you should know that Lexmark's Lexmark Paper Tray should be flat on the bottom and Lexmark cartridges should be centered vertically inside the tray. The Lexmarks, unfortunately, are not flat on their bottom. You will have to either make sure that the cartridges sit on top of the Lexi-X in the Lex-X tray (which won't fit a lot of cartridges anyway) or use a flathead to print.  You'll also have to adjust your paper size to get the Lexix paper.The Lexmark scanner has a tendency to jam up and the Epsons don't always do a good job of scanning.  Buy the Eperron cartridges instead and you'll get better results.  Epson's printer is a piece of junk for the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used to buy these cables from Logitech for years. I bought two pairs of the same color for different computers and found they weren't compatible. So I tried the other colors (red and black) on both computers and was told by the dealer they didn't work either.The cable included with this product was different from the one pictured.  So I ended up buying three color pairs that all weren't the same.  When I received my order I received three pairs with the wrong color on them.I was told that I could send them back and that would fix it.So I emailed Logitech and received no response.I ended up shipping them to Logitech myself and they told me they would have to ship back the wrong pair of cables (red for my Dell laptop and black for my Apple Mac).I was then sent the other two colors (Red/Black) that were supplied. When I opened the package they were all the wrong colors.I am now returning the entire order and ordering a new product from Amazon

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst monitor I have ever bought for my video computer.  I ordered it on a Friday and it didn't come until Monday.  And I haven't gotten it hooked up to my VCR yet.  It has the ability to change the brightness and contrast levels but not the resolution.  Very, very poor quality.  The company has been bad on returns.  If you want a decent monitor, get something from Belkin or VESA

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This cable has a long history of failure. I lost two pairs of these in about a year. They are useless on a Macbook, and you would not know. I bought these to connect a FireWire 800 to my Dell notebook, but my Macbook does not support FireWire. You would need a Firewire adapter (like the HP cable) to use it.The best way to use these is as a terminator between your existing FireWire card and your laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product thinking that I would have a quick and easy installation.  I must say that I'm extremely disappointed.  It took almost 2 hours to install.  When the system would power up, the monitor would hang at 90% brightness.  The screen was completely unusable after the installation.The user manual stated that the display could be operated with the keyboard.  That is not true.  Please provide an alternative installation method.  Otherwise, I'm forced to return the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this to monitor my child's sleeping times and it turned out to be a nightmare.  I have the wireless version and it works fine.  The Ethernet version is not functional.  If you can get it to connect to your network at all, it just tells me the IP address is 255.255.255/32.  This is the router I ordered so I figured it was fine. If your network is not secure, this is not the solution for you.  Buy a better product, get a different router 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product I received arrived damaged. I took it back to the store and was told it was shipped with no return tag or proof of purchase. I called customer service and was sent to another salesperson.I returned it to Target store and had them send a new item (a full refund).I have since received another bad model and returned that as well.The only positive thing I can say is that they shipped this with a return label and a tracking number. The return label was returned to the same company who originally shipped it. So it's not exactly a "buyer beware". They are shipping these defective items to customers and don't bother tracking them.The other bad thing is that it's only good for 10 hours of operation a day, which is only enough time to listen to 10 songs (at least 10 minutes each). If your radio is on, that's the limit. I'm going to return it this time and not buy another one

I don't believe that is a defect of the product, but rather a defect with the packaging.  My first computer was a Sony PDA and the product worked fine.  It will be a month before I can return the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this printer and it arrived damaged.  I contacted support and they sent me a replacement printer.  Problem was the new one had a blank side to the picture.  The printer came to me as-is.  There is no way I'm going to buy another printer from HP 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very pleased with this product. The first time I used it to connect my Sony Ericsson cell phone to my Windows 95 computer, the unit failed to recognize the phone. I returned it and returned the unit. Then I tried to connect to a different computer, but I could not get any sound at all. I am returning it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The tape player I ordered arrived broken.  I contacted Pioneer and they sent me a new one. However, the problem is that I was only able to use it for a few minutes.  Now I have to buy the same reel-to-reel that came with the new one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the unit online, and the box was damaged in transit.  The unit was shipped without the batteries and charger.  I called, and they said they'd send them to me as soon as possible.  But a week later, I received a bill for shipping for the batteries, and charger!  Not impressed with this brand of products, if they want to sell a great product at a discount, then they need to keep their word 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had a few problems with the TV.  I had one on the same exact TV for 10 years and was very satisfied with it until I received the new one.  The picture was so low that you could barely see anything on the screen at all.  Now, I have to spend hours a day in the dark setting the picture manually and trying to get it to change.  These new Sony boxes are defective, they won't work at all

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am a professional photographer and purchased this printer because I needed it for a portrait and landscape series. I purchased it online from Printer Warehouse. Unfortunately, the print quality I expected was not available. I immediately returned it and purchased another model from Amazon ( http://amzn.to/1I6E7eV). However, this model did not come with the included paper cartridge. I had to return the Printer and have to buy more cartridges. If you are thinking of buying this printer, make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. Printer should have the ability to scan both sides of the paper into a single file and allow you to scan and print only the section you need. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used many, many adapters for my Sony TV, and this is the worst one I have ever purchased.  I ordered it from Amazon and the item did arrive, but they had changed the name on it in the meantime.  It arrived damaged and I have had no luck with Amazon ever since.   Even if I could get a refund, this is a poor adapter to use, it's very bulky.  You will need to cut or fold it to get it to fit on the Sony TV

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is a huge disappointment.  There are more than three times as many contacts as needed to make a soundcard.  It is completely incompatible with soundcards that use the same type of connector as the RCA jacks.  The soundcard that came with my HP z400 works great with this product.  I have returned it, but if you have a similar soundcard, you are out of luck.

Well, today I'm waiting on UPS and the printer is not working. The printer is sitting in my office on its stand. I have called Dell and they told me that the drive is not being returned as it was not defective.So in the end, I paid for a bad printer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am not a fan of the Logitech wireless keyboard, it does not register my typing accurately.  I tried several different wireless solutions (not Logi) and the Logi WFC-700 is the worst out of all the options I tried.  The device has no built in memory, and once you use all the memory it goes to the recycle bin.  Also, it uses too much battery and it dies after a day.  If you are looking for a wireless keyboard use a wireless mouse, its much better

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two of these units for an 8 port switch and I'm still waiting for the UPS delivery. The unit I got with the 8 ports worked fine in both my home office and my garage. The UPS delivered the other one to my house, but the port was not powered. I called HP Support and they said it was a "hardware failure" and I should send it back.    The unit that UPS delivered to my garage was not at all power efficient and I had to disconnect the power from the router and then from each of the other four ports to complete my set up.  I am deeply disappointed in the HP products and the customer service at HP.  It is ridiculous to pay extra for UPS when UPS delivery can be accomplished more easily by plugging the ports into the switch instead of into the UPS unit.  The HP units with 8 ports are supposed to have a UPS that will power up all eight ports.  In my case, I received one with only two ports on the UPS and I still have not been charged for the additional cost of power.  You won't get the most out of these switches by buying them with eight ports

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this cable thinking it would be an easy way to transfer my VHS tapes.  I had no problems transferring one or two tapes, but the other three tapes I transferred were unusable.  The first two, one being a Super 8 film and one being an AVI tape, the video didn't transfer.  However, the audio was OK, but didn't come through the Super 8 movie.  After sending the Super 16 film and AVI tapes back to Sony, I returned both.  Then came the problem of receiving the 3 tapes. I called Sony, and was advised to return the tape itself, but not the cable.  At least that would work, but I wouldn't bother with a return of this item unless I could return the cable separately, and that would involve returning the unit and not the actual item.  So, if you want transfer tapes, buy something else.  If you want video, get something else

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these cards with the same name. The first one worked fine with my Windows Media Center Media Center Server (Windows 7) but would not run on a Windows XP Media Center Edition server. The second one worked OK on a XP server but had a very poor audio stream quality, probably due to the lack of a front panel connector. I returned both cards and purchased the Dell Thunderbolt Media Center Card from Amazon, which works great on any system but the XP MediaCenter Edition system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would not buy this product again.  The product works fine in the box, however when I plugged the product in and then went into the settings for it, I was not able to connect my modem to my router.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The headphones came in damaged. I called Audio Technica and they sent me a return label, but no return instructions. I did not follow the instructions and they gave me a new pair. Then they sent them back again.

It's very frustrating and I've sent several e-mails to them but not a single word. I've already returned the box in which it was shipped. It was defective in the first place

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this CD-R. I installed the CD and tried to copy music from my CD player onto my Mac. The CD reader only accepts blank CD's, and I am not a blank music lover. So, I installed it, and it didn't work. The picture on the box said that it supported up to 32 CD's.

I sent it back and exchanged for a different one, and now it still won't play any music on any format.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this router to protect my personal laptop. I live in a very busy area with many wireless access points and very poor signal. I tried to use the supplied WPA2 password to get it to work, but was unable to.

They sent me a new router (with the same WPA flaw) with the WEP password password on it and suggested I use it. They then sent me the wrong router which I installed on the wrong network.I returned both.  I am now out $80 on two identical routers and will likely return the new one.

The first recording was on the wrong tape, so i had to go back to the recording station, pay the price of a new tape, and try again. The tape was on a CD-R, so it couldn't be copied.  Also, it took forever for it to record a full hour, and at times, it was just silent. The sound quality was horrible, and my computer had to run the tape twice to get any sound at all out of it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product did not work with my Toshiba Satellite CD-RW-DVD-RW.  A couple months after receiving the package, I called Toshiba.  They refused to refund the money.  Toshiba is a bad company.  Get something else.  I ended up returning the product to Toshiba. You have to be very careful ordering from Toshibu 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a Dell Inspiron 600w with a VGA monitor. I received this monitor as an upgrade and it took up my whole VGA port, leaving only two PCI slots for any other add-in cards that I might have.  The adapter does not fit in the PCI slot and I was sent an RMA replacement that arrived damaged. It didn't take long to return the damaged adapter. Now Dell sends you a new one, which does fit, but only if you remove the original one and throw away the original box it came in. And now, two weeks later, the monitor still doesn't work, even with a new adapter

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product arrived with a few dents in it. But this is a $30.00 item that I needed to test the functionality. I can confirm the product does not work as I expected. The cable supplied with it is way too short, and not strong enough to support the weight of a laptop computer. I was extremely disappointed to return the unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my item, I thought it was a spare, and was completely disappointed in the quality.

I am a professional photographer and had to get these cables because i didn't have the proper length in my studio.  However, i am now stuck with them and can not get them to work with any software.  The picture quality is terrible and even worse, the cables do not seem to have the quality

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had no problems with the product, the problem was with me! I installed it without taking into consideration that it did not have the "Auto-On/Off" feature on it. I returned it within a month and had to purchase a different adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these because they appeared to be one of the few good choices for making a shortwave radio with a battery operated scanner.  Unfortunately, they are not!  I would never buy one of these from EBay again because these have absolutely NO sensitivity or sensitivity range!  The scanner will not work in ANY weather condition I can think of!  You will hear all the static and static on and off in the middle of the day and then the antenna will come down!  If you really want to make a short wave radio, I would buy an Avantor.  They have a far better range and sensitivity!

I'm disappointed and will not recommend this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD player is defective, it has not been able to play anything. I took it to Best Buy and they sent it back to me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this printer thinking that it would work with my HP Business Color LaserJet 488i.  Wrong. The printer works fine with Color LaserJets that cost 3x or less.  It doesn't work with HP LaserJet Epson printers, which cost over $3000.  The only reason for the negative review is that the printer is not included with the kit (you have to buy the printer separately) and the kit is extremely expensive.  I don't know if they are in any other color.  You can get a black HP printer from Amazon for under $100 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the printer, but after using it for a while to print some Christmas cards, I realized I didn't order the black ink cartridge. The cartridges were black when they first arrived.  So I contacted Fujitsu and they sent a replacement cartridge which was fine, but the printer wouldn't work until I received a replacement ink cartridge as well. This printer has a very high price tag, but a bad warranty. I have called several times to no avail.I ordered from Amazon and got it within a day or two, but that's all. I'm very disappointed with the Fujitsu product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable is too short for my computer.  I returned it and bought the 10 ft. cable from HP.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First, this device does not come with a remote.  You have to buy a separate remote to use your receiver.  Second, this remote is very hard to use and very hard, if not impossible, to find.  Third, I am not sure if you can even tell if this device is on or off.  It is a very, very faint white light on the receiver. If you do not have the receiver plugged in, it is almost invisible.    I returned it and went to an Elgato unit.  However, if you do have the Elgatto receiver plugged into your TV, this will not work either.  This is one reason I bought the Marantz, it has a remote that is a lot easier to use.  All of these issues are easily fixed by the manufacturer.  I am very dissapointed in the Maratge product.  And I am using this exact model. If I could give it zero stars I would. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was one of the first items that I received.  It worked for a short period, but then my printer refused to start.  I called HP support and they sent me a new unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this adapter thinking that it would be the only way to connect to my Toshiba Satellite HD-P2000, as it is a Panasonic product.  I thought it would have been easy to plug in the supplied cables, as they were for my Tosawave.  Well, it's not that easy.  First of all, Panasonic and Toshiba's products are two completely different products.  There is no universal connector that connects the two, so the Panasonic adapter is actually incompatible with the Toshiba one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit I received is not working at all. I am returning it to HP. HP, you need to update your product manual and the description of the unit. I will not buy from you ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this product for 2 years.  The unit I purchased a few months ago is dead.  I called Sony and they sent me a new unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these and one of them worked well.  But the other did not work at all.  I called tech support and they told me it was not an issue with the unit but with the radio.  They recommended upgrading to the 9300.   The 9300 is much better and it worked for about 10 days.  Then the radio stopped working.  Called back a few days later and got the same response.  So I returned both units and have not bought another one since.  Very bad product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is worthless.  I ordered this cable to replace my old, but now broken, cable.  The first item that arrived had a "Cable that does not fit your television" sticker on it.  Not knowing about this, I installed it and had no luck getting it to work.  Returned it and ordered another one.  Same problem, but with a different sticker.  A second one arrived with the same sticker and still had not worked.  Contacted tech support and they told me that if I put the product in the wrong location that I can remove the sticker.I then asked them to send me a picture of the back of the cable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is one of those cheap, not very good "all in one" power supplies. It's supposed to have a 12v output, but the two 12v outputs are not connected. And if you have more than 12v on your system, it's not enough. I have been buying these for years, and I've never had one issue.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have purchased two of these and the same problem, if you have two of the same model (VX-2022B) and one of them is working and the other isn't, it is because of the serial number on the motherboard, not the unit itself.I can get these working, but it is really cumbersome and expensive to troubleshoot, and the process takes way too much time to get it to work.I do not recommend this product, the company should do something to make it better.The company should provide a software or a drivers CD so that you can easily disable these functions on each of your machines, so you don't have to hunt for your disk for them to work properly.I am a computer tech and this is not worth my time

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this router thinking that it would be a good alternative to Netgear's product.  I have to admit that I'm not exactly pleased with the router,  and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought it would do a better job of protecting my network.    The router does not have the ability to be password protected.  You have to set a password for it and that is it.  It also does not provide any wireless range.  The signal strength is also pretty poor.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to protect my Dell 1540 laptop from fire and water damage. However, the only protection it provided was that it kept the case from folding in half in a liquid spill. My computer now has water damage on it because of this cheap, overpriced dvd burner. This is a dvd player and not a water filter. I contacted Dell and they sent me a new case.

My hub would not power on, the ports would not be recognized by any other devices, and both were useless once they were installed in my network.  Amazon has very poor customer service.  Please don't buy this product, it's a total waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this printer because the color ink cartridges were so cheap.

But you only have 20 seconds to find the "lock" button on the unit.  If you want more than that, just remember that the battery runs out and you have no power!  But what can you do?  The product is a total failure.  Buy a "Smart" battery.  Also, I tried two different units in two different apartments,  both were dead in less than 5 minutes.  This is a really bad item to buy

I also expected it to have a built in antenna but was under the impression that it came with that function included. When I tried it, I was told that the antenna is built in and cannot be removed. This product is just a wireless phone adapter that plugs into a standard telephone jack and cannot even be used to make or receive calls. It is a total disappointment

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I got the machine, I expected some bells and whistles, like an ethernet jack or audio out.  Instead, it is the complete opposite: no ethernet, no audio out, and it is not a USB printer.  I called HP and the rep informed me that HP is replacing the printer because of the  problem.  Now it looks like I wasted my time, because the new printer has the same problem. If you want to use your HP LaserJet Pro for word processing or a scanner, don't buy this printer.It is very hard to use as a printer. The paper you are going to print on has to be a flat sheet.  The cartridges are not compatible. The toner cartridges are useless because you need to load them manually. You need to buy toner for both the toner and the toners on the cartridge tray.  If you buy HP toner, you are in for a disappointment. HP does not carry any other toner cartridge. The cartridge tray is not wide enough. It is not easy to find and use ink. HP toners are also very expensive and not easy on credit

But now I am in the same situation as before I got them.  They are so bad, that I will be buying something else next month.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried two of these units, a new one and one that was already dead on the side.  The new one would not record, and the dead one would only play a fraction of a second at a time.  I returned the dead unit.  If this is your only option to record your CD, then please be a little more careful.

I returned the items and got two brand new batteries that lasted 3 hours.  The replacement batteries lasted 2 hours and 45 minutes.  Very disappointing

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does NOT deliver as advertised and is no longer in stock.  It works great on my PC, but does NOT do it on my Macintosh.  I spent about $80 on this product and only received it 2 days before Christmas.  The first time I used it it was a big fail on my Mac, then it worked perfectly on my WinXP desktop.  Please make a replacement immediately 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was broken within the first week I had it. I contacted Panasonic, they sent me an RMA, but the part wasn't right. I had to return the RMA and go back to Amazon, which is where I am right now. I'm giving it 4 stars because it worked fine on Amazon, but after 3 weeks it started working incorrectly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a new Canon EOS 10D Mark IV as a Christmas gift.  The new camera comes with a 10x zoom lens and a new "L" battery.  But I noticed right away that the lens is only about one fourth full.  I am running the battery down every few minutes.  At one point I stopped taking pictures and called Canon customer support, they said they couldn't replace the lens 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm very disappointed with the product.  I needed to connect my HP LaserJet 636C printer to the printer on which I am printing.  No problem.  The HP Laserjet Connector Kit came in the box with only 4 slots available.  So the 4 slots in the kit were not usable.  Fortunately, it was already delivered when I ordered it.  However, to do so, I had to buy the HP Scanning Printer Printer-to-HP Kit.  Since the printer did not come with scanner, the scanner kit was not used.  Needless to say, the HP scanner kit is NOT compatible with the HP Laser Jet 636.  There is a reason why HP has not released this product as an upgrade kit.  This kit was designed with scanners in mind.  It should not be used with printers

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After 5 months of trying to figure out why my new iPod is not recording at all, I've finally decided to call Apple.  This product is useless.  When I first received it, I tried it with my car stereo system.  The iPod was working perfectly.  I then plugged it in to my car's MP3 player.  Both the iPod and the MP3 were working perfectly for a few minutes.  Then, I played a few songs.  None of them recorded onto the new iPod 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased two of these and one just failed and was useless. I called support and they told me to call Pioneer. This is an after market product and they don't support them like they do with the Pioneer CD-RX. Not a good deal at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had a really difficult time getting this to work in my new Dell desktop computer.  I thought it would work, but it wouldn't.  For some reason, when I was connecting my serial line to the adapter, I was getting no signal, even though the adapter was receiving the serial line.  Then, I realized that the serial port on the Dell computer was not being used.  This adapter doesn't even allow me to make the serial connection from one computer to the other.  No other adapters have this problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these to add a NAS to my PC.  I'm still using one of them, because I thought I had a dead hard drive, when I got it, and realized I had the wrong drive in it.  It's a very hard drive to format with anything but the most sophisticated formatting software.  The other drive is about as useful as a piece of junk.  Buy something else.  If I hadn't spent so much time figuring out how to format this drive, I wouldn't have needed to buy another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The monitor is ok for the price.  But for an 8 inch LCD TV, you would be better off getting a cheaper brand LCD that will last for many years.  I tried to order it from Amazon.com, but they didn't carry it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this antenna on the 3rd of October and received it on the 20th. The antenna came with an extra plastic holder for the wire. The other end of the wire ended up coming out with the antenna. The only other option for this antenna is to buy some short lengths of wire, put them in a ziplock bag, then stick the bag into your car's trunk. I didn't do that.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my new Toshiba drive and put it into my Dell Inspiron 1565. Within 1 hour it was damaged. I called Toshiba to see if I could get a replacement and they said I could not. Toshiba sent me a new drive with the same problem. I returned the Toshiba and got another Toshiba from Amazon, only to get a new Tosagate. And I have now returned 4 Toshiba drives and returned Toshiba computers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item and received a defective switch.  I contacted Kink and received an immediate replacement.  Unfortunately, the defective switch is still on the switch. I ordered the "Flexible" version and have had no luck.  It's very hard to get the flex switch to switch to the on position.  When I tried, the switch did not respond to the key presses.  If you want to use the Flexible version, you will need to replace the whole switch assembly with the Flex version.  Kink should not have made such a poor switch with such a high price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this TV because of the excellent reviews and low price.  I received it less than a week after ordering.  It is a little hard to turn off when watching movies, or while playing games.  You must press a few buttons on the remote in order to get it to do the job.  Not only that, but the image quality is terrible.  The picture is not that great in the dark, and the picture looks distorted in bright light.  This TV is no longer in my possession.  If you are looking to buy a new TV, DO NOT buy this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this in April 2010 and had it shipped to me in May of 2011. It was not damaged when I returned it to the store.

I sent the product back, but it took over a month for my computer to start. I returned the item for a refund because the product was defective. I would NEVER buy another HP product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this product for 4 years before I ordered replacement for my new Dell Ultrabook.   Unfortunately, it was shipped defective.  I returned it to the store and exchanged it for one of Dell's refurbished products.  However, the product I received from Dell was NOT the same as the one I ordered from them.  It was different color and a different thickness.  This will never happen again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because my original receiver was getting in the way.  However, I found that when the receiver was in the stereo mode, the phone line (and therefore the caller ID) was inoperative, and could not be switched to the CD player mode.  Therefore, I could not find out what was wrong with my system.  I returned the unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod works great on the drive. However, the headphones don't fit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this adapter in October 2007 to install a Mac, but it never worked.  The Mac came pre-installed, but Apple did not provide a replacement or support.  I sent it in to my local Apple store for a refund and got it back about six months later.  In December 2007, my Dell Latitude laptop got an overheating problem.  A replacement arrived and the only way to use it was to insert the adapter into the slot, then remove it.  It wasn't until February that they sent me a new one.  This is the same exact adapter that I've used for many years, so I am baffled as to why it isn't working.  There is no way I'm returning this item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this product on June 29, 2006. After installing it, it wouldn't charge my Motorola DIR-850 modem, so I returned it. A couple of weeks later, it began to smoke. Unplugged and put it back in. It still wouldn't work. I called Motorola support. The technician recommended that I return it to Amazon, which I did. I've had no improvement. I can't tell if I'm just bad at electronics, or if it's this particular product that's making a bad connection to the modem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After installing my HP Deskjet 450 G4 Printer on this product the printer worked for about a week. Then after about a day the color on the screen would not go away, only a black background.  I returned it for a printer from a different vendor and that is exactly what I received.  It will print fine with a standard HP ink cartridge, but the picture looks so dark it will not be visible.  HP's support department told me that I should return the printer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst product I've ever had to deal with.  There are times when it works perfectly and others when it won't power on.  Even after trying hard I have only been able to get about 5 hours out of it.  When the power is on it seems to do a lot of stuff, but when it's off the TV turns on with it, so I can't use the remote to turn it off, and I can turn it on, but then when the TV is turned off again it won 't power on the router.  I'm never going to buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the product, as promised.  However, I had to return it because I do not have a switch to use as a "hot swap" switch.  I should have contacted the manufacturer for this, rather than have to return the product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This card does not support ATI and therefore will not support any ATI games that require the use of the ATI driver.  I contacted ATI and was told that they would have to work with Apple to modify their drivers to support the card.  ATI told me to contact ATI's customer service center and was promptly informed that I should send it back.   I'm sorry to say that I am now out more than $400 because of ATI's poor customer service and refusal to honor their promises.  Do not buy this card, you will be out several hundred dollars in extra fees.  If you are a high performance graphics card user, do the research and save your money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product for a new computer.  Installed, however, the computer would not boot.  This was not a problem on Windows, since I installed the DVD with the proper drivers.  But when I tried to install the CD for my existing disk, the software would not recognize it.  At the time, I had no way of checking the specs or the serial number.  I called Tech support and they suggested that I go to HP.com, buy a new disk, and try again.  After waiting over a month, I sent in my old disk and they came up with the same response.  It appears I have a bad computer!  I will have to buy another one to get my computer to run.  Don't buy this disk from HP.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this TV thinking I'd be able to get it at a local store and it was just sold by Amazon. I paid full price for it and had it shipped directly to my house. I thought maybe I had to have special packaging to protect it from the inside, but Amazon sent it in a box. So I had my new TV sitting on a table waiting for a couple of days, then the UPS guy picked it up and put it on my porch. That's when I realized, I don't have any cable, no antenna, and no way to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first and last one.  It will not charge my iPod and my iPhone will not sync up.  I ended up returning it to Amazon because they will not exchange it for a new one.I have returned about 4 or 5 of these in the last year and each time it was a different model.  Even Apple will only give you a return label if it is a new item.  The only reason I didn't give it a lower rating is because I ordered it and received it on time.   Hopefully there is a way to do that with the Amazon order

It was the same problem with all the Dell monitors that I've tried to buy from this company

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took three calls to Dell tech support to finally get the HP Compaq 1520 to recognize my HP Pavilion dv4000.  The HP Pavilion, which is brand new, works perfectly fine with the HP 1520.  If you're looking for a product with great price and performance, you're better off with a Samsung product like the ProBook 4550/5550 or the Toshiba laptop.  HP is really falling behind in the laptop computer business and the Compaq is no exception 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These adapters were made for the Tascam DR-100 but are not compatible with any Tascams.  I've owned 3 so far, but only one has worked.  This model (Model # R-3048) has a small rubber ring inside the base. This allows for no-load, low-speed operation.  You cannot adjust speed by moving the ring, and the unit works only with the input tape speeds at the highest setting, which is 3.  For other media, it simply refuses to turn on and needs to be reset.  Took my Tascami DR-200 with them for a test drive, and they refused to work at all with any other Tascama models.  Beware 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this cable to charge my new Sony Vaio laptop.  I only needed the USB connection for my Sony VaIO laptop, so I did not expect it to work for any other device.  The product itself is fine - a little on the light side.  But the adapter is a huge mistake.  It takes about 1/2 hour to charge the Sony VaIuo laptop. That's it.  A cable that's supposed to charge one device takes hours to charge other devices.  Very disappointed with this product, and Sony.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This mouse is no better than a cheapie.  It will not fit under my desk.  I have tried other brands and they all work.  Only got it because I was told I was getting a 30 day guarantee on eBay.  Guess I got lucky.  If it had fit I would have returned it.  So I wasted money on this item.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product expecting a reliable CD player.  I have since discovered the "Auto Power On" feature is extremely unreliable.  After only a few minutes of play, the player will automatically turn off, usually due to a low battery.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product shipped and was delivered on the first business day.  The CD player was not even plugged in, and I would not buy anything from Amazon again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this adapter, thinking it would just work. I was wrong. I called Best Buy and they told me to return it. So I am going to go back to the store for an exchange. I've never had a problem before with adapters, but this one is a complete failure. I did receive a free replacement. I'm now back where I started. I have spent over $100 on adapters for my home and office, and I'm still without an adapter for my Sony Apt-X1000.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This cable is not as advertised.  It looks like the picture but is not.  I tried two different brands and both did not work.  If you want to run an ethernet cable, this is not the right cable.  There are many better options like the AER-4K.  Buy from someone that offers better prices 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this unit was supposed to have a new processor and I have had problems since I received it.  It has not worked since I put it into the wall mount.  I contacted etek support who sent me a new one which worked for a while then stopped.   I returned the defective unit and bought a new version which is supposed to work.  Again, it stops working, I'm back on etek tech support.  And I don't have to send it back and deal with return shipping costs.  Buy from a different company, maybe you will have a better experience

Not impressed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these monitors from Target and they looked good on the TV and in the store, then I got a call from Samsung telling me that they had sent me a different type and the pictures were not the same. So after 1 week of waiting and not getting an RMA I returned them.  The pictures are not the best and you can see all of the lights flashing at the same time making it seem like you're getting no picture. I'd recommend shopping elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this and got the new Sony product (see review below) only to have to return it when the Sony unit did not work right out of the box.  I have used the Sony product on a few computers and I am still waiting for it to work properly on my HP 4740.  Sony product does not come with a software driver to allow it to be used as a boot drive.  The only thing this device has going for it is that it is compact (2.5  inch floppy disk).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product does not come with a hard disc holder.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this CD changer and used it for about two months. It started to work great once, but then stopped working altogether.   It took several phone calls to the tech support line to get it repaired.I returned it to Amazon and got a new one that worked for over a month. Then, about a month after that, it stopped working again. I've since returned all my CD changers and I'm still trying to find a replacement. I bought this CD changer because Amazon is the only place I found that sells them

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking I could use it to help move my Sony DVD player. I got the CDR to play CD's. It was supposed to play all audio CDs.It didn't. I called Sony and they gave me a new disc changer for the $10 price difference. But, I'm still out $5 for the cd changer that I got. I returned the bad cd changers. Sony does not help when they are a company that thinks the world is the way they do. I'm sorry Sony, but this product is overpriced and does not work. If you buy it thinking it's CD playback and then realize you don't use it for CD playback, you'll be out at $40 or more 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After over 1 year of regular use, my Sony Vaio laptop stopped working.  I called Sony, they sent me a new one, but Sony said it was defective.  When I received the new one they had replaced the battery and the mouse.  Sony said they would ship me a replacement, but no.  After calling Sony, I found out the reason why, they ship refurbished items.  So now, Sony refuses to ship me replacement and refuses to repair.  Buyer beware! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This printer just can't print without a ton of ink.  So far it has only saved me about 10% of my prints and cost me an entire ink cartridge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed with this product. It seems to work fine on a windows machine but on my Mac OS X system, it was stuck in the booting process for minutes or more and was not usable. The sound was very bad as well. I returned it and bought the Logitech Harmony X4. The Logitech system was a little bit easier to set up and had better sound. The Harmony X3 is not as good as the other Logitech units I've owned and this is the worst one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this receiver in July, and it was delivered in August.  It had not arrived when I called, and they said they would get it for me in two days.  Well, two days passed, and still they had not gotten it.  I called again, and the rep informed me that the product was out of stock.  So far, they have been unable to help with replacement, and I am out over $100.  At this point, I can only recommend a third party.  They were extremely slow with my order, and would not honor return/exchange for this item 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i bought this item thinking that it would be better than the 3.5 mm to 1/4 inch adapter. but it turns out the only difference is that 1/2 inch is not "full-size" so I have to buy a adapter for that. the CD player is not good either.the volume control does not come close to the level of the CD itself so there is no way to adjust the volume. and I have had problems with both the adapter and the CD when I listen to the CDs. this adapter only has a one-way function.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a defective printer, a scan was not done correctly in the first place, the printer stopped working after a couple of weeks, then I sent it back to Epson for repair, the Epson representative called me and said the printer was returned to Eppans for repairs, so Epson's return policy is not applicable to it.  Epson has a terrible return policy for printers, and when I call them they tell me there is no way to return it for warranty service because the printer is not Epson, not HP, not Canon. It is Epson! I think the Eppan's rep just doesn't know what he's talking about, but I did take the risk and return it anyway, I have yet to receive a replacement, and Epson refuses to provide a receipt

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was skeptical about buying a universal remote because I have a remote that works on both Mac and PC.  When I got the remote, I was surprised to find that the port that is for the USB version is not labeled.  I contacted Sony and they responded that there was an update, but that it is not the one that the remote uses.  The update will not work because it requires that you have an OS X version of XP running on your PC. That was not a problem because I already had XP installed on my computer, but it is a big drawback for someone who has a Mac.  This is not a universal receiver because it has a built-in receiver for a TV.  If you have a cable box in your home, I don't see why you would want to get this.  Sony needs to redesign this product because it is way too small and has way too much wiring to it.  For $35, I expect more than a basic remote.  It is also way too sensitive, so if your TV is not on and you accidentally push the button that controls the volume, you will probably turn the volume up by 30%.  I have to admit that the instructions don't mention how to use the button on the remote to turn it off.  Don't let the tiny size fool you.  You don't need a remote to control your TV if you have your cable box connected to your TV. The remote has a big button on it to turn off the TV so you don't even have to take your eye off the remote. That way you have to remember to use your remote to select which TV channel to watch.  And don't get me started on the power supply 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my son's desktop PC and he loves it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this router for my work and it worked fine for about 3 weeks. After that, I had to remove the WAN port from the switch and replace the existing wireless card with a new one that I bought from Amazon.After the new card was installed and the new port was unplugged, the router wouldn't reach the Internet and the IP addresses that the computer assigned to the other network devices on my network were lost. I called Amazon and they sent me the same defective wireless card that I had previously purchased from Amazon but when I contacted them they did nothing to replace the defective card. I spent about an hour on the phone with Amazon support and after explaining how the modem/router wasnt working properly and the problem had to do with the new wireless card not working properly, they did little more than to say that they "don't know" and would have to send me a new card. This was only a few days after I contacted Amazon because they had already shipped me the defective wireless-card and had not sent me a replacement. I then called and got disconnected.  I have contacted Amazon about the defective new card and the replacement I was supposed to get from them is also defective. I've called several times since then and they just tell me that "it's not their problem", etc etc

I have tried: hard pressing down on the button, pushing the power button for just a fraction of a second, etc.  No dice.  If it has been in use for 30 minutes or more, it will activate the unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works fine, but doesn't have a hardwired Ethernet port, so you have to plug it into a cable box. If your office has any printers, it'll make it difficult for you to use the printer and also leave the unit inoperable when you leave for the night.  I returned it and bought a Netgear WN1000v3, but found that it worked fine and I'm happy with the performance of my printer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I installed a Dell Epson Portracer 4x6 CDR scanner into this printer. Within a month the ink cartridge had begun to leak.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product is exactly as you see above. But the instructions state that the product can be replaced if the connector itself is damaged, not the cable.  Not true. You need to buy the repair kit to actually get the replacement cable. The cable is defective. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit came with only two connectors and a cable, so I bought three different adapters from Amazon.com and a different cable from Amazon as well.  All of them worked, but the third cable from them was only 3 feet long, the one from Amazon was 20 feet.  It's fine for a scanner with a large surface area such as a scanner and copier, but not for a laser printer.  I'm going to return it because of these problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   They say they can withstand up to 1000 rounds with no problems.  However, in about 15 minutes, I had to send them back for warranty service because the batteries were already dead.  They promised the battery would last for months.  After having to send it back for service, the battery was dead again within a couple weeks.  A $10 ebay item is not worth the cost of replacing batteries.

I sent the unit back and exchanged for the new product.  Unfortunately, the new one was defective. It will not turn on. I called HP support.  They said they are not able to provide the serial number for the defective unit.  I don't know how you can buy a used unit and expect the serial to be correct

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This headphone jack is not only terrible quality, it was very expensive.  I sent the product back to Radio Shack, the return label was torn off.  There is a plastic cap on the jack, so you can't plug it into your computer.  The metal piece on the outside is broken, so if you want to use it to plug headphones, you'll have to buy a new pair of headphones

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this cable because my old Apple Magic Mouse was not receiving any power from my computer.  Unfortunately, the product description doesn't mention that this cord has no power contacts, and that it will not provide a mouse signal.  Therefore, I am unable to use the mouse.  Please check the specifications carefully before ordering

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product thinking it was going to be a great value. I was wrong.  I returned the product within a month because the unit wouldn't turn on.  The only reason I returned it was because I didn't trust Panasonic's customer service.  If you have any doubts about buying a Panasonic product, you are probably better off sticking to products from Sony or Sony's competitors. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my wife's computer which we had just gotten out of the box and had no problem with. Then I checked and the hard drive was not recognized.  So I called customer service and they said they would send a new drive and take a look. I had to go to the office and pick up the drive. The drive arrived, but the hard drives were completely degraded.  I called back the next day and they sent me a new one and a new memory stick. Then they took a look and realized the drive was completely corrupted. They sent me another new drive for my system, but they could not get the same results as the first time.  It is now two weeks since I had a problem.  This company is terrible, they are not customer serviceable, you are paying $15.95 for a product that has the potential to malfunction at any time. I am returning the product. If they actually cared about their customers they would give a refund to anyone that has had a bad experience

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this product for over a month now and it is no better than my old Hitachi.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When we received our unit the power cord was already ripped, the tape was not even in the cassette holder.  This is the fourth time we've had to return an item from Pioneer.  We contacted Pioneer customer service, they told us they did not make this cassette.  If you have a choice to return it, do not buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because of the large volume of ports on my home network. Unfortunately, the port on my HP ENVY 6000i works perfectly fine. But all of my other ports on the HP work with the ASUS STRIX. I called ASUS customer service, and they said that you can only have one port for each card. If I can only use my HP port for something, that's what I'm going to do.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First off the picture on Amazon is incorrect.  The item was delivered in brown packaging, however in my box it says black, however it is a little hard to tell.  Also, it is not the right size.  It was supposed to be a 32GB thumb drive, but is only 16GB.  For those that know they will know why, however, for those that do not know it is the wrong size. The drive itself is also useless.  I have not tried any of the software offered, however my first attempt at copying a file to it did not work and took forever.  If you have anything larger than 16GB on your drive, I advise you to return it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The remote doesn't work and the battery never lasts more than 5 hours.

Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would give it zero stars if I could!  I bought this item expecting it to do the job as advertised, but the quality of the packaging is horrible.  I was shocked to see that it came in a single large package.  The USB cord was also the wrong color.  After spending almost an hour of unloading, unplugging, and re-unplugging this cord, I realized that this is the problem with these products.  You expect them to be cheap and easy to install?  Buy a good power strip.  If the cord is bad, take the whole unit back.  Just be careful, and check carefully before plugging in

I am using it with the antenna on the outside of my house. I was shocked to discover that only live shows appear on my TV. No commercials, no shows that I've watched. I am trying to return it right now, but I am so disappointed with this that I am not returning it. I would have to return the entire TV to get it fixed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the first time I have had any problems with a digital camera. The picture on this camera is terrible. I ordered it, and after one week of waiting for it to ship, it arrived with the case still on it.The box it was shipped in was damaged and didn't include the hard-drive. I sent it back, and it arrived again with the hard drive in the box, but the case was destroyed!I've seen these reviews on other sites, but I decided to try it out anyway.  I was able to get some pictures on the camera, but after about ten minutes, I was unable to continue taking pictures because the picture had already faded to black.  My guess is that this camera needs a separate hard drive to store the pictures and videos.  This camera is NOT worth paying for or spending time returning from Amazon

First, it only has one input, and it is a DVI-A, which is great for the small case it fits in but not great for connecting to my PC to transfer files.  Next, it does not have a USB port, which means that I cannot hook it up to my laptop to transfer photos.  Lastly, it was very slow to display what I wanted, and I would not buy another product from this vendor.  The return policy is a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had my HP 2910xs set up with a couple of disks in a RAID 6 array.  Within 5 days the unit started to randomly and repeatedly power off and on.  I contacted HP Tech Support, they sent me a new unit that was already installed with RAID 6 and did not have the problem.  However, the new unit would not accept my password.  They sent me the serial number of the old unit and that's when I discovered that the unit had a problem with the wireless card.  It's a HP wireless card, not the one supplied with the computer.  All of this was resolved with the purchase of a different card, but it was too late for me to return the HP2910xs.  If you're going to buy this, get a HP cable and an HP adapter.  Save your money and go with one of those.

First off, it is very hard to get into (I have a small laptop) and the USB ports are only about the size of a quarters.

They shipped it to me, and it is only 1GB.  If I had the 5GB card it would have been fine.   If it works well with the computer you are using to back it up, then you are SOL 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these, one for a business pc and one for an HTPC, both of which I installed using Dell's website.  I'm on the third model.  First, I had to return one of the units to be replaced,  then I had a problem with the return and couldn't get it replaced for two more months.  So, after waiting on Dell to send me a replacement for a month, I now have a second problem with my replacement, and the second replacement has stopped working as of today.  The software that comes with the product doesn't support booting Windows XP, even though the product name is called the XP USB DVD Writer (not sure why this is confusing).  They all work in Windows XP on a Mac but Dell doesn't know why.  It may be that there is some incompatibility with the firmware and the Macs simply refuse to boot the product from their optical media.  If that's the case, I can't recommend this product any more.  You can buy a good USB DVD burner from NewEgg for about the same price

The spindle drives are great.  They hold about 30 minutes of video.  These new tapes do not last more than 4 minutes at a time.  After trying to use one of the drives for 20 minutes I ended up in the hospital with pneumonia.  If you are thinking about buying this product buy the spindle drive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these because my old Mac mini was having trouble booting up and was not able to use all the drives that were included. When I received these, I discovered that the CD drives would not work with my new MacBook Airs. They worked fine with my old Mini. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 2 of these units with the hopes they were made to work together, they don't work with my Dell Latitude 1140c, they work with Dell Latitudes but Dell isn't offering them as a package deal anymore. I had to return both units and buy some of Dell's other units that don't have the same problem

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This TV does not support any kind of signal strength meter, so if you want to know what you are getting, use an RF meter to measure the signal strength of the signal coming from your antenna. This TV did not do that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones have no bass, no sound reproduction, and no volume control, just noise.I returned them. I can't give them two stars because I was told these were in production. The only good thing is they are very comfortable. They feel like plastic, but the sound they produce is horrible. Don't get these 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is no way that the unit can be mounted to the table. The mounting bracket is of such poor quality that it can only be used to hold the unit in one spot. The product itself is very poor. You should check with the manufacture to see if they make it. I would recommend buying a better quality bracket. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First time using this product.  I was not sure if I needed an optical drive.  So far, I am not happy.  The disk is scratched.  Also, the tray is scratched and useless.  Should have returned the product. I am returning this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit did not fit my desktop, and was also too small. The instructions on-line did not seem to be very clear and the description on- line of the product did not describe the size of the unit.  I returned the unit and ordered the correct unit. Unfortunately, it was too late for me to return it. I received only a return authorization and returned the incorrect unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It came as a replacement for a Mac Mini that was not working properly.  It was also missing a power cord.  I called ASUS tech support and told them what had happened.  They told me that it was my fault and they would not replace it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to use as my "network storage" drive.   Unfortunately, the only way to use it as a disk drive is to have it formatted to NTFS.  I don't know if Microsoft has released new versions of NTF.  Also, the hard drive tray has a large scratch on it.  So when you try to "open" your drive to use your files, the tray scrapes against the glass.  You have to repeatedly turn the tray over to get rid of the scratch.  All of this on a drive that costs me $20.00 at Radio Shack!  Do NOT buy these drives.  They are not user friendly,  they take up too much room in your computer,  and the tray is so scratchy that you can't use it for any of your normal uses

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased two of these and both stopped working. I called both of the phone support numbers and they told me to return them and return the order, which they did. I bought two of them thinking that maybe they could be swapped in to use with my older equipment. Unfortunately, these new ones had no switch built in, so it would only power on the units that had them.  I have yet to return these, because it cost them very little money to send them back, yet the unit would not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this item thinking it was a good item, but it turned out to be nothing more than a cheap cassette player with a built in player.  The player does play tapes but doesn't let you change the tracks or skip to the beginning of the song.  After only 3 weeks of ownership I had to return it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this to replace a defective iPod dock, and it didn't work, after two attempts with the iPod on the dock and then off it would no longer play music, so I returned it.  I contacted JVC for help, and they said that I should return it for a refund (in my case $35.00).  However I was told that JVC was not responsible for shipping damage and I would have to pay for shipping again.  That is ridiculous!!! I had the iPod attached to the dock for two days.  My experience with JVC is poor, and the fact that they do not take responsibility for shipping is unacceptable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product hoping that it would be ok. I should have known better. When my new computer was about to come in the mail, the power button would not work. I called Amazon and they said they had no records of any of their products having this problem. I thought it was the package, so I just got it from Amazon. They said it needed to be returned.  So, I had to buy a different brand of power cord.  Amazon, you have a customer for life. Get the product out of their catalog and get someone else to sell it to me. Don't even think about trying to sell me this cheap generic cord

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor to get a picture of a TV in our living room, and the picture looked fine. Then we started playing with the remote.

We took it back to the store and they said it would cost us about $50 for return of the monitor.We lost a week of using the monitor

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These batteries are advertised as being "high quality."  But when I used them I found that they only had 6 AAA batteries in the battery compartment, and none of them were in the right size to fill the NiMH cells in the NiCad cells that I was using.  I returned the batteries.  And it turns out that the only way to get more AAA batteries would be to buy a second set of batteries, then go back to the original location where you bought them and buy the additional AAA batteries. All the other reviews state that they will charge to full capacity.  They did not.  Do not buy these batteries. You will not receive enough NiMH to fill your batteries. If you want the highest capacity, buy a set of AA batteries

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Bought this TV to replace my old Sony.  I took it into my local electronics store, and they recommended that I return it.  When I called Sony, they recommended a different brand.  The picture was very poor and the sound was even worse.  In the end, I returned it and purchased a Sony. The picture looks even worse, and the picture is now terrible.  Even with the remote, you can't get the picture back to normal.  For the money, I would expect a better product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My computer monitor did not come with a power cord, so I bought this one with power cord and no monitor.  The screen was dark when I opened the box, but after 5 minutes of watching a DVD it worked!  It took several tries to get it to come to life.  No support phone number for this company.  It seems to work fine when my monitor is powered off.  I returned it because I thought I had received a good one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got the computer and monitor at the same time as getting this monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD-R drive in my Sony digital camcorder went out in January 2007, and after 3 weeks of sending it back for repair, Sony gave me a new drive.  I then discovered that Sony no longer provides a CD-RW drive for this unit.  The new drive is a CD writer, which also defeats the purpose of having the CD-ROM in the first place.  Sony should not be able to make such a mistake.  Buyer beware

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just recieved this monitor yesterday.  I plugged it in and it shows no picture.  It turns on with the picture, but only after about 10-15 seconds.  Even when it's not showing a picture, I can't move the monitor out of the way and leave it on my desk.  So I've got a monitor and a stand, but no picture and no video.  Just to get the picture back on, I have to move it.  Very very disappointed in this purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the item thinking it would allow me to record HD videos.  It only works as a VCR.  I returned it and ordered another item.  But when I received it I found out it does NOT have a memory card slot!   It's a pain in the butt to remove the label and reattach it.  The reel is stuck on top of the VHS player.  After a few hours I return it and get another item that DOES have a slot.  So my only other choice was to purchase a new VHS recorder and use this as the cartridge.  That takes time and effort, but I did that for about 3 months.  Don't waste your money if you want something that will record VHS.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this printer for about a month and the cartridge has already leaked.  I called Delta Tech but they said to use the print-center service because they do their own repair.  This is where I went wrong, they sent me to printcenter and I had to wait 4 days for them to get here.   They gave me no information about the cartridge.  They did mention it may need to be refilled because of a "factory defect".  So I had the printcenter technician remove the cartridge and then the cartridge arrived with a tiny little leak on the top.  When I called them to ask about the problem, they told me there is no way the printer could have leaked when it is in the machine with it.  The cartridge was replaced by Delta Tech, which they are not authorized to do

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this because I wanted to use my wireless printer at work.  The printer didn't print at all.  I called HP tech support and was told to send the printer in for service.  When it arrived, it was completely damaged, including the rubber case that held the printer to the base.  It also was missing the power cord to the printer.  At first I was very upset, but I called back and talked to a tech support rep.  He suggested I ship the printer back to HP (I paid the shipping charges), and he would send the replacement.  Boy was I surprised to get a return address from HP!!  I sent the printhead back (they have a separate return procedure) and the return label was returned to HP.  This time I had to send in the printer myself.  Well, it did print out, but HP service was nowhere to be found on the return package.  So I sent it in again, and got the new return label from HP. However, this time, the printer wouldn't print!  HP told me they couldn't even find the printer on HP's system!  So basically, I had bought two replacement printers because HP didn't service my damaged printer. I'll have to buy new printers from HP!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First of all, this was my first order with Amazon and they lost my package. They shipped the wrong product.  After calling them several times, they finally sent me a brand new one.  I ordered an ethernet cable for it, which I was told could be included with the product. Nope. I had to return it for a refund.  The product arrived in horrible condition.  It was in pieces, which made it very difficult to assemble.  As far as I can tell, no one from Amazon has even bothered to send me an email to apologize for the terrible condition of the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to return this item because my printer refused to print from it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this product in March and installed it, and was shocked to find that I needed an additional wire to make the product work. (The two wires from the power adapter were long enough to plug the product into the computer with.)After trying a variety of products, I discovered that I could not add the extra wire to the product without voiding the warranty. And I had to return the product.  I returned it, but they did not refund my return shipping.  In addition, the product does not work with a certain type of printer (a color laser) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The box came in a little damaged. I called and they did not return my call. The unit is not shipped with all of the instructions.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wanted to get some speakers and these did not come in the box, I had to wait 30 minuets. Then I was called and told that they did not ship the speakers from Amazon and they were not included in the warranty.  I thought these were the same speakers that came with my Pioneer CD player and all was ok.  Then when I started playing music I was told that the speakers were defective, even though they were packaged correctly. I took the speakers to Pioneer, the replacement speakers are no where to be found. So, if you don't mind spending more then $20 then I suggest you take the risk and go for a Polk or Denon instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The headphones don't fit my ears at all.  I thought they would work because they were made to fit someone else's ears, and the packaging said they were earphones.  But even if they did fit, there is no way that they will actually stay in your ears.  They slide off your ears like a pair of underwear, leaving you with ears that are extremely uncomfortable.  The only thing that makes them comfortable is if you put some oil on them and massage them.  No way I will buy these again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased this product from NewEgg to replace a failed HP MPL-A-6000, HP PBA-5001 and HP Deskjet 54800.   The MPL drives worked fine on the day of purchase, and the Deskjet failed on the next day.  The HP MPLA-5000 drives all worked fine.  My only criticism is that the rubberized gasket on the bottom of the drive is very weak, and does not stay in place when the bottom is pulled out.  A single crack (slight indentation) can cause the gasket to break completely.  If the rubber gasket is replaced, the HP drives will all fail again.  I am returning these drives for the HP Deskjets, which all work perfectly.  So far I have wasted $60, and I've wasted a great deal of time trying to return the defective MPLA-5000 units.  Please make sure you have enough gasket material before you begin to use the drive.  Hopefully I will have better luck with Deskjet units, which seem to have excellent gasket life

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't buy the Epson-ScanSnap Professional Series Inkjet Printer.  I've purchased 6 of these printers over the last 4 years.  The first one I bought, the printer would not print at all and then later on would only print the first page.  Now, I am stuck with a $500 printer that will not print.  Why Epson didn't listen to customers before is beyond me.  Epson's service department is unhelpful, too 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product has a bad reputation for being "good" for the price.  However, it doesn't hold a charge for more than about 2 hours.  I have been using these earphones for several years, and it takes about 3-4 hours to fully charge.  If you are like me, that means you spend a lot of money for something you only use a couple of times a year.  The earphones are NOT cheap; you will be spending close to $20 for them.  There are some other options for this price, and I've never had a problem.  In short, you will probably be better off with a more reliable product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i was extremely disappointed with this purchase.  It was supposed to fit my HP 1720 with a CD reader.  I tried the box and the card, and both were too small.  The store told me to try again on Friday.  That's exactly when I realized the card was defective.  If it fits you have a great product, but if it doesn't you have no product at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered one of these for my TV, but couldn't get any help on how to return it.  I thought the reason for the return policy was that they didn't make them in black.  Unfortunately, they're not.  So now I've had to buy a different brand, which I had to return, too.  There is absolutely no need for this product - and you could just buy a cheap TV and do a good job.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered a new printer with the HP cartridge but got this cartridge with the Epson ink cartridge.  My HP cartridge is only used for color prints.  I sent back the printer and ordered a different HP cartridge, but the cartridges are not interchangeable.  The Epson cartridges are more reliable and seem to print better.  This is the third printer I have bought and all were defective.  It took me about 3 weeks to track down a Dell repair center to replace both my HP cartridges and get the printer back to work.

It is the same old remote with a different label

I put it on a flat panel, and it just began to flicker, and the picture quality was horrible.  They would never last 100,00 hours.  It has now been on only 10,000.  The pictures are so dark, and I hate to use the remote.   Do not buy it, it's not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered these monitors online and got them in a timely fashion. When I got them, I found the right monitor was not included. The next day I received another shipment with the wrong monitor. When the shipment was returned, I was left without any monitors. The return shipping charges were non-refundable and it cost me a great deal of money to have them shipped back to me. The LCD display is extremely weak, and the buttons/switches are very difficult to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The remote has a problem: there is no way to turn off the receiver without disconnecting it from the network. This is a major oversight on the part of Tivoli's. There is no guarantee that this is a problem with the unit, and there is a remote with a power button, so they should not have left this feature out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Have not had any issues with the unit.  But, I had the same problem with my old PDA and returned it.  And, I'm currently returning this unit as well.  I have a new Sony Ericsson Ericsson G1000, and the PDA I was returning from was no longer available.  So, I thought I was buying an off brand product.  Well, I returned the unit, but am still trying to get my money back from the company that gave it to me.  Now, the unit does not work with my Ericsson, and will not connect to my Palm Pilot.  As the seller has already refunded my money, it seems as if they don't care.  If you have an old Sony Ericson G1000 PDA, get something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The TV works OK in a living room. But when you turn on the TV in a small bedroom or family room (where only two people watch TV) it is only available on one of the two HDMI inputs. I had to buy a second HDMI port just to make it work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this because I was having problems with my CD player, and wanted a compact CD player. I could not find any information on this CD player that matched what I thought it would be. After trying on several occasions, this was the only one that worked. I called and they sent me a new one that didn't even work for a week, then they sent it to me with the same problem and then they did send me the new one. I still have to return it. I was so frustrated, that I returned it for the 2nd time. I bought 2 of these, one for my DVD player, 1 for my CD. I know you can tell the difference. The one that does not work for some reason doesn't make a clicking noise, and doesn't scan correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was disappointed by the poor sound quality of this headset.  It has the same sound as a cheapo $5 headset but with much better bass response and no way to adjust the sound level.  I have a Sony MDR-7506 and both are great but I needed a cheap headset to do work at home so I bought the one on Amazon and immediately returned it because it couldn't be adjusted properly for my ears.  Now I have to get an expensive pair of headphones to go along with my MDRs.  This is not worth the price you pay for this headset

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are the WORST cd players I have ever had to try.  They don't play anything.

The CD's just went everywhere 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a bad product. If you want to use this printer to print documents, the ink cartridges are not included.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item thinking it was a quality product. I have been replacing the cables for over a year. This product is simply unacceptable. First, there is no provision for replacement of the cables if you ever need them again. Second, you cannot adjust the volume in the CD player. When I go to press play, the volume is full. There is no way to decrease the volume without unplugging the player from the computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this mouse only to find that it was not compatible with my HP Pavilion.

However, both mice worked fine with my Logitech Wireless Elite mouse (which is the only one in my house to have this mouse).    The replacement mouse was returned and replaced with the Logitech, and now both mice work fine with the Pavilion but no the Pavillion.   If you want the mouse to work with your HP Pavilion, buy the HP.  If not, get the Logi or something else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i am very dissapointed with this purchase.  I bought it thinking it would be a good way to connect my HP DL1650 printer and Xerox copier at the same time.  Unfortunately, it would only print one page.  And it did not autofit when I wanted it to.  It would only autofill the next page. I was unable to return this product or get any assistance from HP.  You have to go to the website and type in the return code to return it.  So be careful with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took 6 tries to get this to work. I don't know if it was the firmware or the cables that didn't meet specification.  It is not even a replacement for my ATA/IDE SATA cables. It is for hard disks only

Now I have a pair of earbuds that I cannot use.  Please do not send me these for warranty purposes 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this printer in January of 2008.  It has not worked out of the box.  I called Hewlett-Packard and they said it was a software problem.  They sent me a new software CD but I did not install it.  You can't even print from the menu system on the printer.  The printer works if you use the auto-filtration setting to remove the paper from the cartridge.  Otherwise you cannot use it as a regular printer. The cartridges are cheap and no longer available.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this receiver can't even send an AP to a CD player. and the antenna doesn't even reach the receiver.  I have a vintager sound system that is mounted in a closet.  The antenna will not reach the sound system or the receiver, even though it is within a foot of them.  It only works with Pioneer products, and only with Pioneer CD players.  This receiver works only with Kenwood products, i.e. the KDC-120.I bought it, it worked, but after two weeks the receiver would not connect. I called Pioneer customer service, and the tech on the phone told me that I need to "press the buttons in" and then it would work.I asked him where on the receiver was that button? and he told me to press the buttons at the top of the receiver (where the antenna is) and then the button at the bottom (where all the buttons are located on the side of the unit).So basically, it is useless to have a receiver that doesn't work unless you use Pioneer CD's.  So, if you don't have Pioneer CD, don't buy this receiver

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased two of these for my wife and I to be able to connect to two computers at the same time. One was a HP Pavilion laptop, the other was a Dell desktop. When the two of them were turned on, the HP Pavilion's WIFI stopped working. I called HP and got a very unhelpful answer. So I returned the HP laptop and ordered one of the Dell laptops. This time it worked properly. However, when I tried to connect again with the Dell, WIFi stopped working completely. I returned that one and ordered another Dell. This one too was working properly until I tried connecting to the HP again, with no success. It was then that I decided to return the HP laptops because I found this little unit to be a total dud, a waste of money.

It would skip to the first song then play the first track.  I called Sony and they gave me a replacement CD.  Then I tried to listen to the CD that had just been played, again it would skip.  If you buy this CD player, DO NOT BUY this CD recorder.  There are much better products out there

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took awhile to get the unit to work in the new computer.  After it did, it worked perfectly in 2 seconds.  Then it went to sleep and wouldn't turn on.  If you are looking for a way to get CD-R's, this is not it.  I returned it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these cables for my TV, VCR and computer. They do NOT fit in my MP3 player or DVD player.The directions are incorrect. You need to fold the cable in half. They are not soft and pliable like the ones at Amazon.com

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I ordered the iPod nano, I figured that I would just get one with a USB cable. Boy was I wrong. The shipping was slow, I still haven't received the product. When I contacted Apple, they informed me that the iPod Nano was not being made anymore and that it was no longer available. So I went back to Amazon and got the item, only to get a defective unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor because I was looking for a monitor with a high resolution that I could use for video conferencing.  It seems to be exactly that - high resolution and not HD!  However, the resolution is pretty low and you lose image quality.  Very disappointed with this purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these and was disappointed. The first time I turned on my computer, it would not power on at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The LCD on the HP Pavillion 7200 did not display any colors at all on the first use. I tried to call HP Customer Service, and they confirmed that it was a defect. However, HP never sent me a replacement for the defective LCD. After several days, HP finally shipped me a new monitor to replace the defective one. However it had a different screen. I returned the replacement monitor because HP was not willing to repair or replace it for free. I'm very disappointed with HP for not replacing the defective HP LCD, especially because they are supposed to be one of the most reliable companies out there 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product and it didn't arrive before I had to return it.  I ended up buying another item and it was more than I had paid for it!  I have the Dell Procurve N5025 and that is exactly the same product.  This product is a total waste of time and money.  If you don't need a CDROM drive, don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit arrived broken.  I contacted the store who shipped it and they told me the same thing.   I called HP and they said I had a defective item and they were sending a new one to me.  Unfortunately the new one was defective.  They charged me for return shipping and they didn't send the unit.  HP was supposed to ship it out by end of the day (Nov 28).  I had to return it on Monday.  The return shipping cost was over $30, the cost for a new item was $9, and HP charged me another $9 for return fees for not having the item sent.  So the total is $43.02 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was the first iPod touch that I ever purchased.  The case was very poorly constructed, and the product shipped did not include the original headphones.  Luckily I found some that were just a little too expensive.  After only a few months of use, the earbuds no longer worked, and after two weeks, the headphones fell out of the case.  I returned the product and returned the case, and still have not received any replacement earbud(s).  I am extremely disappointed with this product, and I am sure many other users are, as well.  Please do not buy these unless you are 100% certain that you have everything that you need to use them.  You will likely need to return them and purchase new ones, as they are simply not very good for your money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my HP 2920b and the power strip wouldn't stay plugged in. It kept getting hung up and resetting to factory defaults.  I returned it and ordered a different model. The HP product was shipped and installed on my HP PC.  The first time I used the HP Power Strip, I noticed that it seemed to be missing the USB port.  When I tried to plug the USB in from my PC, the computer would hang.  After changing the power adapter to a USB extension cable, I was able to connect the HP product to my HP computer.  However, the Power Strip is not sturdy enough to withstand the abuse of a typical home PC. It eventually became difficult to remove the battery from the HP unit.  In short, I am highly disappointed with the HP 2910i Power Strip and recommend that you buy the HP HP 2970

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product based on the excellent reviews, and was disappointed to find that the "USB" connector on the box is actually a mini-B to mini-A female.  I received the item and the mini-C connector was completely different from the one I ordered.  After contacting Asus, they did send me a replacement, but the replacement was the wrong connector (mini-C).  It was no different than the mini B to mini A male connector in the box.  Very disappointed in this product, and returned it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I returned this cable and the remote. I have had a Sony remote for years and have never had any problems with it. I purchased the cable with Sony's recommendation to use it to link my Sony HD TV to the computer. I did this because the remote is easy to use.The problem is that the remote has two buttons to select channels and one to tune them. I am not sure if this is a defect with the cable. I cannot get it to connect properly either on my TV or the computer to my Sony TV. I'm very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the cable and controller for this item. I received the item, but the item was missing the required dongle. I called customer service and the representative advised that I should call the manufacturer. I contacted Sony, but they said they did not make the item. The item that I received was defective, not the correct cable or cable driver, it came with a defective remote control. Sony should be held responsible for shipping and handling and providing adequate customer service. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product on the assumption that it had two ports.  I didn't realize that the product had only one port, and I ordered the wrong cable.  When I received the defective product, I sent it back to Amazon, which was the right thing to do.  They offered me a credit for the defective item, but I didnt want that.  Now, I'm out over $150 because I spent the money on a cable that I didnít order!  I don't recommend this product.  Amazon.com has a 1-800 number, so if you ever have an issue with this product you can contact them and they can help you.  And, as Iíve pointed out to Amazon.

I should have read the other reviews first.  The product shipped was damaged.  I returned it for a refund and am still having problems with this product.  Even after two months, I am still on the search for a replacement.  If you want to pay over $100 for a hard drive enclosure, buy a RAID enclosure, not a RAID controller.  And get a good one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used this printer about 7 times, and the first print is never finished.  The print head is always jammed in the carriage.

It took me a month to get the printer working again

A week later, it worked fine with my other two computers.I have gone back and forth between Amazon, and my local Best Buy, and both have returned my item. The same thing happens with the two adapters for the computer.  I bought one adapter to use with both of my Macs. Both of them failed. The other one I bought was for the PC, which is now broken, too. I have had three attempts to return this item, but neither Amazon nor Best Buy will accept my return

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There are three issues with the product. 1.  It does not fit my Apple Magic Mouse (which has a larger trackpad than the Dell Mini 9400). I tried several sizes and no matter what I do, it would not fit.  2.  I could not find any information on how to return or exchange my product, so I sent it back and have not received it.  3.  Once the product is used, it becomes very difficult to remove it. It is virtually impossible to remove the trackpad from the trackball without causing damage.  If I wanted to make a point about a good product, I'd compare it to the Trackman.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered one of these as an upgrade from the first HP I bought. It was a no-brainer that I would get the larger model because of its size.  I placed an order with the company and it was shipped as a replacement item from a different company.  So, I had to order from the HP Web site and it came out after a few weeks.  The monitor only works if you have a laptop that is at least 9" wide or bigger.  There is no way that my Dell XPS 7100 fits in the monitor.   It is not a problem with the monitor, it's a problem that the only way to make the monitor work is to use a laptop and then transfer the image to the monitor with a DVD or a computer.  This is not something that I expect from a new company and I have already given up on HP

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 2 of these.1 came,2 did not. They both came with the wrong connectors installed.  I contacted Pioneer and they were uncooperative.  The problem with this product is that it will only work with Pioneer CD Players that have the 3.5mm input.  If you want to use it with any other device, you will need to order adapters.  So, be prepared to shell out extra cash to purchase adapters. That alone is a huge mistake on Pioneer's part, just a bad product in general.

If you have a wall unit, or plug the unit in only to realize that the power cable is still being used as a battery, just throw it away.  It's an old-style device, and no one is going to want to plug it in just to use it as a remote.  Get a power strip

They did not know the problem and sold it to another customer for $300 with an "unreturned item" policy.  So basically Best Buy ruined my investment.  I ended up returning that too, but they would not exchange it for a new one, even though it had already been replaced with a different one from a different store

The day they arrived, my computer was not able to play the discs. So I returned them. The following day, they had the computer order me new cards. The first card had several dead spots on the right hand side of the display. I returned the second card. When the third card arrived, it had multiple dead spots in the same position. I did return the fourth, which also had dead spots. After several weeks of frustration, the sound was still not working. I called Best Buy support and they told me they do not stock this card. They told me to call Pioneer. I call Pioneer and get a person who says they no longer stock this product. So, I have to get the same card from Pioneer again. What a waste of money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is no option to select different adapters. No one needs a dual card adapter in their computer case. Buy an old school floppy drive for that 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i got this product, i thought it was great.  But it isnt.  I had to return it because it didn't work with the original cable.  If you think you will use this with only one set of speakers, you are mistaken.   So if you like to use a cable to connect your receiver to your receiver, buy something else.  i would rather spend my money on an original Pioneer set

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This card did not work at all when it arrived. It did not have a driver. I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement card that did not allow me to make or receive any calls or data transfer. I had to return the replacement. The replacement card came with a different radio, so I can't even call in or see my home phone number with that radio. It is a shame that this card is not warranted for its low price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product to help keep my cable modem running.  I've only had it for a month.  The sound quality is awful.  It seems to pick up some ambient noise from a room with soft furniture and the occasional television, but not well enough to make it usable.  For instance, the volume is too low in my room to hear it even when standing a few feet away from the receiver.  No matter how many times I switch the volume to its maximum, the receiver will still hear and say "low".  This is the only reason I've given it a three star rating - the sound quality could be improved a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have purchased this item over the last 4 times from Amazon.  I returned the item to Amazon on 3 of the 4 occasions.  The first one, I didn't even know about the defective design.    Second one, the unit wouldn't boot up.  Third time, the power cable broke.  So far, I have sent it to Amazon twice more to exchange for a new one.  These are the reasons I gave up on using these products

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This USB adapter works as advertised, but the adapter itself does not work very well with any of the computers I have. I was very disappointed when I saw the rating for this product, because I was hoping to use this adapter with my new HP laptop which will be delivered tomorrow. This adapter will only fit the one computer I have, and that computer does not support Windows XP at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the product and received it less than 48 hours later. I immediately plugged it in and it did NOT work.  The box had been damaged in transit.  This is a very old technology and it is still under warranty.  Returned the product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have ordered more than 10 sets of these modules (and am still waiting for them to ship from China).  The first one that I received didn't work properly with a Macbook Air running iTunes 11.  I returned it, sent a new one, and got another one that worked on my Macbook.  After one month, I am still getting only one set of the three modules I ordered.  And I will be returning the last one.  These are not even covered by the warranty.  Don't buy from  Icom.  Buy from another company 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It only comes up to 100 feet, so for someone in your house it's fine, but not for a client in your office who sits or stands next to the server every few minutes.  I was sent a new unit, and it took forever to ship, and has yet to arrive.  The one I have is still faulty.  It needs to come up to 200 feet.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product was advertised as having a hard drive eject button, however, when I tried to activate the eject button on this drive, it made the drive unreadable.  The eject button worked fine with another brand drive.   I returned it for a different drive, but this time it also has a problem.  One time it started working, but when I try to write to the drive, the drive will start skipping bytes. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking that the 4GB SD card would be sufficient.  Well, I got to this point only to discover that the card was too small and the phone would not recognize it.  I returned the item and ordered the 5GB.  And again, the card that arrived was too large.  Returned again, and again, had to return the item.  So I guess you can say it is an expensive lesson.  But there is no other way to say it - the card itself does not come with a case - and, unless you want to spend several dollars to purchase a new case (which I do not recommend!), the one that I received does not fit the case I have for this card

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's not that the product was bad, it's that you have to pay $30 for the return mailer and send it in for it to be repaired! Don't waste your time with this product, just use a $20 item like a $5 CD recorder. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product and was very impressed with the price and performance.The problem is the audio quality is very weak and the sound is very muffled.When I called the company, I was told the exact opposite and that they did not provide an exact warranty for their products.I was very misled and could not even get a replacement.I contacted several other sites and they were also very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am currently installing my first external hard drive into this hard drive enclosure.  I thought the case would hold my hard drive securely, but it turned out to be more of a challenge.  It is a pain to try to insert the drive because the case has a small opening at the back for the insertion of the drive.  The case also did not come with a long-range cord, or any instructions on how to install the drive in the enclosure.If you do not use your external drive as often as you think you should, do NOT purchase this case.  Get the SPC-50 instead.

The second one I recieved did work, and I ordered another one, expecting it to work just like the first. It wouldn't - the picture came out as bluish black. When I returned that one, I ordered an Epson V600, and that worked perfectly. I paid full price for those two cameras, so I'm just left with two cameras with a horrible, useless, overpriced product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This CD changer does not fit our car, because it is too big.  We bought it to use with a Sony CD player, which is mounted high on the dash.  It sits right above the radio.  Our car's radio does not have a mute button, so we had to turn off our CD player to turn on the CD changers.  The CD player works fine, just not the CD player itself.  There are many other, much better CD changing units on the market.  Buyer beware. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this monitor thinking it was going to work with my new HP 715c. It didn't work and HP sent me a new one.

The monitor would work for a short time but would not turn on and would not be able to be adjusted to any size. I returned the monitor, and will be returning HP's replacement as well

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing doesn't work for me. I am an avid audio user. I got it thinking I could use it to connect my CD player, MP3 player and TV. Not only is it too big to fit in the TV (maybe it was designed that way? I can't remember...), but it also doesn't seem to be compatible with the two players, not even for the audio input. I thought I could just use my laptop to connect all three. But no, you need a special cable to connect the devices together. I would advise against buying this product 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I received this I was expecting it to work as advertised. Instead it has failed multiple times.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this product to replace my old PDA which had a dead slot.  The product was packaged poorly and came with a screwdriver already in it.  So I got another item from Amazon to make the replacements and had the product ready to ship.  Then the UPS guy called me and said he needed to come pick up the package because it was in a dumpster.   The UPS guy told me the package was lost in transit, and the only thing he could tell me was that he would ship it back to Amazon and they would ship the replacement. I called Amazon again and they told me they didn't know.  I called the local office of the UPS company and they were clueless as well. So when the replacement shipment arrived at my door, I tried to put it in the slot, but to no avail.  Now I have a dead, lost product. Amazon should return the product and get me a refund 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been ordering these printers from HP for two years.  Today was the first time I received a print job from them.  I called HP and they said they were sent out and they were not.  A few hours later I got another email saying the same thing.  So far I have tried each of the HP print types: Color, Photo, Preview and Black and White.  None of them worked correctly.  Only the black and white prints were acceptable.  No matter how many times I tried to print from my HP Printer, it would not work.  HP could not provide any assistance in fixing the problem.  Very frustrating

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I received this product I thought it was one of those low end mp3 players like the one I had.  When played in my car it cut out and I had to go back to the store to order another player.  I've been using a Logitech Wireless G930 for a while and I would never buy anything from Apple/Logitech again for any reason.  But this player would not work in my Mac (PowerMac G4) and was almost impossible to use in my iPod with the built in player software.  The sound quality was ok and the only thing I don't like about it is that there are no instructions on the product that will tell you how to get the batteries replaced

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this adapter to use with a laptop, thinking it was a normal adapter.  I received it and installed it only to discover that the card doesn't fit the adapter, it just sits in the slot.  This is true with the product manual as well.  For what it's worth, the manual describes the problem as the "normal" card fitting into the adapter not being the actual card, but the "standard" card, which is slightly larger.  Don't get me wrong, that's a real pain in the rear, but it's a different model and I'm not going to spend more time troubleshooting that issue, just return and exchange it for something that works.  All the other parts work fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a bad product.  It has an on/off switch on the back, not the front.  The product is not labeled as such, but I got it by mistake.  I sent it back, and Amazon would not honor my return.  For the price, and for having to use a battery pack to get it to turn on (which only works in the dark), I'd just get the Kenwood TS-CD103R.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this because I thought it was the best product on the market. It was not. I went through a total of 5 attempts to set up the card.  After that, I returned the card, because I had to return a laptop and was very frustrated. After 2 months, I called AppleCare and had my Mac repaired.  Now, I've returned the entire computer to get a new one.  The only reason I am not giving the product one star is that it was a gift.  I would not buy this AGAIN

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to use with my iPhone, but it doesn't work with that either.  I had to return it because I didn't read the instructions.  It seems that Apple has stopped making iPod docks with a 3.5mm jack, so I guess they're all the same now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just bought this product from Walmart because of the great price I was offered. I did not use it at first because I figured I could get a refurb from Target at a lower price. After one week, I discovered that my unit would not work with my Dell computer because it did not have the ATA-compatible drive. The product does not come with a program to configure it. I called Target and they said they could send me the program to set it up, but I would need to call back to get it. They would only ship to a retail location.So, I called back to tell them that the product was faulty and could not be repaired, and Target refused to ship me the drive. I am just glad that I didn't spend all that money and just return it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product thinking it was going to save me from the headache of buying and installing an RJ-45 cable and router. I was totally mistaken.  I have used this to connect two computers that I had just plugged into a machine.  Unfortunately, the signal from one of the computers is so weak that it only works if both computers are connected to the same coax cable and the network router is on the other end. If I would have known this I would never have bought this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a HP ProCurve G5-2700 server with this hard drive.  The drive was delivered about 10 days later.    As of this date the drive is very scratched and has a few small scratches on it.  I called HP and was told to send the drive back.  When I called back, the customer service representative told me that the warranty on this hard disk is only 6 months.  That's too little time to get the drive in shape

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this monitor from Best Buy to replace my old Dell.  The only difference is that it is a bit darker.   But that is the least of my problems.  I have had the monitor in three days.  But, that is because I only used it for 15 minutes each day.  And I had to use it every other day.It is not reliable, not user friendly, and not well protected.  So I am sending it back.  My recommendation is to get the LG P2414Q

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones are a piece of junk.  I ordered two pairs for my boys and they are the most uncomfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn.  My boys have both worn the same pair for the last six months.

They are not water proof, they are not adjustable and they have not solved the problem of them not playing well with other earbud types

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have owned two of these printers, and I have already lost one of them. Both came with the cartridges already in them.  When printing on my HP Color LaserJet Pro 840c, one cartridge had to be used twice before it was able to print. It was only about 5 minutes of continuous printing before I had to change the ink.  I could have purchased another cartridge from HP if I had known this issue, but it was still a pretty frustrating experience.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this to record our family pictures, but the camera just doesn't work, and the SD card doesn't fit in the card reader. It's been a week, and I can still feel the difference in sound from the card. It also makes a beep whenever you try to copy a picture. You can't even change the card name, you have to do it the old fashioned way (write it down). The price was right, but you'd have to buy a blank SD card to get good quality. It won't be useful for most people

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item expecting that it would be an excellent device, but it turns out to be a pain in the ass. The item arrived in excellent condition except for the cable, which I could not figure out how to get to unscrew. The instructions are all in Chinese, and the picture that I was shown on the internet showed a long plastic piece that is hard to get at with even the smallest screwdriver, and I could only manage to pull one off with a very small screwdriver. It took me over 3 hours to break the cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These earbuds don't stay in your ears at all. You will need to take the buds off and put them back on a few times to get them to stay on your ear. They are not comfortable and the sound is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a replacement for an older printer, not realizing that it does NOT print from photos taken with my Nikon Coolpix P600.  I have to take the prints out, open the package and re-print them all.  The software is not compatible, as it's for a different system.  You have to buy the software for that system, and then it's not worth buying.  Don't buy this.  Get a Fujitsu ScanSnap or something like that

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this product, and used it for a couple of months. I have now had to return it due to problems.  The product itself is fine.  However, it did not turn on during the first few months. When I called, it was told that the unit needed to be returned.  After 3 weeks, I received an "RMA" for the item.  I called and was told I had to do the return on the spot, that the return label had already been delivered.   The "RMM" came with instructions on how to return the item, how to ship it back to HP for tracking, and where to ship a return label.  So far I've sent it back, and I'm still waiting on the return tracking.  HP is obviously trying to get a quick buck off of the consumer.  Buyer beware

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The monitor works ok, but the connection to the TV is awful.  The TV connects to the monitor via a RCA connector, and the monitor uses the same connector for both.  Both the TV and the Monitor use the same connectors for audio and video, but one of the connectors on the TV has no label, and you can't find it in any of the TV's control panels.  I tried using the same RCA connectors for both inputs, and for the video connection, tried to connect them through a coaxial connector to another TV, but it would not work.  It was a total nightmare.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different monitor

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this drive and after 2 months had to return it because of a hard disk error.  They should recall this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I paid $120 for the "Smart-UPS" system.  It never delivered my orders (or any other customer's).  Now, because of the power outage, I have to cancel my UPS contract.  I am forced to use a competitor's system. If UPS would have delivered my order, I would have returned it in the first place.  No apology, no refunds.  Now the batteries are dead.  If you buy this product, be prepared to return it, and get a brand new UPS that you can return to get a full refund.  For $120, you could have bought a reliable, self-contained UPS and saved yourself a lot of frustration.  Instead, I am out $120 in lost UPS fees, and you have a dead system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the 8 port adapter for my HP dv200 sata. When the item came I realized I would need the 6 and 4 port adapter.   It is hard to tell the difference, because all the ports are the same size.  I sent the 8 ports to HP for warranty service and the 6 port adapter went to the waste bin.  Now I have to return both.  HP needs to issue a new adapter to each customer to match the color and specs of the original adapters

I received an invoice for $15.00 (or even more for free postage). I called Best Buy to ask why and they said the price was higher in the store because they needed to get the price down. When I called back, they had the same price at the time I made my purchase (March 5th). When I showed the invoice to the customer support representative, she said it would take 24 hours to check the price and if I didn't like it, I could return it. I called them back and they told me the price only changes if they are out of stock

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a new external hard drive for my PC and I was really excited when I ordered this drive from Amazon.com. However, within a few days of the order I learned that this drive is only compatible with Windows XP.  I sent Amazon and Microsoft a couple of emails and still they had not provided an updated compatibility list.  Then, just a few weeks after I ordered the drive, it was stolen from under my bed.  Fortunately, I had a backup copy of my files.  However, even if Amazon had a list of Windows XP compatible drives, I am not sure that I would even bother with it

This is not a technical support issue.  Please DO NOT BUY IT 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product thinking that it would work with my MacBook Air. When I first connected it I was greeted by a flashing blue light. The LED bled at the same rate, so when I tried to switch the computer on it only displayed a warning message that it had not been inserted into the computer yet.  After numerous phone calls and e-mails to HP, it is finally coming in. The problem is that the connection does not have any connection indicator. I tried attaching it to the computer, then the monitor, then my keyboard, then just pressing and holding the power button on the back of the unit

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a big disappointment. The picture on the box is misleading as it says the unit is designed to be used with a Sony receiver.

If you want to use these connectors with a printer, look elsewhere. I'm very disappointed in this purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a HP 870c from Amazon.com, had the case shipped from Amazon and had it installed the next day. I used it for a few months before finding that it would not boot from the drive it came with.  I called Amazon and they said that they could not send me a replacement drive, the HP 871c that I was using was the only one they could mail out.  So after 3 months I had to return the 870. Amazon gave me a credit for the price of the 871, but no replacement.  They sent me an 871 which worked fine, but when I powered it on, it booted from the CD, not the drive 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this router from Netgear in the mail on Nov. 6, 2004.  It worked great for a week or so, then crashed.  I called Netgear and the tech who replaced it was very apologetic and said the router was defective.  No replacement was offered, and I received a new, cheaper router in the next few days.  This one has been even more unreliable.  In addition to that, the instructions for changing DNS for the wireless network were lost in the post, so I now have to go into the Netgear control panel to set it up.  Please don't sell such defective products, Netgear! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I installed the HP Z620 and immediately noticed the HP logo on the power cord wasn't centered, but the one on the cord was, so I thought I had a bad cable.  The HP logo was fine after some investigation and repositioning of the cord, but I then received a call from HP to inform me that this was the most common problem with the HP software.  If you don't know what a software problem is, think of it as being locked out of something that is actually working fine 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very poorly designed printer. If your ink cartridges do not go flat then it will run out of ink too soon. If you have a roller type printer then use a roller with a low-quality ink cartridge, like ink jet. If not you have to buy a whole new pack of cartridges and the printer will only use about half of the new cartridge 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First of all, this item is not designed to receive phone calls.

The adapter shipped quickly, and I received the unit a few days after I ordered it.  Then, within a week, the unit was completely dead.  Not only did I have to return the unit, but Samsung sent me a new one with a new interface, even though the original unit worked fine.  I was very disappointed that a good-looking product would fail so quickly.  So far, I'm out a $350.00 in hard-earned money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried to purchase this product through Amazon.com and they would not ship it to me. I called Best Buy and they were very helpful but they still would not accept the item.   They recommended you buy it from Digi International. I tried that and they shipped it to a FedEx Office box but UPS took it, not FedEx. UPS would not deliver the item because there was no tracking number on the shipment. The box was delivered to me in the FedEx Office parking lot. UPS had to call FedEx for pickup of the package because it was in their parking lot and UPS had a tracking number to the box.  I called FedEx and they said that the FedEx office did not pick up the package for UPS.  So I called UPS again to get the tracking number for the package and UPS said they would call FedEx to pick it up. UPS never called FedEx to get pickup of box. UPS finally called and FedEx came and picked up box. I had to wait about 10 hours for FedEx to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was a problem with my Dell PC. I ordered this item and received it less than a week after ordering. I called Dell and they told me there is a big defect with the PowerDVD 2000. I took my PC to the Dell store where I found that the DVD ROM chips were bad and would not read the discs. I returned the defective item and ordered new ones. It took almost 6 months for the new PowerDVDs to ship. In the end I was left with a big hole in my DVD shelf. The new Power DVDs, however, are not compatible with the old ones. They would not boot my PC from the DVD drive. They worked with my old HP printer, but I could not print out anything. The only good thing I have to say about this DVD reader is that I did not have to open it to replace the chips in the DVD. I am returning this product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a new Dell Inspiron 1710 XPS 8525 today.  I immediately noticed that the touch screen would not work.  Dell provided me with the replacement.  When I turned the machine on for the first time, the screen would still not work properly.  After another 15 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to boot the machine up, I called Dell support.  They sent me the original replacement, but only the touch panel worked properly. They provided me a new unit, but it would not even turn on.  Again, Dell provided a new replacement, with the same issue.  Finally, I contacted customer service.  The call lasted only 20 minutes.  Upon completion of the call, I was told to ship the unit back to Dell, so I did.  Now I'm left with a useless machine, and a $400 Dell credit I cannot use to buy a new machine.   This product is clearly not supported, and the customer service reps and support agents are both slow and uninformed.  My advice to everyone is this:  DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First of all, the packaging is very, very poor. The device was shipped from China with only a piece of paper with the part numbers on it. I called Amazon and they sent me the box with the packaging removed, and the box was shipped by FedEx.  That was supposed to be for a week delivery, but it's been 6 months.  I returned it and they shipped a new unit. I had to send them a photo of the box as they didn't ship it that way.  Still, it's a pretty crappy device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wanted a keyboard for my HP Elitebook which could be used as a notebook. I used a Dell keyboard (not the business-like one) to try to save some money. I ended up giving up on that.I bought the HP Wireless Elite keyboard on Amazon.com. I have not used it yet. I ordered one with a detachable "scroll lock" keyboard. The unit I got did not have that option, so I returned it. Then I called HP support and got the same "it doesn't work with this one" message. I got the original unit back, and it worked fine the first time, but when I tried to use the detachable keyboard with my HP notebook it would not work.I returned the keyboard to Amazon and got another one with the detached keyboard, and that worked fine. So I am now stuck with the original keyboard, which I am told is not in warranty anymore. I also found an HP replacement part that I am supposed to send to Amazon, but it isn't listed on Amazon, so that will take a while.I am sure they will work fine with a generic Microsoft keyboard. I can't see why HP would have sent me a bad one. I am using HP's new keyboard on my HP Pavilion dv4000 series notebook. That is another story altogether.For $30.00 plus $4.75 shipping, I could have gotten a genuine Microsoft Wireless Keyboard, not a cheap imitation. I don't trust the product, and I am very disappointed. I will not buy HP products again. They should change their warranty policy to be much more clear and to help people avoid the problems I am having.If you can get a genuine Wireless keyboard at a discount from HP, buy that. Otherwise buy this for a computer with a standard keyboard only and save money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are not wireless adapters.  If your computer has wireless, you may need to connect it with your computer.  I had to remove the adapter from my desktop, plug it into my HP Pavillion 2340 notebook, and then back into my computer. I also had to manually switch between wireless and wired adapters in Windows.  These adapters are terrible.  They are made to be used with a desktop computer. The only problem is that your computer's wireless is only capable of using two of the three ports. I returned them because I did not understand that one port was a wired connection and the other was a wireless one.  Do NOT get these adapters unless you are really sure you are using one of the two ports you can use with a laptop.

Get a good CDROM and use it for storage.  Save your money!  Get an RCA/JVC/Toshiba/Logisys.  Don't buy this one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was no way I was going to give these a chance.  They didn't fit in my Macbook, and the volume on my CD player barely went down.  I returned the box and sent it back for a refund.  These are a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After using the product, I noticed that the unit only has 4 memory slots. I don't know why there are 4, but at least one of the slots will not support any memory cards. I ordered 2 more of these to install in my Mac Mini. Both units would not boot. The first one wouldn't boot at all and the other wouldn't function at all. I returned both units and I'm going to return the one that works. It would have been more cost-effective to order 2 identical Mac Minis and use the included instructions to install the memory cards in each computer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit because it came with all the cables, power, and a hard to find battery.  The product is terrible.  You will need to buy a third party power cord to get the maximum amount of power to your computer.  Also, it is not possible to charge the unit using its own batteries.  Make sure you get one that has a wall plug 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product I ordered has arrived after a week and a half!  The pictures of the product were clear, but I can't believe they would use "Frosted" graphics on their web site for a CD player.  I ordered the player because it said it was FDM-6B.  It is the same thing as the FDM CD player from the CDman catalog, except it's a little smaller and the CD is not as large.  The player seems to be ok, but it has some problems.  First, the disc tray is very small.  Also, the CD player requires batteries, but the batteries have no place to go.  So, the player is always charging.  If the batteries are out of the player, the players volume level goes up and then back down.  You have to keep the volume level at the lowest level to save the disc, but that means you can't use it for any other purpose than listening to music.  Just keep the discs in the tray, and they'll be fine.  But this is a huge problem, because you can never make them play faster.  Maybe I am spoiled by my FDM player, but these issues with the CD tray and CD player make it almost useless for listening to CDs.  A CD is good enough for a short workout, but not for listening.  After 2 weeks, the batteries on the player have died.  Fortunately, the box came with a replacement set of batteries, so I got a refund.  Don't buy this, unless you're willing to use batteries for the CD players only.  This is the worst deal I've ever made with any CD player, and you'll have to live with the batteries 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking that it would allow me to keep using my older Sony cassette player. Well, I was wrong.I bought two of these units and one of them was faulty and refused to record. So I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with Sony to resolve the problem.  Sony told me that this is a common problem with the VCRs that come with their units.  They sent a replacement VCR. But after about two weeks of use, one of the units was dead and the replacement VDR failed. I had to return the dead VDR, pay shipping fees and wait a couple more weeks for a replacement unit to arrive.This is the third VCR that I've had to replace since I started recording videos in 1999. I've bought other brands and this is the worst. I'm sorry Sony, but I am NOT buying any more products from you. I recommend sticking to your original equipment

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am writing this negative review for the PDP-8100.  It works great until it doesn't.  The video out is only for about 20 seconds.  I put up with it because it was the only one on the market that worked and I needed one for the office.  But I'm writing this review because of the customer support issue they are having.  Their response time for me to return the unit was 1 week.  Now I have to call again to get a new one.  So, now I am looking for a better product.  For the money you can't buy better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got the "Bose" speaker system and I was very excited when I received the speaker.  When I installed the sound system it didn't sound very good at all.  My wife was very happy that the system sounded nice and it looks nice but the sound was awful.  After contacting Bose I was told they do not provide warranty on speaker systems.  I don't know if that means Bose does not warranty the sound quality or if they simply don't care enough to provide it.  Either way the system is not worth the cost and I returned it to Bose.  If you are looking for a good speaker system look elsewhere

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After a year of use I decided it was time to take the Sony Apt-i to the junkyard and return it for a replacement.  There were several reasons I did not buy a new TV.  I'm not a tech and was not comfortable with the fact that there are no instructions on the box for replacing the remote.  Also I was not pleased with the remote not being able to be adjusted for my TV's position in the living room.  So I called Sony and told them about the problems with my remote and they said that I could return it and get a new one that would have all the same features, no more problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered two of these monitors and received one that wasn't properly packaged and one that had all the black covering taken off.   The package that I sent had a sticker that said that it was "for a Dell XPS 13".  So it wasn't defective but it wasn''t exactly the one I ordered either.  So I went ahead and ordered two different monitors and both are missing the black covering.  I also ordered these because I have a larger desktop and need more space than what this monitor allows for.  The monitors are also way too bright.  No way to adjust the brightness.  It's set to the maximum for each monitor.  Just a waste of money for this Dell

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am still using this product.  I ordered the same exact model number as I had previously used with the HP DL580c.  However, when I received it, it had different serial number.  The serial number was: HP-A-5944.  It should have been: HPA-5844. So, I returned it and ordered the DL580j.  When I received the DL58j, it worked fine on my home computer, but not on my NAS.  So, my question is, why did I buy this when HP already made one?  I would never buy this product again

So I am now left with a brand new printer that does not have the ink cartridge I paid $20 for. I don't know how you can ship something that isn't delivered.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The receiver works fine on the Yamaha XM10, XM100 and XM50 radio (all Yamaha units). When using any other radio, the receiver will not transmit any signals.I received two different units, one of which worked properly and the other one did not. If you buy this product, you'll have to spend more money and wait a longer time for the return process.Don't get me wrong, I bought it from Amazon because it looked better than any of the others out there. The shipping was fast, and the item was in stock.  However, I was expecting the receiver to work when I plugged it in. The receiver simply stopped transmitting after about two seconds.  The instructions clearly state that you must hold down the "R" key for 5 seconds or the receiver is supposed to start transmitting.  I held the "r" key down for more than 10 seconds and the receiver would not transmit.  Amazon and Yamaha both blame the receiver for not working.  No wonder Amazon is out of stock of the unit, but they won't return my defective one

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this thinking that the warranty would cover it. Instead they sent me a replacement with a damaged serial number. So, I returned it and they sent a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was supposed to be a wireless product.  However, after a short time it would not connect to my home network.  I returned it for a return.  It now hangs in the air like a piece of rope.  If you are buying these products to connect to the phone system, you will probably be happy with them 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had no problems in the first place with my Dell Inspiron 15R, but the Dell 2445 worked fine only a few months ago.  I have to return it, I am not happy with this product, I guess Dell is stuck to a bad decision.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wanted to play music from my iPod from my CD player.    Unfortunately, this product only fits one CD.  I returned the CD player and bought the adapter to play the CD that came with my iPod.  This adapter is unusable, because it doesn't fit one CD at a time.  For those of you that own a Pioneer CD player, I apologize.  If you have a Pioneer you don't need this adapter.  You need to buy an external recorder which fits the Pioneer CD slot and works as a CD player to record your music.  It took several calls and emailing to Pioneer customer service to get them to send me a replacement 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these adapters and thought they were great. I installed them and they didn't fit my Lexmark CDMA radios.I sent them back, but Lexmark is still making CDMA adapters. The Lexmark adapter is not made by Epson. I'll be returning mine 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product itself is OK. I bought this to do an internal network. I was never happy with the quality of the adapters I received. I returned the bad ones for this one. Then I discovered, when I rebooted the device, the WAN network adapter was disabled. I called Amazon and they sent me a new WAN adapter, and no where on the box does it tell you to unplug the LAN adapter to deactivate it. I've sent them a picture of the problem (left side).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones are terrible. I got them as a Christmas gift for my daughter but had to return them after only 3 weeks. The earpieces would not stay on when worn over my prescription glasses and they would not fit over my glasses if they were less than half a millimeter away. They also didn't come with instructions and a little instruction manual was included with the shipment. I returned them and purchased some off Amazon.com 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this antenna and it works fine for my AM stations. But the TV's in my bedroom are receiving the weaker signal from my neighbors and this antenna is not helping at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am absolutely not impressed with this product.  I returned it for the return of my old Apple Keyboard - no biggie - but it takes several minutes longer to print anything on the Web when I first open up the unit.  The only saving grace is that you get two of these (one for your PC and one for your Mac) but I'd prefer just a simple keyboard.  So if you don't need your word processor, spreadsheet or word processor/spreadsheet converter immediately in the next hour or so, by all means buy a $10 Dell PC to do it the easy way

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the second Dell laptop I have returned.  I had to return this one because the battery wouldn't fit.   I paid $500 for this Dell laptop and the price for batteries was about $50.  That's $50 per battery.  So Dell should be able to figure this out.  It wouldn't charge my computer.  Instead of giving me a refund I had Dell replace it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the 5.8" version of this TV and it turned out to be a 5.1.1 TV with a 4:3 aspect ratio. I called customer service for a replacement TV and I was told to come back in 3 weeks to get a new TV. I returned it again and got a new HDTV. Then I discovered that the TV only had 50 cd player inputs. I tried to use the TV with other players, but it did not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The CD player works fine for about a week then breaks. I returned it and got a replacement but that one broke too. I should have known better. They should have at least put an image of the card with it on their website 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my old Soundblaster Zodiac CD changer.  It is NOT the same as the Soundblasters.  The buttons and the buttons that are supposed to "scan" the CD or DVD and "show" the player in the center.  These two buttons are on the top of the unit not in the buttons.  This unit also has two tiny buttons on the rear of the CD changesthat only work if you put the CD into the player.  You have to push the buttons very quickly and then hold down the button for a second to "activate" the buttons 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this unit for two weeks.  I am in the market for a new CD player.  The sound is terrible and the unit has only one player. Not a good investment. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these on Nov. 6, 2007.  I have owned several brand new printers over the years, but none were as disappointing as these.  The ink cartridge leaked out of the box and a replacement cartridge was sent within a few days.  However, even after that, I had to call and have them send a new cartridge as the ink wouldn't flow through them.  Fortunately, it only lasted six months or so and the printer still wouldn't print properly.  It also had trouble keeping my negatives in the dark, even with the power off.  In short, these cartridges are useless and you'll be stuck with used ones.  So just go with a well-known name like HP. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was surprised to find that the iPod was no longer connected to the computer, because the connector it comes with has to be removed, and that takes a bit of time. I called the supplier, and they said they would mail me a new one (not the connector). Well, not only is it not a replacement, but it doesn't come with a replacement cable! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   these have not held up over the last year and a half and they are starting to get dirty.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this product to use on my Dell PowerEdge R710 server and ended up losing it in the mail.  No credit card is included with the order and I still have not received my order.  I have ordered from several other sites but HP has the only return policy with no good way to notify them or find them on the website.  Don't waste your money with this one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took longer than I thought to get this thing working.  There is no way you will make any use of a cassette deck that takes more than 2 minutes to turn on.  Even if you do, the cassette player doesn't record.  I'm going to return this item, because I can't be bothered to find a new product for my machine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   First time buying from HD, they sent me a broken box. After 3 weeks of trying, I still have not received it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this TV because of the 4k video.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am extremely disappointed with this TV. It only has the 4k picture and sounds, and it is very expensive. I was told to buy a 4k converter (not available), so I did and had to return it because of bad picture and sound.I am not going to return this TV because I know this is the way Sony is going to produce the 4K pictures and sound in the future.However I am very disappointed that I was sold a bad TV. I thought the picture was so great that I would buy another Sony.I would suggest you avoid this TV unless you really want 4k pictures and sounds only.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace my old RCA line output cards.  They came with one blank stereo card and four blank cassettes.  I immediately returned them, thinking they would work.   The blank cassette deck actually worked poorly, and I returned the stereo, thinking I could use it for another purpose.  Well, I just returned it again, and still cannot get it to play a single audio file from my computer.  The only reason I gave these five stars is because I got them at a great price.  It's not worth wasting my money on these cards unless you have an iPod, which I do not.  So far, the only way I have found to work with the new blank cassette decks is to rip the files off a CD player and burn them to the blank cards.That's it.  If you really want to play MP3 files with this card, just make sure that you're not in a loud environment or using it in a high volume setting.  Buyers beware.  Also, some people have reported problems getting the blank cassette cards to work, apparently with different brands of cards.I would avoid these unless you want to spend $10 each on blank cassette tapes, $30 on one blank cassette and $50 for two blank cards
