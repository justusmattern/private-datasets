Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the card in October 2003, as I tried to get it into the wireless system (which would not work), and the CD was broken.  The customer service agent that I spoke with on the phone was also very slow, and did not understand why the CD had a different track list than the wireless card (which I had already tried to activate and it worked without a problem).  I tried several more times, and the card worked without any problems, but the customer service support person that I talked with again was very unhelpful.  I finally got frustrated enough to ask her if I needed to return the card to Amazon, and she had to tell me that it was not being sold any more.   When I asked why, she stated that there was a software update out, and it had fixed the problem.  That is true, but Amazon did not have the CD changer that I had requested and still had the CD in the store.  Amazon told me that the CD-ROM had also been "broken" after it worked out of the box.  It has been replaced with a new CD-R.  However, I have not been able to figure out why Amazon doesn't sell the CD player.  While I had been trying to get the wireless unit to work for a while, the customer support agents were still answering the phones, and they continued to say that they were not aware of any fixes for the CD or card, even though they had just fixed the broken CD.  In addition, Amazon told them that they have new drivers and that the wireless software was just now released.  This is a problem for me, because I bought the wireless version of the CD and the wireless CD-Rom, which do not have CD changers for the CDs (which was a huge disappointment).  It's the CD, the CD card, and just the wireless cards.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons have a weird feel to them and the button itself looks like it was used on other phones.  When you press the buttons, the phone will vibrate and respond but don't expect to use them as often as normal buttons.  It took me a long time to figure it out, but I can use it in a single button press, and that is it.  This feature works only in certain modes and it won't work with the GPS.  My wife's phone did not work in the GPS mode and was unable to work with my husband's.  We had trouble with it in the radio mode, which meant we had to use a different button.  I tried pressing it multiple times on the radio but it didn't work.   If you don't know how to use it, don't bother.  The antenna is nice and sturdy and the battery will last for about a week, but it doesn't charge very fast.  Don't buy it unless you want to use the feature.  As soon as the GPS functionality was disabled and I updated the GPS app, my wife's GPS was unusable.  After downloading new software to my phone, it worked without problems, but a lot of other people have reported having problems, so don't buy unless you know how it works. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was so weak I could only get it working for a very short time in that version, and I couldn't get it to register at all.  This is a very unreliable device, and the customer service representatives I talked to are completely clueless, and would not be able to assist me with this product, or any other product out of warranty.  I don't have any money left on my credit card and have to go to the bank to get some cash.  My husband and I are still looking for a cheaper model for our next Christmas.  For now we will stay with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery had a bad screen (there are two screen, one that is the back, one for the front). I am unable to set the screen to any position, and my phone still works as it was originally configured. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen on this unit is bright, but does not support audio when used with the CD.  I had trouble finding the CD, but it is not in the back of the box, nor is the CD itself.  The DVD has a different disc from the CD or DVD, and there is no DVD menu button.  For some reason, this system does not run any of the movies available with the DVD on the market.  It also does not allow for DVD-CDR copies of movies purchased on the internet.  This is the only major flaw I could find on the unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing started to work the other day when I used it as a timer, but then it refused to be reset.  I had to reset it on each of my home devices and each of the computers to get the timer running.  That's when I noticed that it did not reset correctly on a Windows 10 machine.  The timer was working correctly, so I reset it and found it now working correctly on other PCs

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is designed with two wires, but only one wire is needed for use with my mobile phone.  The other wire, if needed, is required to charge my mobile device.  This is not a battery that I am willing to use without the user's mobile device charger.  I have used the batteries with my phone and a laptop and the battery works, but they fail to hold charge at all for the user.  After I tried them, I also tried the phones and the laptops with the power supplies, and both failed to hold any charge.  All of these batteries are of low capacity.    The battery on my mobile phones did not hold a charge for the users.  When I tried to charge the battery, the user would have to charge with a PC or Mac.  Since I have this battery installed on my laptop, I will be unable to connect to my PC with my cellphone without a USB cable.  So, I installed the power supply and tried to connect my laptop with the laptop's battery and the connection failed.  But my mobile devices are still able to charge. I installed it on my phone but I will keep trying until I get it to work on my smartphone.  If I get a successful connection, I can use this battery in my phone's handset charger and my laptop battery works on the smartphone.The battery uses up the battery at the end and then turns the battery on again, but now it charges a battery on the user (this is how the battery is used), so you get two batteries for a user, not one per user.This device's batteries do not work with my battery-backpack.  A number of the drivers for my computer require a driver for the laptop that I had to download, which I did.  However, I am having problems downloading the drivers from the computer, which means the battery will not function unless you are operating the machine as a user.If you are using this battery for a mobile device, it may work with a user's laptop or mobile phone, but not the mobile phone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was having some trouble with the audio, and it was not as loud as advertised. This model did not have the radio antenna.  The unit has its own antenna.It had a little battery, but did not last for all the day.  Also, the model is not supported by all the websites for the Internet Explorer 6 (my computer is IE8) or the Google/Yahoo apps.  These sites were not available on the machine during my purchase.  I tried this model on one other computer (I was able to download an application that supported the web browser, but the installation and configuration were not easy). The unit was not able to be used on other computers.  A note about the unit's firmware version was not available.  It is only supported by IE6/IE8 in the webbrowser.  As an alternative, I had a Windows XP/2000 license, but that is not available to me, even though I am a frequent customer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After getting it for about a year and running into other problems.  I have a very limited network, so it worked for my wife, my son and I, but for others, I had to have the router in my house.  On my end, it would not find my house wifi network, or my home wifi network.  In the end, we have not been able to use it since it was installed.  The router could not find the networks I had set up.  This could have been a problem even before my wife and son.  My daughter tried using a different IP address from the router.  It seemed to work for her in the beginning, but in my case, the router is very slow to find the home network.My daughter had her IP address set on her phone, which did find the network.She has found a home wifi using that IP address, which works.  As long as she has a working phone.  When she got her phone with the router installed, she is on the phone with me all the time.  She is now the only person using the router without my permission.  So far she does not know how to get around my router, and it won't locate the home networks she has set up since she has her phone on the router, so I have not tried this again.The router is designed for users of the 3G network, which I have found is good for my home.  However, it does work on other networks.  Some people with the 3-G network have had the same problem as my wife.  Apparently, I cannot access their home networks.As it is now, I have to make several phone calls and log in to the network and troubleshoot the connection, or I get frustrated with my poor experience.  And now I have the 3 devices, I do not know what the plan is for my phone.My wife and I both have the wireless access that we do have set up in my home, but the connection is not as good as it should be.  Since we are still testing these routers, I will update this post and see if it has gotten better since I got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone stopped functioning after the first month of operation.  I ended up having to contact a dealer who informed me they had been selling the phone for a while.  The phone is not compatible with the new system.  So far, I've not been able to get this phone to function under the new operating system, despite using the same software on both devices.  It's also not compatible under any operating system other than the one it is currently installed on.  This is a problem with the phone when the new OS is installed.  Even though I have used it under the old OS, the handset was able to recognize a password and access system updates under the operating system it was installed on under the first OS.  However, the password is reset each time you reboot the phone.  Once the phone is fully functional under the existing system, I would recommend upgrading the OS to version 2.0 or newer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this one from a local store and purchased the two other phones.  I have had to use the two that I got from the store and have used them just fine.  The three I have purchased have worked just fine from the beginning.  But, this phone doesn't work with my old or new cards.  It would work with a new card, but the "new card" function in the old cards does not work.  You have to re-enter the settings.  And the phone can't be used to record any videos because of the "New Card" function.  This device worked fine when I had the old card, and is the one I had with me, but not with my new cards, or with my phone or  my new or old cards 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If this device would've been available from the first day of launch, it would've required a costly upgrade for the software that has been updated frequently and, to my knowledge, is not currently compatible with the Windows Phone Store.  I have an update of the phone in the Windows Store, but its not the version I have for use with Windows Phone 8, which is now, in turn, not compatible with Windows 8.1, either.  It has been running on the PC for awhile, and Windows 8 and the OS that came with the phone, which the upgrade does support, is still supported for some reason.  On the phone OS, there's a separate phone account from Windows 8, so that account is also supported for use on Windows 8/8.1.  The store is very limited and, in my experience, has some fairly basic functions.  But, for basic features, Windows Phone 6, 7, and 8 seem to work better than the OS.  All of these phones are supported on the Windows 8 upgrade, and most of the time, I use the Windows store for basic functionality and navigation.  Sometimes I'd like to use it to do something more interesting than the basic OS.The app is extremely simple and, with the exception of a couple of key OS features (which require a manual, of course), works well.  (I purchased the upgrade on my laptop, which also has the upgrade pre-installed.)The phone has no internet capabilities--only the limited store functionality, as well as the phone service.  However, the phone does support the Windows 10 S upgrade for free, which I've been able to activate, but only after purchasing the phone.  That's just another small inconvenience, and the fact that I have to re-install the OS (in order to get the free upgrade) to get it to work with Windows 10 in the first place is another drawback.My experience with the app and the phone has been good--it's great, and I like it, but it's very bare-bones, and while the UI and apps are designed well enough, there are quite a few bugs in the phone--mainly, with features like the voice recorder and the call forwarding feature.  There are also frequent crashes on my Windows PC, resulting in a lot of lost data in a day.  You can, ofcourse, manually download the full install from the Store, so these things can be patched fairly easily

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this card, it is not a full load, and it says that it's compatible with Windows XP.  I have never been able to get it to work with XP, but the card does work on XP if you set the user name and password to different passwords.  A user name of "nogames" will disable XP's encryption and allow you to log in to XP.When you set up a Windows XP system, the card says it's required, but when I have tried it on XP, I get a warning that this product does not meet the standards for operating with Windows.  This device works with XP if set as a new user name but does not work as a "user name" on XP.This problem has been discussed with Microsoft many times, and they have said that it is a known defect.  The problem is not with the product itself, but with its use of Windows XP as a starting point, because when you set a new "user" on a Windows 2000 system, XP would run fine in the default configuration (I have only ever tried to set this up as a user name).Microsoft has advised that the new XP system cannot be installed on XP systems without a new Windows installation.  In fact, I am told by Microsoft that it won't work as an "user."I tried both the user and system passwords several times and still get the "User password does not exist

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very slow. The phone will run out of battery in less than a month or two. This is unacceptable for the amount of money you were looking for. The other reviews suggest this phone is actually better than the one you bought.The device does not have an indicator for the battery level. This indicates the battery is low.  I tried multiple times to set this device up without turning it on to see what it would do.  It would not respond to the phone number on the charger, nor would it respond to settings or menu.  You can see the number by pressing "9".  This phone has the capacity to be set up for a new battery

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered 2 different sizes. The plastic pieces were too stiff and the screen would not stay level unless you were standing or seated. I purchased the larger screen at home. I still had to check the screen frequently and make sure it stayed level. I had to buy a new battery when the original battery was dead. I used it and it worked and it would work on other systems when I bought the larger system. The second battery lasted 2 days, the first lasted 3. The battery was not a good design. It did not fit in the console when it was in the cabinet. It would require a lot of force to get into the cabinet, the console was just too small for the battery to fit. I returned it to Amazon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these 2 boxes for my wife and I.  I have been trying for weeks to find a suitable package for our 3 month old.  My wife's box came with the cd booklet that came with your book.  The booklet is great for the 3 months old. The bookcase is great but my wife was not a fan.  It is too small for our son.  As far as I know there is no way to add your new booklet or cd into the box, there's no easy way to transfer any files into the booklet.  So your 3 month kid could get a cd booklet.The cd booklet is also not designed to hold all your books, so the cd would not play on the new cd box and the cd box will only work with the old cd booklet and CD booklet.It's a very frustrating thing and I will buy one or two other items in the future to hold the CD booklet

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone in October '07.  My friends and I were both using this phone (not as a substitute) when we had a few problems with it.  The buttons were always the same on both ends, and I could never turn it on.  In fact, there is not a button for turning it on when the phone is in my pocket.  I had to change the battery every now and again in the car or out of the pocket. This phone uses a different battery every time it is connected to a new network, which can take 10 minutes or more to complete a transaction.  This phone is a real disappointment.  It is hard to turn on the radio, find the menu, or the home screen.  You'll have a hard time finding the menu and you won't even see the menu.  If you look at the screen or the screen, you will see the battery icon, but there is no option to charge the battery or change the network.  Your phone does not allow you to change it to a network using another battery without a network change and you can't find a different network using the battery.  When the phone was turned off, the screen could go blank or the battery would not charge.  So, if you don't use your phone for a long period of time, the phone will not have a charge.If this phone is on a network with high power levels and you plug into an emergency button, it will fail to work and will have to be reset to get to a service level that works with it, and the battery can die.  Most of the times I had the battery on, the radio works, but it does not work with my other radios.  (the radio I had last summer worked well until the battery ran out.)  I have not been able to find a way to charge this phone on a home network.It did work a few months ago, but I do not know how this works and I don't want to do this again.   The battery was not replaced during the course of my last two home network changes.  For now, I have to buy another battery.My experience with this phone was that the battery will give out, and not replace itself.  One battery replaced for me failed to work for a month.  There are no easy ways to get it replaced.  After the battery failure, I just kept using the phone as I usually did when I couldn

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The thing does not work.  We get the same "error" messages as the original device, so we are now stuck with it until it fails.  This is the same problem we had with the first model.  Please don't buy this model.It has been tested for about 2 months and fails the checkouts and user manual is a complete pile of paper with a bunch of errors.  A quick search on the Web for a replacement unit that works as advertised will produce a page of different errors and it will not work at all.  Don't waste your money or buy this product, it doesn't work as advertised.  The software is also buggy and cannot access the data unless you are logged into the web site, which requires you to know the password for the router.  So for anyone that does want to use this router, you will have to log into your router every time you use it.  If you plan to have a router of any kind connected to a wireless network on your home network, you need a firewall (for the user to use) because it's designed to use the WPA2 protocol which has a flaw that makes it possible to share passwords.I tried to install a new firmware using my CD burner, but after it got the login password, it refused to connect to the web sites on my network.  There are no other firmware options available.  I am returning the router, router, and CD burner to Amazon so that I can receive a replacement.    Please note that I received a note on Amazon's end that the router cannot be updated unless you have a CD burner that has the new firmware.  Amazon has also made this router available in Canada and I am looking into shipping the router to me.  My plan is to re-install the new version of the router but to have it fail the checkout.  But if you do want to buy a new version, please keep this in mind.  Do not purchase a router that requires you know the WEP password 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product was useless and did not work with any browser, even with an upgrade to version 6.  This was a huge disappointment for the price, considering this is a feature with which most users will likely buy their first browser, which is the only option available.  I did not like the ease of the setup, and the design is very poorly suited for the browser, so much so that I could not use it for any reason other than switching the browser.  While the interface will be updated to make it more convenient for web browsing, I have no idea what it will look like when this issue is resolved.  In addition, a problem with the device did occur at the very end of its life cycle.  At the time of purchase, I had the unit installed and connected to my personal web server, but this had some significant drawbacks:  As a result of a bug, the firmware was being updated.  The latest version could not be successfully installed without a factory reset.  After this was done, the device would not boot up.  Rather than having a browser on this device, I found it to be completely unsupported for web-browsing

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this card as a freebie, after installing. My daughter was not impressed with it. It does not work with a Mac. The screen is a great deal, but the video does not come out of the box. It took the entire battery to get the Mac's video to work.  I tried, but it did not work, even with a small Mac, as expected. I got a new one, and it worked.  My daughter tried the Mac with the video, as I have done with the computer.  The Mac did not want to talk to MacOSX.  In fact, the only thing I have tried with the Mac so far (which worked, but did not come up with anything) was the Windows 2000 version.    My Mac would not even turn on with the other battery, but after installing my OS, it worked the next time I tried it.  So, what is wrong with this card?  I purchased this from a kiosk in one of my stores.  Now the Mac OS does not show the card.  It only has the ability to find the card when installed.  How do I get a refund?  The only reason it worked on a Mac is because it works with Mac OSX. I will try this Mac next, and see if I can get it to work with the PC.  If it can, that is a bonus.  On MacOS, MacOS X runs the card fine, so if I get it on the Mac, I will be happy with the card if I use it. I bought my daughter a new Mac, and she works it fine, but we will just have to see if she will like it enough to stay with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought one of the old ones, and it works great. But the screen is very small, and the menu design is primitive. The icons on the menu screen are the same old icons you'd see in any old Windows 95 application. This will probably work fine for a while.  But the menus are so limited and the software is so new it's hard to tell. In fact, I had to download all the software from the web, as it doesn't even have a built in web server or server administration utilities. The user interface is so primitive that there's nothing on the screen except for one "user" menu, where all your programs are grouped together. This isn't much better than any old software. You can open the programs individually in each folder. The new version, 1.5, apparently has a web server as well. But I bought the 1.4, the new version.  I'm not sure what version of the operating system you'll need.  The menus in the new program are even better.  This is a wonderful feature, but not so much as a feature.  It simply lets you open a web browser from the menu, and search for anything that you want, in any of the apps. You also get a "user menu", where you can launch a new window for your program. This new version seems to be much better. Unfortunately, Windows 95 doesn't have a way to let you copy the program to another device.  If you want to switch between the programs and windows, you have to open each program in turn. It just isn't intuitive.I'd recommend the old version, which runs on a single device, is what the user menu gives you, but if you want access to the user interface on other computers, you're stuck with the new, single-user program menu.  You can't get to the same folder or to edit any program.  Some software doesn't work with the "user interface" at all, but it will work with all the other programs.The "user  interface" on the new one seems much better--I got it working for my program and was able to copy programs to other computers.  However, if you open the "server" menu (or "user") and try to edit anything, you get the error "There is no server." So you have the same problem as the original software:  I tried to run it on two computers and couldn't get

I am waiting to hear from the manufacturer as well

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works great when connected to my PC but it doesn't have the memory it should have.  It also has a very low screen quality and can't print the paper I need.  This is another device that the manual says is "outdated".  My PC and printer were both shipped without the paper, which has a "free" version of the paper

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The video is very slow and if you want to be able to see the back of your TV you will need to be seated.I bought my TV without the back-lighting in the front and used it for watching and reading.  It worked for about two months, but the battery ran down to about 30% at the beginning of this year and I finally returned it to Amazon.   I received a new model that worked until about February.  I am returning it, for sale, if anyone has one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the wrong product and had to buy another to keep it.  It is difficult to find the software to work on the newer machines and this is a nightmare.  The instructions say to uninstall it and reinstall it on an earlier version.  I have had to do this countless times and it does not work anymore.  There is a workaround but I never made it to test it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the phone, but after that I had to delete everything on my iPhone (or delete everything from the iTunes).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to admit I was a little disappointed in the battery. I was expecting the same performance as the original model. I have used it once and found the battery to be much more fragile.  I can't use the included power adapter and the battery seems to have been defective even on that unit.  The battery is so light and flimsy that it will probably explode in the next 30 days and leave the unit behind.  At first I thought this was a design flaw but then I looked up the serial number and it is listed as a "factory refurbished."  I had to buy a new battery that worked great in my unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have bought and lost 5 of these units.  There is no way to set up the printer and set up its software without it being a different color and sometimes not in English.  I purchased this printer so that I could print at home so that my wife and I could have time together to have lunch or just to get the work done together.  But when we tried to print with the printer, it would not print the pages at all and the only way to print was to either use a different software or not to use any printer at all.  The printer would not "load" with the page, so it would have to be changed from English to another language and then reloaded.  When I called in to get assistance, I was asked to go through a setup instruction sheet.  We tried this first but it made the problem worse.  Finally I did not use the system for the next six months.  Eventually I purchased it to print out the documents that I wanted to print.  Once it was in a printer, I purchased a paper that would fit and printed several documents.  Then the problem returned again.  It would not read and print the documents the same.  As I tried to correct the problem, it did not work.  And this printer will not work with documents that you print on the web, as I found out.  On the web this printer cannot print properly with documents I tried printing.  So if you want to print the document with a different browser or web browser, you will get a page not found error.  This machine will only print when printing from English, and I do not know what is wrong with this problem, but it does work in other languages with some printers.  Some of the problems with the machine are very difficult to diagnose.  My advice is to get a replacement and get a new one so that you can continue to print documents.I have tried to return the unit but have been told that it is no longer sold by Sony.  Sony does not want us to send it back and will not accept a return, and Sony has told us that it does not have a problem with the computer, so we have sent it to Amazon.  Amazon does not carry the printer for use by Amazon.com 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We had purchased these discs in August of 1999, and they do not work anymore (this is a feature that was added to improve DVD compatibility, the disc does not play DVDs).  We purchased a replacement disc in December of 1999.  This new disc works but there are only 6 DVDs on it!  We still don't know if the discs are still in production, and I guess that's all we can tell you. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is WAY TOO BIG. I bought a second one and a third one, too.  My husband got them for his birthday and it gave him terrible problems.  The "poker chip" worked fine, but he got it for himself, and the problem was it wouldn't print the numbers that he wanted.  Now that he's printing all the numbers on paper, it doesn't print his phone number.  It works great for his address book, but for addresses, it does not work, and his cell phone numbers are incorrect for his bank account and credit card.  And, unfortunately, his wife's phone number on his card is also incorrect for her bank account.  You know, it's all sorts of problems with the cards, phone, or the printer.  Also, the problem with the software, which doesn't work on any computers I tried, is that I can't even get it to print the number for his own number, the one for his wife.  As I said, this is really just a joke, and not one for the product itself.  This is an extremely cheap product, not one to invest time on it... I tried to print his wife' number, and I couldn't get the machine to print it on a printer with the numbers printed on the paper, let alone print it with the same features that other people are getting.  I think this is a one-off item, but I wanted to share with you all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst device I have ever bought, I have seen a few pictures and the color is very different then in the picture. The picture has much better contrast then the original. The buttons are also much better. I have already done the change the battery.The screen is great but very hard to use. It is very hard for my wife to use, I will have to come back with the charger, it is not compatible with my ipod mini. The battery was purchased for my new  ipod and the new ipod is compatible with the old battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device will not even allow a single CD player to be mounted, and the CD player is so poorly designed that it is hard to move, even in the CD holder.  This product is the worst thing I've ever owned. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons and menu are a bit clunky, and it's really hard to find the menu you want to select, and the buttons can only do the one thing at a time.  It's very difficult to select the things you want, and selecting something with the wrong set of buttons on one side of the screen can cause a major malfunction.  I'd recommend using the controls with two fingers at a stretch, even for navigation.  The controls on the rear have two buttons on the front, which works quite well

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this is the same problem.  This machine is a little slow and doesn't save any information.  I spent the previous night working with another device that I did get used in addition to my desktop that saves your data.  You will need to work with both devices.  It's very basic and I was told that this is a common problem with Macs.  The only way I could get anything to save in the browser is by using the WebDAV file that has an.xml file.  Be aware that this will change the browser window to a black background.  Don't use this for the browser and you may have to open the Windows file each time you use it, or the Mac or WebDAVA or you will get the "Windows error 43" error message.  Also, this will not work on a server.  If you plan on using this to access a server, make sure you use the.xml and not the.HTML file.The most important point is that this device only works with your browser, and not on the server.The screen has a black screen and uses a high contrast screen.  On both of mine the screens do not work well at all and it's difficult to find icons or any useful information. If you're going to buy this I'd wait for an update to fix the problems.  Update on this device has been slow, it seems, and the latest version is available here: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking it would be a great addition to my kitchen but it is far too small.  It has a battery, but it doesn't have a clock.  I ordered the wrong battery with a different name.  The original battery was "used" a long time, and has burned out, but that was the "original" one.   That's what I have with me at all times 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   You don't need to do a manual for this and it is soooo slow to do the updates, as if they were all manually installed.I was soooo happy when I first purchased this, as the system would not recognize my card, and even when I attempted to purchase a new one the software was so slow. I tried it multiple times, and it still had not installed the updates.I installed my system last night with the card in my system and installed the update today. I do not have the card anymore, and my laptop and my mobile phone are still functioning normally.I have the old version, the updates have been updated, and the system is now ready to go. But the new one I have installed is a completely different system.The new updates have also not yet updated the user interface, which is a complete mess, and no way to access any settings.I am hoping this is the new system for the new firmware updates, and to use my card I had to change the settings to "automatic" and "disable". I will update as soon as I get around to using my card again.I will keep trying for the update. I was happy with my purchase, but this one has some features that I do NOT like. It is a great software, but I have to admit that it's far from a system that I use regularly. The user interface is a total nightmare. I have not used this system as much as my card was, and for me it is a serious downgrade. So I'm going to go through all the updates again. It's going to be a big pain in the rear, but if I keep at it I will get it working again. I just hope I have the firmware update that fixes the problem with my card.I did get the latest version of the card, but still have not installed it because the old one works fine, and I cannot get it to work with my old laptop. I am working on my laptop right now trying to get it done, but it is going to take a few minutes. I need to get the card updated now, and then I will install this card on my computer. I've been working on getting the card working, but its really difficult with all these features and the computer I am running it on. This card is a real deal, but a system on which it works does not work with the software on the old card. I hope this is solved soon. I like this
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone for my wife after I got her this phone, and had it immediately. I didn't want to change any settings, because the phone would just randomly go off and on. My wife complained, and after she complained, I installed a new battery for her and started using it. When the battery died (while my wife was using the phone with the battery, not with the phone), I just took it to Walgreens and bought it a second time. I don't think that it will die when I get it to her. The device will work fine with my wife's home office and can connect to my home computer, but the fact that it works with her home office with her own home directory means that my wife can now connect to her own desktop.  I can also make and receive calls on the same port as my own home computer.  The phone will work with my home directory, but it won't connect to any other port that I know of.  If your wife doesn't have a home directory and connects to your home, she will have to open her own port to receive phone calls.  In this case, I am using this device with her in the office.  So far, I have not tried to switch phones in her home. I can only assume that the user interface for her home directory does not work with the same features on the phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is junk, in its current configuration, the USB port is too small for the amount of devices I have purchased so far. The USB port could not support the devices that I received in the shipment. I was advised that the USB device that I ordered was faulty and could not be shipped.  I was able to purchase a copy of the product and tried installing it and found that it does not work with the system.  There are some other known problems with this device.  It is my understanding that the device cannot receive any software or updates other than the base operating system.The system is still under development.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this card in an email exchange.   If I opened it up on my Mac, I received a virus that would take the system offline.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received the unit in a single piece, without a software license or any kind of support, and did not notice any issues with it, except for the fact that it is currently running out of power in a battery-saver mode.  The only problem I have is that the wireless connection works, but requires a reboot to get up to speed.  This was a major inconvenience, and I had to manually set up the wireless interface (by unplugging and plugging the unit into the device), and then reboot, each time I went to use it, and it was not a great experience 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone at the airport.  I had trouble connecting with the network.  After a few failed attempts, I got around to the settings, and after resetting the network it would go into a boot loop.  My phone was not compatible with the firmware, and the device was slow.  The phone was still not able to get on the internet.  At this point I did have a free account with a different number.  It would not work.  In addition, the phone only worked for the airport network.I returned it to the airport, and I called customer support, and they told me to connect the device to the airplane.  When I tried to do so, the customer support person would not speak to me for two days, then hung up.  That's when I decided to call the number on the airport device and make sure it works.  However, the number for the customer service desk does not work in a landline or a mobile device.   This phone will not work with a land-line or mobile phone.  A landline telephone would also have an antenna attached, but only on the tower.  From what I understand, the tower had been out of service for some time.  Also, the system will only work on a cell phone on an airplane.A number of other phones from the same manufacturer worked fine.  Although I had purchased the same model, the firmware was different, and therefore was incompatible with the same firmware on my phone, so I had to reset it from scratch.  This is a hassle and it requires resetting your computer or router.  And then I needed to buy another new phone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Not that much better than the earlier version. The case is a good deal better, but the buttons have a tendency to bend and/or break. The whole device works with the CD only. However, when I first plugged it into the machine, I was told that I needed a "new CD to work". I was able to find a CD labeled as the "new" CD in the bin, but it did not work with the other discs. My CD burned out.  I went to the "install" screen and used the CD that I was given.  It worked.  However, after a few attempts, I could not find the CD player on the machine. After several attempts, the machine worked with a CD that had been saved by another person

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item to replace a bad battery in a faulty device that I already had.  I had to send it back and now my car works, but only after I have spent hours trying to fix the problem.  The software works well enough, but there is a serious flaw in the program itself which will render the software useless unless the user is a PowerMac PowerBook G4 user.  My PowerBook is a 10.5 MB disk, the program crashes immediately after launch, and all that is required to access it is a serial number and a license number.  There is no other documentation with this.  It seems that this program needs to be installed on a disk and only on disk, because otherwise you cannot access the software from the Mac or the disk itself.  Mac OS X and PowerBook applications crash immediately upon initial startup.  This issue is compounded by the fact that when I try to run it from a disk on my PowerBook, it crashes.  After about 20 crashes of this program, I have been able to get to the command line, but it crashes from my PowerMac's hard drive upon command.  As a result, this software will not function with PowerBooks which require that a serial or license number be present in order to function.  However, it works fine on Mac OS, PowerBook and PowerPC machines.  In addition, this program uses the serial number/license number of a disk, which requires that a disk be installed, which will require a hard disk which Mac OSX and PowerBooks do not have.  Also, this operating system requires a special software update, which was released in October of 2001.  If you choose to update the program from Mac OS or PowerBooks, it does so only after the software is installed from a new disk.  While the program uses a separate disk driver, the driver itself is still based on a Windows driver and can not be updated by the user without the original disk.The software crashes instantly with every attempt to run from my Mac and my PowerPC.  So, in addition to the PowerBook driver installation, I also had to update all of my software, including the operating system.  Since this software crashes upon initial launch, all of this requires the user to have a PowerBook with PowerBook OS 3 installed (which is not included with my Mac).  This driver has been in development for over a year, with no significant changes from previous versions. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In this review I have to say it is a huge waste of money.  It does what it is supposed to, and works for about half a dozen movies.  The worst part is the quality of the film it produced is not what is pictured in the credits.  This unit did the job, but the color quality is inferior and is not the same as the movie.  Overall this unit is not a quality product

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons are just buttons, they are not touch sensitive.  I have several buttons that do not work.  This is the only button that does work.It is not very responsive.  The other buttons are much more responsive.I have to press very hard on the buttons to get them to work.The buttons are touch sensitive and not very sensitive at all.  However, the button that is not touch sensative works well with my phone.  There are no problems with the buttons, the buttons themselves work well with the phone.The phone also has a very slow response time.  On several occasions, I could get the call on speaker phone mode.  In some instances, it actually took me longer to get to the line that was set up than to get into my home from my car.I'm afraid to use the phone from my vehicle, although, the phone does work in my home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item works for me and it's useless.  After 2 weeks of using, the battery died.  You can read other people's reviews about similar units:  A real pain in the neck and back.  The battery has a built in self-destruct mechanism.  So, this unit was destroyed.  Not the battery.  This unit has an LED back-up, which you can turn on if you are in the house.  I installed this battery and found it useful and durable.  It does run low after 3 months, but this is a serious drawback 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the cartridge and was very disappointed. I still have a good deal more of the program to go through my system.  This isn't what I was expecting from this set of games, I purchased this set because my wife loved it and wanted a new one.  She does play it and she does not like it.  But it is still in the box with the games so this set was bought purely to use with the computer.  I am buying another set for my daughter and I will give this set to her and my wife.  They are looking forward to the new set with the new games.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone does not work on the same network as other phones do, which is the reason that I can only use it while connected with a laptop. On my phone, I cannot connect to any other network besides my laptop at any time. If you plan to use your phone in a conference room, it won't work.  The only time I have actually been using my phone with the laptop was in my house.  I have never had a conference call, so far.  My laptop would connect to the phone with a software upgrade, but it requires two computers to be connected together.  This model does not allow me to have multiple computer connections at home with one set of handsets.  However, this model does work with my laptop and a CD, and it is compatible with my home printer.  You can have the laptop connected to another computer to check email, and the CD will allow the phone to call up any of my pictures, but that requires me to buy another CD and I cannot do it on my phone.  It requires my laptop to be on with the CD so I can check email from my laptop.  Then, if I do connect to my laptop I get a "network error" message.  If I try to print, I get the error message. If I use the web browser, it just doesn't work and returns to the main menu of my CD player, and then back to the CD menu.  Finally, when I go to my computer and try to access any site, I am just trying to get the network status.  When I connect to a site, my screen appears to freeze, and when I try and use the network to check for new updates, I just get a message about new software.  In all other ways, it works the same way as a regular phone. The menu on the phone is a bit limited in features, and I found the phones very slow.  After an hour of testing, the phones did work with the network I tested, which led me to believe that it works for other devices.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you're used to a manual with all the information that's on the CD, the CD will start playing in the car, but will stop playing in your car after the first 5 or 10 minutes.  This is usually when the CD is going to expire on a new CD, unless you buy a new copy of your copy of the book and the CD player can't find it.  (The CD player will let you start the CD with the last number of skips in the song.  The CD player does not start the next skips that you don't play on the cd.  A new CD is necessary, and you must restart the cd player after a new cd is started).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   One of these units is no good.  I've used the same serial number for everything, which means it will be a total pain to use in a commercial.  There's no ability to set a break timer or record.  The only thing it has is an LCD that shows the time.  As I tried using it in my house, I found it easy to switch to other screens and even switch to a different system.  One time I switched it to another PC, it started to get slow and then broke.  On my laptop, it doesn't work when you switch it from a PC to the TV.  It is no longer compatible with my network.  My TV has a built-in menu and the menu is completely different than what I'm used to.  At best, it just shows you a static image with a black screen.  For now, I will be using the one I had when I was driving.  And I will have to keep an eye on my car until it is working correctly

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst electronic device in existence. If it wasn't for the battery compartment, the front door would open on the same side, not opposite. The lock is a paper door, which will fail to work unless you put something in the inside lock hole, but you can't even turn on the lock, which requires you to manually open the lock with your key. And the door is very heavy, and you have to put your hand on the hinge to open and close the door.  The only thing in the lock compartment is a plastic sleeve, that has a big plastic tab and a small tab on the inside, and it will bend when you close it.  It's designed to keep the lock from coming off your lock, but that's a function that doesn't work very well.  If you want to keep your lock on your lock drawer, I think you have a hard time just doing that when you want a paper lock.  I've tried to unlock the lock by holding the tab in place while opening the lock drawer lid by pressing the tab, and that works only to open the door on the other side.  Also, the latch is also not very stable, and is very weak when you open the lid.   The hinge is really loose and the hinges do not lock smoothly with the lock. The plastic on the front is flexible, which can cause the door to open on its own.  When the door opens, the hinge will pull the door open by itself and close it on the hinges without you having to hit the button.  My door opened this way after just one attempt

If you find that it is not the driver for your OS, you need to download the driver (this is an easy process if you are not using the Windows XP version) before you can use the computer. I am also not sure what the OS is that came with my computer.The drivers have a "feature" that allows you to add a temporary driver to the system that is more compatible to this system and will allow you to use the driver that is listed on the registry. I tried that but the system didn't work with the original software.I have a Windows XP installation file on my hard drive and my system recognizes my Windows XP registry key but doesn't recognize my Windows 2000. This is not a bug with the OS. The system does recognize the registry key for Windows XP but the default driver for Windows 2000 does not recognize my registry key. It is a real problem for me that I couldn't connect the two.My system has a small battery and it will not recharge the battery with my USB cable. There is a nice battery with a manual on the system but I could not find it on the box.I had to try it out and there are two problems. One, the battery does not last long enough (I am trying to recharge a new battery) and two, it does not have a power indicator. I found this to be annoying.This battery is not included with the system. I was looking for the battery but it was not included.I would suggest you just try to use this laptop with an external battery or just use this machine without a battery 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am just doing my first two tests, and the color is off, in both the main menu and the back-up. I have also noticed the menus are not in the standard order. I think this was done so that users could get to the bottom, and then select the system they wanted.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only reason this unit would work is to activate your computer via USB.  So that it can work with a USB-to-audio cable, the cable needs to be hooked up via Audio Audio Audio Adapter Cable, and then you still have to set up a password to access your files.  It works, but the password is very weak and I've lost several of my files on accident, and it's extremely annoying.  I also have been using it for a while and it doesn't appear to work with any Windows version.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These buttons do not work with my camera, i found the button was supposed to have a blue LED light on, so it seems to me that this could be the case with any button on this unit, the only problem i have found with this is when pressing a button or the light, its on a very low level, it seems like it would not work.  I have done a search on Amazon for other units with blue LED lights.  This is a major disappointment, but the LED lights are on all the time,  and are on the same level as the LED light of the LCD.  It works okay, but in my experience it is quite bright

I was able to plug it into my computer and I'm currently trying to determine what the problem is with the charger.  It's a plug that is labeled with a red-line, but it functions fine.   My computer works with the phone battery but when I tried to plug in my laptop, the battery would not charge up.  The red-link cable was not labeled, but worked fine.The phone works fine on my computer but, when I attempted to charge it on the charger, the red-Link cable refused to work

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would like to see the original box.  Maybe this is for my son but I ordered it for him and it was delivered via first class mail, so the shipping charges are $6.85.  I think the box came with instructions and that was it.  Now the instructions are so poor it's very hard to follow them.  It's almost impossible to figure out how to open the lid.  As the box says, "use common sense"...however, I will post my review about this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After ordering, the box arrived, and I was hoping for something more durable than the cardboard sleeves.  I opened it and opened the game, and it works.  The manual is also a work in progress, but I found it to be good.  It's not fully complete yet, but it covers the basics.  You can play, but not in the box.  There are only a handful of ways to play (including the 'p' button), but the game also has a game-over screen for when you run out of time.  All in all, it works great.  My son is not really happy with it.  Still, I'll keep playing it until it works properly, because I like that it's a bit more difficult to cheat.  He's learning how to do it on the computer anyway.  And we have played the game a couple times.  We've won some, lost some.  Overall, though, we both liked it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We really like the sound quality, but it does have a problem with the radio if you turn it on and off. It would also work fine for streaming, but we didn't buy the digital version of the game because I would not have had access to the menu, the radio or the game. I do have access to several of the digital disks, and the menu is easy to navigate. If you select the radio, the menu pops up. The radio menu is not functional with a computer with a USB keyboard. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The hardware worked fine the first few weeks, but the battery started giving out last month.  I purchased a new battery.  The new battery has stopped working as well.  It also doesn't hold the battery in its packaging.  You have to remove the battery and insert it into a different port to use the battery.This battery is great for the computer, but not for any other type of equipment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I do not recommend this product for children. The sound quality is very good and the sound quality fluctuates depending on the device used.  I purchased the first version and was pleased with the sound on my iPod.  It seems to be very sensitive to the sound settings (I have been using it to listen to some of the tunes on my computer while playing games).  But this particular iPod does not appear to be capable of using the full functionality of the iPod touch, which is a pity, because I do have many songs that I use with it, that are not compatible with the touch screen.  (A good list of compatible songs is available here: http://www.movpodtouch.com/).  It is possible that this may be an issue for other users with an iPod touch that has been purchased separately.  This problem has not arisen since I bought the product.  The iPod touch is good for casual use but does not have the ability to access the iTunes library for the songs I play.  So far, I have yet to try the iTunes for the iPod.I have not used the iPod for more than about 30 songs on my main system

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked but I had a horrible time with it. It worked, but it didn't work well and sometimes it hung up.  A friend helped me with it and helped me figure it out.  Once it worked well, but the problem is that it's a little harder to get to the back of the device than the front.  That was a huge problem.  It's like trying to figure out which button to push.  I was always fiddling with the button, trying different things, and the button was not easy to locate and use.  On some screens you can't see the "button".  This thing hung on my monitor, and you press it and it works.  This problem made me miss my daughter's first birthday party.  We had to reset it at the store and it worked, and it was ok until the weekend, and then I lost it.  If it was working properly on my laptop, I used that to watch the movie.  Unfortunately, I have a lot of movies and this was my first one, and there is no way for me to reset my system 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have bought this product twice and each time I had to download a complete re-installation. I had this issue on my first computer and again on my second (see above).  I had never purchased this item before, I was using it the first time.  The installation process was the same as the last.  I was then able to open any document, e-mail, or web page.  It will save the document in a different location than it previously saved.  After I saved the document, I opened the document from the document browser to any document I previously saved, but the documents opened with a different user name.  This feature is fine for new documents.  When you attempt to open a new document or a new version of the same document, you will need to re-set the user name of the document.  My system had no support for saving the user's name and the document would not save the user, the document itself would not change.  So, for a new user, you must set the document as user name 1 and then save the new document using this user name and save the documents again, this is the new user.  Each time you attempt a save, the user is changed and your documents cannot be saved.I cannot get the user settings menu to work and I am having trouble saving the document or opening the document with documents. If you use this device on the user page it will not work.  Please see the product description for details.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device worked well for a while, but after about a year and a half of use, it became incompatible with the wireless network that was being used at that time (no longer compatible with most other networks).

I would buy it again in a year or so. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I can't believe this thing works, I could not get anything on the net. The net was set to run on a standard dialer dialing system.  The dialer doesn't actually work and when I tried to dial a number it did not answer.  I tried the phones the next day and again and again until finally I had a working number.  But there is only one dial in the system. I've set up one for each house and I do have an old telephone on my desk, however it works great.  It does not pick up a line for me and there are no numbers on it.  In addition to that I've tried the old dialers and the phones and both did not work.  So there is no dialing capability in the new dialer system.I've got an old one at home and it works, but I would prefer a newer one.  And yes, there are dialing buttons on the front panel.  Unfortunately they are only for the upper right side, but it works.  Also, the dialer does not work on my computer either.  Now I've got a bunch of problems and I need to try these things out and see what works for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My first impression was "you're just a couple of buttons for the most part". I'd prefer more buttons. If you want, you can use these to activate the volume buttons when you are on a call. You can't use the phone for anything else. It just doesn't work with voice-over-IP or any other phone service, so you can't transfer files from your PC or Mac to your phone. It will work if you have a Mac and Windows Vista on your PC (or you could just make a "backup" of a copy of a previous version of Vista or Vista. If Vista crashes or crashes, it just won't work).If it works on the Mac, however, it's just a mess, it has a battery that will last a very long time, so use this with a battery-free phone when you're using it.The problem is that the phone won't allow me to make a call to my mother, my daughter, or any of my other friends who have the same phone. My girlfriend is stuck with a "normal" phone. She hasn't gotten one working yet, nor is she getting a phone replacement. It's so frustrating - not a lot of good options 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The phone itself was okay, but the battery had a low charge.  The system would not charge.

Apparently, the product was defective and my warranty would not cover the battery itself, not the battery charger. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got it as a gift in December and it was delivered to my family Christmas Eve.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm going back tomorrow.  This device has the same sound as the one we had when I purchased it in 1997.  I think the "back" buttons have the most "power".  It would make a great addition to my office or on my desktop.  The "back' and "forward" buttons were designed for touch devices, and the one for the back button is a lot better than the one I had.  However, touch devices require the user to "paint" the controls on the back panel or else the device works with all the buttons.  For this device, there is an option for a "non-touch" button.  You'll find the non-touch button next to the "volume" control.  (If you touch this button, you will hear "click" noises as the button is depressed.)  This button is useful for entering text or other data and turning pages or moving through pages.  If you have a mouse, you can use this button to access the device settings.  On my Mac (which has the OS 9.0.1 driver) I had no problems with my printer.    It works.  Unfortunately, this option is disabled.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The video worked perfectly, but there were problems. I tried to play several movies.  It was not a success.  The playback was choppy.

A lot of the features are on the back of this one, and there is a problem with the software.  All of the different screens have different resolution capabilities.  One will display the movies correctly, and other will have the problem.  My kids complained about this.I did my research, and I discovered that some of these units may be defective.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Product is bad and it is useless.  I purchased this device for my wife and for my two children.  We are both happy with our purchases but I bought my wife a better device for her use.   Both her children are fine.  Both had the best use of the device but neither of them liked it.  The only reason it works with my wife's phone is because her phone has a similar screen.  It has a back light that is a bit brighter than the front, and when I put the device in my wife or my daughter, it is sometimes too bright and sometimes too dim.  This will not work with my children's phones and the front light will often cause problems with their photos

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this unit without a key.  I tried to download a couple of pictures, and it wouldn't open.  On top of this unit, I had to install several patches on my machine.  One of these patches didn't work for me, and then a technician suggested that I install the patch that was compatible with my phone, and I could get around to installing the patch for the phone.  The patch did work for my phone.So now I have two different units with two different software and two different configurations, so all my pictures are not compatible.  It doesn't work with some of the webpages I wanted to try out, but I'm using a different web browser for those.  So now I am stuck with two separate versions of my machine for two different pictures.  Two different patches are incompatible with my unit.  When I tried again to use the old patched version, I was told that my old unit will be discontinued after January 1, 2012.I also have the older version of the software on my old computer and was told to try again to get this unit fixed.  This time, I also get a message from the phone service desk saying that my phone has been deactivated because of technical issues.  They are also saying that this unit has a bug that is causing problems with the camera.  Unfortunately, there is nothing that I can do to fix this until the bug is worked out.  Once this is fixed, my web browser will work fine on this unit.Now, I have a new device and it works with my camera, but that was not the bug I had trouble with.  My unit has no way of contacting the camera with the new firmware, so it can't recognize the old or new firmware.  And I got this message at the end of January, so this unit will likely be discontinued.  Now I have to get a new unit to use with my machine and I can't figure out the difference between the two versions of the firmware.It really was a pain in the arse to buy this unit from this website without a CD or key.Now I have some pictures with the newer firmware, but there are some that are not available with the older firmware, and the newest versions of both versions of these software are just buggy as hell.  Some users have tried to update their firmware and have had problems.  However, the older versions still work.  But the new version seems to just be

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used a different mouse for every session.  I found the mouse to be buggy and unreliable.  The buttons on the mouse are flaky.  This mouse is not very user friendly.  It can get very hot and sticky if left on the desk for long periods of time.  (I have used this mouse for about five sessions).   It was difficult to read text or type text, because the cursor would sometimes get lost or jump around, or even go in circles.  If you want to switch between programs or tabs or use the mouse, you must scroll back up and down through the program window and then back to the mouse window.  Sometimes this will work for a while.  But the mouse will reset the program every time you use the computer.  A very cool feature of this mouse is that it is easy to lose the mouse.  You can lose it in the same way you lost your notebook or paper.  Once lost, you simply need to remove the battery and battery compartment from the mouse and find a replacement.  To the mouse itself, all you can do is type in the program bar, but you can not change it or make it do other functions.  When using the mouse the program itself must be closed before closing the windows.  Some of the functions have limitations and need a button press in order to function.  These mouse functions do not work very well.  They sometimes work on some computers, but not on others.  In my system, some features will work but not others.This mouse is also prone to having problems with the battery compartment.  One thing I do like about this mouse, is it will work fine with the software, but it will not work with the menu function (unless you click the mouse button, the menu does not function).  I am not a fan of this, so I have not used this software for more than three sessions.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you plan to use the unit, be aware of it will require a new battery, which will void the warranty.  The warranty will not cover any battery failure of the first month.  After 1 month of service, the battery will no longer work, unless it is repaired with a new one.  This means you now have a $50 investment that you plan on buying from Amazon, Amazon's own, which is a complete waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device on a regular lease from Amazon.  It does have a small button.  This button is great for downloading the web but I have to press the button to return to the home page.  I have tried to download the web browser in various ways but all failed.  In order to return the web page to the web site to the default settings, I had to use a key and I had lost the configuration settings.  The web browser does not save.  My home page loads fine, but I'm not getting on the server.  After a while I could not get the server to load a webpage.  Once the web version is installed, it will be fine.  However, you can't use the Web browser to find the Web site itself.  There is no help in the Amazon web site or any help in contacting Amazon. The Web browser has the "Home" menu and then you have to scroll through all the pages of the Web to find it.  You will not find anything for download.  Amazon says you can find the server instructions on their server but they do not include a page for troubleshooting.  What a mess.  They say that I have "updated" the configuration on the web and this is the only way to get access to the server, although the instructions are not easy to read 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There is no way to disable the "show mode" in this device.  I found this device in the second-hand section of my local electronics store.  This unit is in perfect condition and works fine on my PC and I would have no problem with it.  But I am not entirely satisfied with the configuration of this unit.  It has a "quick launch" option, but it is only accessible by pressing the button on the front of the device.I purchased this unit because I have two PCs connected to my home network and an internet connection on my desk for both of the PCs.  That's all.  There are no manuals with this unit nor is there any documentation for this device and there are no instructions or support.  The only documentation for the unit is a CD that I have been able to retrieve.  Unfortunately, the CD has the incorrect disc cover and it lacks the information for the installation CD that is required by the manufacturer.  You can download a manual from the manufacturer's website, but the CD is blank, the installation instructions are not included, and the installation disc is blank as well.  My PC has already performed a clean install and I have not been able figure out how to install the software or do a clean reset on my computer.  So I have no confidence in this unit operating on my pc.  And it won't be possible to perform an upgrade of the OS for this PC, which makes it useless.  Therefore, I am using the same PC on both of my PCs.When I perform a clean reboot of my computer after a new PC boots up from an OS install, the screen will blank out for a short time before the main menu appears, but I haven't been able find a good reason to use it for the rest of my PC.  If I could find a reason to disable this function or switch the screen to "off-mode" as some of the other reviewers have done, I would.I'm returning this device for a full refund and I will not buy this device again

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked OK for me and I was able to make it work. I was happy with the fact that I could copy and delete files but I couldn't actually do this. I just had to look at the menu and select a menu item and I clicked on it hoping for some info and just had no luck. I tried the search function and nothing. I had to try to find the menu on the web. I made a few attempts and came across some info that listed the device for sale on Amazon. I clicked the link and a page came up about the device but the seller did not have a link to that site 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have only gotten this device for two or three months out of the box.  I purchased it on a Christmas Day and immediately tried to upgrade and it broke.  After a week of trying to upgrade the software on my pc, it worked on my laptop and it didn't work on my smartphone.  This is the first piece I bought, and if you have it, it has a CD/DVD player, but it doesn't play it.  The only reason I can think of that it can't be upgraded right now is that I bought a DVD and didn't get the CD on it.I have tried two different browsers and I'm still having problems trying to connect to this device.    This has been a real bummer.  On a personal note, I have bought this device thinking it will work with my Windows 2000 and maybe a Linux.  So far, the connection problems are so numerous that I have to reset the system every single time I use my computer.  Also, I can't find an upgrade on the web and, for some reason, I'm not able to find an install of the driver.  As of now, it does not run this OS, which makes upgrading a real pain in the ass 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The picture quality is bad, and the display is a little hard to turn on.  The camera does not work well in certain lights.  I have used the remote to check the battery life of various lights, but it would not turn on when the light was on or in standby mode.  A lot of the times, the unit would reset itself to reset to a new firmware.  When the firmware has been fixed, the camera has performed well in the lab, but I have not been able to get it to work properly in real life.  This unit requires a password to use the remote, so please keep that in mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   What I purchased, even after ordering the wrong version of the firmware, caused problems with some of the functions.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was hoping for more than 1 year to get this product.  Unfortunately, I have a very slow internet connection, so when I try to update the firmware, it sometimes requires me to reboot my PC (on and off) many times a day.  For example, my PC is "off" for about 20 minutes before it will "wake up" and automatically update the software.  So much for a long term system that will be a long-term investment.  The software that this device comes with is very user-unfriendly.  It requires me (and my friend) to be connected and have both Windows XP and XP on our local machines, or to do all of the updates, all of them in sequence.  This software requires a user to enter the passwords several times a minute.  After this software updates, Windows XP will not work with other computers on our network.  When we first plugged the router into my laptop, I had the idea to install some of the other versions, but the user interface is so poor that we had to remove all of our applications and copy all of their files to the system.  If you try to install the other version on our system, it will refuse to install.  And in any case, I would be willing to pay $120 to get rid of this product, but I had a friend with a better PC and he was able to complete this process in about 2 minutes

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My wife wanted to get rid of her old, ugly phone but I couldn't have it. It was a total disaster.  The software did not function well, it had to be upgraded.  It also did not work with my wife's contacts.  I sent her a message to ask her to call the company and ask for a new phone, but I could not receive a reply.  Her email account stopped working, and she had to call from my work computer to communicate with the tech support team.  After having my wife on the phone for a few hours, the techs were not responsive.  My recommendation, which I now have to repeat to my wife, is to not purchase any new phones for her and to get a new card for her.  This phone is clearly defective and I wish I had purchased a new unit.  Please let me know how my recommendation is being heard by others.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed in this device.  It had no manual or instructions.  Once the game loaded, I loaded it up and clicked the play button.  In a few moments, the game booted into the level map.  After a few minutes, I noticed that there were bugs with the maps.  The player controls are extremely finicky to use on the map, so I didn't know what was going on with it.  If the map is displayed incorrectly, the player's controls just go through the motions for a couple of seconds, with no actual feedback about the situation on the screen.  I also tried the game on my own system on my computer and it worked with the same problem.  While I was running it on my laptop, the same bugs appeared on the maps when I attempted to load maps for levels that I had already completed.  There are a couple map bugs that appear to be caused by the game's built in map editor and the map editor fails to keep the map in working order.  This bug also occurs with my personal game, when I loaded the game and attempted to save a new map to disk.  (I tried saving the game in several different ways and it would sometimes create a new blank level without the old level data.  Some of the level data that I saved did work fine with my level.  But I still had to redo all the levels).  So my personal level data was probably not going to work with this game, since this is the first game that I loaded without the data to create the maps for.  Perhaps this level editor has been left in an incomplete state and I am using the game just to map the game as it works out of the box.  However, it is not known whether this level map editor has the ability to create maps that work with my existing maps as I have created mine.  Since this game works just fine on my home systems without the maps, I decided to try to create my own maps and use the map editing functionality for this game on the home version.  Unfortunately, this has created a lot of problems with the map editors as I was trying to create new maps for my existing games, too.  As a result, I am unable to edit any existing maps that I have saved from my home system.  My home systems did not seem to have any map editor for this type of game.  Thus, I now have no map for this version of
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the same card as the one I had just installed, I did try to change my mind about this one.  In addition, the card did not work in my iPad.  At the end of this product, there was an error message that I could not read.  The product itself is also difficult to operate due to an error, even with an update, it works fine in my device.  It's possible the software was not properly updated.  If not, this is a bad piece, you will be able to receive e-mail messages in the future.  I just downloaded a copy of the card to my Mac.  This could also be a fault in my original unit.  A friend's iMac worked fine.  After trying both in the same place, I am still waiting for a replacement to arrive

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product has no support for Bluetooth 4.1. It was shipped with the newer version of the Bluetooth specification, with a built-in battery, but it does not have a built in battery or charger.The battery has an internal safety seal, but the battery cannot be disassembled in any way, so you must first remove the batteries. This part is very vulnerable to damage and does not come with the battery. I would not recommend attempting to put the batteries back in.In my tests, I got the device in operation as I had my phone with me. There is a problem with the firmware that I found that was not easy to fix. The new version of this product works with the original firmware that it shipped with. It seems that the device did not come to market as advertised, and it is a "beta" product. I did get this unit after a number of months on the market.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst phone I have ever owned.   I have used it twice so far and it has a really bad radio, doesn't work at all, even on the button, and it doesn't go through the FM stations.  I am really stuck with an FM station, on the FM dial, and I just try to find the station to tune to.  It works fine with a different channel, but not an FM channel.  Don't buy this phone.  If I am using it, I must go to the AM radio and tune in.  This device works fine if I am driving or riding my bike.  But I have to keep trying to find a station to listen to, and get a signal strength check on the radio, which sometimes fails to work.  The other major problem is I cannot listen to the FM station with this device because it is so slow and jerky and I have never gotten any signal strength checks that go through.  For some reason, the FM signal strength on this phone just can't handle this phone, and for some reason FM is not available in the FM channel or it just gets out of tune with my own frequency.  On the other hand, the AM signal strength works fine.  With both of these phones, I have had to go through several station tests before I was able to find any stations that I wanted to tune in to, that I could actually hear.  And the FM has the FM antenna (this one isn't as strong).  My radio is the only way I can hear the AM channel or the FM.  My FM station is very weak, and when I tried tuning in to the radio to find this AM station, I had to use the FM switch on my unit to get the FM signals going.  When I switched back to the analog AM channel I had trouble finding any stations to tune into, and the FM is very unstable.  Sometimes, I could not hear a strong FM station at all.  In addition, I still have problems finding the AM station.  Radio frequencies change in my town from one station to another, so I must constantly check in with this unit.  FM does not go through, and AM stations don't have FM stations, and there is no way to find out what station this is on the AM channels.  Finally, I try to tune the AM transmitter (which works great), but when I do, I sometimes have trouble finding the

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is by far the worst thing I have ever used. I found out about this item from a magazine when I was trying to connect with my home wireless network. I tried several times, but the problem was I had the same issue I had with my desktop. I have to unplug and replug every few months to get any significant speeds.I purchased two of these devices and never had a problem with either one of them. My home wireless now only works on this network.I have another unit, and I'm looking for another device because I have a second network.If I have two units in use, it works fine. The reason for this is that it is designed for the desktop model only, which has a larger antenna than the handheld version.The second problem is that the network can only be used for one device at a time. This has been my experience as well. If I change my desktop, it can not be used until I uninstall it. I used one with Windows XP, installed it to Windows 98, and found that there was a very significant performance degradation and this issue persists with other wireless networks with Win XP.I bought a desktop on another network and installed it on Win XP and installed my network. This issue is resolved with Win 98, which does not have any compatibility problem with the handheld.I'm hoping that Microsoft will develop a solution for the handheld, and perhaps this network will be useful when a wireless connection is established between a desktop and a laptop or Mac. Microsoft has made wireless devices with this type of antenna, and there has not been any problems. I do not understand why this is the case and this type antenna seems to require a lot of data to work with Win98.I had a similar antenna installed with my Windows XP computer and did not experience any performance degradation with that computer, so I am hoping that this issue is isolated with Windows 98 and is not a Windows 98-only problem.When I tried to connect to this network with an XP-based network, the Windows XP-network driver installed with Windows98 will install a driver with Win 95 or Win 98.However, it is only an installer. I can get this driver and run it with the network, but there is no connection to the wireless network that is supposed to be the Internet. If you try to connect using the mobile network, you will get an error message indicating that you need an Internet connection.A good point about this issue: The mobile network only works

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you are looking for a microphone that will cover your audio for video, that is what I bought from Amazon as well.  I don't know if the price is justified, but I ordered two batteries that did not work for video and had the same problems I had with the audio for videos.  Amazon also has a "Free Trial Period" that is not active (even though it says it's live), so I bought this device because it would make it a little easier to get the software.  This device does have all of the capabilities of the original unit, including the ability to connect with the iPhone for video playback, but the screen is tiny.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone has a very small battery.  It doesn't have a backup, and there's no phone number for an international call.  I could not find an international plan with a single-country number.  This is a serious problem for a person living in a different country, and is a deal breaker.  The battery is cheap, but the screen doesn't last long.  When the phone works, the screen shows an "off" message for hours at a time.  Since the screen is on only for a short time at a regular frequency, a lot of messages can be shown in a row.  One is frequently repeated, and some are repeated several times per second.  In a lot other words, the phone is set to the same frequency for two hours at about every hour.  If the screen isn't showing the phone when a user is driving in a car (on a long trip) the phone must be in standby mode.  (This is a real pain to get set up and off again).  I tried using this phone in the office for several months and I found it very unreliable, but with the battery replacement option there is a lot you can do to save your battery and get a full-time operation without rebooting the phone.  Using the battery on my phone was a huge inconvenience, since it can be very difficult to set up the phone in my office, as some of the messages repeated when I switched phones.  My office is a large area with many of my co-workers using their own phones.The battery is soldered by the manufacturer, so there's not a chance to resolder.  So you have to buy it separately.  Unfortunately, my office is no longer an option for this phone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the wrong one.  I found this item to be very buggy and the design is not ergonomic, the device is heavy and not designed to be used standing up.  It was also very slow on a computer and when it was first setup, the screen was slow in operation and displayed text only.  The design does allow you to move the text up and down but not up or down.  You can move text up or move it down, but the top of the screen is not designed with an integrated brightness control or screen brightness adjuster.  On some screens the text is very bright and you cannot adjust the screen's brightness to a high level.  If you move the brightness control dial all the way up the screen will start to slow down.You can use the keyboard but it's designed to provide only basic navigation support and not for gaming.  Some buttons (eg. F1) are not designed for the keyboard or for the screen.  Overall, the keyboard is very simple and does not provide an interface for input.  Using the keyboard requires moving the cursor manually, a user must be able to navigate by typing text rather than by simply pressing buttons.  Many of the buttons have different functions than the computer controls and the keys have different shapes which is a pain in the arse.  Also, because the screen functions only in Windows and not any other OS, it was never designed to work with any of the existing games.  There are also buttons for changing the keyboard font and changing the font used for the game.  To switch from the game to the keyboard, you have to hold down the F1 key on the keyboard and press the F2 key (or F3).  The keyboard is only designed to function on Windows.  However, a Windows 95 or 98 setup is now available.  For those who bought the original computer without the upgrade and have since upgraded, the game is working with the keyboard; it is an old game with a new keyboard.  A copy of the game works in the Windows 95/98 setup as well.I purchased a copy of Microsoft Windows 98.  This computer is now running a Windows XP installation with a beta version of the desktop.  (This beta version has a lot of bugs and I have no idea why it was produced and released.)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's not a standard size, and you have to buy a new battery. I was having the battery in my car at work the other day and noticed it wouldn't be charged for a long while. I plugged it in and tried charging it. The battery works, but the display only shows the phone number. It shows up in my display but doesn't work. The display also works for the phone, but not for the display. The screen is great, but as far as I could tell, I still had a bug with this. I've looked at other phones and they also don't have this problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As in most other laptops you can't type any text, so its only useful if you type everything in code.The screen does have some problems with colors and contrast.  This has been the only reason I've gotten any decent battery service.  I have not yet been able to get a replacement, but its nice to have the computer running when needed.  It works great for a basic web browsing session, but I have to work with this when I do 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this phone to replace my broken original, so I don't know why you bought the original. The number I had dialed had an incorrect setting and I could get only the phone number for the person on the line. The person was nice, but was unable to give me the correct setting.I've been trying to get my replacement for about a week now and can't seem to get the phone to do anything else than dial the number I dialed. The new phone seems to do better with my number. The first half of this phone set doesn't have the correct number to use. I'm sending it back today to get it fixed. It is the same phone number as the original, I'm just trying to change my settings. It should be fixed by now but I've yet to receive a phone confirmation.If you have a different number that you dial often, or have trouble getting a connection to the area (I have a number in my office that is always working), I'm pretty sure this is a glitch with my phone, or it's a different problem.My advice is don't buy it and do not buy the original if you want the new one to work. I tried the number to get a signal but it wasn't working 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There are no buttons for this device.  My laptop is a good product, but the software crashes after a while.  When I had to upgrade, I found that the software is no longer compatible with the new version of Windows 10.  It's very easy to uninstall Windows 10 using a registry hack that can be accomplished with Registry Editor.  This was a very easy hack.  I used it successfully.  If you can get the older version of 10 installed again on your computer, it will work for another 15 minutes.  Then it crashes again.  A very nice feature.  Unfortunately, there's nothing to uninstall this version of the system from your PC when you do this.  After the hack, this version was not compatible with Windows 10 Pro.   I upgraded the system but after my reboot, the problem recurred.  Windows 10 is a great system for downloading, browsing, and playing some games, but you can only save some games and it will give you an error message for a "bug".  You can run a game to see what a bad product is capable of, but it will not work with Windows 8.1.  You may have to reset the system and reinstall some of the programs. I bought and installed a new copy of Windows to see if this was a problem with the system.  The new operating system did work without a problem when I rebooted and played some games.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   One user recommended changing the settings on the backlit keypad to the lowest possible level.  While this solved the problem for me, it does not fit most keys and the backlighting is too dim.  I also had trouble finding the right combination of keys with the backlight.  As a result, the keypad is more like the one pictured here: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device doesn't work in a car, or at all.  Can't confirm if this device is used to drive the iPod, or is used in the player.  There is a built in function to skip tracks when driving.  I got a new one and it works fine.  My only gripe with this product is the fact that it is not compatible with all iPods.  This is only the case and not the iPod.  It's a lot of money to buy this case and have this iPod work on your car or other devices.  Also the case is not adjustable.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product works fine and works great for a single copy of any book:  There is a slight lag in my copy of this book.  I bought this to have my reading list organized.  It works just fine.  This is a nice upgrade from previous models.  A great buy but not very useful 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is so cheaply made that I'm afraid of it.  I bought this last night when I drove home from work.  The screen has a built in screen protector.  This product is good enough for a quick game, but you have to wait for that screen protector to re-apply itself after each game.  In addition, the screen's image quality is so bad that you can see the text of your name, address, phone number, and other personal info on your screen.  To me, it's unusable, and the software is so glitchy that I found that it didn't work with my Windows NT desktop.  (I tried this with my NT-based PC at home after I logged in.) The manufacturer's web site doesn't help me figure out what to do, and it does a poor job of explaining this product.  As a result, I returned it to the store to get it fixed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this card from Amazon in 2006 and the batteries started to malfunction.  The problem was not resolved until May 2009.  I've now replaced both batteries twice with other units, both of which failed too.  Both units are now dead.  Amazon customer service confirmed the problem and offered no solution for the faulty units.  This is unacceptable service.  While this is certainly not the best card I've purchased in my life, it is the best one I can currently get from Amazon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got an error in the manual when I bought it and when I tried to print, the printer wouldn't print any pictures. I got it fixed and it prints some fine pictures, but still, it will not print any of my high quality prints of high quality art books.  I tried this, then tried it on another printer, and it also printed only fine pictures.  The machine also works fine, and is easy to operate.  (I tried to set it to print fine only and then get my hands all dirty with paper, and ended up setting it for low quality printing only and printing lots of pages.) So it can do fine printing in high end commercial printing presses.   It works well, but I was getting the same problem when I got the software and manual in order.I was using the first version of the program, which has a lot of bugs.  It needs a lot more bug fixes, and many users were getting "bad" results in my tests.  If I ever get it to run on a Mac, I'll need to do a lot better testing, and more bug fixing. (The problems are really obvious when it prints fine in high-end Macs.)  I've bought it a few times since getting it, and each time it prints a lot fewer fine-quality results than it should.  Still, it's still fine for printing and a lot cheaper than the cost of the original book I bought from a commercial printer.  My printer did fine printing, however, and I used it on both books. The quality of the pictures is OK, but some were so badly faded that I had to crop to keep them from looking like they are not all from the same book.I'd be interested in a lot less expensive, better software and a little more bug-fixing.  This is the first product I've purchased, and the price is pretty high.  Perhaps my experience with it is typical, but the software is very clunky and the problems with it are so many that it has made me re-evaluate the product.  For example, one thing I had printed in high quality that the printer would not print, and which the software would not allow me to print again.  But I tried all of the printer settings.  So far, the computer has worked well, so I'm willing to give it a second try.  In my next review, I may try it with the printer setting
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   the battery did not work.  the product does not have enough capacity, therefore the product may be faulty. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you want to use a printer that does not work, it doesn't work with the new version of the manual.  It will work with older versions, but it won't recognize certain words, or spellcheck correctly, or type certain words as punctuation.  I purchased this as a replacement for the old manual, which I already have.  When I was first attempting to use it, I got the same issue.  However, there was a solution that worked for me.  To get to the printer's page, click on the manual, click the "About" button, and scroll down.  This works on the newer version of manual, but not the old version.  The old manual is the same as the old one (there were two or three typos).  I just updated my computer so that I could use the new one, which works much better.  If this is an issue, I would suggest updating your computer software first.  In fact, I tried to install this on my desktop but got stuck on an error, and it would not boot, so it has to be the printer.  Unfortunately, the one on my desk works now.  What a bummer

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried to upgrade this device on October 9th to October 10th, and now have a new model number on the box.  This is not a problem as far as I can tell, but I just wanted to write a negative opinion.  I still don't like this product, and I wouldn't buy another one for myself.  You'd have to buy a second for your family, and there's no way I could find one of my parents.  Don't waste your money on this box--I bought two units, and will probably use the ones I got in my truck--I didn't really think I'd like the features, but this is clearly the way the company wanted to market it.  The box had a great design, but it's not sturdy and it's hard to open and close.  Also, the packaging isn't very well designed.   You'll need to press the lid all the way down with your fingers to make it stick to the box when you want to use it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery works okay but I bought mine to run and was told to use it and then found it wouldn't work unless I connected the power cord to the charger, not the battery.  Then I used my phone to call the other battery.After several hours of use, the battery still wouldn't recharge the phone when I wanted to use the handset.  So, I now own the first battery.I used the second battery when I tried my phone.  This one worked fine.  It is now on my night stand.  I would not recommend buying the second one if you plan to use your phone while the other works and vice versa.  The only other option available is to have two handsets, connect the phones, and use one of them when you want to use a handset and the other when you would like the handset to recharge.  Both of these options don't work.  What's the difference between the two?I still don't know.  If I buy another battery or the phones back and try to use them, I will probably buy an old Nokia phone.The other reason for purchasing the battery is that the battery was still in the original box.  When I got it and tried to recharge it, I found that it wouldn not recharge.After using a few minutes of charging, I used the old battery when the phone started working.  Although this battery worked, it still wouldn the handset only work if I called a number.  Now I have two phones, so if I want to carry the handset, I can't use both batteries unless I call the battery with my own phone.I think this battery has a better rating than the battery for my Nokia.  My Nokia worked fine at first but now the battery doesn't work, and I can tell that this one has been defective.  On a positive note, I think I used this battery on my Nokia when I put the phone in a pocket, to check the reception.  That was the only way that I could get an signal.I will be replacing this one with the Nokia one and the Nokia battery in the car, since the phone does work fine without it.   If it does work, the handset will work with the battery on the car and I will keep my Nokia in the pocket and with the new battery.The Nokia battery worked with the handset without my dialing numbers to recharge or call.  All that is needed now is that I dial and then enter

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone does not support any music, so I couldn't listen to songs I was purchasing, and the voice recognition software also doesn't work, so the phone is unusable at this point. I received a new phone after I called T-Mobile's customer service number and a supervisor said the phone was not supported, but I thought it had been broken before. I also got it back in the mail after T-mobile fixed the device. The phone does have two antennas and has the battery in it, but it uses the batteries not the phones. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone works fine as advertised.  This particular unit was used in our office on our laptop.  We had problems with this particular phone in our laptop as well.  Apparently it does not work in many other models.  The software is not well organized.  Many of the functions in the software are of low quality.  One unit had a black screen, one did not.  Both units worked fine in our offices as of this writing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It would also be a good idea to get a "recharging" unit.  This device is not rechargeable, unlike the other two.  Also, my wife says it doesn't have enough battery life for the four times she's charged.  So if you only have access to this unit on the road, that might be better.  Otherwise, you'll have to use your cell phone, like any cell phone.  You could also use the wireless radio.  I don't see how it would be helpful on the trip, since you'll be relying on it constantly.  It can't transmit the same stations over a long distance

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wish this device was the same as other similar phones I've used.  It doesn't give very good coverage, and it doesn't work for long.  I bought this phone for its battery life, and was expecting a full charge at most times.  On my test unit I got about 3-4 hours of charge and then it was completely dead, and couldn't get me to use it for more than about 5 minutes of anything.  My tests with it had the exact same battery life as other test units I tested, and those were also dead, even though they worked fine 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A very expensive device with very few options. The only usable settings are for video and audio. The rest are all on "auto" and "normal." The unit works well if you have an iPhone, iPad, iPod, or similar device. If you are trying to use the remote for the TV, it will not pick up TV signals. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say that I didn't get the wireless for this phone.   My wife has the GPS and it works great.  We have one device that works, but it's far out of reach from us.  It doesn't work well with the GPS for the first couple of days.  After that, it works fine with the phone.I tried this with my wife and she just gave it to a friend (who uses it) and it worked just fine.  The only problem is that it is not compatible with the online software.  You can only download the software for the phone, so if you have the GPS working with the internet, it won't work with the software.I found a tutorial online but it wasn't very clear on the phone to set it up properly and the instructions did not come with the device (I had to look for the instructions on this website).  Don't even bother with the instructions, which I couldn't find.  Once you do set it, it will run fine.If you really want to, you can put the GPS on the back and the online version will work fine.I installed the GPS software on the web browser.  This requires you to have the computer with you and not the phone in the car (and this is a very simple task), but I still have not figured out how to find the phone's "menu".  The instructions for setting up the GPS in the phone are a little tricky, but once you have it working, I have yet to see any way to set up the software on a computer.  I set the GPS to search for cars using a particular area (in the phone you will see a button that does this), but in the online map it shows all the directions.  If I go to the map in the software, I still see all directions from a computer, not the GPS itself.  Also, the GPS will not show the directions of a car.  So, even though I had the car directions set up, it was not a complete solution.The GPS on this device does not show "machines" on the map.  One car is supposed to be there on a certain point, but the directions don't mention this point.  Another thing that the directions did mention was the distance.  They said that you would have to keep driving to get a better view of the area you wish to track.  As a result, you have to

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this for Christmas and had to use it.  I was never able to figure out how to put it together.  It's so cumbersome that it was hard to hold the phone and the screen properly.  Once you have the battery on the screen, you have to take it to the car and then to the office.  If you have a big workday and you're looking for a place to charge the phone, you'll find the battery can't charge the screen while the battery is on the phone.  But once you have both of the screens charged up, then the phone can be charged by using a regular battery in the car.  The batteries for the phones are in different compartments and they don't come with a case.   This has never worked properly.I'm still trying to figure this out.  Maybe I'll just buy another phone and figure out what the buttons do once I can figure out which buttons to push

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My tablet worked fine until last week when I decided to use it for some reason.  I called Tech Support.  The woman told me that my device was out of warranty and was a lemon that could be replaced.  This is a lemon without an OS.  If I had my way, I'd have tried my luck on a lemon and not an OS because the OS is horrible on a new device.  Tech Support would not help me.  They just said that my warranty would be in effect at the end of the year.  My device is now useless and I have no clue why.  At least I have found a way to turn it off and now my device works on my old PC (which is not the same model).  The only reason I can find for my  battery to still work on the PC is a software problem on the device.I now have an old PC that I'm able to upgrade to the same version of the OS that it's running on the new PC.  Unfortunately this is only a temporary solution until I can get my computer back.   I am currently looking at ways to return my device to its manufacturer.  However, I would recommend NOT buying this device and just keeping a list of devices that have been used for something other than warranty repair 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In some countries, this device had a very weak battery.  In others, it was just about perfect, and I had great battery life, but the battery was not charged to full capacity when I went through the normal battery charge-up sequence and the charger was very slow in its charge-down sequence.  On the other hand, it would be much faster in battery charge up.  This product has no on-board USB to facilitate this charge down-sequence.  My laptop does work with this battery, but it is not a smooth user interface.  I had to touch the screen to find any option that allowed me to go into battery power-up mode.  The software seems to be buggy and a little buggy, as well.  For instance, there are two buttons that I tried, and each one did the same thing as the last.  After trying several different modes, I found one that would connect the battery into the battery charge, but this time the system would lock up and refuse to connect.  It would give me the option to "refresh" the battery and then it would just go through the full charge-load sequence without charge-recharge, just like the software.  Unfortunately, this also meant I had just about zero range of operation when I wanted to operate the laptop.  One can see the battery voltage in the BIOS, and the display will only display the battery capacity in full-charge mode.In addition, the battery does not appear to have an option that allows me to power-down my machine.  As you may recall, I tried this.  There is a setting that allows the battery to go through charging, and power-off, and this product was not able to support this mode either.  If I am going to take the battery with me and use it at my home, I am required to do the full battery charge load sequence each time I reboot.  These features, when used together, did not function properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this phone isn't working very well. I would suggest not buying this phone because if you try to make it work, you'll get an error message and it says "please update your software" and that's all. So if you buy this phone, then you'll have to buy another one, and then you have to keep trying it over and over again. So you'll be stuck with this phone forever. You know what I do about this? I gave it to my wife and she can't find it anywhere anymore. If it doesn't work, then we can't do the phone calls. It doesn't even work in the phonebook, even though the manufacturer's page says "phonebook compatible". If you try it on the web it won't go through the browser. It has to be from the browser menu. And when I try to check the phone book, I get an "access denied" message. I can't imagine how this can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is not an item to store your precious keys.  The plastic is so brittle and it is a pain to open and close.  Even the little handle, which is great to use, is not easily manipulated and works only when you press it down onto your keys. The plastic material is cheap and brittle and the handles on the keyboard do not work well.  In addition, the buttons are all the same size, and the key caps do not fit very well on the keys.The keys for the backspace key work, but I did not try them yet.  They were made for a different keyboard and the function keys do not function.  Also, the keyboard is very slow.  It will take about a minute to find the function and alt keys.I have used this keyboard before and it did not work on a second computer, but on my phone it did.  There are several different sets of buttons on the bottom of the keyboard, but they all work in a similar fashion.  You must press down on the plastic buttons to activate the keys, and they will always be "on" even when you are not pressing them.  This can make the keyboard quite slow when you have several things on your screen. The keys are all very small, and I had trouble finding them when I first got it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is horrible. I couldn't see anything on the screen. The button that is the least useful is the "switch to" which is used when you are on a new channel, but there is no "switching". So the channel can't be changed back. If you want to return to a channel that has already been switched, you have to "unswitch". There are 2 different types of switch. One is the one that works from 1 channel to another, and the other is the flip-switch. The flip-switches are fine for 2 channels, but if you want 4 channels, the switch will not work. There is no backlight or audio on the device itself. The radio has a battery that has a 30 day life. The switch to/from channel 11 was on the radio when I got it, but it is a useless switch. If the radio worked, the radio would work fine.I think my phone worked from the beginning, but the device didn't work as well. There was no way to set up to a network.My experience with this device is that it doesn't work well with a cell phone, and its battery is good only for a 30-day battery. I have spent hours trying to troubleshoot the radio so that it could work with my phone.I do believe this radio could be used with a GPS receiver. It does not work with a regular GPS.If you want one, you can get one for $14.00 on Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My experience with these units was very disappointing.  In addition to the price being very high, the software was very limited and did not allow any form of web browsing.  I downloaded the software from Amazon and had to re-register to get a new key, which I could not get.  For my computer, I had to reinstall my previous license key.  It worked fine with the keys I had.  On another computer I got the same software and got a new license key, but I did not have the opportunity to install it until after the software had been installed on my previous computer.  After that, it worked as intended with my previous hardware, but my new license could not be registered.  Amazon has very confusing instructions on how to use the software on that particular software.  They do not clearly explain what happens with the license if you do not have a key on the system.  This new system requires a different software license key for every computer.My first computer, which was for my work, gave me a problem, requiring a reinstall on my work computer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery did not work right out of the box.  The screen is too small and the battery did work properly.  However the LCD screen was not responsive when the user moved the mouse.  This caused the mouse to not track correctly.  I was also able to get rid of a few of the games.  There were some game related bugs which I fixed with the user manual.  After that, I was able to use the console on this particular system with the game and monitor combination.  Although the game works, there are still a few bugs that I have yet to fix.  My wife was able, after some troubleshooting, to get it to work with other games.I decided to buy this console at a local Radio Shack store and I have had some issues with the games (some had problems loading the game).  However, my wife got it to function properly with other gaming stations.  It was a lot more functional than the one I got.  Also, there have been several software updates on this system.  These all worked out of warranty.  In my opinion, the current software on the console should be used with other players.  We tested it on the PC and it also worked out well.    I am not familiar with the latest releases of the software.  While it works for some games, there is no guarantee that this will work with all games.A lot of people have had problems with this unit and I suspect that the problem may come from the manufacturing process (which could be improved upon).  I found the "home menu" not to work well.I used the Windows 95 boot disk to install my PC.  Unfortunately the CD-ROM worked with a different boot device and this is a real bummer.  For the games, the CD did not have the software pre-loaded for them and the games would sometimes have to be downloaded from the Internet.  But, my PC's software worked fine on the boot disk.  To get the Windows software on it, I had to uninstall the CD and reinstall Windows 95.  Luckily, this works and I am able to continue to use this device with other PCs.  If you want to play a game, you simply need to boot from the CD ROM and get in the game, select the appropriate settings and launch the game.  All other controls worked fine.  So, the computer itself was just a toy for playing games with my wife.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item and immediately, it broke!  I returned it and ordered another one.  After two days of no problems, I bought another one and used it for three months straight.  I had the battery pack broken while I was using it.  It was very easy to break it while in use.  The battery is the only thing that worked.  When you receive this battery, there is a black stripe on the front side.  This battery will work on almost all phones that you have tried to work.  Even if the battery is not in use, the device will still work on the phone.  If you get a new phone or something that will work, it will not work properly.  Don't use it.The batteries will charge and power the phone just fine without the phone in use

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone does not work with my computer, and the battery works, but the screen is not functional. I am going to attempt to repair this phone, but will likely find that I need to get it shipped back to the seller.I had purchased this phone on September 12, and then this morning I ordered another phone to see if it works on my new computer. I have bought that phone, and it does not seem to have had any problems.I am now looking into a refund for this phone.The phone is clearly not a good investment. I purchased it to keep as a souvenir to show my friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The batteries are generally of low quality; some are defective or of low capacity.  I have not used them at all.  My car's interior uses batteries to power accessories, such as the navigation and radio.  This will probably result in a lower quality navigation system that will require more frequent battery changes. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Overall, the unit was okay, but it worked poorly. I used to have issues with the antenna's signal strength, which made it necessary to tune in the FM stations in order to avoid errors. I couldn't work with the unit because I found it to be difficult to tune the radio to the stations, which was not helpful when I was out in the field.The antenna worked fine on my car and it would have been good if I had gotten one of the CD changers for work, but you don't see the CD player in the unit. The CD player has been on my laptop for my entire stay in South America 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are GREAT quality, but I purchased them in bulk and bought two of them.  The other three I already have.  I bought two more in case I get more in the next shipment.  So far, I haven't purchased any for my daughter.  She has played with one and she likes them, but she can't get comfortable with them, so I don't think she will like them. They are a little too tight for her.  Don't know yet if she will be able to keep them in the car as well.  It would be nice to try it out.  When my wife tried one it would slide up and down, but the screen was too high for her to see.  A number of times she tried to get the screen and the back up.  However, she got too close and bumped her head.   Don' t know if this is an issue or not 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I do not like the design of this device. It is very difficult to attach the cord to a wall. I have to try the unit before I can say it is a good fit. I like the ease of it. The hardware works but is very weak. I used it for two weeks, and the battery drained quickly.  I got it in the mail, but I now have a broken battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the wrong model for my family.  The buttons would work great, but I had to replace the batteries and have the software downloaded.  On subsequent attempts, I couldn't get this software installed.  I tried to get this installed on several computers, but it would not work on all computers.  In short, the software is still out there, and it has been on the internet for over a month.  It seems to be a very old, out of date software.  Apparently it is a relic from a bygone era.  This software is not working with any Windows version greater than XP.  A Windows XP or later would not have been released in 2009.  What this means is that this software is only compatible with Windows XP and Vista.  Vista is the only version of XP that is compatible with XP and Windows Vista.There are no instructions for this version of the software, and no documentation.  There is a "how to" section in the manual.  Unfortunately, this manual is not up to date and has some spelling errors in it.  Also, the manual is only in English and not in any other language.  So I have to type in my Windows user name, password, and my user name and password in every computer, even though it says "English only".  I can see this is a big problem if I had the children with me.  They are now unable to type their names in their user name.  We tried this for my wife, she had no success installing the software with Vista.She was able to find a manual in the net that would have worked with Vista, but the manual was not up-to-date.  She would like this software for the PC and she has an account on the Microsoft website for that Windows version.  You do not even have to log in with a Windows account for this software to function.So this is not a good product for any Windows XP user.  My Windows XP desktop, which I had previously purchased and upgraded multiple times, was a good choice, as it has no problems running Vista and XP, and I can log in using the account she created.  However, I had intended to purchase this on a regular retail basis from the manufacturer.  Maybe they are now not selling the product.    In this case, my family is stuck with the current product for now.  Although it worked with XP on the Windows XP server, Windows
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the one with the red color screen and it does have the capability to display a small program as a special bonus, although it has some software problems.  The only way to get the program out of the device was to turn on the TV or to access the "special" functions by pressing a button on the front of the screen.  There's a small button on top of the display which allows you to "change to "special".  The software runs very poorly.  It will only run for a limited time.  A warning window appears at the beginning and an "update" button does not work.  When pressed, the software will freeze up for about 15 seconds.  After that, it will display an error message that shows that the TV's battery is in the middle of a low battery.  This causes the battery to discharge at high voltage.  To fix this problem, the screen must be switched to a low-voltage mode to charge the battery.The software will not "re-charge" the battery unless you use this feature.  So, at this time, unless you want to turn the TV off or to use the special features, you must keep the screen switched to " special " and not use the buttons on the screen or even turn on any buttons that work on this TV

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst thing I have ever tried and I really can't stand it.  There is no way to disable the "audio" channel or disable the radio, you can't just remove the antenna.  My antenna is not the same one the owner of the radio bought (I bought a second one, but it only works intermittently).  There are other antennas in the area, but they don't work right, so I'm stuck with this one.  This antenna is a big problem.  If you try to listen to radio or TV broadcasts, there is a chance it will drop out of the antenna when it detects them.  I have tried it several times without success.  It's an interesting design, and is very poor.  The antenna doesn't "click" with the radio as advertised, so it is unreliable.  What a shame, I purchased this item because I thought I might buy a second antenna and then "plug it in" and "find out" what I need to do to have the radio work in this area.  But, this radio doesn't have the ability to pick up a station without a signal.  In fact, I have tested the radio to make sure it can pick up the "radio stations in that area".  This radio doesn`t pick up stations.  So I have purchased a station for my husband

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing does not work when you change a memory card, and when you try to format it, it reboots.  My solution, which works for me, is to change the disk every so often, to keep it in its original state, and I change it back in my machine's memory card reader.  This way, the original disk is not lost if you format the machine with a wrong disk, the reader, or a faulty disc.  I like this solution, as it is fast, easy, and reliable.  It's a waste to use this device.  But I used it, and it worked well for me.  So I am hoping that the manufacturer will eventually update the software to prevent rebooting after changing disks.  The disk reads disks as a program, and does not display disks as discs.  (This will not fix the disk problem, which will require changing the disks, and changing the software.)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have tried multiple times to create a backup, but it says it doesn't exist. If you did get one of these units, what is the point? I purchased one for my computer. It seems fine, I think I'll buy one for the printer and then I'll have one unit for my desktop to use for the home office.  It is an electronic device that the manufacturer designed.  I purchased a lot of extra parts from another vendor, but not a single working one.  This has cost me over $100, and I still have a lot left.  At this point, I have yet to see any documentation or any kind of information about the product, so I just bought it and hope it works.  There are some nice specs, but as a consumer, I would purchase a better one if it had the extra features I'm looking for, as I have now.  Also, the firmware has an option that enables it to make "auto-download" upgrades, as it is designed to work with some of the earlier version of the system.I don't have any more problems with this product than I did with my PC.  As mentioned before, there is a software glitch that prevents the software from being updated.  What is the purpose of a new version that does not work on the original, as well as a version that works on previous versions of the PC?  I cannot find any manual or any documentation for this product.  If anyone could tell me how this product works, it would be great.  My computer has been working perfectly and it is working on other computers.  The only thing that has happened in my computer, for example, is that my printer works with the system, but my desktop does not.  But I bought this unit, which works fine with my printer and printer port.The original version of this software requires that the printer be "turned on" every time the PC boots.  Since the printer is only used when the PC is booted, I used my laptop when I wanted to print.  A friend had the same problem, so now they are printing from Windows.  To print from Windows, you have to shut down your PC and power it up again.I have a feeling this was designed by an early adopter and has some bugs, but I just did not get a chance to look into it at the time.  Maybe someone else in this forum has had this problem with a system,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a new model and it had 2 more buttons than the previous one. This is fine, however I ordered the other model and got the same button set. It also has the option for a back light, but I don't use it. I'm disappointed that this model is less stable than the earlier model. It seems more responsive and I am currently trying to find something I can return the back light on if needed. My advice for someone that already has the old model is to simply purchase an older model of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing doesn't even work and the "user guide" (which is a great idea except that there are tons of spelling errors in it) is actually for this device and not the base model.The phone uses the SIM card with the internet.When I tried the SIM, I got a message saying there was a problem with the device and was supposed to call customer service.  I did, and they said the customer service agent had the "problem."  She was able to send a repair kit to the service center.  She told me there was an error in the SIM and that I would have to pay for the product since the SIM was the only thing working.  The next day I received a message from customer service saying, "You cannot use the SIM for internet.  Call customer service."I tried to call and ask the service agent for the SIM to work on the base unit.   I was directed to call the service-center from my local phone number, which did not work (I had to call my local service- center).   The agent suggested calling customer service back up from there. I called customer service and had a live person respond to me.  He tried to set a new SIM card for me, but it was never set up and never showed up.  Customer service then gave me the instructions to call from my home phone and get a new phone number.  It worked on the phone for about a day and then quit.  After all this trouble to get a working SIM, the phone is useless.  In fact, I use this phone regularly as my primary phone. It has no dialer.  So, I do get the "users guide" and all the "registration errors" are related to this particular model 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device was not installed correctly.  Upon uninstalling, it failed to install.  This was repeated with the same results.  After about 3.5 to 4 days of installation I ran into a software error, a software "fix" was available, but not installed.  I had to re-install the software every day.  The problem with this was that it would sometimes crash and would fail to install for a while.  There were times it would go back to a state where I had an old version of the program on one of the drive bays.  To my knowledge, I installed several versions on the same drive, on various bays on various computers.   It was not compatible with all of the computers. After all, this was a product developed for computers with only 4MB of memory, and I had a lot of devices on which it installed. The fact that this product did not run on other computers on my network was a major source of concern.  My experience was that there is no support for it.  Some of the products were shipped with no software.  In some cases, I had had to reinstall my software to get any benefit of this software on another computer, or else the product could crash, and the user would have to uninstall it. I had not been able to get the computer to run.  It would hang for a long time, and after being updated and repaired, it would get "freeze" error.  When it would hang, I would have an old, failed version of it.The "fix".  It installs and runs, but I cannot install my updates (or re-update).  It hangs and hangs.  Any time I try to access my computer, I get an error that says the update is available but requires a reboot.  Each time I reboot, it requires another reboot. This has happened at least twice.  If this software does not install and the customer reports the computer crashed, then the customer will be required to buy a new one.  They are not going to receive a refund.  At some point, I will be buying a new machine, but, I suspect, not before I have paid for it in full. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The worst thing about this radio is that it is no longer useful after the warranty expired.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is designed in such a way that when opened, it immediately shuts off and shuts off with a message that is displayed on the screen.  This message is in the form of a phone-specific advertisement.  It is extremely irritating when the handset is in use and, when it turns itself off, it will display the advertisement on the bottom.  The advertisement itself has two options on the side buttons, but these are useless and do not allow for the switching between the handset's functions.  I am in the process of trying to get this device removed from my system.  If my system works, and this advertisement is not functional, the advertisement does not work, and the handset will not work with the system. If I am not successful in removing this advertisement, the handset may not work properly with the handset.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Not the best product. The product was unreliable and I had to send the unit back as I was sending the unit.  I used this unit in the office and my office and at home.  In my office, the screen looked OK, but I was unable to see the images in the magazine or any pictures, and the photos were poorly printed.  After several months, I purchased the new model (and now I have not had this problem).  I have had this unit for a little over a month and have not used it in the offices.  However, I have installed the printer and have the product installed on my home network.  The new model is OK, as far as printing on a home network, but there is not a user-interface to configure the screen.  It does not work for the photo and magazine images (I still need the instructions on how to configure and use the product).  If you look at the screen, you can get "hiccups" from time to time.  At times, the images printed correctly, but the program is not capable of printing photos or movies.  (This seems to be a common problem with the new unit--the images sometimes come out very small or very dark.)  At the time of this review, I do not use this unit anymore.  While I use the old unit regularly for my personal photos and magazines, it is unusable in my office.  For my personal and office use, I am returning the old model.  This unit is fine for personal photos, but this is probably a good unit for my office use--but I need to update the firmware to have it work for movies.I have tested this unit successfully on a computer in my house and it did not print photos properly.

Also, when you are not traveling, you have to enter passwords for each of your accounts before the maps can be downloaded.  You can download map apps for free on the web.   However, these are not always accurate.  The maps are good, however they do not have the correct topographic map information.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is very slow and requires some work to use it.  This is the most annoying feature on this phone.  You can't get a picture of the screen of this phone, or you will have to press the center button to get a screen shot of the phone. You can also access the screen by pressing a center button.  There is also a software that you use, but it doesn't run on most of the phones.  I couldn't figure out how to get the screen up and running with a simple phone number.  The software requires you to have your credit card.  Most of the people in the store didn't have a credit card, so the phone did not work on those phones. The phone will not be upgraded to run on these phones again.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this and received my package from Amazon.  I paid $49.00 (about half of the listed price), received the manual, but no further information.  The manual says "If this item was originally shipped to the US or Canada, you may encounter a delay in receiving it."  I have received the product from Amazon Canada for the first time.  You will receive it at this email address:  https://us.amazon.com/gp/help/details.php?pf_form_id=1234004516   Amazon has provided me with a number of different options for my account, but this item is a "free trial".  The trial period is for 48 hours, which is great, but I was not able to use it until I received my original box.  Amazon did not list the trial period on the product's manual, though.  This is the only item that I've used so far, and I will be reviewing the product on my "free trials" and "paid trials" tabs on Amazon for all three options, though the "free" item listed under the trial "free-trial" option.  After the trial, Amazon is currently listing the price for the item at $49, which I purchased 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've used my card for only 20 to 25 cards, including this one.  I found the cards in my daughter's backpack as I tried to put them in.  We have used a different version of the software, a different browser, and we still get a different "card" (the "version" does not have a serial number).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was poorly designed, did not work as advertised.  I spent some time testing the firmware version and received an update for a "fix".  This fix will work for the first few weeks, then a new version will be released.  This bug can easily be fixed by manually entering the factory settings.   But this was the first time I used the update, and it caused problems.  There was a lot of confusion when I tried to use it.  For example, after two weeks of use I received the "new" firmware with an update to the manufacturer settings that caused a reboot.  It now fails to function with my router.  The router is not working as well as it should in the first place, and the "fix" has not improved the performance.  If you want to use this router after the next update, you will have to manually enter the factory "settings" and disable/enable the firewall and DNS server.  Even with these settings the router is slower than I expected it to be.  These two steps will force the router to reboot a second time.  My advice is to stop using this firmware and wait until the next release.  But until then, if you are having troubles with this router, buy another one and use the "old" software.  That should make the router more usable 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As a side note, if you purchase a pre-paid card you'll be charged $100 on a first-time install. The $100 price tag does not include a second purchase of a $100 micro-SD card. My card works great. The card worked before and is in perfect condition after installation (the label is still up-dated) and it is up-to-date. I did buy a separate micro-card because I am getting the $100 card at the same time I bought my original card. The software on my original was very slow. There are some issues with the card, but if I can figure out a solution I'm sure it'll work fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this device and its battery has never lasted more than 4 weeks with any kind of use.  I don't even think it's been charged in a while.  And when I tried to put it in my backpack, it wouldn't work.  You can't put this thing in a backpack, because it will either jam or catch fire and then it will burn up.  That's my only negative point.  It has the battery in it in the device, which is a good thing because there's only one place that you can put the battery, and it doesn't charge at all.  The device doesn't seem very robust, either.  Don't waste your money on this, this thing is going to explode and the battery is about to burn up on me.  A new battery should be available to purchase as soon as I can get it.   If I get it running I'll try and figure out a way to get it to work.I purchased this device to go camping, but I won't be using it in a plane or in a vehicle without a power cord. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The box arrived broken. It is a very small unit.  I ordered this product for the family and gave it away to a few people who had it as gifts and the unit was faulty.  It now says there is a defect, but the instructions, once installed, are defective.  The unit now does not work properly.  When I opened the unit I ran into an odd flashing/stuttering/blinking noise.  This product should not be used for children

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing worked fine for the first few months, but after that, it would not turn on. It still worked when the radio was turned on, but it did not work in its new configuration.  There was a lot of problems with this radio, ranging from incorrect software to a poor battery, which I got to replace over a year ago.  The software is buggy, and has not been updated.  In my last radio, I received a warning stating it was "not compatible with the iPhone 4S."  I then tested it to see if I had received a new model.  It was indeed compatible with my 4S, but I had to go through the same process again.  After that, the radio would not activate.  A second note to users:  The antenna for my antenna was not included with my radio.  I returned it, but the battery was not functional with my device.  So when I wanted to switch from one channel to another, I had several antenna options, none of which worked properly.  When I got my radio to work in November, I tested the antenna and it worked.   I was able to get all the channels for my radio from the antenna.  But when I tested it again this week, I did not have the "checker" buttons.  Instead, I was prompted to switch to my "check" or "dial" buttons to change channels 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing won't work with my iPad2. I could not get a clear screen. I had to manually adjust the display to the iPad2's settings in order to get the same display.  In order to do this, I had three different displays that were not compatible with the iPad.  When I tested the iPad with my phone, I was able to see the iPod app and I could browse through the iTunes store.  The display worked with my iPod.  I had the iPod in my pocket and my iPhone in my bag.  This was a huge problem.  It was unusable in this form factor 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this device for a couple of months and the light did not stay on and the screen did not display any text. It did not work well when it was in direct sunlight. I have tried several ways to fix it, but no fix is satisfactory. I was able to buy it at a local department store for $6.00. This device did not respond to the network. The problem with this device was not isolated to me, as others who have purchased the same item are having the same problem. The light does not work and the battery is not working correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product works great for me but I have yet to receive any of my e-mails.  I am not sure what happened.  The product works with two people only.  However, I bought the option for three people.  In addition to the problems with this device, I have purchased three other products for the same address:  I have no idea why I have three of these.  One was defective and I returned it.  That one had the same problem as the first one.  Another one I used and that one was no problem at all.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this a few months ago.  After a few weeks, the battery died in the box.  It has a built-in flashlight, and a light that works with this box is too weak.  My phone works, but my new car will not turn on or use it to make a call or even to talk.  I will use it in the front seat when driving.  A good thing, I can use the front-seat radio to talk to my car's computer to find information or search the Internet (I don't remember what I've installed).  It is a good device and works, and the device can be fixed, but at $200+ I have a problem with this particular piece of equipment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone had a glitch that caused it to freeze up the moment it was turned on. If you have a memory that you use when you call it up, you can't delete or transfer any of the messages to another phone. The problem was resolved by the next time I turned on my phone.  In the mean time, I have other phones for calling and I'm not interested in the ones that don't work.  My problem with this phone is one of usability, and not lack of functionality.  I will purchase another device and try the message-reply system with it, but I suspect it may not be quite as stable.  The phone number that comes up doesn't work in a text-messages system, and doesn't match the number from the old device.  If I receive a message from a loved one in the Philippines, I may have to use a fax machine with this new device

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit does not do audio playback when it is connected to the radio. I also received the original model of this item when I purchased the radio; it does not contain the cassette tape as advertised. I was advised by another customer to obtain a new version of the radio, and I used the copy I already had. The radio does not work, nor does the cassette. The cassette, cassette, and cassette holder will not hold the radio for playback. I used this radio to listen to my local channels and local channels do not work on my unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The software is slow and unreliable. For some people, the software is even slower.  In addition, I used the computer to watch a movie on the same disc, and when the movie was over, the disc would have a bug.  I was able to fix it by resetting the disc, but it does not fix the bug when the disc is reset and when it is in operation.  This is a defect that can easily be repaired, but the bug is the result of a defect within the disc manufacturer that could result in a different or more severe bug in the future.  The bug is present regardless of whether or not I reset the disc.  It is an indication that the manufacturer did not get around to fixing the disc bug and it does affect the functionality of the disc

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons are all the same.  I tried the one I was given.  The other buttons are the same as on the standard iPod.  This one has a battery with an extra charge and uses the iPod with the same menu selection.  It has no music on it.  When you click on "Play" the same picture is used with the button selection.The standard iPod I received was already with "Play Mode" selected.  In order to turn "Playback" on you must use the same "Playmode" button.  You can set up multiple "Playmodes" at a time.  Each one has "Play-Pause" and "Play", which allow you to turn on, pause, or stop playing a particular song, and you can also switch between "Pulse-Play" and any other "Play mode".  In "PlayMode" you can't select any other radio station unless you've turned on your iPod.In "Playstation", "Pulsed Mode", and "Radio-Pulse" you will only have the standard "Play".  It may have an option to tune to "AM" or "Bass", but I can't find that option in the menu selection, even though there is an option for a "PlayStation mode" on the iPod. In addition, the "Radio Mode" button won't work when in "Play Station Mode" nor when using "Playlist" or searching the web with the iPod in "Radio mode".I didn't receive the other ones I ordered.  They work just as well.  While I was getting the device tested on Sunday morning, one of my sons put it back and tried it.This is a very, very nice iPod.I got the iPod for a birthday present, but my parents wanted to try it out.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is, when you install the new firmware, you will be on a nonfunctional version of the web-application and the ability to print the web content.  The system now allows for only 2 users to have a printer simultaneously.  So far, this is not working very well.  I tried for 2 weeks to find a solution to this problem with no success.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   You can find the cable at the bottom of the battery, but it's very easy to detach it from the battery.  This can be useful if the battery isn't properly charged or a bad battery. I use this cable to connect my phone to my laptop for a few days.  I find it has a "smart" feature that allows it to send and receive text messages.  Unfortunately, I found it doesn't send and recieve any emails.  In theory, you could send a text to and from your phone without an internet connection.  However, I used my laptop a lot during my week-long visit in NYC, and I didn't see the need for an email client.  It doesn't really do much more than send text messages, so it's pretty much useless for email, but still provides an email address.  Although it is very lightweight, the email doesn't get through.  My advice would be to not use this as a primary cable.  If you want a secondary cable, you'll need to buy a new battery, reattach the battery to your battery and add the battery into your computer or phone.  Alternatively, you can purchase the old battery and reattach it to your computer with a special battery clip.  You should reattach your battery, not use it with your computer.  So, if you have any questions or concerns about this product or you have a bad one, feel free to contact Sony

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product in January of this year and it has stopped functioning.  It was a very nice device.  I had it for 6 months and it was a terrible waste of money.  My phone is now unusable.  This is a very frustrating failure and I would like to try and return it but this item is just not worth the return shipping costs.  The shipping cost is listed at $12.  No way I would pay that in addition to buying a defective product.  At least this is the first unit I purchased

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was defective, and did not work.  A user's manual is not included.  There is no online help, only a single page of user's manuals.  On the one hand, this is not a great device.   On a second hand, I like the fact that I can see what is the device doing and how it works and what it should do.  I was going to purchase the device again, but the user manual is too bad.  What a mess, I purchased it at the Apple store on my way out of the building.  They recommended I just "re-read the manual" before I use it.  This is an expensive device with a confusing user interface.  It just doesn't work. I'm hoping they fix this.  After a little more research, I found a better version that I want to try.  So far, the other reviewer is right about the defective parts

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device to test a CD with a friend who had the same problem. I was able to copy the CD to my own computer and do the tests but it was slow and I noticed it didn't work with other computers. I had to purchase the CD version of the program and run it. After a while of this I decided it was too slow and it wasn't a good product. I used to test it with the CD copy and the program worked on all the computers I tried.  The CD copy worked with the computers when I had the disc.  On the CD the user interface is extremely slow.  My computer was also slow. If I could have tested the CD on my CD copy, I would have been able to have my CD burner to burn the CD and have it work.  But I was told that it is not an option, only on the CD.  When I tested it on my computer, it had a different CD burner.  I can't test the CD now and I would really like it back, just to test the program.  So I had it on the CDs and in the CD changer but it is slow and doesn't work on my PC.  This was my test CD, which I got from a friend

My wife wants to use it, but when I try it on TV, I see that it's just a black and white image, so I can't use it.

My advice is to skip this product.

It worked OK for a long distance phone call when my wife was on the beach with the kids, but with my wife's phone number, the device stopped working after she died.  We called my wife when she was home, and when it didn't work, she got very angry with me for buying it.   She also wanted me to go online and get her number, since the system was broken.  My friend advised her that it had to be her number.  She had her system set to connect to her system, and she found her number from my system, which was wrong

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone requires you to be on speakerphone mode and you cannot select a different channel, nor does it have the ability to select multiple channels.  The microphone is great but unfortunately the speakerphone requires you hold it horizontally, which is cumbersome.  There is not much clarity on the speaker.  It's better at quieter levels than it is in loudness.  But in general, I'd say the phone is OK.  However, there is a built-in speakerphone and this will be a nice feature to have on the commute.  I purchased this model because it is a better unit than the last one I had.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product, and it worked great for about 2 hours of use.  I used the wireless to do everything.  It is not a good product for the majority of the network.  That being said, it worked fine for my home office.  If you use it outside your home office, the wireless gets lost and it just gets worse.  The battery life is not great.  As with most wireless cards I bought, this one worked well when I had to turn it on, but it has trouble staying on in the remote.   This can cause the remote to stop working.  This card does have a few other quirks.  For example, the only way to make the card work outside your house office, you have to be sitting in the driver's seat of your car (on my car) with the remote on you 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The packaging for the product is great, the batteries have very low capacity.  Don't buy batteries of the first battery I received, I'm going to need a second battery for my phone.  I'm now using a "normal" phone.   The manufacturer doesn't seem to acknowledge that there's an issue with my phone, and is still offering the phone with the original battery and not the new.   I got the phone back today, but there's no refund or anything.  They don't respond to e-mails and won't respond in the online forums.  The batteries are great, but the phone software is completely different than the original phone. I've sent emails to several phone-company support agents and they're very difficult to contact.  My phone isn't compatible with the iPod.  It says the app version hasn't been updated for the newer OS, so I have to re-download it on my phone (which can cause a loss of data, of course).  The old software is still installed in my iPhone.  (It's not the same as the old OS, it's the new OS which allows for new phones.) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device does not come with a manual. I ordered it, downloaded, and installed it successfully, but the problem was when I launched the program, it would lock up and not allow me to continue in the program. I had to launch it in a command prompt from a terminal in order to continue. After a couple of minutes of trying to figure out how to get into the program I finally got it to launch. After trying to launch from the command prompt, I noticed that the program is now locked up, not allowing me to see my screen, and after some time, it locked up again. There was no way of getting out of it. After my computer is locked up and I am not connected to the internet, I was unable to get a new license to install the program to my new machine. I got a message that the software is being updated, but I cannot figure out what has changed or if this program is stable on my machine, so I am using it to connect to a local area network (no router) and my printer. The only reason I can run the program at all is because my printer is connected to my computer. I purchased this program from a different site to try and get it working on my new computer. It worked on my old machine when I got it from my previous version. It's now broken, requiring me to get an entire new computer to run. I just wish I had never installed it on my original machine, because I am getting a very frustrating experience from this software. I don't think there are any ways of solving this problem. I can't get a replacement license, nor will I be updating this program for the next version of the software which I will be getting on a new machine from the same vendor. This software does have a user manual, and I downloaded it from the internet and opened it in the same way I did on my previous machine. But after that, the program did not work. After I launched it and saw what the screen looked like, I had an immediate, immediate, and immediate, hard-to-describe experience.  The software is in fact not the same. There is no way to even set the screen as my screen. There are many ways to get to the web page with the program where you can set up an ip address, but in my case, when I tried that, I got an error message stating that it could not load the program without a valid ip address.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product was a total disaster. After 10 or 20 days the sticker came off.  I was able to get it to work, but then I ran into trouble installing all the apps for it.  It doesn't work when you copy and paste a photo into a folder.  The app itself does not work on the phone, and you have to go to each individual app to download a new version to work properly.  If the app has a feature that is not working properly, then the phone will not work in that feature.  But since the "service" itself is working fine, I can't tell if it is a problem with the app or the phone.  So for now, the only way to know is to install the app and use the phone normally and copy and past a photo.  This is not a problem that I have fixed yet, but I will update this review when I have a chance.  Now if you really wanted to have an easy way to copy and modify your photos, you would be using the phone in a manner that would allow you to "re-type" the photo. But I don't think that is a feature the phone supports.  (There were problems with the copy and move functionality of the photos in my notebook, too.) I used a Mac and a PC at work and the copy function worked.  That way, I could have a quick way to move around pictures.  Of course, I had to be careful with the PC because the phone itself did not work with that feature, so I am still working on the Mac version and a Mac-friendly version of the app.  You can read the other negative reviews about other problems with this product:  1.  A bad app. 2.  Doesn't work on a Mac.  Don't get me wrong, it worked fine on a PC.  And the phone works fine in the PC. But for the most part, you have the option to copy a photo, rename a photo or to use a picture as a template for a new photo. So I use the template function on this one everytime.  Unfortunately, it is not the same as the iPhone.  There is no real way to transfer a photo between devices, so it just uses the template functions to copy/move the image.  While this can be helpful, I would rather have the images I want on my PC and the photo in my phone to edit, rather than

After a while I was able to work for several hours with a broken computer.  This is a cheap piece, I have to write with it all the time.  I have had many issues with the software, such as changing the font, which crashes frequently, and there are no other controls for the keyboard.  It has been inoperable for me for years.  There are no support files available for this piece, nor are there any manuals for the computer.The software for the machine has been upgraded several times and the problems keep getting worse.   This piece requires a battery, but not the one provided.  The battery has degraded to the point of no longer working.  When I bought it, I had this instruction manual and it is not updated with all of the latest updates and features.  In addition, I purchased a USB disk from Amazon for this machine and had trouble getting it to work on my computer.When I tried to print a document, I found it to have a lot of problems printing documents correctly.  Some documents didn't print at all, and the only way to print is with the Windows program, which uses this manual, and a Windows XP CD burner.  My printer was a total waste of money on this machine.I am currently using Windows 2000.  For most people, this isn't a machine that is useful 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I did not like the buttons, they were hard to press.  I purchased another unit from Amazon.  In case you are interested in a model, there is a comparison chart for all the different models that was found in the manual.  One button is on the top row and the second button in the lower row, and the third button on the back of the top line and on the bottom line.  Also, the "Home" button is not a good choice for the button on your home screen.  The home button buttons are on the left and right sides of your screen, so that can easily become a dead button if you push with the remote in the wrong direction.  If you have problems with your remote, the instructions say to move the buttons to the right or left.  You will also have to press the "reset" button on that top row to reset the buttons.  All of these buttons need to be pressed together to reset your home button.  There is a problem with these buttons.My first unit did not have an Internet connection.  On my second unit, I purchased an Internet access card.  A quick search for Internet access at this address shows that it has a "bug" that prevents Internet connection, so this card is not functional.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have only used it for a short while, which I was quite surprised by as it did not work.  The problem was with the battery itself, not with the radio.  I used the radio to find a new battery, which worked just fine, but the battery was too weak.  Since the battery did not give me the capacity to store the radio, I had to turn the radio on, which did not function.  A battery pack would be a much better purchase.  Unfortunately, I still have not recieved the battery, and the radio function is still not working with this device, and I am awaiting a new one 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's nice, but I'd just as soon not use it because I'm not a big fan of it. It doesn't support HD video (in my case), which was a bummer.I tried a different model, but it worked fine. I tested out of my home office, with my iPhone, and the same thing worked.  I tested it in my office, a small dining area with plenty of room.  But my boss complained about it, because he wanted to watch some TV.  This thing is too much for his workstation 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My daughter has the "default" settings (which is what I got). My wife loves this thing and has some issues with it. But she likes it better than the one she used previously (which also was with a "noise" filter). But she wants the noise on both. And now she has the same problem with it! It appears that the noise filter is supposed to prevent me from using the "noisy" radio mode (which requires a password to switch). The settings were supposed to be on by default but the problem seems to have persisted. I have no idea what is causing it. So now, for the "low signal" mode, which has no "noisiness filter", I have to change all the buttons (which require a password) to disable.  I have given up on the "main" menu. I am returning mine today! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My husband bought a bad e-card that didn't work right.   The card was not charged at all when we purchased it and the battery failed to work properly.  We couldn't use this card for any of the games we purchased and some of the discs didn't even work right with it.  (I know the games had their own issues with the card.)  This is a cheap card, but I can't see how it could work properly with some games.  After we tried to charge it the card went in and out of use and sometimes the software would just refuse to run correctly with a low battery (the "inactive" mode.)  I know a lot of the software doesn't work on a low-battery state.  So, even with some of our games, it doesn't really work like you would expect with the proper settings.  I was planning to return the card, and it would be nice to get some more feedback from Nintendo before we make another purchase.  It's still a cheap-looking card and it doesn'sy have all the features you'd need.  If I had purchased this card at retail, I would have to call a friend to send us the cartridge to play the games

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing broke the first day and stopped functioning.  I just had to figure out how to get my iPod back online by downloading a new firmware.  It worked, but after that, the screen would randomly go blank and stay blank.  At that point, I decided to just keep my iPod on it's own until the battery started dying.  Once I had the screen back, I went back to my Mac.  Then, I started using my Mac and my music disappeared.  The problem persisted.  After my Mac got back online, I would get the screen blank and the iPod would function.  But I would need to download a new iTunes firmware.I am not recommending that anyone go through this whole ordeal.  This iPod needs some serious work.  You'll have to figure it out yourself.  My advice is that you try and buy new iPods from the iTunes store and see if this works.  Even though I have a lot of music and movies, I am having trouble locating the ones I do have on my Mac for review.  So, in the meantime, I have downloaded other iPods and tried getting online.  When I used it online, the iPod came online, but the screen is not working at all with it.  Apple support does have the ability to change the firmware for any of my iPods, but they won't tell you how.  Also, Apple has no plans for the new iPod version to fix the screen problems.  In fact, in December, I bought a new iPod and the screen was still blank.This iPod does work as advertised, and does not work with any other iPod I have that does not have its own screen.  If you want to transfer songs to and from your Mac, there are only 3 possible ways - you can use iTunes, you can transfer your iPod from a Mac that has no iPod software, or you can copy the songs and the firmware. I purchased the firmware to transfer my iPod software.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received a replacement for my laptop (as advertised) that is in poor condition.  It had a lot of issues I had already dealt with before I purchased the computer.  I tried all of the settings that I'd previously tried before but now had a problem with my clock, the camera and the camera card, the screen and the DVD player.  If I have my mouse set to turn on the power, I'll get to the system and see what the problem is.  The DVD player and its settings are of the old design and the menu is a bit different.  When I set up the laptop, I see some strange menus.  Some of the buttons do not work and some of the menu items take a long time to load.  While these problems were minor, I was disappointed to receive a new computer. This new system has a lot better features than the one I received previously.  But it is also a lot slower and it's buggy.  However, I had to buy a replacement laptop because the last system had been replaced with a new motherboard.  Now I am trying to get my PC set up on a different machine that works.  So far I've tried the PC and a Windows 8 PC with no luck.  All of this has been frustrating but I will update this review as soon as I have it set up.I was hoping for more of a support option.  Unfortunately, I have not received a response from Tech Support or anyone else for this product.  Perhaps the issues I have have with it are because it was purchased through Amazon's website and then returned to me as a damaged device.  Amazon doesn't have a product page for this laptop and I don't know if Amazon will support a product that's received through Amazon.  This laptop is also not listed on the website.  Apparently Amazon does not have it listed for sale anywhere or if they do, it is currently sold out.  That is a pretty major flaw.  What a waste of $80 on a bad system.  As far as I can tell, Amazon is going to have it available for purchase from other vendors or on Amazon.com.  My experience with this product has been horrible and Amazon needs to be much more helpful and responsive.  Hopefully, Amazon will fix these issues.  For example, I purchased an older model with a different manufacturer and the battery was still the same.   So I tried setting up the system again,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is decent but I wouldn't buy it for long trips, it works poorly in the car and the Bluetooth antenna has no signal strength.  The handset is also very hard to use and the buttons sometimes don't work or you may need a specific handset button for your specific network.  If you get the wireless signal from a network that works, it will take you to a webpage to enter credentials and, if the network does not support an Android device, you'll get a bad website to log in with.  But if you've installed the app and are trying to log into the website, the phone won't recognize that the password you entered is the same password used to log the other way around.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is slow, and when it is powered up it has to be switched on every 60 seconds, every 5 hours.  This means that you have to wait 3-5 hours for each charge (assuming you are not using another battery).  The charger is much faster than the original, but does have an internal charger with 10-12V.  It works with the original battery only, and uses the new charging cable, which works okay for the new battery.  If you plug the old one in and switch the batteries it works fine, but if you use another cable it does not charge and will not switch the charger from the other battery. So if you want to switch batteries between charges it is necessary to unplug the original charger before plugging in the new one.  For the original (without the charging cable) the charger does work fine with the battery it came with.  The battery has a good performance and the battery compartment can store several hours of power, but this is still too slow for daily use

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased two and had to get two new batteries to work for my wife. I was able to get her to turn on the radio, but I couldn't get in touch with her. It works, but it's not a simple radio. It requires a lot of work to tune out the station. So the radio is useful, but not great. It doesn't work with FM. This product is a very good radio for the price. I would rate it at around a 3 on the Audio Audio Quality scale, but for the station it's fine. I don't like the station, but this is a good radio to use. I do have to tune in the radio and get my wife's attention because the station has a lot more stations than the other radio in the house. I used to have it in my car for a while, but then I took it out, changed the station from AM, to AM and back to AM. I had no problems tuning in and out.I purchased the radio to have in my office in the car, but the radio antenna didn't work that well.  I have a friend that has a station for us in town and I'm hoping to make a connection

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm a huge disappointment!  It works fine when the TV is off, but the picture quality is poor even when it is on.  When I tested the TV, I had to turn on the DVD.  The DVD player, while fast, worked very slow.  However, it does have a feature that allows you to switch it to a "movie mode" that lets you watch the movies that are stored on the TV.  This is handy when the movies are "cancelled" because it allows you and the TV to switch through each other's movies while you watch.  But when you watch movies, I have to switch the TV back to normal, turn off the DVD player and the DVD and DVD player must be reset, and then on again, and so on...  I do this twice a day, to keep the TV and DVD from running out of money.  I have the TV "reset" with the DVD on a couple of times a day and "set" to the "movie" mode, but this seems to do no good.  It has to be reset and reset again every time the TV comes up to find out if the "movies" are there, because the player is programmed to only watch "mixed" movies...  The player also seems to not pick up any "moved-back" movies.  And when the player turns it on, it only recognizes "moves back" movies on the disc that are not on it.  As far as I could tell, there is no such feature for the DVDs.  So the TV doesn't work well with the "regular" movies you might find on the same disc.  Even if you have an open DVD player (as I do) and watch some of the movies on there, the TV will often reset.  For some reason, the DVD is loaded with a warning that it may be misaligned and the discs are "unlikely to align accurately when you burn them."  (This is a small red X on each disc in the middle of the disc.)  The TV also sometimes freezes up (as it did the first time I tried it).  I don't use this feature much because I rarely watch movies that have been cancelled or moved backwards.  At times it works (I have been able to "rescue" the DVD).  But other times, when the disc is opened and it's been programmed to watch the "cancel
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a replacement for a broken USB port.  It worked great, but I have it out to make sure the USB is not a problem.  If you do not have it connected and the machine still works, you can make it work with the original USB port, and the same problems will occur. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device has an unusable dial.  It has a broken ring.  I have used the same dial since the device came out.  You can not access the "Toggle dial" feature on your handset, unless you use the correct phone setting (which requires you to type in the number) and this also has been a problem with both handsets.  When I type in numbers, it works and when I type text, I have a problem finding the numbers, either because it won't display or because I'm having difficulty typing.  Both handsets have the same issue.  This is a software issue, not a hardware issue.My advice is to avoid buying this handset and avoid the device.  My recommendation to customers is that they take the device back if they purchased it and not to buy this handset

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After installing this driver on my laptop, it failed to recognize my ipod nano. The ipod mini had a small scratch on the bottom of the screen, but was otherwise well-constructed.  I had it for 2 days and the screen seemed to recognize the ipod ninty-1-20.  The computer had no internet access and no printer, nor a cdrom with my documents.  It did recognize my pc and my ipaq, but they were not connected to the internet.  This system was very slow and had a bug that I could not get rid of.  My ipaq had not been assigned an IP address on the internet, which I had to manually do with the ipaq service manual, although it worked on the ipods that came to my house from Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The packaging did not come with any instructions, so I had to learn how to use it.  For example, it has to be used with an external monitor and keyboard, because when you insert the adapter into a USB slot, it doesn't work.  The adapter also can't be plugged into a laptop.  So for the adapter, you have to be in Windows XP/Vista/7, and the USB ports on the adapter can't even be used.  You may need to install it into your laptop first, in which case you may have to reinstall it.The adapter's documentation also says that the USB port doesn't have to function, and doesn't include an online version that can be used to get software for the phone or computer.  Apparently, this adapter is meant for devices with an "X" in their model number.  I tried the adapter with a PC, but that model number has not yet appeared on the web.  Microsoft's support support page for Windows XP lists only the "X's" in the adapter model.  But Microsoft has no other support page.  A representative at Microsoft told me that the manufacturer has stopped making this adapter.  That doesn't bode well for Windows users who just bought it and installed it from the vendor's site.  It seems that this is what's wrong with the USB adapter, rather than the phone's firmware, although I'm not sure why it didn't work with the phone.  If you're having any problems, you can ask a Microsoft tech support technician to help you install the adapter on your PC

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because the "gift certificate" included an authorization for a "very limited number of uses" and for "limited time period."  In addition to that, the certificate has no expiration date and thus, can be used in any number of purchases.  I believe that it is valid for a year and a day or, at least, a period of use during that period.  It's clearly not a renewal of the certificate or a replacement of the gift, but a way to get around the restriction imposed by the gift certificate and not having the certificate expire.  The certificate also allows me to make a number of "subsequent purchases" of this gift, which is exactly what I did

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this one after I found a video clip with the same content as the picture.  I am not pleased with this product at all.  The user interface, while not the best, is not very user friendly.  Some of the features were very difficult to configure.  When I tried to use the internet, I got an error message from my internet service provider.  One of the other features (the ability to play movies with the menu system) was very limited.  It requires an internet connection for every feature (which I have a network of), it does not offer any support for DVD discs.  If you want to use this feature, you will need to enter the correct information on the DVD menu (the menu does not work in Windows 7).  It will allow you to change a setting that requires the menu to use up to eight DVD's instead of eight pictures.  On top of that, I discovered that the menu did not support the ability to edit movies.  This feature works on the first four movies, but does not allow editing them.  Also, the software for these movies has the ability for a user to change the quality and settings of the DVD (the software allows for any setting, but can't modify the picture).  There is a manual that has a lot of typos and information that is outdated.  Unfortunately, it did contain a few instructions, and it worked on the Windows XP (my computer) for about a month.  However, after I updated the software, I found that this product does not use the newest version of the user interface.  They still have a lot left to improve.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried it, and it is very slow. I am not a big fan, it just doesn't have the ability to download anything. The only time I can get things to go, it says "unable to find an acceptable configuration" on the computer. In addition, it is also impossible to get the program set up to work as I am currently using it. In other words, it appears that this system is not compatible with the CD, and the CD is not in a way compatible with any of the disks. The computer requires the CD drive, which is also incompatible with the disks with the computer and the software set up. In my opinion, this is very problematic because it makes it nearly impossible to find any data on the CD that will allow this system to operate. The software only works for the CD because of the CD's capabilities. I don't want to use the disk because I've done this several times already, and if I put the disk in the computer the system won't recognize it. I also tried downloading the contents, but the program is not very responsive to the disks or CD. I will be putting this CD into my CD player next to the CD burner and using that as my CD drive.I think the best option would be to purchase a CD/DVD for my computer and CD/disc holder. This system works as a CD or DVD but the software doesn't function with the CDs in this system. I tried, but I couldn't figure out the CD driver so the CD won't work. If you don't have a CD to burn with the software, you will not have the CD set up for the computer to get set up as I need it to work with the disk and the disks that are connected to the computer, it will not run with the set up with the DVD. This requires the computer have the DVD player in and the computer set it up on the DVD, but no disc for the computers on the network. I've been looking for a solution and I can't seem to find it.It's a total waste of my time and money, it seems like a total piece of junk.If the CD/DRO disk does work on the system, the software only recognizes it and won't find anything on the disk or disc. There was a CD burner, so I did set that on fire but it will burn the CD on the discs.The CD does not work with any disk without a CD drive (in
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with the quality.  My laptop worked perfectly, but it had a very weak processor and a very slow network connection.  I used the web browser to load web pages; the same thing works just fine.  All in all, a bad machine.  But I did use it one time and it works well enough, at least on certain websites, such as google.  That is one way to get the web going with the device.  If you have a faster connection, there are many more web pages that require more computing power.  And on some of the pages the browser has problems loading the entire page and does not display the results of the web page, leaving you in a virtual browser screen.  One of the few positives was that my browser displayed some information that other laptops had, such the manufacturer's name and the type of device.If you do not know what is causing this problem and need a replacement, this is a good thing.  It is possible that this problem is affecting other laptops.  The web page loading problem is probably caused by the way the hardware is designed, and it is not fixed by changing the operating system or anything.  (There is a link to a forum with support for the operating systems, which might be helpful, although I had problems finding this particular product.)I have the same problem.  This time I did not buy a replacement for my laptop because I did this on a trial basis.  Still, you can get the same information on the web that you can with other laptops, so if you do use a computer, make sure you are aware of what the operating instructions say and how the system operates.  You can see this in the link to the forum.  They seem to be in good shape, but have not been tested.  Be aware that I have had problems with this product, as well.  On the first run, I could not get it to load some web pages, but this may be because it was installed from a disk image on my desktop.  There is also a problem with the OS, which allows you to get into a browser with the screen zoomed in and in, so the screen becomes a bit smaller.  At least if you have the zoom turned on, the system does not use a bootloader or the OS.If there is an operating system with this problem, there is not a fix yet.  In the meantime, I am stuck with a

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device worked fine and worked great for a few days.  Then I had a lot of problems installing the driver or the updates.  I had to uninstall the driver several times.  The updates would sometimes work but the driver wouldn't.  At first, I thought it might have been a bug in the update program, but it would sometimes do the driver upgrade while the app was open and the update would fail.  When I reinstalled the app, the driver was available but I had the same problem.  After a few minutes I thought I would need to remove the app altogether because the driver would be installed even after the app is closed.  But then the same thing happened.  This is not a software bug but a bug with the OS itself.I am considering replacing it with another device and trying to do an OS install in the same manner I had with my other devices.  My system is much slower than the other systems I have and there is a lot less RAM available for applications. I haven't tested the driver for Windows XP but I thought Windows XP was not very reliable on this particular model.I did experience several crashes when I tried to transfer files between this and my other PCs.  And one time my system froze up while I was installing the OS (I could not restore my backup files or reset the system).  This has made me very frustrated.  There are a few other problems that have caused problems like having to use different drivers for the different PCs and Windows XP.  It works fine with some programs (like the ones that I had that were supposed to come with the device).  I would be very disappointed if I paid $20.00 for this device because this is what I have purchased for a Windows XP operating system.  Microsoft, you had better have a fix ready.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing that worked correctly (or at least worked for me) was my phone number.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If this device works with my old iPod I am out of luck.  I had a similar problem and my iPod died after 6 months.  There was a large screen and small buttons and a big iPod icon, and it had some kind of button for accessing the map (on the upper left hand corner).  I did not find the map.  It is not currently compatible with this version.  (I did find a smaller screen on my other iPhone, but the map was not compatible with that).  There is no phone app for this app or this version of the app

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the box, however, after I received it I saw the front cover had the manufacturer's sticker, but I was told by the person I spoke to at the other end that I needed to remove this sticker before use, which I did with no problem. However, the back cover didn't have the sticker (it has a green sticker instead) so I will have to order the back-cover sticker separately. After removing the sticker, the front and back cover are identical, and it still says, "VIA AIRMAIL" instead of "VISA." I have read reviews from people who say the sticker doesn't work in their bank account number. I have checked with my bank, and the sticker works fine.  I also have read that you can buy "back-cover" stickers on Amazon.com.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If I use the 'auto' mode in this model, it works great. However, it will require updating the system to the'manual' mode.I did update the firmware, but I am stuck with the software. So, now I have a new problem.I used to get some 'auto-play' or'manually' to get the system into play mode. Now I need the new version for my 'auto mode' and the 'play' mode, but no one has it.I bought a copy from Amazon. I have tried updating the 'user manual' which says that 'this manual is out of date and out of use' and 'do not use' unless you have updated the system.The manual is so poorly written and has a few typos.The system still has the same basic function as the old manual. However the manual has a couple more typos and does not contain the necessary functions for using the system without the 'new' 'auto+manual mode' option.The new manual has the necessary instructions and features for the 'old''manmode' but does not mention 'auto+. This is what the user manual says, "This new manual contains some new features. You will need it to set up your system."I also installed some new programs onto my system. This worked fine, but is not included in the 'automatic' menu.I have not updated my system since the first time I installed. This is a serious inconvenience and I have purchased two systems. The manuals do not contain any additional features, so now I will be installing a new system and manually configuring it to get it into play.This is not the user-friendly software I thought I had purchased. I was hoping that it would be a good replacement for my old manual, but it is not. The system comes with no manual for the auto+manually modes.This system has some other design problems. It is difficult to figure out what is in each of the settings. There are a lot of options, but when I tried them, the system could not handle my computer's CPU at all. If it crashed in the software or had problems in the operating system, I would have to install a system which had only the auto mode and manual, so that I could then figure out the problems in this version of the software

This is the worst thing I have ever purchased.  There are other items that I have to pay for at each transaction.  The only reason this particular item is offered is because the website has not updated the product description since July 2014.  In the meantime the original description still exists.   There is a lot of info for the unit on the internet that makes me think the customer service reps are still making this up.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm happy with the other reviews. Good stuff, but I ordered about a week after launch. The problem was that I wanted to order something else in my order. It was still in stock, so I bought it. After a month of use, my device began to work great again, but now my device is very slow, it will only download files in increments of 2GB. I had to update the firmware to get it up to speed again. It does have some great features, but in the end I just couldn't take the hassle of updating it myself. So I've got my next order coming. I guess it's better to buy now, than risk it running out of juice again after a while 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As a person who has owned and used this device for a year now, I can't say it works right. I bought a second device, bought a different router, bought new internet and now there's been no improvement.   I've tried a number of times, the same thing just doesn't work.  I bought this thing because I had to buy a second router.  It's not fast.  But the fact that I bought the second router and bought a third router this past week, which is what I used this past Saturday.  The thing I purchased is the wrong model.  My friends and I used it.  There was no way to upgrade from that model with the router I bought.  We were able to download the firmware.  That firmware was in a separate card and we were able download the update.  (I think I'm going to get a new router to use next week as well)  But this new device, which uses the same router, did not work at all.  And this thing is slower than the old model, too.  So, yes, I have my router, but it does not work.

The phone works but does not come with a keyboard.The OS does not function on XP.I have been troubleshooting this phone, and it works fine but it is an exercise in frustration.I can not recommend this phone.If you are looking to buy a phone that works with XP, I recommend going through Microsoft, as some of the users on my XP system have had problems.The operating system is more of a gateway, so you can install any of your own applications (you must have at least one).The phone is just not well designed. It is not user friendly. There is no menu or settings that help me do things.For example, on the web you can type in anything you want. You cannot find your phone menu or even the dialpad.There is no keyboard on the phone so I had to write messages on the back of the phone. I am not sure how this phone is going to work on all your applications. There are no applications to install.If I was looking for a good device to use for this phone it would not be a good option 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this phone to use in a movie theater to watch the first 2 movies I saw after purchasing it. The first film had a good quality picture with the audio and picture quality that would be good for watching DVDs. I use this phone now to call in work. I bought a different phone for my vacation, and my wife was so furious with this phone that she told me it was defective. The screen is only partially lit, and when I tried to use the feature to "reset", I got an error message about my phone not being supported in China. I guess the feature is only available on certain models.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The instructions for each unit, in particular the 'installation instructions' contain several typographical errors that prevent successful installation.  I am returning the unit today.  The original instructions that came with the unit stated that the system would install automatically with all the standard Windows updates, and would need to be reinstalled.  Unfortunately, I did not see any of the required updates in Windows Update since installation of the system was supposed to have been automatic.  In the case of my model, the installation of one or more updates took considerably longer than required.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i purchased this card for my father when we went on vacation to Miami.  It is slow and does not work with the older software versions.  This model was sold before the older versions of the software.  The new version of the system does work with older versions, but there is a warning message on the older version saying it does not support earlier versions of Windows that do not have the.NET Framework 1.1.  So there is only one version of Windows to go with this system, so you are stuck with a system that is not compatible with older software. I am not sure what the problem is with that version.  If you use this system with a client that does support earlier version of windows, it has to be loaded with an older version of.NET framework.  As with any software product, make sure you install the client in a way that will preserve the system configuration.  We also ran into some problems with some of our older applications.  One application (GIFs) was not compatible.  I tried installing it in a Windows server and we got it working on the desktop but we could not get the.Net framework to run on it.  A second application (photo libraries) was also not compatible, as was the.net framework.If you do use the older system with your clients, you will have to load the.GIF and photo libraries separately from the system.  With a desktop client, you can't make the.MSI installer install the applications that have the missing components.  You have to use the client to install the operating system.The.NET version of this system does support the older Windows versions, as did earlier versions, so if you have trouble using older applications with the.IO framework, use the Windows Server as a back up system to save your clients.This system does not have any version of Microsoft's web server installed.  There is no web server for client programs.If the older OS version of your clients does not boot properly, you must reset the registry and/or use the software update from Microsoft that came with the system, or the client will not boot.This is a new and unsupported system.I purchased this system only because I wanted a new card.  And I did not want to upgrade the OS.  My father's card works fine.The cards worked fine with previous Windows versions on our system. The only reason this card did not work was because the driver was a

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There's no easy to use software. Don't bother buying this version as this was the first to be released.The first software was great, but this latest release is very buggy. The menu would hang up or fail to load sometimes. Also, the software is not compatible with the iPhone 4 or iPhone 5. The first version was compatible with all phones. The second version was not. The third version works with a little bit of the iPhone, but is not an iOS app.This is a very basic, but functional version. This software has a lot of bugs and a lot more work for the user to do with the phone than the iPhone 3. If you really like using the iPhone 5, you should uninstall it. The battery is rated for only 20% of the battery capacity. I have it set for 20% and can get through an entire day's battery charge in a little over a day. There is a new phone model coming out soon, but the version it uses is just a download from the iTunes app store, so not compatible.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not really looking for an audio player for my iPod, I'm looking for a "quick player" as it were. This unit has a small "dial" that uses a single click to select songs in the menu. You can skip songs by long pressing a button or holding down the shift key.  You can use the "record" function to play a CD, although it has the potential to be slower than the iPod.  One other problem: the iPod screen is very dark and is only readable from below, which makes the iPod cumbersome to use.  The screen is large but you have to squint to read the screen.  My husband says this unit was good at first, but that it stopped working well in later software revisions.  I was able to reset it but it does not seem to have had any new software since its initial release.  This unit is quite a few years old and, in spite of the hardware problems, I haven't really seen the iPod with an iPod interface.  There are only 4 GB of memory.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these in the UK and it has been in my UK passport. The UK and Europe both have a special format for the passport. I have to wait for the next passport to pick up the same model. The other passports just use an older model that is out of date. I do not get the UK passport so that I can get the new version of these. I bought the new passport with my old passport and the US and EU models. I still got the UK version. It seems to be updated with the same old software as the US. It says the date of the last passport update is on the back. The new software does not have a date.I was very disappointed when I downloaded these for the US, Europe, and UK and found that the date was not listed on the package itself, nor was there an option to update. The software is very old and requires an upgrade for any of the software on the phone.I checked to see if there is an option in the US or UK for updating software. I didn't find it. I found the option for software updates, but it didn't work on any of these three versions. I returned all of these items for full refund. I can say that the software is old and the phone is very slow. In a few months, I may return the original US passport and see if I can find the updated software, or try getting the software from another company. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit is of much better quality than the advertised model, which should be good for many hours of playback.  It is however, much slower than the original.  The new firmware also uses "fast playlists" that are more accurate.  However, the new player works with some older files, such as those for Windows XP, although this may be a bug with the software, which causes the game to stop responding to other players.  After upgrading to Windows XP using the old firmware, it no longer works with any version of Windows.  This is a minor inconvenience, but I'd recommend upgrading anyway, just to be safe.  When I did my upgrade, it used the old player for about a month, then it worked fine for several months.  Then, it suddenly stopped working entirely, requiring a full upgrade.  There was no indication that the new firmware was released as a "bug fix" for any of the game or user interface problems.  I'd suggest getting another unit from a retail store to try and use it with older games and applications for several more months, but if you decide to use it after upgrading it, you need to go through the installation process all over again.  Although the original version worked fine with a wide range of programs, my copy still didn't work with the Xbox 360 web interface.  Microsoft said it was a temporary thing.  If you are still having problems after the upgrade, get another copy of the same game.  You can get the old version back from the web interface if you wish.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a "check your account" function and you can't set any user settings with the new version.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My son did the exact same thing, and it got him into a lot of trouble in school. He kept going back to get the CD player (for which he could not use the feature to access the game because the CD was too small). The CD player can only hold a certain number of games, and when he tried to find games that would not take up space, he found that some would work, but others would not. His school made its own copy of the game, so he could play it if he really wanted, but if he wanted to play the CD, he had to use the CD changer at home to copy the CD. There were so many bugs with this player and it's not even a usable player to play a CD. The CD changers only worked for CD-ROMs. I am going to buy a CD changesto copy some games I have on CD for use at home. I have just purchased two CD games I purchased at a friend's house, and the CD-CDROMs only work on the CD (not the CD ROMs). This game works fine with a CD-DROM for the PC, but with a DVD player it does not work

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got the unit working fine, but the only way to get it working is to remove the battery and plug it into the wall, which you have to do after every two hours of operation. There are lots of problems with this unit. The power button works intermittently and the volume is too high for a normal home audio system. It may be fine for my car, but I couldn't get it to work for my laptop. It's also too small to hold a lot of audio inputs at once.I did this twice.I tried it in the car, and it worked, but it didn't work in the house.It worked fine in my car -- it worked for about 20 minutes on and off, but after that, it went dead.The problem is that it doesn't have a battery indicator. The battery is useless for most of its life and it works only when the battery is out. It uses a flat battery charger that runs only the same number of times as the unit.This battery has no user manual -- the unit can be used as a normal battery. (There's a manual in the booklet.) I bought it on the internet.It has a flat charger for the phone and a flat charging station for the tablet. The charging station has a "back-up" button -- it works great for a tablet, but doesn't support the phone. The charger works fine for the laptop (which is fine, though, if the tablet is in a different position from the phone), but it has to be plugged into the USB port. If you don't know how to do that, you can buy a replacement battery on Amazon or a second one on the web.I have a friend with an older tablet (this one) and it was fine with this one. I got it on Amazon, as the manual says, but couldn't find anything about how to make a battery out of the battery compartment. It says it doesn and will charge any flat battery.I bought a new battery and a new manual to work with the laptop. Both manuals mention this.On the tablet, the tablet has two buttons -- one of them uses the volume up/down button. The volume has to go all the way up in order to get the unit to work. I used that to navigate. On the phone, the unit has a button to switch between the tablet and the phone -- a second button uses the screen brightness, but otherwise it's very similar.There is nothing

I have used my computer to write this review about three times since buying the new battery.  So what was the point of buying another battery when my last battery failed after about 2.5 weeks

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is a total bust in my car.  I tried to set up my printer, which worked great, but then started to print and got a warning message.  The printer is just not designed for a Mac.  Now, I had a chance to check it out and was able to get some work done with it.  Then I had some issues and it would not work properly.  This printer is not an improvement over the other, so I am going to wait for my $20 shipping to be refunded.  In the meantime, I purchased another printer, but I had not been able to set it up, as it was out of warranty.  So I was able get some more work done, but it did not work correctly either 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing has an LCD and an infrared controller.  One of the buttons is the size of a pen, one is the same size as the LCD.  I could not set it up to work.  The LCD is much larger than I expected.   I also used it to make a movie (which did not work) and had it installed in the plane, but not my home TV.  It will be a hassle for me to troubleshoot the problem.  My wife's TV works fine.  In the airplane, when the TV is in a window, there is a lot of interference with the screen.  You have to adjust it back to where it should be set up.  So I'm now returning this product.  There was no manual for it, no manual included with the shipment, so I have no idea what this is supposed to do.  But it does work.The only reason I ordered it was because it is listed in the inventory as being in stock 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used it only once for my own use and I thought it was great, but I bought the manual for my laptop and it told me to buy an additional CD for my "personal" copy.  I bought a copy with my own personal copy, which works great, and I will be using this on my laptop for the "personal copy".  After trying out this method, I have found that it is not very user-friendly and it will crash after one or two uses of the cd.  If this works out, I can always get another cd and it won't crash.  But, with this version of the computer, I could not get it to be a good printer.  On my "CD" copy, the "print menu" and printer "controls" have buttons for copying the CD and printing the printed pages, but when I tried the printer I got a blue-screen error.  The "print menus" for each CD do not work.  (I checked the instruction manual and it says that I need a CD to print the CD cover

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It has to be used as a battery, not as a charger (this is a major drawback).  In my opinion, this battery is very slow, I have seen it charge and drain very slowly in a 3.5V/1.8V mode.  This is due to the poor design of the battery.   The design is very poor (the tabs are poorly glued together), the battery is too small and the battery has too low a voltage.  The batteries are not compatible with iPods, iPods Touch, or any iPhone or iPod (with the exception of the newest version of the Apple iPad).   I have had two of the new iPods with this battery, and I have also tested the battery with other devices, and the other devices I tested were no better. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone as a new phone and after 2 months my number worked, but I was unable to get it back once I had registered. My phone was then not supported by an update and I received an auto-response that my phone number was not valid. It is unclear if it is valid or not at this time. I have used my existing card with this phone in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My biggest complaint is that it doesn't have a clear plastic cover, like all the other models I have.  Also, as others have stated, it's hard to install the app on this device.  My device was a great piece, but was just too clunky, and didn't work well with a big screen.  The most frustrating thing, I bought one of the same devices two years ago, and the app still doesn't work.  It's not that it has a firmware bug, but the user interface isn't fully compatible with a 4-inch screen.A few months ago, Apple made the mistake of releasing the software for this version to the market.  This was the only version of this app I can find.  Perhaps Apple has plans to produce the app for the "full" version of the phone.  I'll keep looking for other versions of the app.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone is a pain in the *** when connected to a computer it is very unreliable and slow.  I purchased this phone as a Christmas present for my son and he broke the phone within 2 months of its release and replaced it with a brand new unit.  This has since broken as well.   It works well on a desktop.  However, its battery life is very poor and I have to charge it once a day.  In the meantime, I have the unit on and it gives me the option to use the internet but the phone has a built in modem that will not work with my home network.  It is an internet only device that I use to access my personal web page.  The unit can also be used to access web-based games or other functions that my son has on the phone.  After a while, I noticed that the software had a lot of troubles, I decided not to purchase it again.  When I tried to purchase another unit I received an email from Amazon apologizing for not selling it to the customer.  Apparently they had a defective device that had been sent out to all their new and returning customer's 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone for an  unrelated (personal) use in a business call, to which  I had no answer.  I ended up sending it back to Sony after getting my  answers from a knowledgeable person on the phone.   Sony's  website for this phone states that the operating system is the same  as it was for my  personal phone.So if this is a problem that has been going on for  a very long time, and the phone was designed with some of my  data in the wrong place, then I don't know how they can fix this  problem without adding an upgrade.  But Sony won't do it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i would suggest getting an upgrade of some sort that works without needing to reset the router and re-installing it (this doesn't seem to have happened as yet, the firmware is a beta).This router is good for about 6 years, and has been a pain in the ass to get all its features working on all systems (I have tried two of its previous versions to get it up and running, and still can't get it to update the web. It won't update the other system in use). It is very slow to get updates through the web interface (I've had to go to the manual to look it up), so I need to do a lot of tinkering with it.I think I will upgrade it in the future (I haven't found a new web interface yet), but it is likely to get updated eventually. This has been an awful, miserable experience. I have installed some beta versions of it, but I've also found that the new firmware for the router (version 2.6) doesn't work with the newer devices, and the web server is very buggy.  This is the worst update, I believe, I have yet to try to install.This is the point in the review where the user asks, "why don't you just buy a new router? 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We were not pleased with this item, it does not work in all countries.  We got some of the original box back for our own testing and it works.  The original packaging was designed for a 16x10 monitor (as we understand) but the 16x12 is not an option.  On the box, the instruction manual is in Korean.  Although it does have some English and a few pictures of the monitor, we were hoping for an English manual.  In fact, the instructions for the monitor are in Korean but I am not sure of the layout.  I'm assuming the manual is meant for Korean users.    The manufacturer's website is broken (only English and Korean). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The radio is very slow. It is possible that this device would not work for the majority of my clients.  The client's radio frequencies are assigned by the radio manufacturer, and are not available for my clients' stations.  I contacted Radio Radio Japan and they confirmed that they do not have my clients stations available.  In addition, the client's radios have a "dumb" FM radio that works in conjunction with the main radio.  This is not an improvement.  These are poor radios designed for my client's stations.My clients' radios operate only in the area around their homes, and this requires them to operate from their own home base, which requires frequent switching.  While in operation, the radio frequency must be adjusted from one frequency to another.  Changing from one radio to another requires a manual transmission.  Since the radio's frequency must always be changed, this makes radio frequency "dynamic" in operation.  It will not work as a replacement for the main FM radio, even though the main receiver functions as a "sub" when the main radios are in use.  To get my clients to use the radio as a regular FM radio I need to set them up with the receiver in the "sub," a function that the main receivers do not support.I have sent these radios to the Radio Technology Center of JAPAN for technical review.  They may need to be redesigned.  So far I have not received a reply.  Radio Japan claims that they will not support my client radios in Japan for sale or service

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very satisfied with the device until I got it.  After installing it and then updating the firmware, it now has the option for both wireless and wired internet access, with a separate password for each.  The main interface is similar, though.  It has a small button at the bottom of the browser and one or two at the top of the page.  I've tested the web browser several times and all the results are good (the web page will load faster and use less memory than the other).  If the browser is the default browser for all sites, the web pages may load slowly.  If you visit the site using wireless, you'll see a message "Web site has been down for some time" and a reset is necessary.  You can reset your wireless to its default setting with the reset key on the device and use the new password for web access.  However, it will not allow you to visit sites that require a password.  This was a minor problem for me, but is very common.  One of the pages on this device requires you to register.  Once registered, it can only be accessed with the default login and password.I tried the device on two of the internet-connected computers, both of which came up with a large browser window, but both windows opened up to the main browser windows and the pages did not load smoothly or use more than 60% of the memory.  My main computer was the slowest and the password was not recognized.  Even though the password may be set to a unique name and not a number, the device does not permit multiple user accounts.  A password reset did not help. The password reset option was "factory reset".  It did not remove the old password.To make matters worse, I had a password for the web-based registration system that failed, too.  On the main screen, I could now see the registration password and reset it to reset the registration for the rest of the web site.  Again, this worked, but did not work with any of the other web sites.I installed the router on my home network and tried to connect to the wireless network.  At first, it allowed me to connect and the router responded well.  But later, it tried to reconnect and the page did not respond.  So I disconnected and then re-connected to the router.   However the device itself was now no longer recognized on that network.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is unreliable.  I tried to purchase a new one and when I did it would not work with my system.  So I just returned it.   It's not a problem with my phone but I had to reinstall everything.  The last thing I tried was to use it with my laptop.  This new phone has a feature that I didn't like at all.  It works but when I used it with the laptop I got the blue screen.  My system has an easy solution.  Just reinstall and the phone will not crash.  If it crashes just press "0" to start it over again.  On the other hand, if you install it on a system with the same system version the next time it does it will not work on the system I have now.I did this twice and that's the version it worked on.  But with the new phone I had this time, the phone would crash on me just like the one I got when I bought it. If this has happened to you, don't buy this phone, just return it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am not a big fan.  If the screen is dark and lacks contrast, it is difficult to read.  This thing is also very slow to respond to buttons and buttons do not respond well on this device.  It also does not save your e-mails to cloud.  The battery only lasted about an hour of continuous use.  I found this one to be very slow for sending e-mail and the device has trouble recognizing the e-mails.  At first I used it for my work and then it died.  My next e- mail sent to me was received and I had to wait for it to process.  After my last e-  mail I had a problem sending an e- mails to work.  Since my last use I received a warning e- lister stating that there was a software defect.  Apparently, the software that sends these e- messages uses a different file format.  However, I have used this same issue with another e- mailing service (which did not have a defect).  I did not use the e  mail at work. In addition to the hardware and software problems, the screen and buttons on this screen are hard to use for typing.  Also, I would rather use my laptop in the office or use a paper screen

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing works great and will run on the same battery as the watch I have.  So I am now wasting my $10 to have the watch working, the watch not functioning, and the battery now showing only 1/4 of its capacity.  My wife has lost one or both watches.  She is also losing one or the other of the battery-sitting modules to the dock.  As a result, the battery runs out of its nominal capacity and does not charge as a result.  The battery was not installed when I got the watch.  It also appears that it does not work on other units.  If I ever get the battery repaired, my wife will get the same watch.I have tried a number of different units. The battery now only works on the watch and only uses the original battery, which does not have the same capacity as the original (I have seen this battery in the dock).  This battery does not come with its own charger.  One of the batteries I have purchased for the dock, the one that runs the clock on the dock is still the same model, but not working correctly (the battery has lost much of its charge).  Both the watch, watchband, and dock have battery modules that work with the battery.  I have a note from Samsung regarding this battery, but the note I received was dated January 31, 2013 and apparently this is the model number for the docking dock.There was a time that this model worked with the dock in an earlier release of Windows XP, but this one does not now.  Apparently this is a problem with the earlier Windows version that I am running.  In my testing, Windows XP is now incompatible with the docking station (at least on my laptop).  For the watch itself, there was a "free" version for the Windows XP XP system (the "free watch" did not work with my version of XP).  The "free clock" was apparently a "fix" for the problem and worked fine.  This is the version I use now.The "free", or "fix", dock will work with both watches, but it does have a "fixed" clock and some sort of software.  After I installed the battery, I installed some other software to the watch that has some kind of configuration.  There was a software configuration, but I was unable to figure out how to install the system to the watches. I can get this installed, but then

When I tried this out it seemed like the Bluetooth connections would stop and reconnect. The keyboard was very difficult to type on, and there are some quirks to the keys. It seems like I have to type the "A" key first and the "R" key (in the "C" row) before I can type a "Z". I tried to type "Z", but it doesn't work. It also seems that the keys are too "light" and have poor tactile feedback 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is great to try, but it is extremely unreliable.  This device is supposed to store your credit card information, but is unable to handle the larger cards.  It did not store the information for my daughter's card.  I called the number listed on the device and was put on hold for over an hour.  When I finally spoke with someone who knew the technology inside, it told me that my card is too small and that it is not recommended for small cards.A simple upgrade would make a huge difference, especially if it is available.  Unfortunately I do not have the upgrade code and do not know what upgrade codes are available for other phones.  However, I can order my daughter a card, but she is not required to upgrade it with her personal information.  The upgrade is available through the web.

This is very disappointing but, I have yet to get it to charge up to its best charge level.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing has a great feel in your hands, and the buttons work, but don't press them. If you want to turn on the TV, you need to press the buttons, the only way you can turn the TV on or off is by turning the TV around.  The controls are very limited, there are only four settings.  All the buttons only work with the TV; they are not compatible with the old and new TV's.  You will have to switch the TV and TV set to see the remote.  It's a very small remote and when you turn it around, it will zoom to the left and right.  This remote is made out of plastic.  I use it for basic functions; you cannot set the TV to your home setting, you can't go to channels or the menus.  However, you CAN set the screen to your main setting.  Unfortunately, you cannot turn the screen on/off, but you can scroll through the channels.  There are some channels that I find easier to navigate than others.  As of now, the television does not have a tuner, so if you're on the main setting, the remote will take you right to the tuning function.  On the TV you can only tune to certain channels. The remote is very sensitive, but it's not so sensitive that you will be hitting buttons that have already been hit by the other buttons on the television.  Buttons on the remote are easy to hit, but on the other controls you may find that you can no longer press buttons without pressing on the screen.  My son and I tried this remote a few times, and both times the TV's tuner failed to function. After that, the TV just wouldn't go through its tuning function on the dial.    We thought that this problem might have come from the manufacturer, but we tested the TV with several people and found that no one had this problem.  Apparently, tuner failure can happen on other TVs as well

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a bad device.  After two weeks it has begun to work, but I have been told it does not work on non-English-language systems.  My friends at work do not have trouble using it.  But there are times when the display doesn't respond to the user's input.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  It appears to me, as another reviewer, that some software is installed on the system.  There is no way to change the software or the OS of the system that uses the display.  I used the free Microsoft Office system (not the professional version).  My advice is, don't buy this display 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product did not meet my needs. I bought my first printer from Amazon and found that this had an incorrect screen that has a white background on black background, which made it impossible to print any document. The only option in the program I tried was the "print" button, which I had to use, and it worked for me. On my second printer, I got the printer without the white background, but I had the same problem with the "Print" button and, although it works, I had problems printing documents. Again, the only option was the print button. Amazon's website, in comparison, worked better in many respects than Amazon's web site (although I received emails from this printer asking me to add an incorrect printer).I got a message from Amazon to fix the problem and, with my Amazon account, I was able to obtain the corrected print version. My problems with the two printers were corrected after I uploaded the updated versions. The problem has now been corrected, but it was still a bit of a hassle. I also found that, although Amazon now accepts the old program, it can not download the new one, so I had trouble updating the program.I tried downloading new versions of the program (at least in some cases, I couldn't get to it) and got stuck at that point, with no options for printing documents (I also found errors in the documentation). This is apparently a bug with the firmware (the "update" button on the web version was a little unresponsive) and it is an error that can happen for new users on some computers as well (or, the program does not recognize a new printer). This, in combination with the faulty screen, makes it almost impossible for someone to purchase a new computer without an updated copy of the firmware. On the web, you can use a temporary printer in order to get a printer on the market. I got one of these but couldn't print a document for a very long time.Amazon, in contrast, seems to be more flexible in terms of the types of programs that work with their printers. I tried the "printer" program in the first version and did not get very far in terms  of printing anything, but the other versions of this program did work with printers. In addition, the "Printer" option on the program allows you to configure the background color (there is no default background color set). For the "default" background, I set it to black, but

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these units to replace broken CD's that were broken, or simply didn't work.  While the CD's worked fine on the initial use, I had to rewind the CD to ensure it played the right music.  After this was done, it began to skip tracks.  I then attempted to record.  On a second CD, I attempted to use the same settings, only to see the CD begin skipping songs and displaying error messages.  The units were returned and replaced, but not without being shipped back to me with the same defective CD cover.  This was clearly the fault of the manufacturer.  They didn't do a good job testing or calibrating the CD cover or CD player, so the CD would only accept one CD at a time.  There were several different ways I attempted the disc on the unit, but the only successful one resulted in skipping tracks and having to re-record.  If you are not playing CD's, this problem becomes a bigger problem because of the error messages that display from time to time.My advice, save yourself some money and buy a new one when the units work right.  It is now in a safe state for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit failed to work in my car.  I've since purchased a replacement and have been able to use this unit successfully in the past, but the problems it presents for me in my particular car are more frequent than the problems I've experienced with other models.  The main thing that makes this model so unreliable is that it's very much difficult to operate in a parking garage with the motor running while driving.  It has the advantage of being small enough to place in a small space, but it requires that I leave the ignition key in my center console for the entire duration of the drive while I am driving.This product does not have a user-friendly software upgrade, which is why I installed the firmware a couple of weeks ago that will cause it to operate only with the center console turned on.  This is fine for parking in my garage for my family and for parking the car on the street with me while I'm walking the dog, but I have not tested this with any other motor-driven vehicles in my possession.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone because it does not work for me! I had to call up Microsoft Support a few times to get the issue resolved.  This phone is still broken and I need to get a new one before I return to the airport to use it.  I would not recommend this phone for someone with a laptop or a printer.  It has no web browser, nor does it have a copy function.  The problem is, if I get a machine-specific page (like a blank document) that I can get online and try to copy and paste text, the device will give me errors and I have to retry copying and pasting text and then trying to copy, paste, and paste some more.  Then, each page of the document I try to download will give a different error.  If I try copying and paste the entire document, I get the message, "Error, the machine can not open this file".  I have returned it.I can't say enough negative reviews about this phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My device is out-of-date, very unstable, and has problems with the software. The most glaring thing is the software itself. This software is the same, or very nearly the same as the older version I have on my PC. The only differences are minor UI changes. This is not a good version of the app. My PC crashes easily, and you can get stuck in the "insecure" state without saving a game or changing settings.I have tried multiple times, the most recent version I tried on my phone crashed my PC, as well. I tried both phone and PC.The first version of this version worked fine. I used the phone for several hours, the second version was slow, had a glitch and required a reset from a PC-certified PC. If I did this the phone could not be restored. The phone worked fine on the PC, but the second PC was the "main" PC that I was using and crashed after a period of time.I'm hoping this version will be a better version of my phone.I really like the way it works, it's a great way to play games, but it is not very stable. I got an error message from a friend who tried the app for my PC and got stuck in an out-dated user-interface. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am currently running a 64k modem, with 2x 1 megabit.  This one works.  Unfortunately the router is an older model with 2.4x 1.3 megabits.  The ip was set to a default ip, so I was unable to get access to my web browser.  My other computers were set to default ip and my printer could not be configured to work in any of the browsers.  When I tried accessing web pages with my browser, the print dialog showed that it could not use that ip either.    The net will have the browser settings back once I reboot my computer.  I had an ip address that worked in my home, but I would have to re-enter my user name and password each time that I logged in, which is quite a hassle.  In addition, this computer is quite slow.  Using any internet function other than surfing on the net is a huge pain.  It does not support the latest versions of the web browser

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen's color is just okay, the color is bright and clear but the resolution is poor.  The menu is too small.  If you have to scroll through the menu to find a particular movie or TV show it gets a little confusing.  Most of the movies and TV shows I have seen on the channel have a black and white look.  In addition, the menu in some of the games has a black, yellow and orange look. This is not a good interface for the majority of the channel's content 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It does not work. I tried my printer and the screen was not compatible with my software. I had no choice. I bought the printer and tried again.  I then bought the software, and installed it, and it worked, but it required a lot of memory to install the software and the software is very slow.I did a lot more work on the software than I ever did on the printer. It is not reliable and I had a hard time getting the printout I wanted out, I think it is necessary to buy this printer again.My software will now not run properly in some other computers, because it does not have an option to print the printer in full-screen. This printer works only on Windows and my wife's Windows.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery would never last for more than a few hours, no matter what the date.  It would not charge or deliver even remotely as promised.   I emailed Apple support and they said there was nothing I could do.  In the meantime, I tried to charge it myself.  The instructions say, 'Battery power may be reduced when not in use by the manufacturer.'  I attempted it and the device wouldn't respond.  I tried a different model, and it worked better 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item only works with my PC. This is a big, bulky device. I have not been able to get any useful information on this device. My PC is working fine, so I have installed the necessary drivers on my PC, but there is no way to get a hold of this product from Amazon. The driver for my Windows 2000 system was designed to work only with Windows 2000, however, this driver also works on Windows 2000. I installed the driver on my home computer and was able to access my home network and do something, but I am not quite sure what this device is intended for. I will have to try to get some information from Amazon about this product. I am hoping that Amazon changes this design to a more compact device so that I can use my PC in my office and get a better user interface for my work PC. Amazon has been very helpful in providing some information on the device, however the product itself appears to be designed for desk use with the driver for desk and wireless and desktop.  It is also compatible with my work phone which I use, but not the other wireless phones I have on my desk.  I'm hoping that if I can get a user interface on my work system that I may be able to use the wireless device, but until I do, I will still have to use my desktop to connect my home PC with my home phone.  For now, the device will not be usable with my office because the software and hardware require that it be installed with the PC, not the PC with the wireless router.  This may or may not be a function that Amazon plans to introduce in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After purchasing this, I bought and installed a new version of Windows 7. This update fixed many of the bugs and caused all sorts of other glitches. It is a complete and total disaster and has caused a total loss of all functionality.I installed the Windows 10 upgrade on my laptop and I have no idea how this is possible.  This is not the original OS version and it is missing a number of features that were present on the original version. The OS version is dated to mid-July 2014.I bought this to fix the "wasted RAM" and other bugs on my computer. I bought this OS so I could test the bugs on the system and fix the bugs.The OS version installed on my system is out of date. It has many features that are not present in the original operating system and a few minor bug fixes.  The OS installation took less than an hour from start to finish and I had to restart my computer in order to get it running the way it did with my original OS.I did not notice this until I took it out of my box and started it up.  I had a Windows 7 computer with no upgrade installed and was not able to even run Windows 7 by itself (the first time I tried to use it I got stuck in an error).The software is not even usable with Windows 7 to run the system.  One can only download files to the computer by using the Windows Explorer interface.I have been unable to fix any of the problems on my OS and had to restore my OS installation to a previous version.  Although the installation process was quick, it was a nightmare to get working with all of the software, which is a shame as it was well documented and easy to use.The installer does not offer any sort of options or information about the OS, nor the files. It simply installs the OS onto the machine without any options or settings available for use.This has made the OS unusable with the original system and I cannot fix any problems on the OS (which has no option or settings to change).I downloaded the Windows 7 client for my laptop which runs well (Windows 7) but there are no programs available for installation on the machine.  There is no information about this OS client in the web site.  After installing Windows 7, my computer was working for about a week and then I discovered that Windows 7 was a "new" version.I had to use an Internet Explorer browser and a couple of problems.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very poor device.  There are two small knobs that are used to adjust the brightness.  I used both the knob and the slider once to check the brightness in the menu and to adjust my display.  Both knobs have a built in light so they can't be used to check or adjust the level of brightness.I did not see any instructions for adjusting the display.I am sure there must be instructions for changing the brightness, or the knobs.  If there are, I'm sure they would be simple enough to use.I also tried the knob to check out the light level and the brightness of the menu to get a better idea of how to adjust them.  The only knob that is used for the menu is located on the right side of the display

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My unit arrived with several problems: The "C" version was out of stock, but after contacting Amazon they said it would be available soon.  The "L" version worked fine.  If the "C1" (the version I'm currently running) has a lot of bugs I am going to have to go back to Amazon and ask for a refund for the "L1" version and get the "V" version of the device, which will also have a lot more bugs than the "R" version.  There is a lot left to be fixed on both the "S" and "L2" versions of the unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As soon as the audio jack broke, the audio quality dropped to near unusable, resulting in a significant drop in audio quality (and poor stereo reception), resulting in audio degradation and difficulty listening to the audio.  The user interface is not intuitive and the audio playback is buggy.  I tried to connect my iPod to my iPod dock and was told that I had to restart it.  In the end, I decided to purchase a different iPod for my family, but was unable to return my old unit to Apple's warehouse due to my family's size.  Even now, Apple has a bad reputation for this product.  Given its poor performance, I would not recommend purchasing this unit for any of my family members.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item does not work in the UK.  It does not use the "bump" feature.  This feature is the only feature that works in the US and is therefore the only thing that I bought and the "vortex" in the back works well when I bought this and works as I wish in the European/UK versions.  The "vault" in Europe only works if the device is connected.   I bought the US version because I found it was easier to use the system.  I don't know how much "feature" this item has, and I have never used it, only tried to use it in the front of my vehicle.  On the front side there are buttons to use, which works well.  In the UK there are no buttons and I do not think that feature works as well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device has a "factory printed" label that is not durable, and does not contain all of the essential information. The labels are not very easy to read, and the "user manual" is the same as the "featured" manuals for the base units. The base units are not currently listed by Amazon, and it appears that Amazon does not yet carry the "product" as advertised in the "features" section on the website. I used one of the instructions on the base unit (I received this in the mail yesterday and put it in a box to mail away for review), but I am still in the process of reviewing the product to determine if the manual is a good one.  This is my first "feature" that is missing and I cannot determine how to use it or the "customize" option.  I suspect it has the same functionalities as the base model (i.e. it is essentially the same), but there may be an additional feature.  My review on this product is now closed

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing won't work with anything that comes out of the DVD's tray, it's a bit hard to read the titles and it can get really slow.  After a while you have to switch it off.  I got mine on the shelf and it's easy to read, but the box is a bit flimsy and the box doesn't have an on/off switch or a battery.  It can't take a DVD without a DVD player or a TV with it.  If you want to watch a DVD from the box without an HDMI cable, you can only get it to work when the DVD player's on and you plug in the DVD.  And the video quality is pretty poor, in fact the DVD quality can't be much better than any old DVD

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this unit doesn't work.  I installed the CD in the same way I have it from the store.    If it was working, I would have noticed but I could not install it again.  When I opened the CD, it took a long time to start.  If you don't put the disc in the CD changer, the CD player just works.  It is a nice system, but it has been a real pain to install.  The CD changers are nice and functional, but they don't work in all cars.  After installation, I checked the instructions and the CDs that you could find in the store and the CD that was installed on the new system.  These instructions are for the CD system I used and I have been able to install the CD.  Once you have done this, you get the new CD changor and CD player, but the CD-ROM that was in the system has not worked.  In addition, once I installed it and the cd-ROM was in it, I found it would not work with a new system, not the system I had installed on my car.  This system will only work with the old system and new system or you can go back to your car and use the new cd changer.  So be careful with that CD changter.  That is where the problem is

This is a very minor feature and a bit disappointing considering it can be used with both regular and dark grey backgrounds.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a great toy, but when I tried to start it up, I had no control. It did not allow me to use the CD. I spent much time searching for another CD, which worked, but then had problems loading it on my disk reader.  I used the CD to get some things ready for a family dinner, then it worked and I was able to use it to watch tv.  But it is so slow and has so much lag.  This product works great, but the CD player is not as reliable as the device, which means that if I'm on the road or if I put a CD in the CD drive and then put the CD in and then try to load it, I'm stuck again.   I have tried everything, but this time the CD does not work in the device or the drive.  The CD reader does work great, and I found that it can be set to skip certain songs from time to time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a different design than I have had on before. The back button will be depressed, so when pressed it can not be depressed. The only other button is the volume and the clock is only a couple of inches high and will only work with the phone.  I installed the battery without charging it and the problem is the new phone has a different mode than the old one.  After the battery was installed, I tried it, but it did not work.  One or both will work fine when the battery is charged, but when I first tried the phone in the airplane, I got an error that said "this phone does not meet the FCC's standards."  The phone cannot be returned to the manufacturer.  The problem appears to be that the phone is not certified to the FCC.  Since it is certified and I have the original phone, I cannot return it to the airline.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am using this for a very simple reason. I got a small screen and was hoping for a better user interface than the basic on-screen controls. I installed the software and immediately the screen crashed with a red 'OK' screen saver, so I downloaded an update and it was fixed. A few minutes later I did a web search for updates for it and found one that said it could no longer be installed to a system without an Internet connection. I was not able to get it back to a stable state and then install the update again. I did have an Internet access point in a cafe I had checked the network and the connection worked, but a few minutes before I got home it did crash with the red 'Ok' screen.I called the tech support and was told I would need to call the phone number on the box to upgrade the software. I called back and called the number and got the same number again, so the upgrade seemed to be working. I am not sure when the update will be back in the store 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device worked fine, but it would not work with my printer.  So I bought my printer, printed, and used it to copy some documents.   I had an easier time with this new version than with the old one.  I tried the device again and found that the software didn't run on my computer and I couldn't print documents with it.  When I printed the documents on my PC, I received a warning saying that I had a copy of the computer but could not print documents. When I downloaded my files onto the PC from my laptop, my PC ran on a Windows XP computer but it did not recognize the files.  Instead, I needed to run the install on my pc.  The install went fine for a while, but then stopped on the printer.When I pressed the reset button, the printer quit working and I needed my PC back to work.  At least I now have the printer on hand to print documents again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After one successful battery replacement, the unit broke.  After the battery failed, the customer service rep did an excellent job.  I purchased my battery back in June.  The unit I received is now defective.  When I tried to use my unit, it would randomly stop functioning.  This unit is currently not in service.  In July, I paid the original purchase price for the battery (about $12) and purchased another $2.75 for the service, and the unit would not function with the new battery.  While I was waiting for this unit to work, I contacted customer service again.  They said the battery is the product in the package.  It also has to be the same model.  There's a reason the battery came with no instructions or manuals.  Also, I got a different model from the original defective battery I bought, so the "service" rep just wrote the instructions on the back and provided an address for the unit to be sent to me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried this thing out a month ago. I got it on a Sunday night and it did not work until I updated all the settings. The first time it was working well. I tried a second time, and got it working well the third time, but the 4th time I tried it I was able to get it to work. My problem is it does not work well with all the CDs I have. It will work with all but one. I bought the two for my two young sons, I guess to make sure they could use them as they liked them. I put them into the CD player and they both like them and they like the way they were made. They will be playing CDs to their favorite TV show and I'll be able to see them as I want to watch the show. But when you switch the set for the television, the discs will come up in black and white (in my case).    It will not work with the other discs in this case.  The only way to change the mode or see the disc's menu is to close the door, switch the channel, and then switch back and forth between the two discs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing worked for just two episodes of a documentary and we lost signal during that entire trip.  I'm surprised this worked for more than two episodes.  There are way too many things that don't work.  The battery life in one case is only an hour, the battery life is low even in the other case, so it will work with any show or any time that you put it on.  In the battery case, it's too small and the case is not designed for a DVD player.  It's not a good product, but I bought it anyway for two shows anyway to see if it worked.  Then I'll buy another one for another episode and check back with a battery case for the second episode

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In the morning, I started this unit to use for an hour or so before I ran across the other reviewer who got the same thing.  He reports that it worked, but the LCD screen does not have a backlight which can produce some pretty nice looking results.  The screen resolution is also very high, at 480x288, and this works out to be the highest-resolution LCD in the market, at least for my laptop.  This unit does not appear to be compatible with the system BIOS (or any other) and it does not allow me to set any passwords, nor do I have any security code from Apple.  So I'm left with an unsupported device, which may well cause trouble on some of the files I store and the BIOS itself.  I have no idea how to set up anything remotely secure or keep this system clean, nor have any other idea what I should do with the machine.  While I cannot recommend this unit, I am trying to figure out how to repair it without a problem

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After installing all three games in a row and making changes to the system. I thought it was a great improvement, but it does have limitations. You have to choose between playing single player or two player games. However, it also plays games on a hard drive and a cartridge. And you can transfer games between hard drives. The hard drive that I use, however, is much slower than the ones I used in the previous version of the system and there is a significant decrease in storage capacity.The other problem with this system is the lack of a bootloader. If I try to copy a game from one drive to another, I get a message saying, "This is a bootrom and not a ROM and is therefore unable to execute a game."  So I don't think I'll ever be able to run more than a single game at a time.  So the only way I can play games on this system at all is to copy the game from the hard drive to the cartridge.  I've had to do this on several occasions just to get a working copy.When I tried this, however this version of my system did work with the game I had for my vacation. So I downloaded the game and installed the new version.  This one is an improvement and works fine.  But after I get my vacation, I'll have to go back to the problem of only having single player games and play a game on a different hard drive with a copy of my vacation version.I have to say, the bootrom that I had previously worked just fine with the harddrive, but I downloaded it, installed it, and tried installing all the three games.  On several occasions, the system would fail to copy or execute the game. This makes it really difficult for my system to run several games in succession at the same time.I bought the original version of this system.  Now the system boots up with my existing system and all of the disks work fine.My suggestion is that you look for one that works, otherwise you're better off with a game cart with cartridges. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit uses a CD changer with the player, but the CD changers have different menus, the player has several different buttons, and does not have any audio controls. This unit worked ok for several weeks, but at some point it stopped working. After that, the system worked fine for about a year, but it stopped functioning again after that and never returned to normal operation. I finally got tired of trying to figure it out. The CD player is good, but I've had trouble getting it to use the CD. On my previous attempts I had trouble understanding that the system can be set to do this, or to set the CD player to use a CD, and sometimes the CD would not work.I finally bought a new CD and the player works fine, but, of course, the buttons do not work with the CD so I cannot change songs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thing as I purchased the other one and got the same results.  My brother purchased this product and had the same problems.  The battery worked great on the web browser.  I found an e-mail address to support but it was never replied to.  On the web site there is a lot of stuff wrong with the instructions that I found.  There are some buttons that just aren't functional.  As someone with my previous electronics, the battery had a dead battery, and was also defective on my laptop, even though I had a replacement for my laptop.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is ok. It doesn't have a built in clock or alarm. My wife is trying to use the clock to time her reading.  It's only a good clock if you want to be a handy clock.  I recommend putting a clock on your desk, then your desk and then your bedside table.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very happy with the package except for a few small problems. One thing that kept coming up was that there is no instructions included with the instruction manual. If I were to copy and paste the instructions, I'd have to make a few minor changes in order for it to work. Also, I noticed that the instructions tell you not to change the clock on a regular basis. In fact, they are only updated when a new set of handsets comes out. So it would be very nice if you could set the handsets up to go off-line, but the manual tells you to set the clock only once every year. I've had a lot of luck setting the handset to go "off-line" but it seems to work fine. The problem with the manual is that it has an odd format which is very hard to read. The clock is supposed to be written in Cyrillic, but I tried to use the same time format as the "regular" manual. I also tried to copy the manual to an English-language web site and it worked. Finally, the manual mentions that a second, "time clock" is available and it comes with the hands set to go time, date and date, and hands, and date to time. So, although I can use this clock to the clock, it is only one thing for the clock face. The face is also a plastic construction and I found this feature to be annoying. It has to be adjusted every so often and, as I type this, my hands are not aligned correctly with the face. I set the dial for the time and date so the hands don't need to be set to any position for the date. The dial needs a little adjustment at first and I'll set the date and hands in order to get the dial set correctly but I had to make the "Time Clock" option on my clock turn on and off. It's not that easy to do, as it will not function properly if it is turned on or off. The hands work fine, but it is a bit tedious to use. I am currently working on a new design which I hope to have in the next few months

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just got mine from Amazon.  Amazon doesn't have any specific ordering requirements other than a minimum order size of 3 items.  The Kindle Touch had a manual that was out of date (as was my copy of the Kindle itself).  I attempted to download the entire Kindle from Amazon's website on an early January morning and was unable to get it done.  My Kindle Touch returned from Amazon after that to have been a totally different device.  Now Amazon does offer a version of Kindle Touch with the same Kindle UI from the current Kindle OS release that can be used by Kindle owners.  That is the version of the software that is recommended to my Kindle Touch from Amazon on Amazon's site.  I can't remember whether I had an old Kindle that I had sold by itself or was I able to purchase a new one from Amazon in a few weeks?  If you had the same problem with the current firmware release, then the solution is simple, buy the Kindle Touch already on Amazon with the new UI already installed.  If it is not on Amazon, and the Kindle has the latest version on the Kindle's own website, then try to download all of your books, and then attempt to use the interface to download any additional documents.  You may also need to go to settings and update the app and browser to get the latest functionality.  It works, but some of the features are out-of-date or buggy.  So there are a few potential fixes.  However, after doing all of these things with Amazon, my Kindle works great.  This device has some potential, but there is no way to get all of my books, photos, etc., into it.  (I've been able to download some content from Kindle stores and other websites.)  So now Amazon is a good device, but not as a stand-alone device in my home, just a stand alone device to use my books.  Also, my home screen has a button that allows you to download your eBooks, though I haven't tried it.You can find information on how to get a Kindle Touch at Amazon.com 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone only works for a limited period and does not provide a lot of functionality.  I bought this for my girlfriend so she could keep in touch with my mom who lives in San Diego.  If you are driving home to San Diego you have to hold this device on your lap and it will only work for her.  It also doesn't work on her ipod 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is a total fail.  I bought this and installed it myself, and all three CD player controls worked.  However, none of the discs worked on my computer.  After I installed the CD player, I was able to play some of my discs on the computer, but the problem was that none of my CD players worked with the CD players.  The CD player would hang onto the CD and sometimes skip or play a CD that was just out of play.  Once in a while it would play a completely blank disc.  But this happened on every CD I tried to play, which led me to believe that CD drives don't work with discs that are out of print.  When I tried all four disks, I couldn't figure out how to get my CD player to work on my CD drive.  This was just one of the two CD player problems I experienced

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would like to review the same item from the new box.  I purchased this item to replace a broken item which was defective.  My only problem with this item is the cord does not extend as far as the item did on the new item.  After several use I am unable to get my wireless set up and have to go back to the store and purchase another unit.  The store does not have this item available for me to purchase.  If I had a question I have no recourse.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was not functioning and I had to open and close the battery many times.  This was the only product I ever bought from a retail store.  I could not get the device working and now I have a black belt in my pocket.   The device works OK but if it was used for a longer period of time, it would drain the battery even faster and then the battery would not last.  If I bought this for $80, I purchased this with the intention of keeping it for another 60-90 days in the backseat of the truck and then I bought a belt to use with it.  In my experience, you get the most value out of the belt for short trips.  The belt, I believe, also works as a charge station.  You cannot charge the device with the battery charger.  To use the device, the belt is required and can be charged with a cord at any time.  But you may want to take out the battery at least once a week.  And the belt has a "burner" in the belt pouch and can charge the battery in the vehicle.  It is very useful if the battery was not in the pack at all.  Even if the belt does not work in the car, you can still charge the pack if you leave it in the truck.  Since I bought the belt, the pack is in good shape but I have to check it more often 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons on this device are very slow to respond to the push, this makes it very hard to navigate the menu. This unit also fails to recognize all the pictures or other devices that are in your menu.  It does, however, recognize all of the other images in your program folder.  I have an additional problem with my program, as the image is a large and rather low res.  This also means that the pictures take up the whole screen.  When this product is in use, it is very slow in reading the picture and recognizing that the image has changed (to say nothing of the fact that the images are small and low res).  This unit is just plain bad and unreliable.  The screen is just too slow for most tasks I perform.  You need to use the keyboard to navigate and copy images.  If you need the system to recognize a new picture, you can always buy a new copy of the image (or update the image with a new version number if it is bad).  I purchased one and got frustrated because I tried to use it for the first time and it failed

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product is unreliable, and the case has a hole in it!  I bought this a couple years ago (I guess I thought the manufacturer had changed the product design).  I got tired of the case, and never found a reason to return it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a gift, but my husband couldn't get it to work.  It is a great feature, but I had to buy my other printer in order to do anything I could do with that.  We were supposed to have the printer for christmas, but when it was first ordered, the manufacturer made it to my specifications, which I never received and thus was not able to use.  I returned it and am awaiting a replacement from the manufacturer.  My main concern is that it is not going to work on my desktop.  On the web, I could find the specs to print to my desktop, but no one could explain what my desktop is supposed to look like.   It's not a standard desktop.When we tried printing the page, it just gave us a big blank piece of paper.  There is no way I can go and get the printer now.  What a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say the unit doesn't work, even after 3 months. I tried to use the unit on a different computer on a separate network. It still doesn't show up as an available option on the web-site. I'm sure the unit was made in 2007 so it could work on a newer network (which may be the case in 2008). This has been frustrating.It was not made in China, but China.  The unit worked very well when the web site went up and was supposed to work in 2008

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone and used it for several days without any problems.  When it worked, the voice and text messages could not be changed to comply with regional variations.  As a result, I received some emails that never appeared in the inbox.  I was trying to check a few emails.  There were several problems with the voice.  The buttons and dials could not function correctly.   The phones could not respond to the messages.  Most of the features did not operate reliably.  After using the phone for several hours, I installed software and installed the update.  Unfortunately, the phones would not work on some of the new versions of the Windows operating system.  This software is incompatible with other systems.  However, there were some problems with an update for the previous Windows system.In addition, there are a couple of bugs that cause the phone to stop responding.  It is now a slow, unresponsive phone.  A customer service representative from Microsoft indicated that the Windows system update will fix these bugs within two weeks.  On July 1, Microsoft sent out another update that fixed a few more bugs that caused the phone not to respond properly and it works correctly.In general, the user interface and user interface are not well developed.  In addition, the phone has a low battery life.  Many people find this phone less useful than the previous model.  Microsoft was slow to respond to my questions on the technical aspects of the phone.I tried several fixes to the software to see if it would correct the problems, but the problems persisted.  These bugs have caused several hours of problems, and even the new software was not released until July 1.The phone has been on my car and other vehicles.  Despite the phone's low battery, I did not find it very reliable.  While I have the phone in my car I used the car for errands.  To fix the phone, I had to remove the battery.  My phone worked for a brief period.  Then it would freeze for some reason.  Sometimes the "search" feature would work, and other times it would stop working.  Additionally, the "find" feature works, but it is not reliable.Microsoft's support website has a FAQ, but I have yet to find a response to the phone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased one of these cards without telling anyone and installed it without asking anyone if it worked, or if it was compatible with the system I had on my computer.I returned it to Amazon.I do not believe they will be reissuing the card with the same name because they had the same model number.So if the card works on my current system I can no longer run the web browser on my laptop.I had installed the browser on a laptop prior to installing the card, and it has worked for me since.But if anyone has a problem with the browser, they can still use it on a computer and it will work as expected.But for those who want to run the browser (I bought it with my laptop), just uninstall it and delete the settings in the browser. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If I want to play a PS3, it boots up fine but once I hit "save" or I hit any of the different buttons I find it is impossible to "undo" any of my settings. I am told "no manual is included" and no one in the company seems to know what is included or how to use it.I used the bootable iso because I was not expecting the PS3 to be able to boot up on my pc. I have never tried it but I have read about the same problem for people with Macs and Windows systems. It is a mystery as to why this device is a problem.I have read several forums with information on this device and none of the users have a working version of it to post.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This phone is a joke.  The display quality is not as good as advertised.   The phone has a very large battery for the small battery in the unit that I used.  This unit has an on/off switch that works ok but has not been tested to this point

The screen has a "check" button in it that will turn on a display if a power failure occurs, but it didn�t turn on my third attempt 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device works but is VERY slow. It's a real hassle to operate. I spent a lot of time on the internet searching for information about this device before I bought it.  I found that most people had the same problem that I had with my previous device.  It would not work with an operating system that was up to date with the server.  If I installed the newest operating system, the server would give me the error message:  If you want to upgrade the software on this system, you must use a computer with the older, out-of-date operating system.  This device will not work on newer systems.  When I installed it it gave me the message:The system does not appear to be able to boot into Windows XP, 98, ME, or Vista.  After installing the system, my PC automatically gave me a error message and refused to allow me to start the operating system

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this at Wal-Mart, as I had a good price on it.  I used it as a travel case on a cruise this summer.  This thing would have been great if I wanted to use it on my laptop, but I wanted my printer back at home.  The web site also lists other cases available.  But I found the Web site buggy, and if you have any problems, you can write them off as glitches.  If I had any problem on my computer, I had to go back to my last laptop.  So for now I'll wait for a better case. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was not functional, even though the manual had the usual "Upgrade" option. The only other option was the "Upgrade to Pro".   The upgrade to Pro had all sorts of glitches that caused the device to crash and cause a total shutdown of the internet, and a full reboot.  The user interface would remain responsive, but the "Update" button was greyed out.  Unfortunately, there was no "Upgrade Pro".The "Upgrade " button is currently greyed-out.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only reason i give a negative one, is that the battery was defective.I returned mine to the original seller, and then got another one (this one I don't like) and it works fine.I have to say that the one I got had the same capacity, but was apparently different in quality and has some other issues, such as having a built in temperature control (i.e., it doesn't get hot enough), and this is supposed to work better on the hotter setting than the original.I also returned mine because the "included" instructions make the battery instructions confusing and sometimes unclear.The instructions are not printed. I got this battery back in the same way I got the original, and the battery worked great until I tried to operate it.I didn't read the original instructions at all. If you know how to use this battery, you can easily get it working in any mode.There are lots of other problems with this battery - it doesn.t work with the GPS and it's hard to find a replacement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My wife would turn it on and she would not like the sound quality. She told me this one has to be reset after every time you do something to it. That is why I can hear the sound while on the couch with the volume turned up. This unit is a piece you turn on with the remote and the television, and it turns on with that remote. It is not a wireless unit. It needs a wireless network, like I have, in order to broadcast its content. The reason it is not available for purchase is because I do not have the money, just wanted to share some comments about this unit:  I purchased this item and used it once, it did not work at first. When it worked it would turn on and off with the TV remote like the remote for my other devices, but not my TV.  The TV is not included in this package and it needs to be purchased separately and I cannot get it on the TV with my TV remote. This is a very nice unit, but I will never buy another. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Not the easiest to use but once set it worked great for a while.  It could not be installed as a new CD without the DVD burner being disabled which makes it useless for the DVD version of the DVD.  The DVD is still functional for the old DVD set that has the "unusable" part of it that works for the new DVD.I tried the same thing with the new set and it just didn't work.  I am running the disc player version of this DVD for a long while with no success. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As for the "app", it does give you an option to make a backup copy (in case you lose your phone).  I got mine through Amazon.  My only other complaint about the "feature" is that it doesn't allow me to make calls.  On my phone's address book I could enter phone numbers, but the call menu doesn't seem to be designed to support it.  There is a button for "add call" which I found to be useful.  It's not clear in the "guide" how to turn call numbers into numbers which are then used to make the phone calls.It's a little bit of a pain, but for what it's worth, I am not looking for another phone at this point

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the second-rate product, had it installed on my home computer and tried to install a new system, too, just to verify. The install was so slow that it did not actually work with my home printer. The old system worked for a few days, but has failed for good.  I tried installing the second time.  It failed again.  My home printer has worked for about a month or two now, though it has never worked on my own home.  (The problem with that printer is, though, that it does not have the right driver for my Windows system.)  The old and new systems both did not have a print screen.  The original software is still installed, but that seems to have become useless.  So this one has a very limited utility.  If you want to get it working on a printer that runs on your home printer or a PC with your home driver, you'll have to find a CD with the right software and run it.  But as of now, I have to give up on my printer and its ability to print anything, even a photo.  You can try to run the software, but the way it is designed and designed now will not work on your printer.  And if you want the software to work, the original DVD drive works fine, too.  To be honest, I don't know what the problem with it is and don't want to buy the DVD with the new system anyway, it's a piece of junk.  A DVD with Windows 98 would do. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound was great when it first started up but, like most mp3 player apps, the playback would quit after a minute or two. It works fine with your computer.The device itself is small and sleek and has lots of functionality and buttons. The only drawback is that the app is not very intuitive.I tried it on my computer and it simply does not respond to clicking "back". The device worked fine on my TV and I could do my normal work as usual. I have a hard time telling it apart from other mp3 players in the store and the manufacturer does not seem to have any plans to update the software. I did not try the device out with a friend.The manufacturer states the device is compatible with Windows XP and Windows 2000, but, with such a long lag, it is likely that the compatibility issues are a result of the different versions of Windows XP.If you purchase a used unit from the vendor, I would highly recommend using the Windows 2000 drivers, the driver for Windows XP does work. In fact, the drivers do not have any specific requirements. So, it does appear that the Windows XP drivers work with this unit. The drivers for Windows Vista/7 were never tested and there is no way of contacting them.The drivers also show the device as compatible with Mac OS X, but the device itself does not work with Macs. The unit will not run under OS X.The hardware does have an IP address and will work on Macs under Windows XP, but it does not display a map of the whole world.I used the app with a web browser and the display was nice and smooth but the web browser worked fine with my web browser. This makes the browser useless. I had to install a few of the files before the system could find the web address to the map, the map was not immediately recognized and was not useful in finding other locations.On my PC the only thing I could get this unit to recognize was the address for this web page, but I could not find a map to display.  On the PC, I did have to change the display and some of the other buttons and the map disappeared after several attempts.I could not get this item to recognize my browser window.  After all, the web page on my Mac was not available to use, even with the OS X browser. The web page did not even display a picture, only a white background.I called the manufacturer's support line and was connected to

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It did not work.  The sound was too loud.  I spent some time trying to work around the sound control, then reset the battery.  It was fine.  After the reset, the battery was not working.  But this device has a long battery life, so there was no problem there, either.  When I tested the battery, it worked for about 30 minutes (I reset it), then broke.  This device does work, but I am not sure why.  Also, it is supposed to be compatible with Windows 98, but Windows 98 does not work on it.  Do not buy this unless you plan on using it.It is advertised as being compatible with Win98 (my machine does not have Win98), but if I tried to run the device on my Win98 machine (which was on my workstation), it ran out of memory.   I tried with Win99 and the same result.  Microsoft is currently investigating the problem

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product has a few problems. First, you cannot adjust the camera's settings to fit your picture and picture orientation. Second, the camera has a weak battery. Third, the battery is often not fully charged. In addition, the light will turn on/off several times during the day. The battery does have a charge indicator, but you have to remember to recharged it at night.The camera will generally work fine with pictures you take, but it will not be able to handle all of your photos if you do not have the light turned on. I recently shot a few pictures in the dark and it worked fine for me, but many of my friends have not had the same luck.  This may be because the battery does not operate in all regions of the photo.  I have purchased this product to replace my old, more reliable model and received a battery that is now defective.  Unfortunately, this was the only model I have been able to find that was defective. I do have a working memory card I can use, but I am using this with my camera.  It worked great in the lightbox and on the camera but it was not easy to set up the battery.  The battery is located on the same side as the light box, with the same battery cover.  On my old model the battery cover will not fit the battery and the light.  To find the correct battery cover, I will have to remove the battery, unplug the battery from the charger and put the cover back on the battery until I can get the battery covered. The cover will have two holes in the cover. I plan to return this camera and purchase another.  There is no warning on the cover or in the manual that tells you that you have any battery problems.  You will not know what to do if you have a battery problem until you need it for photos!I found that this camera does not work with the built-in flash that is used for taking pictures of people.  Instead, you will have the option to use the built in flash or a remote, which I would recommend buying if you want to take any pictures of friends or family members.  A remote can be set to operate from anywhere within range.The built- in flashlight on this camera is very nice, but not reliable in cold weather.  As I mentioned before, this camera's light is turned on during the daytime.  In addition it is often turned on in the night.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone as I was on my way to my grandmother's house for a family BBQ.  I thought it would be a good addition to the family's equipment.  The phone would have made a great phone conversation piece for my grandmother, but when I received the device at the BBQ and tried to use it, I got a red screen, and the battery would not work.  After I received a battery, I ran into some troubles with the system itself.  Eventually I solved the problem, but the problem persisted.  This phone is not stable in my grandmothers location.  It would not function correctly in that location.After the battery problem, I returned the device to the manufacturer for an update and that solved the battery issues.  As I was working on my grandmother again, she got it and it worked properly, but I did not receive an update.    In a way, this unit was a major disappointment.  Don't waste your time purchasing this phone.  You can get a better deal elsewhere

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   What a piece of rubbish.  I bought this at the end of October and had my first problem in March.  The software version in March was broken in April.  There were reports of problems on my laptop when I purchased it.  So I bought the latest software version of the last version, I believe.  Apparently the problem with the software is not solved and the user interface on my unit does not work (i.e. does not allow me to use most functions in the computer - not usable).  I found this to be an unacceptable software package.  However, there is one feature which works well.  It seems to be a little tricky to set up.  On some functions, it will require you to first download and install a patch.  Some of the other functions work well, but some will not.  In April the software was so bad I was able to fix this problem, but I am now having problems setting up the application to use the computer on my home network (which is my current primary location).  This software has been available for download from October 16th, but has been "out of date" on my PC.  As I say, I am in the middle of setting up this computer for my home use, with my current software, not the latest.  Although there is software available which works on my current home network, I have no problem using it on my portable computer.  Perhaps the problem is in the operating system which is not compatible with my home router.  If this is correct, then my computer will be set up to work well only when I am travelling to or from my home and the PC cannot be used for other users.  This has been the case for several people (although I am told the problem has now been fixed).  However my computer works with my smartphone and I am able to browse my home web browser.  My home network and its associated router also allows me to download most e-mails and documents from my PC (I have also been able to set this up and use it for the last few days).  My PC has worked properly for me.  Since the patch is a major update for my operating system, I use it on an older PC that is not up to date on my network.  (I've found the patch only worked with the newer version of my OS, not with the older version, so I am using an older version of OS, but the problem

After using this phone, I had some trouble communicating with my spouse and my father.  This phone is still available in a new package with the same information as the old one, which I am happy with.  However, I am disappointed in the user interface and in some of its features, which are somewhat underpowered and clunky.  It also has a built-in "back-up" feature that is helpful for certain applications, but not all.  So the phone is less effective than it has been in the past

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The phone did not have a CD player which had been advertised on the telephone.  On our trip back home, we contacted Verizon to have this device serviced.  Verizon claimed it was on a different network from the one the phone was designed for and the CD would not work.  After a few attempts to contact Verizon, we sent a technician to our office in the hopes of getting a fix.  While we waited the CD player did not work and the phone would not turn on.  A technician arrived and attempted to fix the CD in the same way.  This time, it did work. However, Verizon told us the CD could not be turned off as it was already loaded into the device.  However, the device did not receive a CD-RW.  The CD would read CD's in the DVD case and not in the CD RW.  We called Verizon several more times for information but all attempts were made to get the CD-WR.  Finally, we were told that the CD was a DVD which would work. The CD-PR did not include the CDRW as it could not work with the DVD.  Therefore, this device, designed to operate on the phone, could not run DVD's as well as the phone.  It did not provide any CD-ROM and I attempted unsuccessfully to get a working CD for the CDWR.This device also worked on the web using a website and a web browser.  But, the web browser was slow and would not connect to the internet.  At this point, I returned the device to the office and sent it back with a note telling Verizon to stop producing this device and give us an opportunity to sell it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a poor device that has trouble displaying anything other than some random letters and numbers. I did not get a chance to try to copy a large file over to this one before I installed it.  I have no idea how it works, or what the software does, or how it has done in the past.  All of the settings seem to work well enough to scan large pictures but for some reason, in the future, I would use an external disk.  If I put the device into the scanner, it refuses to scan any other type of files (though I did get an exception to scan a large folder that I had formatted).  I am looking for a better option.  It would be nice to be able to see and copy large files without having to worry about errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item was a great device, but the battery did not work.  It's very difficult to use and you do not get all of the options on your remote.  You can only change the channel by changing the channel number.  I had to re-set the channel after about 20-25 channels were changed 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit is great! But it does have some problems, such as having problems with its clock or clock resetting itself. Also, this unit cannot be powered on or off by the battery - it will only power the radio. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of this device is terrible. If you do not have headphones on, you will get the same reception as the other users, or the radio will simply go into a lower frequency mode, making you pay for the higher radio reception to hear the regular stations. This is only a drawback if you are listening to a regular station. The radio has a limited range, and if you live anywhere in a large urban area it may be useless because the receiver will have difficulty finding the signal. In addition, this radio does not have the best reception in terms of signal strength, or in the direction it is tuned in. This radio does work well in the cities and small areas of the world where radio reception is not so good 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have to say, I am a complete failure with this device. I have tried it several times with the same results. I purchased it for Christmas gift, and was able to order one for myself. Unfortunately, this one does not work with the DVD in the DVD tray, and has to be used in the tray or be copied into a different DVD for the DVD-only movies to run.  I purchased one for my wife and her friend, but I still cannot get it to work.  This DVD has all of the same problems, and the DVD is only functional for DVDs, not for movies, and it is too slow for even the basic movie menu.  It works for some basic DVD menu (e.g. "New Titles") but not for a complete "New Title" menu.I have purchased the CD-roms, which are not functional.  These ones also do not work as the same discs do not contain the proper software for the DVDs.    This one works fine for the movie menu (it does not have the same movie features as the DVD).  I used this CD-ROM to play a DVD in my friend's apartment.  The disc also works with the VCR.  There is no way that a VCR would play the same DVD as an actual DVD.  To add a DVD to a CD-R, I had to get a new DVD, but if this disc worked in a VHS player, it would not have worked in my home VCR 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is a piece for $19.99. The battery life is 5,000 hrs. The manufacturer website doesn't say it's a charger. If you want to charge your phone, you have to remove the batteries. I'm having a problem with my phone, my battery is about to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It will not work with your car.  The battery was only installed as a temporary device.  I was very disappointed with this device.I did have a similar one at my home.  This is probably the best I could get at this point 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a hard time believing that anyone actually uses this product to communicate with each other and it can't be used on the internet.  I would also like to see a way for users to configure the internet in this model and find all the info for each other.  This will probably be an issue for all my girlfriends.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't waste your time on it.  Buy another one and try the different modes first.  Not sure why the mode selector doesn't work in portrait mode.  Don' want to use the phone in portrait.  It should have the same number of buttons, but I found that some of them have buttons marked "button 3", which I didn't use.  After using that button in the first four times, I realized that the phone wasn't very responsive to my touch.  My fingers kept flicking between buttons on the screen.  I was getting very frustrated and frustrated with the phone.  But the "settings" buttons did a better job.  The phone's software is nice and user friendly.  And the phone works well enough.  There are just a few buttons I don't like, which I will use again, and the dial is not user friendly... 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is so hard to use.  The battery is not rated, and is not rechargeable.  After some days of use and a full charge the battery stops working.  When you go to recharge, the system won't recognize the battery, will not recognize it, won't let you charge it.  If you're using a different USB port on the system you may need to uninstall and reinstall the battery from scratch.  This device was intended to be used on a desk, not a table.  It also doesn't come with a manual.  I got tired of using the system in the office because the battery worked for only about 2 hours a day--even though the battery was charged with a different battery (for a different system).  The instructions aren't clear, and I have to manually re-enter them.  My machine now needs to be fully reset.  On my previous system the machine works, but the battery won't work with the new one.   I tried to reset it, and when I did it gave me an error.  So if you're new to the system, or the battery broke, do yourself a favor and don't buy this one--it's defective.  You can't fix it unless you try to use it with the old batteries.  Maybe, I should just buy another battery 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thing with the intention of using it for my daughter, she uses it with her.  I have no idea what her plans are with this thing, she is only 4 years old.  She uses it to look at a picture of her grandfather on her phone and is getting quite the jitters.  It doesn't work well with all the pictures.  The display has to be switched between the old and new screen when the older one gets tired.  This is a pain in the neck and I'm quite upset about this thing.  As far as the screen is concerned I can get this one for $4.00 shipped from Amazon.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this device is great at times, and sometimes it is too slow.  In some cases, you can get the same results if you are very close to the phone.  I do have one complaint, which is that the battery was a problem for me from the start.  My initial one lasted just over 2 weeks, and the battery on my test unit was not as reliable.  So I bought my new unit.  But the batteries have been a huge improvement over the original.  They can last 3 months, which I think is great.  At first, the battery had problems with the battery life indicator on the unit.I also bought a second set of batteries for the units and this time I was getting great battery life.    I did get great results for all my testing, and they also work well for the devices.  The problem was the problem with the batteries.  Sometimes they would not charge even with the display off.  It took a while for me to troubleshoot this problem.  There's nothing wrong with the LCD (which is good).  The LCD display is fine, but the unit also requires a charge and a recharging time.  After one battery broke, I have now replaced both batteries and the unit works much better than when I bought it.  Now I can see the battery status when the unit is off and when it is on.  This is a great improvement from the first unit.The one other issue I had with the first version of the LCD was that it is not easy to read numbers on a paper screen.  When I tried, it sometimes has a tiny display, and my number readout had to be reset (and the number displayed was sometimes not as good as other numbers I had seen).  There are a lot of bugs in the UI and there are a couple of display problems, but all in all, I'm satisfied with my first units. The hardware worked well with my software on my PC.  If I had any issues with my PC, I would send the unit back for a replacement.The batteries on my unit work better, and this unit was much better for the first two months of my usage.  For the first week, I got good battery life, and then my battery died, and now I had to buy another set.  Of course, the LCD is great on the old and new batteries, and I got excellent display quality.  One complaint, however
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device has a great battery, and can't make the radio work as it says it's designed to, just like a regular radio.  I don't see the radio actually working on this unit.  The radio's battery pack doesn't actually last 2.5 to 3 months of use.  There is a button on the radio to go to battery mode.  Unfortunately, it works fine with the radio, but does not support it when connected to the radio.The radio's "home" feature will let you browse the internet using your computer, but it's not very useful and it doesn't display any photos or videos, either.The "menu" button is the one that's the button.  You'll want to scroll down to the second page of your menu to find the "Radio" menu.  Then you can search for the radio or just scroll up and down in the radio's menu for "Radio".  If you want to tune in a specific station, you can just press the "radio" button and search the station.  If your internet connection doesn't work well (I tested it in 3 different cities), you'll have to "turn off" the radio and use the radio "home mode".  Then, you'll be able to use the "home radio" feature when your internet service is active, but not the radio itself.    For some reason, the radio uses your laptop's wifi instead of the "internet" feature.  It's also an upgrade that comes with a 1 year warranty.  Don't expect any "features" or other features that aren't supposed to be on this radio.All in all, the station is not that good.  My recommendation would be to buy the radio that comes in the box for its 2.4GB radio and skip using the internet.  This is the radio you would want to buy if you're buying a "real radio".  It works on an internet connection that works fine, but doesn't support the radio feature when connected with the internet 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this unit is that the battery does not work with all computers, it does not give you the ability to print any images to a large format.  The instructions tell you to print images with the smaller format.The unit works best with printers that are less than half the capacity of the full-sized unit, or with a smaller printer that is smaller than the full size unit.  It will print well on a computer that has only a few icons or icons that you can use to print some information that you might need to know in your browser.  When you print anything to the full unit, the device crashes.  Even when I downloaded some pictures to a printer that does not have the full capacity of each icon.I ordered a number of these units in the mail from several vendors.  Some units were delivered without the software, but I suspect that they will work as advertised.  There are a number on the market right now for purchase, but you can find a lot of these online for as little as $5.   I tried several out of the box with my own photos, but they do not work.  They did not crash.  I got a good chance of printing my personal photos from the full units I got in the package, but my colleague's photographs from my company's computers crashed.  This was a failure of both the software and of the hardware.  As of this writing, they are listed on eBay. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   the buttons on this device are way too small.  If you try to operate this device in a remote control, you'll only get to the menus and you can only scroll up and down or up and left/right, no up/down to scroll back or forward 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you have a problem with it, the software was buggy for awhile.  The only other major problem with this software is that you can't use a disk with a file that doesn't have a full-disk encryption.  It also works fine with an encrypted file that has been loaded from a memory stick.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't be fooled by the name.  A small plastic antenna with two legs to attach to a wall mounted or to a table is too small to be of any use.  It can not be used in the house unless one or both of the legs are removed.  One is broken and the other is still under warranty.  I have tried to contact Samsung.  If it's the same problem as with the Samsungs that were replaced in the previous units, I have sent them a letter and a copy of the receipt and have not heard back.  The defective units were shipped to me and sent back.I have ordered one to the local office so I may receive a replacement, though I don't know how many of these units Samsung plans to sell.  In any event, this is not the first unit to have a faulty antenna.  They will be replaced for new units sold.  Hopefully I can get it fixed for my car as well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the item, and the picture quality was very poor.  The image quality of the photos I took with this device in the field was not particularly good.  This is not a good product for this application, especially with all the different options available.  When I attempted to use this unit in my lab, I found that the device had some performance issues that were not addressed at the time I bought it.  I bought the product from Amazon and had to order it from the company, as opposed to ordering from the seller 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After ordering this device I have had more trouble with it than I have with the CD player.I got it on the way home from the airport the other day and tried to put it in my car but it wasn't compatible.I had to call customer service and leave a voicemail message.After that the number went to voice mail.It seems that I have been put on hold many times for two or three minutes at a time before I was able to get a hold of the customer service supervisor.My friend suggested that he call me and say that he has a car and the CD won't play. This was the only device I could find that I could use in my auto to view my web browser.He told me that the reason he was able get the web browser working was that the auto-play feature was disabled. I tried this and it would run only when I put the CD in the player.The web browser itself works but the CD doesn't play it.My driver was able (for about 20-30 minutes) to load the CD and play it but the device does not work with Windows XP or Vista. It also does not play the other way.This is a great device for browsing the web.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My brother bought this as a Christmas present from someone else. It has been on the phone since June 2007. It works but does not work with a CD player or any CD. I have tried both of them on multiple computers.  It is impossible to get a CD or DVD to work on the computer with the phone.  There are two or three instances in which I have had to return this phone.The reason for this is that it has a CD slot which uses up the entire cartridge.  The computer still works, but the cartridge will not work without an additional charge 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst phone I ever owned.  I bought this because it says it is a 10GB version and you have to buy all of these games with the extra 10GB of space.  This phone was supposed to go in a dock, but it doesn't.  The phone does have an LCD screen.  It worked as a regular screen at first, but now it won't turn on in a standard dock.  All the games on the phone will not work with a standard screen in the dock.There is also the fact that it can't work on this specific dock. This phone has a specific dock on it but it still isn't compatible with the dock because I bought it in the street without any kind of instructions.  When I plugged in the charger and put in the phone it did not work on the dock and it would not allow me to switch out the dock for another one.  You have to do it on the desktop version of the dock which requires a web browser and a browser-specific version of IE (i.e., not the normal version).  This doesn't work because of its specific design 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased these on December 23rd and didn't receive it for Christmas. I tried emailing Amazon to get an update, but there was no reply. Amazon is now "out of stock" (I've sent them my other order, and it's the same as my original).  The website says the order will ship on May 1st, with a "next day service" if that works (which it doesn't).  After spending several weeks trying to track down the problem, Amazon was so unwilling to work with me on any kind of solution.  My original purchase from Amazon "worked" a couple of years ago, but the software is still "vulnerable" to crashes (and I have not been able to find a reliable patch).  When I tried to purchase my original order, it worked fine for a long time before crashing and crashing the whole computer.  I have no idea why I bought the other one.  Either it's a "fixable" glitch, or there's something wrong with my order, which I will try to work around.  Amazon.com's customer service rep. would not be able to help me (I have tried email, phone, and forum chat with this rep), nor would they answer my questions about the order, software, or patch.  If the update to the first product worked for me, this computer would work with the other units, but my original purchase never worked properly after the patch.Amazon.com is a nightmare.  This computer is just not compatible with my laptop and I cannot find the instructions anywhere.  It does not support the WAP file extension, and in my original review, I made a point to point out that it does not work with my iPad (but does with my iPod).  Amazon would not respond to any of my questions concerning this.  To purchase my computer from Amazon's online store, I will have to ship the computer from the United States to Canada.  Will Amazon ever work with a Canadian customer?  A customer service representative has claimed that the problem of the patch (or the WAPP file) on my original WAP unit, or on my second "fix" purchase from the Wapp file, is that it was "upgraded" from an older version that did not contain the update for the Wap file.  But, there is a WAP update for this "upgrade" that works, and works fine.  For the WMP "up
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product and it did not work right.  It took me several attempts before it worked.  I tried this model on at least ten computers in different stores in the last several months.  The problem is that it won't work with any older, but it does work with all Macs from the beginning of the 1990's.  This unit worked only on computers using OS X v.3.0 (or newer).  On the AppleTalk system, it works well.  For example, it worked with my home network, although my home has multiple Macs.  When I tried to make a new network, the Mac in my network would fail to connect, which is strange.  AppleCare's tech support did not know anything about it.  They could not get ahold of me and I have had several different systems since April.  In short, the support people at Apple are no help to a new Mac user, but they will get you started with an old one.  If you do not buy any other Macs on Apple's web site, I cannot speak for their customer service.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this in July of 2012 and was never able to set up my laptop properly. I called the customer service number in July and asked for assistance with setting it up. The phone number is a non-working number.  I called several other times in July 2012 but it worked sporadically and I lost the password for the account.  Since I received the phone in October, it was easy to set it up once I set it on the internet.  The first time, I received a message on this number from "Jenny" asking me to call back.  When I tried calling again, I had a "phone" from April, 2012.  If that is the right phone number, I can no longer check my internet account on my computer.  My Internet is disabled on my laptop and I was unable to change the password on the computer, even though I tried.  So, I have now "locked" the computer. The other two boxes with my computer were installed successfully, but I did not have a working copy of my own copy of the operating system.  One box had a bootloader on the laptop, which, although working, is locked and I cannot set up the computer unless I am willing to upgrade the bootloader.  In addition, I tried setting up a new bootloader, but the boot image is corrupted and the computer is set up to load Windows XP.  (I can now boot Windows XP with the original bootloader in my laptop.)  My original laptop was working perfectly.  It is now on its own bootloader 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this device on my 16th birthday. I was a little concerned about it at first because it is so light and bulky, and because it only worked on my desktop. I could not figure out a way to transfer files between my desktop and the device, or find a way on my phone or ipad to sync them between devices, or anything. The next time I plugged it in, the display didn't work.  So I went to the internet to look at some files, and to my delight, the only files on the desktop that work on my laptop were files that had been saved using the standard program.  I have since used all the disk space on my computer to back up my photos.  The only files that were available for the device in the store were from my desktop or from the web.  If you don't save your files using standard programs, the machine is useless.If I ever decide to buy another unit, I'm buying it off the internet.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wish I had read the reviews before ordering. I purchased this card because the one I had with it worked in my old Mac. I tried to install it and it gave up, not wanting to work with Mac OS 9 (or whatever version of Mac OS it runs) anymore. I was unable to use it. The card works fine with MacOS 10.2, but I've tested MacOS 9 and 10.1 and the system crashes every time I try to run a new Mac OS 10.5. It also crashes with OS X 10.3 and 10 OS X, but the driver works fine in both of those versions. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is bad.  The buttons are poorly marked and work on the same buttons as the main controls, so to change the system from a desktop system to a web browser is a difficult process.  As a consequence of this, you can use the keyboard and monitor in conjunction with the main system in the desktop environment.  This system also does not support many different screen resolutions.  Therefore, unless you are a graphic designer, you will have to get creative with the configuration.  Some of the default configuration options are not user friendly, and you must manually configure every other option.  Additionally, the program is only compatible with a very limited amount of devices.  Even more disappointing, this system does not allow you to change to a different browser.  I was forced to get used to an OS that was more of a novelty.  On the other hand, some of the features available from the web browser are useful.  These features are not fully functional yet.  For example, you must disable your firewall to access the web.  It is impossible to configure or access the internet for use on an offline system.  You are not even sure the system can be used offline.  However, I have used the browser to access a number of web sites, and my experience so far has been a little buggy.  Although you can access the browser with the browser preferences (or the browser's settings), the browser settings do not allow the use of different screen resolution.  Also, the settings menu for the browser is not user-friendly or intuitive.  In fact, you may find the controls a bit cumbersome to use.  Other than the browser, the user interface is not intuitive. For example: the settings are locked, so you can't just open the browser and use it normally like you can with the other browser windows.  So, this is not a very good way to use the browser for browsing the web 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device has very few buttons and does not offer any menu functionality.  This is an excellent device to use for watching movies, but I find that I have to push on the left side to move the cursor.   I also have to turn the device on and off while watching the movies to set the timer.  However, with this device I was unable to locate the cursor to set timers, set the battery level, etc.  One other thing to note is that when the battery is low, it shuts off the timer and shuts off after a few minutes.  The cursor may have been located in a certain position after the battery was low, but it is not very accurate.  In addition, the device uses the same battery as the unit you bought it, which may cause the battery to be less than it should be.  I purchased it hoping that it would work properly with my system.  After receiving it, I found that the unit worked correctly with my home's TV, but the TV would not recognize it as an accessory when connected to my system 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these devices in the store and didn't receive the CD version, which comes with a blank CD.   The CD itself has no cd-rom drive or CD-ROM support, so it will be useless for most people.  I tried multiple times to install the CD into the cd-ROM drive, but after two failed attempts, it will not work.  This product works great on a blank DVD.  The DVD, however, is of poor quality for reading DVDs.  If you have a CD player, use the DVD to copy pictures from the blank DVD to the blank CD before you copy the images to the computer.  Use this method to copy a whole DVD: cd.exe.  Then, just use this DVD to watch any movie that you have on the CD.I bought two of these discs and tried to install them.  Both of the discs would not work correctly and would have problems with the cdrom.  However, these disks had no cdrom support.  Also, when you copy images to a blank disc and do a full scan, some blank disk images would work, but most of the disks had problems and would freeze.  It appears that the CD support is defective on the DVD because it works for a scan of the movie and a blank screen of a blank movie.  There are instructions in the manual for the DVD but they don't explain how to use the CD and it didn't work.I called the number provided on the web site and I was told to return the DVD, which I did to no avail 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is garbage.  The antenna works fine, but it isn't compatible with some computers.  And if the computer on which it is installed is not in use, it stops responding to the operating system.  It will not start, and in some cases it will not work if it is first installed on the same computer.  I installed this on a different computer after installing this on the one I use for my work.  While this does work, I am not sure about the reliability of the radios.  There may be other issues with the radios, or the operating systems, or whatever.  Overall, this thing works, but there are problems with the software itself.  But my wife has never had this problem.  On my computer, she has never been able to locate it and get any help.  This unit works well enough on the TV I use to read or surf the web, but I have lost my connection to the Internet.

This device has a bad image quality that will burn out a battery even if you are not using the device.  I purchased this phone so that I could replace the battery when the system works correctly.  My other  previous phone failed after a year of use.  The phone will not work on an  ipaq

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device and I have no clue why it doesn't work.The buttons don't do anything, no buttons to press at all and no information. I bought a second device to try out and it works fine. But there are no info buttons on the first device. It does work but the "info" button just doesn't respond to me when I press it, just like the others. If this is a standard feature, I would suggest that they make the "information" buttons "working" as well to make it usable.  The info button should just be there, the buttons for each option should be in the right spots. But I don't know if this is possible on the current firmware 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was purchased to my wife who is about 6'0" tall. She is the "eye catcher" for the device and it is hard to focus on the screen. I can easily focus with the phone's front facing camera, but the rear facing camera does not work with a large font (e.g. "Bold Text", "bold text"). I have also been able to use my own rear facing lens to see what I am looking at when I am not looking at the screen, which is a bit of a pain to see the screen and it doesn't have the nice resolution I expected.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was expecting a full size printer that printed out a couple pages of each color in a single roll.  The pages did not roll out like normal papers.  Instead, you could turn the page into a magazine and have a second one.  This machine is much slower than I expected and more prone to failure and jams than I am used to.  It's not recommended for printing anything that's textured (e.g., pictures).  You can still see the original pages on your phone (and the new pages from your email), but the printing doesn't show.  I ended up purchasing a $10 printer for the rest of my work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   You are also getting a new battery pack, new remote and remote code (the other code was broken), and no new app.  These are the same old, same old apps, although I got some functionality in there.  The only difference is the interface.  I haven't gotten around to setting it up with my phone yet, as my main computer is not up and running.  This system is unusable with my phones.  It seems to be designed to only work with a screen on your computer and a TV, which are both connected to my TV.  On my phone, it requires both to operate.  If you want to use the app with a phone on your phone, you will be limited to certain features.  For example, a feature to play videos and pictures on my phone would not work.  (I'm using the tv screen as my remote, and it's not compatible with the phone.)  The feature to use all the apps is broken.  But the new remote codes will work with the TV as well.  Although you can play movies and pictures with the old remote.  And the new app is nice, though the interface is not that great.  After installing the app on my computer, you can use your phone (in addition to the app).  It has a few useful features, such as the ability to send a photo of the screen as a wallpaper to the TV (this is nice as a wallpaper, not a home screen).  The TV can be adjusted for brightness and position and can also play the remote or the game.  Also, the TV can display weather information.  There are some other features to the remote, but they are mostly in Japanese (including the "press" and "hold" buttons).  But they work well, so you can operate the system in a different language.  Overall, this is not a good system for a TV. It worked great for playing the demo version of the demo for my phone and the TV, but after installing the new system for the TV and my phone (which I did with the same version of "demo.rom" as the demo on my  phone), I didn't get any new features or features. The remote control did work with my cell phone.   It works fine, but there's an option to change the screen orientation to portrait (the default).  While playing the games on my TV (and the demo), I got
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is very nice, but the screen isn't that high quality. It's only good for the very largest of prints. A lot of people have reported that the quality of the image is less than desired. The "highlighter" feature is good, but it doesn't work as advertised. It flashes the printed image to the screen for the "highlight" portion of the page. But since the image isn't scanned, it won't work with the actual book pages, either. So, the "text" is not crisp and bright. And you can't print pages to the "Highlight" feature, nor is there an "overprint" option. I like the "light" option that comes with the device, because I use it quite a bit. The product works okay, but don't expect it to last forever. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was a time when I bought a bookcase for my house and I thought it looked good, I had it in a rental unit for two years until the owner died.  It was just a piece of foam on the bottom.  When I took it out, the foam broke and the door broke in two, I just got a refund from the bank.  This device was designed to accommodate two people and the only reason I took the other unit was because I thought the original was defective.  I put it in the rental unit and kept it there until the foam had broken and the case broke.  So I bought the new one because I needed it.  The two units are similar in size.  But this one is not compatible with all of the components I have.  Now I am stuck with a house of foam and a broken door because I have to fix the door.  There are too many components and there is no way to remove the foam for any reason.  My phone won't work anymore. I tried the same door two years ago and the same thing happened.  If I want a new unit I will have to buy a new phone or I will get the phone and try the door and if that doesn't work, I'll buy a replacement.

The user interface is bad and the screen is much smaller than that of the previous version.  There are several problems:1. I bought this phone at a Wal-Mart (at a $19.95 price).  It says the battery is fully charged, but the light bar is set at $2,400 instead of $1,200 and the clock says 2:40 p.m., not 10:00 a.m. It is a lot cheaper, but is still the same

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am just not a big fan of the button, it works great, but you can't change the clock and the alarm doesn't work on some phones (mine did). The alarm will set off the clock when you press the button and then you can turn it off with the button... I bought this phone for my husband and I did use the alarm feature on my husband's phone... this feature works great for the phone alarm (for example, it will wake him up on his own time) but when you use it for anything other than the alarm, you get "blinking" of the time, then "clicking" back into the clock or the clock's settings (this feature does not work for the alarm). My husband told me the alarm worked great when he used his phone to set the alarm up. So this alarm does work... but my husband said he had this problem with his phone on his desk... I believe the feature would work better if you pressed the clock (it also has a clock-dial... but there is no dial).The clock is a nice piece but it was designed by the same company that produces my "home" clock... the clocks are great and they do get used sometimes, but I use mine when I want to clock in at home... my husband is a fan of it. It does have the clock-dials set and it will reset it's clock to the correct time with the buttons.The timepiece was shipped with a "blink-out" feature... it works fine, it can take advantage of the clocks in your home if the blinking feature worked right... but you just have to remember that some of the features are built in and some require you to have the phone with you... and the clock is designed to turn on automatically if the device is powered and it can be powered on, but it's not a power source... I would recommend the blinker feature, but if the alarm fails to turn off (which it can do), that will reset the clock to whatever the clock was set to last... i used to turn it on when the alarm was set on and then off the alarm by turning it off the device. My husband said the alarm system will reset to the same clock every time the clock comes off... but, my husband didn't use it. My hubby does use the blink-outs... but they don't work...

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The plastic was too strong and would not hold the books I bought in the photo-magazine holder.  My magazine fell out after a month.  I bought another magazine holder in the store, but I kept getting errors about the device.  After a month of constant frustration with the device, I decided to replace it with a plain black magazine holder.But the magazine holder I purchased from the store did not hold any magazines.    And I found that my magazine and my magazine-holder could not be separated.  This device could not even hold the magazine in which I used to take pictures in my car, let alone the magazine I bought the magazine-magazines from in my magazine holder 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device does not hold the license for my device.  The system cannot be powered on or off in a single operation (i.e., when powered on).  When the system is powered on, it will show the message "the user manual is out of date" and "this device cannot be purchased for this machine".  The user manual shows no specifications for the system.  As a result of this, I can't even return it for a refund to the company.  They will only accept the product if I send a copy of the original device with a note explaining my problem.  Since this is a new product and the operating system itself is not even supported by the original user manual, I'm unable to use the system anymore.  It is still in production, and it will not support any software other than Windows XP.  I'm not sure when this product will go out of production.  For now, the only thing I can do is buy a license and use it.  This will result in a new user manual.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I can't imagine how they will hold the battery in the car.  There is nothing in the manual that explains how to change the settings.  The battery does not fit in the battery compartment unless you use it to charge.  I had to turn the car around and find another battery.  So much for having my car on the road.  If I had a car in my driveway, I'd have an issue.  Maybe someone had used my battery. It's just not good.  You have to be careful with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the last copy in 1999.  It was printed with poor quality and the copy itself was in very poor condition.  The cover was a red and yellow cover with white lettering and a white image of a tree with a sunburst inside.  I bought this because I was curious about what a tree had inside the cover.  When I opened the bookcase, I realized it was an inexpensive edition of "Cedar Rapids Magazine" and I ordered it.    The print came out great, but the front and back cover have many of the same problems.  For example the cover design is very thin, with a large logo on the front page with the date of publication.  Also the back page is a lot less readable due to a lack of pictures and information about the bookcover.  So I decided I would order both covers.  In 1999 I am happy to say I have a wonderful edition of the magazine and a copy of both the cover and the magazine.  Now I will be using the cover until I can find an adequate magazine.The cover image of the tree cover is different from the cover of the book cover.When I first looked at the cover, I thought it was nice and different from anything I had previously purchased.  But when I saw the tree, I was disappointed.  And this is an issue of the publication with many different pictures inside.The new publication has more pictures in the cover than the magazine itself.  To my delight, the cover does have a sunburnt image of what looks like a tree.  This tree also came with a leaflet with the cover in the tree.The inside of the cover is a much better print than the previous issue.  However, the tree does not come with a back cover. I have been using the magazine as is and have enjoyed the cover since.  Although the inside of this magazine is good, there is one problem:  One of the pages has an image of an image inside the tree that looks like the front cover.This tree cover was printed in 1999, with the same problem as the old book cover image. I will be happy with a tree cover from a 2001 issue of this publication and hope the tree image on the back cover will be different.  One that is not a sunburn image.A 2001 issue is the only issue with an image on back cover that is the original cover and not a back of the new issue of "Cal
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this device for Christmas and it broke.  They did not bother to send me another one.  I returned it for refund.  Unfortunately, the seller had shipped this device to several other customers without their knowledge, even though it clearly identified itself as mine.  It broke with their purchase and they were no better equipped.  Even the instructions are vague.  This has made this the most difficult item to sell.   The device is very easy to disassemble and is not compatible with my computer.  Once I disassembled my computer, the instructions for the device, even with the included disk, left out many key features and capabilities.  Some of these features are listed but the operating system is missing.  The seller's own web page states the device is compatible with Windows XP.  However, this does not have any additional functionality to the system.  Instead, the OS is a boot disk in a hidden location.  There was no bootable disk included for me to install, so I had to use Windows to install it, which I did a few hours before I installed it.  My operating system did not work correctly.  After the installation, I could not get the system to run.  You have to have Windows XP, but the OS will not run.I then received an email stating my computer would not run on XP. However, I do not know whether it is because the operating systems are incompatible with my system.I purchased this unit and was surprised by the battery.  Unlike the software, it has no settings.  While this worked as advertised, I bought a new battery from Amazon.  If you look at the battery on Amazon and compare it to the unit's included battery, it did not come with the battery adapter.  Upon getting the adapter, the battery was not compatible.  When the battery is connected to my computer to make sure the batteries were in the correct positions, the software crashed.  Although this was a problem with the unit, not my computer - I had already had a crash on my computer prior to the purchase.  Apparently, the operating software of this unit did not handle this operating system correctly and crashed on my system when I did not have a Windows XP license.  Also, it crashed and I had an OS install for XP.The batteries worked on XP but they did not power the unit properly.  Sometimes the battery would be in use but the user's PC would not turn on
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The audio system is not working properly for downloading, the TV was broken before it shipped, and then after I got the package, I saw the instruction booklet and couldn't figure out the operation manual. It also wouldn't recognize my credit card, so it refused to accept it.  If you do not have one, it is useless and you have to use the "card reader" (not a terminal).I got home and tried several times but I could not figure out how to set this thing up so it would recognize my card. I finally got a hold of an authorized phone support number, but they are not answering the phone. If you use the card reader, it does recognize my cards but I had to reinstall the TV. It does not recognize my CD-ROM drive, so I had trouble installing the CD-rom, the radio or the TV software.This thing requires you to "activate" it from your computer after it has already installed it, which requires you enter a password. The system also requires you create a username and password to do this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is an excellent device for the size, but very flimsy. I use the unit in my computer and the LCD and CRT screen can turn off and on, sometimes even without the battery, without any user manual that I could find. So, the LCD can display all sorts of images and text from the user interface. If I need any software, the "manual" simply says it can be installed to the system by copying files from a PC using a program that does not require an internet connection, but does require a Windows XP client on the system. I purchased one of the "instruction manuals" that say to look for one on a CD at the local computer-rental store (a "service" that doesn't have any "institutional" computer users.)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are great devices, but, in the end, I bought them to have access to the internet and to send emails.  I have a friend that uses these devices (and sends emails) and uses his/her email account to check the clock for messages and so on.  This device has a nice battery, but no option to charge a device and send/receive emails.The device has very low battery capacity, so you can't have these on every day and charge a daily device that's on.As a consequence, this device won't have the ability to be used regularly on a daily basis, as it will have a much smaller battery capacity than a full sized one that you can use.  Also, the battery is on a removable cover that is easily lost, or damaged.  My experience using the clock has been frustrating.  It will start and stop working, with no rhyme or reason to the intervals it has used.  When I tried to check and check the alarm clock by holding the battery cover in my right hand and the clock face, the hands would not be on the dials.  Instead, the dial would show the hands.  There is no such dial.  At the time of this writing, the clock won't turn off if it is in the "On" position.  (It also won't respond to the buzzer to wake you up.  The only option it gives you is "Check on device"  which works but only works if the battery has been used in the last 24-48 hours.   My clock has always worked properly, but only once on a 24-hour basis, and it works fine on a 12-hour schedule.  Overall, this clock works better on weekends.  On a daily schedule, you will never get more than a few hours out of the battery 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In addition to the above, the device requires a subscription service to operate (more on that later).  I ordered the same version of the same product from Amazon as was previously purchased by Amazon, with the same subscriber requirements.  However, when I initially checked the version number and then the subscriber requirements on the Amazon Web Site, I was surprised to see that the version available from Amazon had the subscriber number of the previous version available for review.  The reason for this is, Amazon will only check the version numbers against the version information in your Amazon account before checking for subscription, and will check the subscriber information of the original version when it is available for download from Amazon.  This is why I was able to obtain the product at all.  I purchased the previous Amazon version from Amazon and it had the same software requirements as the prior version.  When I checked the subscription requirement for the Amazon version, it was still available.  In the previous model Amazon site, the version info had been listed in the prior owner manual, so I purchased this one.  Amazon's customer service was very friendly and prompt, but in this case there was nothing I could do to check the requirements for the current version.The reason for the previous owner manual being available online is that Amazon now requires an owner's manual for the product and does not provide one for download.  They require you to register the device with Amazon (i.e. set a password), then download the manual from Amazon to your PC or Mac, print out, and fax.  After printing out the manual, I ran it through an Internet scan.  It was found to contain errors in the manufacturer's information.  Many of the problems on the previous versions listed in this manual had been fixed.  A new version was available for sale for sale, but only on Amazon in the US

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product was not good.  It broke after a while.  This is the only item I had.  I bought it at a different store, and I am now using it.  However, the seller gave me two other different types of batteries, one for my car, one that I'll use as backup.  But, this particular one won't work for cars yet.  That one has more than one function and uses a lot of power.  When you charge it, it gives you some problems when you press the buttons.  For some reason, the buttons on it don't work very well.  They can get stuck and won't get you anywhere.  Don't get it until the battery is working, and make sure that your car won't turn itself off.  The batteries are in two parts.  My car had one battery and I had a second, which I got from a different seller.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't bother buying this item for a first-time customer.  If you buy it through an internet reseller, you will receive the CD-ROM.  It will not work with any other CD-Roms that are bought by customers.  However, it can be copied to other CD roms and used with the other CD's that were purchased by customers to date.  My suggestion is to purchase this item with no CD-RW/DVD drive, just use it to burn the DVDs.  This can be accomplished with Windows XP and 7.    The DVD is also not compatible with older models.  DVD roms are limited to a maximum of 20 movies.  You will have to copy them or burn them on a DVD burner.  No DVD drives are supported on the CD.  I am not sure why this CD-WR, DVD-RW and DVD burner were not supported by any of the earlier versions of Windows.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very slow device. It runs very well when it is in a single-player mode, but I do not play it much. When I do, it is very slow.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device will work fine for viewing videos only.  It is slow.  The screen was set at 200x for this reason.   It was easy to accidentally skip ahead of a film when watching the video, which is not ideal.  But the worst of all, the buttons are not functional.  I found the buttons to be difficult to press with the index finger and middle finger (or thumb) of the right hand, even when the index and middle fingers were placed on the right side of the buttons.  Thus, you can press the button to "go" forward or backward, to go forward or back, to "play" a film or to "stop" the movie.  This button also has to be pressed on the DVD with a single "click."  A single "t" on the button fires the DVD.  "T" can be pressed while the DVD is in the player.  You can also pull the DVD out of the player, and it works with a flick of your wrist.  A "play," "pause" or "stop time" button can be added to the menu, however, but the button itself has not been modified.  In addition, the remote works OK with a thumb, and the menu has a back button.  However, I could not find a menu to change the setting of the movie or change the display mode (which does not work for movies).  I have yet to try changing the remote's number, but I have purchased a second DVD and it will be used as a reference.  As this remote is used for a second movie, the user interface can be confusing at times.  Pressing the button on this remote on a particular movie will also cause it to be "backward" and "forward" at the same time.  Another feature that will confuse you is that pressing "back" will also return you to the user menu.  When you are using the remote, pressing "forward," "back," and "playback" buttons will change the movie time or video position on the screen.  For example, pressing the "forward", "forward, backward", "back", or "play, play, stop" buttons when the movie is in progress (not the menu), will return you back to the home menu. The "backup" button will return the player to the "previous" menu position.  (This feature is useful if you plan to use the

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used my card with no problems for two weeks, and there is still no signal.  The problem seems to be a lack of the full capabilities of the card.  I am able to watch the videos I want, but not the videos of other DVDs.  This is why I bought this card in the first place, and I still have not tried using this card for anything else.  It is a great card for watching the videos.  But after one month, I decided to try again.  And in the beginning, I had a lot of success.  However, it appears that the card does not have full functionality with the newer, higher level features of my DVD player.  In addition, the DVD player, unlike the card, does not come with any DVD.  If I try to watch movies on my PC from the DVD drawer, I have to set it on an internal battery which can be a hassle to set.  When I used the card with my DVD drawer it is not compatible with this newer player. This is the main problem with the card that is not resolved yet.  You have to have the DVD installed and working in order to even try to use the card for other reasons.  So, this is the current state of my video store.  With a big disappointment in the whole situation I have decided to return it to Wal-Mart for a refund 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen seems better in some of my other devices.  I have seen better in other phones.  My brother owns these, and they work great. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just want this device to do anything and everything. My previous phone was good for 15 seconds.  The software was buggy and did not work.  But now the software works.  Great for testing.  It also worked for me to connect to a wireless network.  I would recommend this phone for a personal use, just because you can't connect to anything on this network when it is activated.  You might have better luck with a personal computer, although I use mine for testing and just to get connected.  This is a great device.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As for me, I used the same phone for 3 months and it broke in 2.  I called AT&T 3 times over 2 months and got a hold-up.  All in all, I tried several times to get assistance.  There are better devices out there in my opinion.  So why use an old phone with so little range?  Don't you have to go hunting for this one? 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for my son.  He had to download a few things from the internet to try and get this up and running.  They have not worked out for me.  I will send it back.  However, this is a VERY frustrating device.  You can never get it running without an internet connection.   You also can't use it to print anything.  It's a very slow internet connection with lag time and slow printing capabilities.  This device was very useful for my wife and son.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these in March when I was in the process of moving.  The batteries worked great, but then they wouldn't work anymore.  I tried everything from the battery to the charger.  No luck.  So now I have to buy new batteries in my garage.  My problem is, I will be out of service for a month.  You get a bad battery if you use new batteries with the new phone when you get a new phone (in my case I'm using new batteries).  Then all your calls will be garbled because the phone doesn't work.  If the phone works in your car, it doesn't even work in your garage. You can call the dealership (but they will tell you that the battery is a new unit and that the customer will get a defective unit).  My wife had the same problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i bought this item thinking that it would give me extra room to store a book or a magazine on the cover (it does), but it has very poor coverage of the bookcase.  The cover itself is good, but in all other respects it is a piece of inferior plastic.  This thing requires two batteries (the included batteries were very disappointing and did not hold two batteries), a switch, and a cord.  If you buy a cartridge for a computer, it uses a cord (like in a camera).  If the camera itself has a cord, it will not work with the cover because of its battery compartment.  I bought my cartridges to use with my computer, but I'm not sure that it will work with my laptop.  Also, as stated earlier, there are no cartridges included in this item so it has to be used with the computer.  In addition, the cover does not work on the computers for which I have purchased the cartridges.  My machine, which is in good condition, did not come with a cartridge so I bought another one.  Since I bought the one with the correct cover, I can't say whether this has been the problem.   It may also have been a fault with the packaging, which I had a chance to verify (I have had this problem on other computers).  All in all, I returned my machine because I am returning the cartridges and switch

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is, I've been in a couple of them and they are very slow. The one I had in my truck has been the only one of them that is of use.  It was a piece of scrap and broke after I'd used it once.  I used it for a month and it broke.  The manufacturer had some other bad ones.  All three of them broke in a very short period of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit does not work with the printer I have, which is not the intended purpose. The printed pages tend to be very poorly aligned. I had to retighten them several times to get the pages to be aligned in a coherent manner.  In addition, some pages are in alignment and others are not.  The page on my printer was in a poor orientation.  So I have two machines to choose from.  I have yet to try either.  They both do not work in conjunction with the paper.  It is a shame to have to choose.  Maybe there are more issues with this unit than with the printers.  There was also an issue with one of the cards in my computer which has the code number 00001-0001 and the other card number 00052-0001.  This combination did not work well with my web browser.  (However, there was an issue when I used the website and the page opened improperly.  An issue with the card, a broken web browser and not enough room on the card to store the code.)    If I were to purchase this, I would have to print all the web pages through the printer, which I can't do without a lot of tweaking to get them all to work in a way that works with the computers.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product would not support Windows 98 or XP.  I would expect to get a fix in a week. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons were just too small for my hands.  The screen was too small, too.  I was just looking for something better, and now I am having a tough time figuring out what other options there are.  Hopefully a firmware upgrade will bring the button size and functionality up to par with the screen.  My only suggestion is, maybe put the whole thing back together and make it a little bigger.  There were no instructions, so I got some help from my mother-in-law.  Unfortunately, I got the original box and the warranty was up, so she did not know what was happening.  In any case, the screen had a little trouble reading certain characters in my name 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I will continue to purchase from this supplier until I am satisfied with the device, this is the first purchase for my wife. My daughter is having a hard time trying to get this device to work (she even found it in the glove compartment - she could see my son and his friends playing on it). I am currently sending a second device for my daughter, which is just the same device except she has found an easy way to install software on the back of the unit (which works). The only difference is that when she installed the software she could not get the back-up program, so we had to restart the system. The device is a complete mess. I have yet to receive it back. There has been absolutely no help from this company to answer my questions. The only other review I have on Amazon is from someone who had purchased it and it is "not working."  This device will only work with my daughter - and I am not sure why Amazon allows this.  I tried multiple ways to get through to Amazon, but was only able to get to a number of pages on the website - only after I changed my user name and password did I get my desired software. I'm hoping I can get my daughter's version of the system back in time to get my son's unit. This device worked perfectly when I bought it - except for that issue with my son.  The only reason I did not give it to my wife is because I wanted to try the software.  As you can see from the other reviews, the software is a little buggy and has not been updated for several months.  My daughter's software worked fine on the same unit that my son was able to run.  When we tried to use the device to get any programs, it crashed.  We sent it back for service and now I am trying to contact Amazon again.  Amazon customer service representatives have not returned my phone calls 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you do not have access to a large screen (with fullscreen and no keyboard), the screen is not responsive.  The user interface works well, but you cannot enter text or enter in numbers.  It is a bit buggy.  I found it difficult to locate many of my search terms 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone to take pictures of my daughter's car seat.  My daughter had to be put in the car seat because she wanted to be out of the seat, to get the phone back.  After that, it would sometimes jam while driving.  I returned the phone because my daughter wanted a new one, I returned it again.  The problem was the battery could not be replaced in the spare part.  One time, I tried to get it out of my car and it wouldn't even work in the engine compartment.  Apparently, if you are not careful about the button, it can be pushed at any time.  Even after several failures to use the spare battery, it still worked fine.  To make matters worse, it died before I got to use it.  If you are having problems with it, buy a new spare!  If it is broken, buy it and have a spare in the vehicle.  And if you do have a dead spare, it works fine. I had my child in the seat and the battery would not work in it!  It worked fine when it worked, but if it fails on a real live device that has an ignition, the car will catch fire and burn to the ground.  It's still a very expensive phone, though.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After a few months, the speakers started losing power, and eventually stopped functioning.  I installed the driver to continue driving, and then the driver stopped functioning as well.  So, I started to do some research on driver software.  One of the recommendations was that if the software used the built-in speaker for music, then I could use my smartphone to listen to music and the built in speaker for the rest of the phone.  This worked, but I could still hear my music from the built speakers.  When the speakers did not work properly, I had to download a new software which did not solve the problem.  At first I thought the phone would not work with the old software, but when I downloaded the new software, I could not get it to function correctly.  Eventually, after doing some research I found that it did not need to be installed with the built speaker for other programs.  It was more than sufficient to allow you to listen via your phone.I tried installing the built and built for different programs to no avail.  After doing some of the required drivers, I still had problems with the drivers, but after installation, the built were working properly.  The phone now worked with the GPS and other applications.  Overall, it worked ok, but the GPS had trouble tracking and sending the signals out to the rest phones.  As soon as I got the GPS, I tried my GPS app and tried tracking with the phone, but it had the problems I had previously noted with the CD player.  In addition, if the GPS was used with the mobile CD player, it would stop working, as does the GPS itself.  Also, it has the ability to track.  If you use the built unit for anything other than its built in capability for GPS tracking, it will not work.  Even with the new built unit, the GPS still has problems.

I just didn't use it enough to get an "okay" rating from the manufacturer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My experience is that this device is a waste of money and takes forever to load.  This is really bad device to use on the internet.  I've downloaded all of my files to this device and I can't find them on my system.  If you have them on your system this would be fine if you download them.  You will still have to use a web browser to get to your website.  A lot of websites will be unresponsive to you unless you click the link from the system to the website and then reload the page.   This system has a built in error log which you can access with a web page browser.  For example, the log for your system says "I can't believe I bought this thing.  It works, but I'd like to use my regular system next year or if you do download anything on your web browser and need to reinstall the web browser just follow the instructions from the log.  The log also says that some parts of the software have been tested for Windows XP.  However, I purchased this thing from a source and was told that Windows XP is not supported on this version of the operating system.So, I don't know.  My advice to other users is to download anything and run it to see if the problem is resolved.  There were several different versions of this software and none of the instructions I received in the log told you how to get Windows XP and that operating system on the system. This could be resolved with a lot of effort.  Anyway, I tried it and everything worked but I would suggest that any of you with Vista/XP/2000 be careful about this one.  Unfortunately, Windows XP would be useless without Internet Explorer and without the ability to run a web server, so I'm going to buy this software to try and fix the problem in my regular unit which I will test as soon as I can.  But even if the system worked with Vista, I'd be forced to wait for a complete reboot before I could use it again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone is very weak.  The dials are too small and it's not easy to use.  I have found it to be a real burden to try to use, and I have to do some research on the internet to find ways to make the phone work on some older computers.  It works best on older PCs with the dials down and the computers with the CD player and cd.  As a bonus, you can just use your computer to download some new games and use the CD in your car.  This is a great feature, but I can't say I'd recommend using it for anything except looking at the internet or playing new games.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried to order several items and the site said it would have to wait.  I would order it again if I found another one.  They were selling the same items as I had purchased.  The customer service rep had the same name as the site's owner 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The instructions are very basic and require the user to type it in.  After a couple of attempts, I was able to type in a few numbers to input the device in the phone and it worked with the screen.  The screen does have a very low resolution that can't handle all of the data you would like to have.  However, the user interface is nice and easy to use.  It has a very easy-to-use dialer and a nice list of contacts.  I tried to type my own names in to see if my contacts were listed, and they were not.  My friends were able to find their own phone numbers with the dialer.  This phone had many glitches, and I was not able to use it.   It worked well enough for the first two months, but now seems to have some serious bugs with the display.  If you want to take pictures of your car and other things, the display does not do a good job of showing them.  There is an update available now, but it is not compatible with all the devices that use the standard version.  One device had an error message that showed the user a list of possible fixes for the errors in the device that would not be compatible with the standard software.  They are included with the updates for the original devices.  A number of them worked but there are many that won't work on the new version of the software

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit has a built in alarm clock.  I just have to press the button in the lock slot to activate.  It works great with other devices and it can't be changed to anything other than a lock by the customer.  If the customer wants the alarm system to be used with any other equipment they have to have the button changed.  The system works for only 9 months of standby.  When in standby mode, it doesn't do anything on its own unless activated by the user.  So it's not really designed to operate independently unless the user knows what is going on.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had purchased this item in August, the "hardware" has stopped functioning well. The firmware that we have in the market is of such poor quality that even if the software were changed, it would not be compatible with all OS's that are being installed. The web interface is buggy as well.  There is no manual and all the user data that was in place when we bought it, including the address book, the list of contacts and the calendar were destroyed.  The only time that I could find a new "firmware" install was after we had paid our purchase.  When I tried to reinstall the software, my computer would not work at all with this address book and calendar, which is now permanently destroyed. I have not yet received the email from Amazon about this problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery seems fine, but the LEDs are less than desirable.  A number of problems with this unit:1.  The LED is bright enough, but not as bright as a "normal" one.  So if you use a blue light, it will be hard for the green and orange parts of the tree to show the blue glow of the original unit, making the tree stand out.  I was able to get the "tree" parts of tree with the light, but didn't like this unit.  This unit is great for the "normal", or the blue light.2.  Although the trees are bright, the unit does not provide the green or orange lights, but rather just the blue.  Using a light-source other than the LED, and turning it on at night, I was very pleased with the tree with light from the blue LEDs.  (For some reason, the LED display does not have a green light setting; the battery does have a setting for "light" or "normal")3.  It doesn't work with any of the lights on my laptop.   Using the green light on the laptop, the tree stands out as the "green" lights on the unit, rather than the green tree light.  4.  In addition, a number of the trees in my yard worked fine.  Also, the battery has trouble keeping up with the demand of the units and the tree.  If I need to go outside, I'll have to turn it off and reset it to get it to work with my laptop again.  There are some instructions, but they are in Japanese.  Don't expect this unit to work in the US, since a number Japanese models have been shipped overseas.  On the bright side, the display can be reset, but I can't find an easy way to reset it.5.  My first attempt at resetting it, I got a "No Signal" message.  Since this unit came without a software CD, I downloaded a large number of CDs and tried resetting the unit several times in the hopes that I could get it working in the future.  Eventually it went dark.  After several attempts I was successful in resetting.  Once I did, I set up the "blue" tree display with a blue-green light.5a.  Unfortunately, the blue-orange trees were not bright enough with the blue display 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this one as a Christmas gift. It arrived a day after Christmas, and I haven't been able to use it because it didn't come with a battery charger.  It comes with a paper case that holds the battery in place, but it doesn't come equipped with any buttons, no display, no driver, etc.  The case doesn't even have a protective case.  My phone won't work with the screen on.  After I tested this phone, I realized I was missing some features that I wanted and couldn't figure out how to get them.  But I still want to return it.  I'm not sure what the big problem is, but I'll let you know if I figure it out.  Also, the battery can't be used on any other phone, not even the original, which is in the shipping case.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   You won't get any support on this phone.  It does work but  you need to use it as your primary phone when you are on the road and don't use it in your apartment when you have the Internet.  My roommate had issues connecting to the Web and even with all of my Internet services, she found a way to get it working on her computer.  She was not able to get the phone to work when I was in the apartment or when it had Internet service.  There are no features that the phone can be configured for this model and I haven't had any experience with the web browser, nor can I imagine a home web site to find it.  The phone is slow.  This was an expensive phone when I bought it and the service is not up to the same standard as my computer 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product's design is absolutely horrible.  You get a yellow screen, and it's difficult to look at anything on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone has the same battery as my phone on another phone!  I thought this is a little disappointing, but they did get them on the shelf of the electronics store to try and make them fit.  A lot of these phones were in very good condition.  However, the battery I received didn't fit in the case the battery provided and I had to go to the store and purchase a second battery that did fit.The case was also slightly loose in some areas and I just bought a case I could swap out at my convenience.  I also purchased a battery that fits the phone in the original packaging.  While I have the case on my phone, I use it for a few moments on my airplane.  After that, the case and the original battery both have failed.   A friend of mine who had a similar phone to mine received one.  In addition, I don't have any battery replacements at the moment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this and after the first use of it, it got to the point where the screen is not functional with a DVD player. It was not supported with any other computer that I tried. The only way you can get a disc is to put the disc on a reader that will read the disc. I didn't get around to getting it set up with any of my other PCs.  This is a problem that needs fixing.  It was a serious problem with the first machine I purchased.  There are many problems with this machine.  You can see some pictures that people had worked on this machine before. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   i bought a used card and could not get it to print anything.  I had to reinstall it.  This card works perfectly on a pda, but it is a pain to operate.  In the end, my printer ran out of ink and then ran out.  It was a good idea to buy it cheap.  That was the only reason I got it. i got rid of it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for my daughter. We tried to operate it for her and she did not work. The screen has a very small display and the screen could not be turned off and it is so dark. It has a "lock" function that allows you to disable the screen. It is not very user friendly, there are no buttons to turn on and off, so there is a "locked" version of the screen available. This is a nice device. I ordered the locked version. I contacted a customer service agent who contacted me that same day. I explained that the locked model was actually the same as the normal model but the firmware was different and it could not control the screen or any other functionality of the device.  I did not know how to fix it. My daughter did not want to use the device anymore. The agent suggested that my daughter could use it with her Xbox and that I should get another version of it for my husband. I sent her the new firmware (which was released April 30th) and she said that she did like playing on the Xbox and she was getting "in and out of this" easily.  However, this product did not allow you to use your Xbox with it.  This model has a new "lockdown" button which is very useful for controlling the system.  You have to unplug the console, plug it back in, and reboot. The "lockup" function allows you access to the Windows control panel which allows you control of your Xbox and the ability to change the resolution.  If you do not have a Windows computer with you, then the system works without a Windows PC.  It was also useful for playing some games that the Xbox couldn't play.I also tried using it on the XBOX, but I just installed it and used it with a manual.  The XBOX does not work with this device.My daughter wanted to use her PC and I have purchased a new one with a separate "user" account.  With the other system, the "user." account does not recognize the Microsoft password.  So I had to create a new user account to access the "PC" functions.  Using the new PC, it worked with Windows.  My daughter's XBOX works well with her and her XBL. I am now using it with my Xbox 360. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you have any problems, the phone itself was a complete waste of space and cost almost the same as the phone I already owned.  I had my original cellular phone that worked.  My home wireless system has also failed.  The best I could get was to be able to "re-configure" my number 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The software was not stable when launched from my computer, I had to reload a previous version, this new version has fixed most of the bugs on my  PC. But now the program has a serious issue with the ability to run the game.  You can now see the cursor, but the mouse and keyboard were not able to find the mouse button.  I tried using the button to zoom the cursor in and out (I cannot do this with a normal mouse, so you have to hold the mouse with one hand) and in addition, I tried the same button to scroll up and down, both buttons are unusable.  The mouse button does have the cursor to move in and down the mouse area (and the button can be pressed to go back and forth to zoom and scroll up/down).  I've since reset and it does not work with the mouse anymore.  Now the mouse pointer is locked on the left side of the screen (i.e. the cursor cannot be moved, even if the mouse is moved up/ down the entire screen), and the game will not be playable at all without the mouse.  So if you really want to play, it is quite cumbersome and you must hold the game in your hand to see the game (which causes a slow game).  For those who are having problems playing, I've used the mouse to enter the game menu and the cursor.  But again, you will have to play the game as it was when you loaded it.  This will be quite a hassle to do with a standard mouse.I've since sent a copy of the game back and will see how it plays without the ability of the cursor and mouse. I did not have the mouse key available on the computer when I sent the game to the publisher, so that may well be the source of the problem.  To be clear, the game is playable with the cursor on screen, with the game menus open, and a normal  mouse.The game is fun to play and I'd say worth the effort to get into, it works, but not the right features.  If you try to go outside of the house (which may be a good thing, the PC isn't as powerful as some of the other games) it will freeze up completely, so be sure you have a copy (it does have a limited lifetime warranty).  But if you are stuck with this PC, you cannot play the games that I had tried to launch
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the same as the old one I bought. If you buy this, you will need to purchase new tires to use for the trip. I have tried to use this one for about a week and am unable to make any changes to the controls. I am waiting for some new owner to contact me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit works with my wife's car in our back yard. The GPS is very unstable and we have to have someone to monitor the position. The satellite system works with our mobile phone. A friend with a car was able to get an unregistered GPS in the first place. I purchased a license to use the system. This device is a disaster. I was expecting a better product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The box itself is great. But it has a built in CD and an option to burn a CD and a CD.   It also has a CD burner and some sort of memory.  Unfortunately, I found that there are no tools for burning CDs on my CD player.  I have not been able to find this option on the menu.  This may be a problem for some.  It is also unclear why I did not receive a CD with the box or burned a CD from my CD burner, but I don't think there is an option that allows the CD burner to be turned off 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing was terrible.  I had an antenna that didn't work well in my car and that would not work in the airport.  In fact, I found it hard to believe that the product was worth the price.  It was certainly not worth the $60 that I paid for it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have seen several different versions and a few different features, some better than others.  The software also fails to recognize some of the more recent phones that have come out and can't make calls to non-US numbers.  I had an earlier model with the same problem and couldn't get ahold of a technical support person to troubleshoot the problems.  Phone numbers were also too long, so I lost my number before I ever called anyone.  If you call to one of those numbers, you get an automated message saying that you are not eligible to use a certain phone system.  This is a nice system for making calls to numbers on the go.   The problem with this system is that you can't call your local number in a foreign country.  You can only call your home number in the US.  And if you ever need to use an alternate number for an in-flight phone call, you will need to dial back to your previous number.  There is also an issue with the system that will not let you call numbers outside of your region.  All in all, this software isn't very user-friendly and the customer support is very poor.  My phone number, for example, doesn't work for anyone in my home country.The last version, version 2.0.2. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It may not be stable in its new housing. I have a couple of windows which I opened, but did not get to grips with the mouse, and therefore I had to stop using it. I don't mind it, but I do need to purchase a new mouse for my Mac.I am on a long plane trip tomorrow and cannot test it for now.I may not have time tomorrow to try and get it fixed. But I'll update the review if necessary.I think it works fine in windows, but it has a very limited range for this device. This may have some technical problems for Macs. If anyone has experience with the MAC OS with this mouse, please let me know. I did try to send the new firmware to Mac-users, but unfortunately, I have only gotten this firmware update after the release of the new Mac. I tried this once, and I was able to upload it.I did not try it in my old Mac, and it seems to work fine, so I may still be able to fix this.The mac user interface is very clunky, and for some reason I cannot get a "check" button. I can't use the mouse while on a Mac and I will need to keep it in a folder or on a usb flash drive for the mac, not the mac itself. I will update this review later, if I need to update this mouse.The user interface seems very limited for the Mac, which is very limiting. Also, you can't move the cursor on Mac OSX. I am on mac, but am not able to update the firmware to change this, as it seems not designed for Mac OS X. My suggestion would be to go into the user interface, and you may need to "update" the firmware.As with the Mac release, I did have a chance to update to the new OS, and this has helped my mouse to work with a "standard" mouse trackpoint and mouse wheel. I installed this on my Mac (which is a Mac-PC compatible) and had a look around. However, I still cannot get the "check buttons" in the user menu. I'm a Mac user, but do not buy this mouse with Mac OS. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the wrong item and returned it as a different one, in a different color and size.  I had purchased this as a replacement before getting the original and was not satisfied with the performance and features of the original.  The new one is not as robust and it does not work well with the original system.  It did not work for me either.  In fact, it would not start or run my computer (it would crash).  I was able to do this on my laptop.  This computer would not be compatible with the operating system on my main computer (i.e. i.e., no booting).  The only way I could boot up the system, as with the other computer, was to use a different computer.  Since the OS is different, it was not able to start my Mac on my mac (or Mac on Mac), even if I had just a different hard drive.  When I tested this on the Mac, I had the computer crash with a blue screen error message (this one is different than the one on my new system).  This system is now not recommended to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The key doesn't come out of the socket. I thought it would be a nice idea to have one of the keys in your pocket but that didn't work, either. If you don't have one and the phone is in your car, it's really hard to turn it on... 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was a very slight amount of interference with my audio jack in my car that kept playing that loop of the movie, and made the radio play the same thing, even though it is a loop. This was also an issue in the car when the battery was on, since it had to be switched for the radio, which would then jam the radio. Since it was so much cheaper to purchase this item than purchase and run the radio loop than to purchase and operate it as a battery, I'm guessing that these problems occurred with other units. I have the radio at work, so I will listen to the movie and the news, but when I'm driving, I'll probably find some place to swap it back and forth, which was the easiest solution. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is not stable and sometimes it has issues with the software. I use a program called "Hacking Tools" to get around and it has problems with some screens.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The thing wouldn't work, and it was great for the first month.  After that, it just got slower and slower, and I had to get another one for my daughter.  My wife got one and it worked OK, but it took her more time to set it up than I did.  The software didn't work with the old operating system anymore.  I couldn't get it to start up.  Eventually I had her set the radio up so that it would switch in a new operating system.  And after that, when she tried to play an old radio station, she had to change stations to the new radio.  So she had a choice of going to a different station or getting another radio to reset the radio.My wife's radio also works fine now, and she has it for her daughter, but she still has the same problem with the new one.  But she got it because she wanted to have one for her own.  She said it worked well, but there's a lot of it.  When I changed stations in the old system, the radio would just lock up.The new software is more complicated than the old one, and that's something that you have to get used to, especially when you have a new family member with whom to use the radio in your home.  You have to type in the station name, number of channels, and frequency range to use a specific frequency.  That made things very frustrating when I tried to use my daughter's station, and had to re-enter her station's frequency range.  If you go to her station, you can't type in her frequency range (or it won't work).If you want to find a station that works with your new software, just enter the station's name and number of frequencies, and the new software will show you stations from other frequencies in your area.  One of the stations that works on the new version of this radio is just a single channel.  On the old software, there were two channels, each with its own frequency range, and two radios.  They're very easy to set up and use, but they both have the same problems with older software that I had.So you can see, this was not a bad radio, but the software and the problems with it were a pain in the rear.  It doesn't work well with the older version of the operating system and it's hard to find stations with frequency range other
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The plastic had a bad seal and was not as strong as the one I bought, so I had to replace the plastic with a different one, and it still had some problems.  A lot of them needed repair or replacement.  I was having a hard time using the printer for anything other than printing or copying documents, so that was a big improvement.  But, the problem was that all sorts of other things, like the ink cartridge and the paper, would occasionally need to be replaced.  The ink that I had printed some documents was not a good match with the documents I was using.  So the ink would fail to write the documents in a way that is pleasing to the eye.  Also, a paper that had a small piece of tape on it was not able to handle all the ink and was defective.  This had all caused some problems with copying documents

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After a very long time, it was finally broken! (Which was great because I bought this on a flight.)  I ordered this on December 31st and it has been stuck in my computer since then.  It will not turn on without a driver.  The driver will not run on my PC!  I am having to reset my machine from its own settings.  I bought a new battery and that worked for a week, but this week it will not work, so I am back to the starting point.  This is a huge mistake.  A lot of work has gone into this device.  In comparison to the other devices, it is not that great and I am returning it tomorrow.  Don't waste your money on this device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device could not be paired with my laptop.   It is not able to work with my printer, either.  The instructions are not very clear or straightforward 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD player seems to be more reliable and a lot less of a burden on my hands, but the audio is not the best (like some of the CD players). I tried to play a movie clip, which is the only way to watch a DVD. The DVD would have to be manually selected.The discs themselves were easy to pull from the shelves.I was able to get some use out of my DVD's after I opened them and then tried to insert them into the DVD players.  These discs could be selected on the DVD player.  I do not recommend the player unless you have an extra DVD and a cd-rom.  The discs were labeled in the DVD-player with a green barcode and a serial number.  (The serial number is a 4 digit number and the CD-roms have the serial number printed on them.  This has the potential to be a problem, but is not a huge problem for my use.)  I purchased two discs from Amazon.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this tablet in March 2014 because the battery does not work and after about 15 months of operation I stopped updating it because it was giving me bad results.  If I tried this device again with this battery, it would die.  This device is very slow and has an LCD that is not up to par.  I don't recommend this device.  After 15 months on the market, the battery was discontinued and they did not replace the LCD with a new one.  The LCD was not compatible with newer operating systems, so I had to switch to a different one every time I did updates

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is great for its price tag, but the color of the text is less than desirable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem here is that the software isn't intuitive and often fails to start up correctly on different devices. I've been working with it on my  desktop for some time and, while it may work on some devices, I had no luck on the desktop.    If you have any problems at all with this software, you should get in touch with Apple directly 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device will work if you use the wireless card for the first time, but it will not store its data.  It can be reset with a reset code that is included in the box.  The code for the reset code will not work with all units.  Please be aware that if you install this code on a different unit, you will have to enter the code again, and it will fail.  This is a defect with the unit itself and is not corrected with firmware.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone after a few months and was informed on the warranty that would expire in 6 months.  I did not receive the paperwork until a month later, after a year.  This phone has been in use since then and has had all sorts of issues.  In addition to not working with the internet (which is a pain in this particular model) and showing up sporadically for various services.  It is no longer listed as being in my service book. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thing after just 3 weeks of shipping, but the software has been so buggy that I am having problems downloading or updating this thing. It would have worked great for several weeks, but I guess it's too late in the season. I really do like the design, but have had it for only 6 months.  The software is pretty basic, and the only reason I downloaded this software is because it was offered in free trials.The user interface is not intuitive, and I have found no way to get any other information than the trial version. I will be buying a full version for purchase after I get the trial software working, which is a waste of money for a user like me. If I ever get the full version installed and I go to use it for anything but that I find it to be buggy and buggy.  If this product were an ordinary consumer product it would work perfectly

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this device since November of 2005. I'm now in my 10th year of owning this device. After the warranty expired, I purchased an extra $100 to replace the battery, but it is still in operation. I tried changing the settings from factory defaults to their default ones, and now I have to reset the phone. I also have to unplug the antenna at least once every 30 days because it is connected to a radio signal. The battery is not in any of the batteries that I've purchased from Amazon. The Amazon site also has a service that has recently been disabled. This device has a built-in microphone (which is also not user-configurable), and an "always on" radio. The antenna is an accessory that can be plugged in. I bought one of these antenna to use in my yard when I'm trying to get rid of the antenna in my house (this is a pretty bad antenna). I just recently bought a manual for this device, and it also has instructions for installation on a PC (which I bought).

We bought it because we wanted to check the time on the clock.  When we had an iPod to charge, we had to go back into the app to find out if it's working.  Even then, you can only see a map and a clock.This is a total waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The plastic was not well made, and I would have been disappointed with the lack of flexibility.  I kept it until I could replace it with something else, then discarded the old version, which I now have.  Since then, I've been having trouble with the software and it still isn't easy to find things, but it's okay if I try.  My experience was that I've had a hard time finding anything I like to use, and the interface is so slow and clunky.  The only reason I'm using it now is because I wanted the experience of typing in my address.  As I recall, I only have two keys - a shift and a backspace key.  It's possible I've made a mistake somewhere.  But it's always been hard to figure out how to set up my computer, so it isn't exactly intuitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The button didn't work and you couldn't get a "OK" button working (the other ones just didn't have the "OK".  It worked well when it worked, but I kept getting the "DUN".  I'm going to get a refund as I've already spent $80 on this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm happy with the color but the black border in some of the cards in my home, you can't see the picture on it, it can't be zoomed in. So the picture is only half as good as the one in my phone. My wife bought this card, my card was the only one in her home that could be viewed. She didn't know what the reason was. And my card did not work with my printer.  So I called a tech person and he tried to fix it but it broke. The other cards worked, however. I called the tech company again, and he fixed the card in my car and told me I had to purchase a new card at a regular price. It cost me $35.  My wife couldn't figure out why the tech guy was so reluctant to help with the card. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a great product, however there are a few flaws with it.  One, it works poorly with all the movies I've been able to produce.  I'd estimate 50% of the time you'd be able to identify a bad DVD before you'd actually purchased it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It was difficult to find a good antenna for my wife. It worked great the first couple of days, but stopped working on the last, after a week. The signal strength was good, but the signal was too weak for us to receive anything. My wife was able to receive signals from other stations and was still able to use the TV, but this was the only antenna that worked well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone can be a real pain in the ears, so often I would have to switch it to talk with people in a loud environment or talk to a large number of people.  One of the worst aspects is, it requires a lot of battery usage and charging the device up from one battery to many is a very slow process, which can slow the device's performance.  A lot of devices that I've seen on ebay in the past months are advertised to work with 3 batteries in the package.  The customer service department was great when I had questions, but they always took the phones back.  There have also been problems with battery issues in previous model year.  But the customer service reps I spoke with were helpful in explaining the process.  They said that the problem is not related to battery, but to software, and that new software will be released for new model year and this is how they fix the problem.  So that's a good sign. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried to connect to some internet that my friends used, but was unable to do so.  There were also times when I was trying to connect from outside of my house, which made me think that it was broken, but I have not tested it with my IP.  I was not able to connect a wireless router that I was using.  This router works well enough for my laptop, but for the router and a second device I had to remove the firewall to use it.  My laptop was able to communicate with my wife's home router (not an Internet gateway).  This is a very small router.  It is able to function, and is connected to my laptop but it does not come with software for my wife or I to set up the router for the two devices.  When my laptop and my wife communicate, the device can be configured as a firewall, however it is unable to allow connections from the network that is not the internet router.I bought the new router for my husband (with no software installed).  I am going back and changing the firewall settings to allow the new software and to allow my laptop to connect (which my wife and I had attempted).  My wife is having an easier time with the setup, as she does not need to know about the firewall setup.  The router was very easy to set-up, however the software is cumbersome, difficult to use, and very slow to load.  While on the Internet, it requires you to click to the "upgrade" button and then to update the software.  You may also need to uninstall software from your Windows XP home directory before downloading the files.  We tried setting up some other things and also attempted to set it up with my own Windows XP laptop that my wife used.  In both cases, the setup worked great for the first time.  However, we were unable to get it to work for the new firewall software.I have tried it with several other users.    One user with Windows Vista and Windows XP was able set it-up as we configured it. (I do not have a Vista or XP laptop with me anymore.)  There is no information on the web site that I can find about setting up the firewall for the internet.  Also, we did not find an FAQ about the wireless router to be found in the Internet documentation, so I purchased a copy and I checked to see if it is known.  Nothing is.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device I received is a single unit with 8GB of RAM and a CD-RW.  This is not compatible with all systems.  I am now using a portable device with 4GB of memory (one of my laptops) to run Linux, which was what I wanted.  Linux runs well and the CD-WRODRW has been working well, and I downloaded all the software necessary to the CD (no software problems).  It works and works well.  The CD-RODRW works.  So I've now got a CD of Windows that I use (and, in case I need to run Windows XP).  I downloaded and installed all the required software (the CD).  Linux now works and the software is easy to use and the system works. The operating system has been stable.  On the CD there is an option to run the Windows boot loader, but I've never used it, and don't plan on doing so.  If I'm ever away from the CD, the CD will simply stop functioning.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this model and I have had problems with it. I ordered this with a coupon from the store, the same coupon that the store uses for the phone and the free plan (you can turn on a free plan with the phone, but the company does not recommend using a free phone with the free plans).The plan is supposed to be a replacement for your current plan; it is not a full plan (it does not include internet access).I tried purchasing a new phone with a full service plan, but it was not available.I returned this phone with some problems; I did not receive the coupon that was promised on the coupon, and the coupon was supposed to cover all my plan charges and any new phone charges I incurred.  This was the only way I could get a free service plan.  I returned the phone several times with my phone (and internet), and the phone (which is now out of service) is now in its original packaging and can no longer be used to make a call.I contacted customer service several times and was asked several times to get a coupon; all the coupon I have received has not worked (at least not with the plan that the coupon is used with), nor does the coupon cover my plan. I cannot believe that this coupon was purchased by anyone. I am going to write to my credit card company and try to get the phone back to replace the coupon.I have returned the original phone, it is currently on eBay. I received a new coupon (which has worked with the one I received on the new phone) but it does not cover the service plan (which still does not have internet access) as well as the free phone charges

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones don't really do anything. There is a slight delay. This will be nice if you are doing some sort of audio conference with someone else, but for the most part these headphones do nothing for my phone. I wish that these would be useful for a person who is walking around and listening to the radio, but the wireless capability has poor range for even a single user.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my copy a few weeks ago.  I am using this copy to review my book on Amazon.  My copy does not have the book cover in it yet.   So I will be able to see the cover of the book and review the book.  After that, I'll consider a future purchase.  But I must say that this copy is a nice book cover.  Also, it is readable on the cover. So it is a fine book cover for the book as well as the Kindle.  However, it does not require a Kindle to read the book 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was never able to get it to work.  Its like a clunky plastic version of a small CD player.  i kept it for a short while, and after a while it stopped working.  I tried another, and that worked, but the first one didn't.  Then it stopped responding too.  It's not a bad device, but its definitely not up to the same standard as the original CD player, which is a good product.  The CD player is not very user friendly.   It will hang up after a few days of operation, and it will not stay put. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit has a great speaker but the sound quality is horrible, and the speakers don't work in conjunction with the phone.  It is too sensitive.  There is also no GPS.  This one will not work unless you disable the unit.   (The GPS antenna is very sensitive to radio stations.  I use this feature to track the car.)  When the GPS signal is weak, the GPS is not accurate.  You can't use it to find your way to your home or your office.  The unit was purchased as a gift, so it should work when you return it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The software was so poorly installed that it made it impossible to use it.  I tried to change some settings but they were never updated and there were no instructions.  The installation process took a few minutes.  My software was supposed to be installed in order to run an online version of the site.  There was no online version available when I installed my software.  After a few days the site was down for maintenance but that did not help.  However, the web browser was very slow and I had to refresh the web page and then refresh the entire software to get it to work.  On the day it was installed I tried for the first time to load an online website and was unsuccessful

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device, as mentioned earlier, is a joke. The buttons work but the screen is very dim. This is one of the worst things I ever bought. The battery is great but the dial was too sensitive and too fast.  When I tried to use the dial I had to press it and hold it steady on the screen.  After awhile it began to break.  The battery was not the problem with this device.  It was the sensitivity of the dial that caused the problem.  I was able to get through the first 2-3 months, but then it began running down.  Eventually the battery died.  At this point it will be very difficult to get it to work, but it works.    The phone was working for the first time on March 18th.  This phone uses a separate battery for each of the two radios.  In the spring this phone will have a very poor reception.  My personal suspicion is that the radio frequency is tuned in this phone to the same range as my radios and it will have to have a much better radio antenna 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this phone in a pre-paid and refurbished version from Amazon for $35.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These headphones are great and they are great quality and comfortable.  However, you can't operate them with the remote if you don't have the buttons.  A remote is included.  If you have the remote you can use the remote but the controls can't be operated via remote.  The volume and mute buttons are on the headphones, so use the headphone controls.   The headphone controls are not wireless.  I have not found a way to use the microphone on them but the headphone has a microphone in it.  My suggestion is to buy new batteries.  There are no batteries for the batteries.The headphone controls on these headphones are very hard to use.  You need to be able to operate them and have them in a pocket or bag.  Also, the microphone needs a way for the user to adjust the frequency so that it will work properly when used on the radio.  These will work for the radio but not with the radio unless you use the audio controls on the remote to adjust it.The microphone works but I don't recommend using the microphone to communicate with the user of these headphones.  Don't buy these headphones if you plan on using them to use with the wireless remote.I don't even like the headphones on these, but you can see where someone has put the remote in there so that you can operate the remote.The wireless remote will be compatible with the first 2 models.  (I don?t have a current date for this because of the different models. If you do have one, I suggest that you try out the audio settings in the remote so that the headphones can be used with the radios.  Just try them out with the receiver and wireless radio. I hope this helps

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really disappointed with this item.  I will not use it.  The only thing that was wrong was the battery charger did not come with any of the instructions, so it came with this "user guide" that had to be printed out on paper.  And when I printed this instruction manual, I found the instructions to be very basic.  They had to do with a power adapter and batteries, which I purchased.  But this is what was needed for the batteries.  A power adapter was also included with the printer.  However, it did not work.  This made the printer very unstable and did not have the ability to print well.  After several tries, I got a picture of the battery chargers that came with the batteries for sale at Walmart.  At Walmart, they do not have this "helpful" instruction manual with them.  Walmart would not sell the battery unless I paid for the printer and batteries separately

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone is way worse than the original.  It works, but the screen is not very good.  The controls are very weak.  I tested out of the store one or two times, and did not get the signal.  You can only find it on the web and in the manual.   I just installed it, as suggested.  In other words, it is not a "new" phone.  What a let-down.  For the same price I could get a $50 phone.The only difference is that the color has the "newer" model numbers.  This would indicate that the old numbers are still used by the network.  So it is definitely not a new phone from the factory.  If you have the number plate in the old handset, the new model plates will need to be ordered

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device did not work right.  I tried to use the web browser, which caused the browser to freeze up.  It froze every 10 seconds or so.  The website was not accessible from the browser.  There was no "refresh" button to get it working.  At this point I thought I was getting a temporary temporary hack, rather than the real thing.  For those of you who know what a temporary hack is, it will work better.  However, the web site does not work in the browser either.  (I have not tried it in a real browser, but I would not bet my money on the web server crashing soon.)  I did try to open a real web site in the web client.  While I was able to get a server on line, it crashed at about the time I began to use it.  To my knowledge, this is the only time this has happened with the device.  In the meantime I could not get this device to work.  If I was to purchase it again, I would have to purchase a new browser and try to get that to work from here

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In general I have been very happy with this item.  I bought it because it was not compatible with my CD player.  On my CD players I have used the option "2", which allowed me to use my DVD player.It's a nice feature but for the CD player, it's too slow.  Also, the buttons have a different operation when in a CD player mode.  The "2" button works the same way in CD player and DVD mode, but when I tried that, I found that I had to move my thumb to the other side of the button to use it.  This is a very inconvenient button design, because when I had the DVD player turned on, I was able to go back to my CD menu, change the speed, and use the "2"... and this was not intuitive and difficult to learn for me.  However, I did learn how to use the button.  It is a different type of button than in CD mode, so if I was trying to use an existing disc, I would have to reset the disc to make it work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this device for the first time in a while.  I just put my headphones in and it's impossible to tune in the radio.  The controls are not intuitive.  They aren't easy to use.  For example, the station list does not have a star rating system and the star ratings are only indicated at the top of the screen.  In fact, the entire radio screen is not used by the user interface.  This radio will not broadcast any programming from any stations that has a star rated radio station.  As a result, I was unable to obtain any programming in the morning, and I'm unable to get a signal at all in the evening.  So, I just tuned into the stations listed above on my computer.  These stations are not available in this region of the world.  That is why the stations are listed as "Ace Radio" on the listings page.  It is difficult to find stations at all 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the worst item in the world.  I have never tried it.  When I bought this I thought it was cool.  It just has a black antenna and a black plastic case.  A black cover that can be removed easily can be used to flip up the cover, to access the antenna and remote.  The antenna is so small, I have had to use the remote when I use the antenna to operate the device.  If you remove the cover or flip the antenna back up the device will work in any position but this one.  This device can be operated in the same way the remote works but the remote requires one button.    The device works when the remote is first used, but will not operate with any other remote.The antenna works in the device when it is first turned on, but requires the device to be turned off, reset or resetting, or turning it on and off to find the proper settings,  or with the antenna.  Again, this requires the remote to be activated or in operation

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There's no way to lock the screen in any way. The whole screen is black. It uses a standard size, so it's very easy to use and it does a good job of displaying the program. I tried it out, and it worked great. But the black screen will only work with the black program. There's a black program icon in the bottom left corner of the screen, but when I selected it, I ended up with a black screen with black program icons. It's difficult to even find the black programs using my laptop. I even tried to change it for me, and found that the black icons were black, too. So I'm pretty sure I need to keep changing the icons, so I'll have to keep on changing the black screens if I want to use any of the black pieces.The whole concept of the device was a joke.  I spent some time researching to see if this product is available elsewhere

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My wife bought this thing thinking she could use it to get things for her kids.  She was wrong.  It wouldn't load.  The manufacturer doesn't support Windows XP.  They don't even support Win XP. So I've tested it in Win XP, Win XP Pro, and Win XP Ultimate and it works perfectly in all three.  So I bought it.  I have to download the client software and use it.I had to find some information about how to set it up in WinXP as it came with Windows XP installed.  This isn't so bad.  All the information is in the support forums.  There's a guide and a FAQ.   The user interface is a mess in Windows XP, but I've found a solution in XP Pro and a similar user interface in WindowsXP.  Windows XP and WinXP Pro are the same.  You can create a batch file to install both versions on the same machine and get the client installed without a problem.  However, the guide says the client will only work with WindowsXP Professional, and I had the client on my PC, and when I tried it out, the installation would go ahead and install XP Pro instead.  No warning, just like the guide said.  Win XP had me fooled.  After installing the client, I opened it and everything worked fine on my WinXP XP desktop.  For anyone with XP Ultimate, there's no way to see it installed as a regular client (it's installed in the WinXP folder, and the user interface requires XP Pro).  That would be an even worse mistake.  A good guide is available from Microsoft, but the client itself isn't up to the standards of Windows XP Professional. I'm looking for the solution for XP Pro.  But I have a question: Why is it installed in my PC?  WindowsXP has a built-in installer that works well in XP Professional with XP Pro's User Interface.I can try getting this into XP Ultimate on the client when I get it, but this is Windows XP without XP Pro support.  If there are problems with this program, the only solution I can find is to uninstall WindowsXP Pro.This program uses a lot of RAM, so it's not ideal for the large number of people I had it set up for.  One thing about the client that bothers me is that it's a lot faster than the official client, even on the XP-

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   One of the few times I had problems is when I tried to download a large file that caused the system to hangup when I attempted to make a copy of the file. When I tried it again, the system would hangup, but would respond to me by telling me that the file is not valid. So I did a little research and found a site that I thought might help me get my file. The only problem with it, when I uploaded the file to the system, it had some sort of glitch with some of the data, and I had to delete my copy of that one. So, I re-downloaded it, and then did the same thing on another copy of my original file. My copies both hung up, I just re-uploaded the files and the system responded immediately to me. I'm not sure what caused the glitch, but I'm going to try a few things to see if that helps. I did the "unvalid file" fix in the same way.  The system still hangs up if you attempt to make copies of the files. I used it several times, and each time the system hung up and said something about it needing a reset.  This is the software that I used to get the program to hang up the first time.   The fact that this thing is just flat out not user friendly is a big problem.  It has a huge number of options that I couldn't figure out, it's not user-friendly and it just hangs up.  I tried going back and forth between the user- friendly version and the normal version, but there's just no going back, and it hung up each time, which means it hangs up your program when you're trying to use it. I think that's what's causing my problems.I really don't like this software, but it was a great program to get me started.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone to have one feature, and it does work, but it is so slow, you need to close the lid to use the phone. I bought it for a good 10 minutes, and that's when I discovered that the lid is openable. I've done this twice and the phone is functioning well.  My initial concern was that this was a common flaw with many early phones.  It also works well with the other button on the phone, which allows you to make calls and text.  I was able to text the doctor, who has a second line available.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the phone for my brother as he was coming home from work.  The phone can store a max of 50 contacts, but the dial can only dial from 5 to 9.  This is a major drawback for our family of 5.  Also, the callers cannot choose which buttons they want to press and how far they want their call to go, making it almost impossible to set up an emergency call.  I was told this phone has a "safety mode" that will allow one-way calls.  However, this mode has not been tested, so please be cautious about dialing the wrong buttons!  The feature requires you to set the dial in the "off" position.  But if the phone dial is in the correct position, it will dial the "on" position!  One would need to be careful when using this mode, because this phone will still ring in the normal position.I bought this phone to use as a calligraphy tool.  Unfortunately, it has no ability for printing anything other than a single line (which the phone's owner said has an error code that will stop calls to 975).  This phone will also not run on an IPN network.  When I tested this feature, I was informed that this phone does not have an "IPN base station".  This device needs a base station to operate.  You will need an IP address for this phone.  There is also a switch on the bottom of this phone that allows you to connect the phone to an IP number, which is used to connect to the Internet.  (When you do this, the phone will be able to receive all calls on the Internet!  You can still set up your own phone number to make calls!  But this phone is not a "regular" phone. This phone requires a special number, and a special code to access Internet services.I purchased this phone in June 2003 and bought an upgrade to the base that same month.  My brother had it installed when I got it, and it was a "new" version.  It has since been out of service for more than 3 months and has not worked well with my husband.  All of the functionality on this phone was added in March 2003.  So, it was not updated with new features, such as "safety" mode, until July 2003.So, while this phone worked great for my husband for many months, my brother's phone does function

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for my first year and had no idea what the options were, let alone what I would use them for.  The device shipped with a manual that was out of date.  I tried the machine and was forced to buy a new manual.  This would have been a good machine to try a little in my computer but it's now obsolete.  Still, the manual was the best I could find.  It contains the same basic configuration as the original model but also has some very nice features that aren't supported by the original version.  You might want to upgrade, at least try out some of the options listed for this machine.  But be warned, this product is an acquired taste and its features are not up to today's standards

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device and received my "new" order with the incorrect model number. I called Amazon's Customer Service number several times, and was told "I have a good reason to not accept the new order, and I am not happy with my product." After I had the correct version of the software, I tried installing the new software and it was still slow. I immediately called Amazon and received an automated response that "you must first register with us." After registering, I still received the same number I used for the old order, which made me suspect a number of problems. The next step was to call the 800 number, and receive an automated greeting. I did not receive the number. At this point I called the 800 hotline and talked with a lady who informed me that the registration process had not completed. I was told that I had not used my phone within the past 60 days. I spoke with a customer service agent and he told me I had to re-enter my details. I had forgotten my password and could not proceed with the registration, so I attempted to log into my account several times and I could not retrieve the registration information for the correct model number I wanted. I repeated this process several times. I attempted several different passwords and found that I still could not log into the "new model" account I wanted to use. I phoned Amazon several times after the 800 phone call. The customer service representative who spoke to me was very friendly, and the problems I had, like the defective software, were resolved. When I received the correct software I was able to successfully register it and the registration was not even a little glitch-y. I have not had to register my phone number again since the new product was launched. The software does work with all of my accounts, but is a bit slower than it was previously. If you are trying to register your number it will be an endless loop, and even if you register it before you attempt to install the product, you still have to go to the 800 telemarketing line and ask for a new registration number (because they have changed the registration number in the software). I have no idea how long this process will take. The registration for the device is a complete waste of time, and Amazon's customer service is a joke. After my account was verified, I could register it. I got to the website and registered it, but the product will not register with my card because the software was designed for a phone
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen looks good, but a lot of the features work well but they are not well integrated and have low viewing resolution (the top half of the screen has an 80x48 pixel resolution) - if I tried the other half of my screen, it would have the same resolution but would display images in its native mode. Also, the display does not look good when viewed with any color of background and it does not support the full version of the Windows operating system that comes with it - only the XP version. So, this is not a real XP, but it is a virtual machine.If you have a problem with the operating system, use it for testing purposes only - I am not recommending this for general usage

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thing to use in my wife's car (this was an older model and required the new owner of the car to download the software in order to change the default channel or the map). It did not work with my wife or I. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If I have to do this over and over, it's going to break eventually.I got the message and it's so hard to read the instructions. I have a hard time figuring out what the first few steps are supposed to be. This thing is really hard to use!It's even harder to find the device in the manual. If I do that, I can't find the "upgrade" instructions. It's the only thing in the whole system that has a manual, and I had to scan a whole bunch of pages just to figure it out.I downloaded the app on my phone and started scanning. My first upgrade request failed. My app just didn't work with the web site either. I tried everything with my phone. There is an app, a web site, an iPhone manual and a "installer" that I can download, but nothing works. If my phone doesn't work, I'll have to download everything again and do the whole thing over again.  I don't know if this thing works on my web browser, because the website says it has some issues with it.  My phone still won't work in my car.  On my laptop, it doesn't even work on my Mac because of the security checkmark.  There are three of them. The instructions are written as if I am trying to use an iPhone 4. The "updater" is supposed to work with 4.  Maybe if I use a 4.2 or 4.1 instead of 4.0.  The phone number I'm supposed to call to get an upgrade is the one that says "this device isn't compatible with 4

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product is not recommended for any camera that was installed in my computer's boot sector because the product was unable to scan the boot sector for my copy of Windows XP. The installer is configured to only install the boot version of Windows.The installer's manual is for Windows XP and was not helpful for any of my installed software.The only documentation I could find for this product's configuration was for the web site. It describes the configuration but does not cover how to set up the wireless connection with my laptop. I will not purchase any software for this device or its setup.I found this web site after a couple weeks of searching, and it did not provide any assistance or documentation of its configuration options.The product does not work with my Dell PDA-2000 and I cannot get to Windows XP with it.The website also provides a Windows Vista license but this is of no use since Vista is not currently compatible with my Windows XP installation.The documentation for the product itself is of poor quality. The only configuration option for this item that I found is the boot mode, but this configuration is not configurable and will not allow me to set it up for Windows Vista.I tried this product at several of the test points in my home. The system can still be operated on the internet. The instructions for the setup instructions are very basic and difficult to follow. The installation takes an average of 30-35 minutes on my test laptop and the setup procedure is slow and confusing to set-up.There is a warning about the installation process that the software does not install in "real" Windows. The computer is configured for my own personal use and I installed this software on my own computer because the instructions do not explicitly allow for this. This may not be a feature that I will use and may require some additional configuration from Microsoft before I can run this system. This problem can also be fixed if I find a better documentation source from Microsoft, but it is a serious drawback to this item and the installation procedure is far too difficult to get working with my computer. I am returning the product to its manufacturer as a goodwill gesture from Microsoft. I purchased the Windows XP upgrade after I was able to get the installer to set the Windows Vista boot priority in the BIOS. The upgrade did fix the problem with my XP installation, but the upgrade failed to fix my PDA with Windows XP boot priority.I have used this device before in my work environment and the product did not work well there, either.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is broken and I ordered it and got it but had a problem with it. It is only supported on Windows 7, although I bought it on my Mac, so I had to reset the Mac. I've tried this method for every version from Windows 7-8, I just could not get it working at all. It was even worse on the newer versions of Windows 8-10. It also does not support any of the OS features that the previous versions did. So you can not have the "newer versions of the program" that are on the computer. I tried this version only a handful of times and found it was very unreliable and unstable. After this version of Windows started running smoothly, the original system crashed at least two times and then rebooted itself.I used the Mac version to create a backup copy of the system with all the old version of the same program and then I got to work.I have tried the Mac versions of "Classic" and "Retro" to no avail.I was told that the Mac has a different file format for each OS and that is why it is so different

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is junk, it doesn't work, and the battery itself is too weak.  I bought this model for a friend (who bought the one for herself) to try out, and we both thought it worked better than my normal, battery-less, cell phone.  However, this phone is just a phone, not a cellular device, and you have to pay monthly fees for data and voice charges.  It is not supported by most popular networks (and will not work on my home router).  It does have the basic features that cellular phones typically do, but only in certain areas of the country (I have not been able to figure out why).  I tried a number of times to get ahold of Verizon but, like my friend's, I never heard back from a representative.  This phone is not available through Verizon stores (they carry it through a reseller on the side of the road), and, like Verizon's older phones, the wireless service itself has some bugs.  If you want to make an order and are lucky enough to find a store, buy it there 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is not very reliable and if it was working, it would not have been working when I was driving home from work on the first day.  It was also slow to respond when I called for help.  Also, the response times were very slow.  This was a problem for me and it didn't get better when I contacted the company.  I have never received a call back from the company or even an email.  After reading some of the reviews, I had hoped I was a bad customer or bad device, but this was not the case.  The only reason I am a bad review is because I bought it when the computer was released.  So the problem has probably gotten worse, not better.  My suggestion, if you can get a better device, is to buy it with a time saver feature, or if you are doing online banking on this machine, use an email client to connect to your computer.  If you plan on going to any online banking site, make sure you log out and log back into your computer before you login 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wish I could tell you it worked like an  iPhone 4, which is why it was marketed this way.  However, I did get a few of them as a test model.  They are not very reliable.  The software, when used, is glitchy and buggy.  I purchased one and used it and it worked well for a while.  Unfortunately, the next one is a dud and has broken the touchscreen in a few ways.  It would not connect to my home network 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was ok for a little while (about one month), then broke and required service.  The warranty didn't cover the entire case and the packaging, so the owner of the computer has had to do all of the work with his service manual.  In addition, the warranty doesn't cover any repairs done to software.  I contacted my credit card company to dispute this charge and to get the whole case back.  But, it seems that even this is covered by the warranty.  It has been a long time since I've opened the case and it was in such poor condition.  My phone bill hasn't been reimbursed.   I'm not sure when my phone is going to be fixed.  This is really unacceptable, and it's an affront to my privacy and to my computer's integrity

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device because I wanted something with a "hot" display in my office, but it is extremely unreliable. I've spent hours trying to get the thing to work properly. I have purchased a number of units in order to try and get a good one in stock.  When I bought mine, the "hotness" of the display is variable, and depending on what room I use it in, the user interface is variable (sometimes a nice interface and sometimes the user cannot select what color the display has). I'm now looking for a good display 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm having issues with the bluetooth that is available, the signal strength is below what is advertised. The only reason I bought the unit is so I could use it with my phone. After having used it for several weeks, I am looking at options for an update (there is an automatic updating option that does not work for this unit). If you own an  iPhone 3.x or 4.x, and you can't get an update for it on the phone, the unit will not work with your phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As a bonus, the device I received has not been used, so it is in very good condition.  I have only used it a few times and had no problems with the buttons and other controls.  It does, however, come with a small amount of memory, which means I need to get back to work with the other games (the extra memory makes things awkward).  I also used the cartridge to copy the discs of several other games.  The games work fine in the CD player.  They do not work in the DVD player.If you have trouble with the software, try updating the OS.  Update instructions were not included with my copy of the game, but the game itself says the update is available on CD-ROM.  My CD-Rom is also a valid DVD player (although, I have never used it).  On the disc it says to upgrade the OS to 1.1.1 (which seems to work fine).  The CD-rom version says 1.0.6 on the back.The games are OK for playing, although they do have the potential for crashes on occasion.  However, this is to be expected with any game with CD-related issues.  When I downloaded the game from the web, it worked fine.  There are no known bugs with the games.The CD-player does work fine for viewing the movies.  You can select any CD-TV channel you choose and watch the movies in the same way that the movie is displayed on a TV.  If you watch in the television, you can choose to start or stop the movie when you are not watching.  Unfortunately, this CD-cassette player did not come with any documentation, but this information is on the web.  In addition, there is some helpful online instructions and support pages.This CD- player is no longer being produced

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you want to use a keyboard with the arrow keys (a feature on the front and back of the keyboard), there is no arrow keys, or the back button is disabled. The arrow keys are a little difficult to use in this application. If you use the arrow buttons, you can only use the front arrow keys. The back button has a similar function, but the arrow key functions are a much better option for general navigation and such. I am only using the arrows key, because I'm not really confident in the keys on this board, which makes me think it's not designed to handle general usage.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My friend had the device for less than a year and it stopped functioning correctly after that.  The device is very slow, takes forever to load the image, and the only way to load a new image is to "recycle" a previous image.  This requires a lot of trial and error to get the right image, which is slow and sometimes gives me an error message.  On rare occasions, this can also cause the device to malfunction.  It does, however, work in some cases, but the image is still very slow.  (It was not intended to be used with Windows XP.) The image quality is very low and not recommended.  I have a much better, more recent device.  Also, the image I tried working with Windows Vista was less than stellar.  Microsoft stopped supporting this device after the first year (and the only new update that I could find after the last support window.)  Microsoft has a very "special" customer service team who have been great, but have yet to answer my queries.  There is some good info on the web at http://support.microsoft.com/kubuntu.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I do like the battery and it seems to work OK. I just bought it a few months back and tried it a little bit, and the "auto-adjust" doesn't work for me. I was able to use it with a laptop (the auto-adjust is good, though) but I was unable to use my phone. It does have the ability to save photos for later and some ability to print. I tried to do both.The problem is, this model has a limited battery life. If you have more than 10 shots or 2.5 hours of battery life, it stops working after that long. I purchased a new battery at the cost of some money and just did some research on it.The model with a longer battery life (which I did not purchase) has the ability for a "hot" mode that will give you a longer charge. This mode is useful, but not as good as the "normal" mode. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery is cheap, but I'm afraid that it doesn't last more than 2 or 3 charges in a normal use of it, so you can't use it without charging or it will run out of juice. The battery does get HOT in the middle when it charges

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As soon as I bought this product the LED's worked, but with the software installed, I had to install the firmware upgrade and then it wouldn't run for the most part. Then, it did work for me, but the new firmware caused a bug in the program that prevented the system to recognize my user ID number. So, it would reset and then have to reset again. It worked for a while, but I could get it to work with the latest firmware, but only on my computer (not my phone). The problem there was that I couldn't get it right.I went through several of my friends' computers to try to find out what was wrong with it. But, that was my main computer, and for all intents and purposes, it worked fine.I did see a few reports about the old and new firmware and it was identical in functionality but the differences in the interface are subtle. I believe it's because I have a certain configuration I like and other people have different setups.I just purchased an identical copy for my phone so I have one that works, and I have the older one now for my other phone. I'm trying to decide which one to keep.I don't want to mess with it anymore.  So, I'm just going to use my phone and update my drivers.

When I tried to set it up on the laptop, I got to where I was prompted for the password (and I don't remember it).  It is very frustrating and the "auto reset" doesn't work and I tried changing it to a different password.

This laptop has worked very well for me in this role, and when I had bought it on May 1, I just changed the password.However, I have this laptop with me at work on occasion.  On the other hand, the "other" version of the laptop I had when I got this computer was not working for me (I did use it at work).  I have no idea how that is possible.  Do I have to go to the store to change this password?  I used the same password that I was using to change the password in April.

I will update this software every now and then, but I am not sure if it is compatible with older versions of Windows, but the software has been very slow since I got it. I have not used this phone with any software that runs directly on the network, but it would be a good idea to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used the same card for about a year and it does not work with a Mac.  It also will not work on a Windows machine.  I bought this card at Wal-Mart and the Mac will never be used.  The manufacturer's website is very basic, and the device is no longer supported.  This is the same as the one described above.  Please take note that the user manual recommends using it with a mac.  (I guess I used the right version.)  I used it this way because my Mac would crash if I used a pc.  Do not buy this card, I suggest you use the one you have on your computer, in your phone.    This one has a lot more of the software to it, though, so I used mine.  If I used this one, I would be forced to buy the drivers for the mac. The mac is an okay device, but it's very slow.  Use this one.  Now, it works with macs as well.  But if I use it with mac's, my mac will freeze or it will not boot.  Then I get a black screen that I cannot see.  And then I have to uninstall the mac driver, then reinstall it.  So you do not have to worry about having to remove the drivers from your mac. I had to reboot mine after the mac froze, to get it working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the same card as the one that I used to create my "good" card, and was disappointed.  I bought a couple of new cards.  As expected, the good card was more compatible with the printer.  The problem was that the software was set up to create cards of varying sizes, and some printers will not print smaller cards than others.  To my surprise, I also found that it printed all of the cards I had tried at a certain point in the process.  However, this was fixed in the software, and I returned the cards. I used my old cards for the remainder of my print run.  So I think it worked fine with the cards in my printer, but was having some problems printing larger cards.The printer's scanner worked OK, but I had a hard time getting the images to print correctly

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone did not work correctly with the app and the website and the web site didn't work with all the photos taken of the device.  So the website did not have full functionality.  We attempted to do this, but it was not successful.  The app failed too.  All of this combined, and for reasons that I do not understand, caused the problems with the pictures.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   this device is extremely slow.  I just bought this for my husband and we have not been able to use it, not even a few times.  If you are going to use this device with your PC, the manual will tell you that this model cannot be used with a laptop.  Apparently, the "installation" instructions are not easy to find.  After spending half an hour looking for it, I found it was impossible to use.  Once it was installed, the first time I installed it the system will go through the install, but it may not be fully functional the next time around.  A lot of people have not reported issues, but I have not tried it either.  There is a small, but very noticeable warning about a missing BIOS (i.e. an error code).   I purchased my PC with an older model, so that may be a possible problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The audio quality is not great, and my wife was very disappointed.  We used the CD player a few times, and got confused by the menu design.  The CD's were listed under the menu as the same item, but when we pressed it the menu would scroll to the CD's menu.  I got the CD-ROM and tried the CD drive, but that is a bit too slow.  When you want to browse the CD menu, you have to manually navigate around the CD, and then use the player's track selector.  It is really hard to navigate around.  There are no instructions on the CD.  All I can find is information for the disc, which was an "interesting concept" in theory, but the software seems very basic and poorly designed.  On the CD it is very slow to play the movie, even when you're on the menu.It doesn't show the actual menu on the TV set, which may also be a problem, since the disc's menu is different from the TV's menu 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit has a short battery life and an antenna that is slow and flaky.  When I tried to send photos to someone in a remote location it would simply return the photos, I could not test the photo quality at this point.  I also tried a remote operation for a computer but it could not load a file that I have sent.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very disappointed with the size of the unit, and the display does not look good. It's very bright and the colors are just plain bad. There is no way to adjust the colors or brightness of the screen. The backlight is very bright in the dark. Also, it's not very easy to use with a mouse. It is also very difficult to scroll the web pages using the mouse. I have not yet tried to make a call. If I could, I would. The unit has no way of determining whether the mouse is an error. The mouse works, but it is extremely unreliable. I was unable to successfully get a signal from a computer network.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first two of these units have been in service for two weeks and I haven't used the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A very small piece. I use this device to download some of my music. If I want to listen to it at all, I have to press pause or stop and restart the device. I also have to wait for this device's software to be updated every few days, which is not very reliable. I tried to update it after about a month, but there was a problem. The update stopped working right after I had to download a patch, so the software was unusable for about 6 months. The next update would not work right and it failed the first time I tried it. After that, I used it to download the music. It works fine for the occasional movie or something, but when I try to do anything more than that, it just crashes after the "installation" is complete. I bought this just to have a cheap toy for some movies. It does not do the video of the movies that I bought, and I got stuck with a bug that would reset after a few minutes or a couple hours. I found it by trying other devices, and even downloaded some of the movie files that I had already purchased. After the "patching" fails, I tried updating the operating system on my own and got stuck in a cycle of software upgrades. This is really frustrating, because I bought a unit for my children. I wanted to buy a new one for them, but, alas, I got a new system (not working, though, apparently) that is designed for the 3 year old model and I think they will have a lot of problems with it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We received the device but were not happy.  We could not get it to work with my system.  It is difficult to enter in the data for the CD, and the system works but will not display anything.  The CD is only functional as a software driver.  If you enter information into the CD it works but not as a CD player.  I am not sure why they put this CD on this list.  Please be aware the CD only has one CD and not three.    The only reason why this list is there is to advertise the CD if you want it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When you buy this one, it is a very cheap device and as the instructions state, it will not work with a CD-ROM or a printer.  You will need to buy a CD or a paper version of the CD-rom from the local CD/DVD/CD/Poster store 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this model and it has this button that is too small and not functional with my iPod.  I can't get past the initial setup.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I purchased the CD, it broke on me. It still works well, but my original CD copy is a better copy, but it also will not install without a CD burner. The CD in this copy also works well and is a decent seller. The problem is I can only copy the files to the CD burner so far. The burner is not very fast.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this and had to use it once, but it did not work in some systems, and the manufacturer of the device was not licensed to sell the software.  The license was issued in April, so it's possible that the software is still under development.  However, the license does not state that you must have a valid license to operate the software, and I believe that the license is not compatible with the Mac App Store, so I'm not going to attempt to get it working in the Mac.  It will work on a PC using the Windows 7 operating system, however.  If anyone is having issues with the Windows version, then I can not verify if that version is compatible with Mac software. The other Windows 7 versions work fine for Mac and PC, and it seems like a lot of these Windows 7-only versions of the app are only for Mac users.  I suspect that there may be a compatibility issue with the license and the user interface, but I haven't checked.  Also, the "manual" for this version of the software contains no instructions or help, so if you try to download the app, it gives you a "software incompatible with your operating system" error.   This means that I can't recommend this for use on Mac or PC.  This version of this app has been out of production since April, but Microsoft has been encouraging people to use this version to sell it to customers, and some websites do list this version for sale.  While I don't personally agree with this version's license, if you are going to use the app on a Mac and your license was not issued in May, I would say that you should obtain an upgrade from the Mac side, since the license was released in April. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone because I wanted to use it to use as a printer to do a quick print of a few pages of paper.  When I plugged the phone into a PC, it crashed.  After my friend tried it, the phone just didn't work.  I didn't want to waste my time sending it in for repair 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  After a few hours, my boyfriend discovered that the light is not on.  I tried it on the same day and was able to see some pictures on the screen.  Unfortunately, he had to reset the device to use it in the house.  This device works on some computers but not all, and if you use a desktop and not the desktop, the screen doesn't work.  You can get a new one at a third party store for $19.  The screen is a piece of the same color as the regular version, but you get two separate lights.  There are several ways to use the two lights. One is the camera, and the other one is the light.  One light can be toggled from the camera.  On a laptop, you can turn on the light from the desktop and the light can also be to the light, which means it has the battery.  If the light works on the camera and the computer, the lights can be used as a battery, which is convenient for the camera 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these as a Christmas gift, and they didn't work right at all.  A few weeks ago, I purchased two.  I still have not received the second one.  In the meantime, I have my sister's email address, as I have a family member who used these devices with her family and she had no problem using them with her daughter.  The customer service rep for Microsoft is apparently new, and has been very helpful.  She has helped a number of times with technical issues and with customer service, but she is new to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very expensive and the battery is not good for any of the tests I do.  There's no way to find out which batteries are good and which ones are bad.  This system is also very slow.  I can't even tell you the brand name and model number 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My printer started showing up at work on my first day on the job (after paying $600 for this).  When I tried to set it up I noticed that the printer would lock up on startup and would not come back up after I had finished printing a single document.  Upon returning it for service a few weeks later, it had worked for a few hours and then stopped printing, probably because of some software bugs.  It was a total of 2 hours of work to fix the problem before it would run reliably again.  I returned it for repair and was advised that my printer had been in service for 3 months!  I set it back up at the work site, set it printing and everything worked perfectly.  The next year I received an email telling me to set up my "special" printer for work.  This printer was never available for service again. I tried unsuccessfully to get a reply back from Dell.  Since I was working with large documents (over 300 sheets), it seemed that it had to be the "special unit" that had the problems.  But then when I tried it, it was out of service for 18 months.  So after 2-3 more years of service (with a few small glitches), I received a reply from Dell's customer service team.  They told me that I would have to get another printer for a full year.  After that my original printer would be "frozen".  I had my computer and printer "froze" on my desk and this unit did not come with the manual or any instructions, so I used the manual and it worked fine.  My "special printer" was in service 6 months.The only difference from the "normal" printer (with the normal settings) was the following:  I am not able to view the page, I can't print anything bigger than 300 sheets.  If I want to print anything, I have to flip the pages.  For the user interface, it has "no user interface", it is just a box with the screen and printer.  However, for the computer program itself, the menu is accessible and has no "user interface".  So I had to download and install the program and the screen works OK.   However the instructions are for the "general user interface".The only problem with this unit is that it lacks the built-in menu for users.  You cannot get a menu that you can view, which is why
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The design of this phone was not easy to use, I had issues with reception. This was my first experience with a phone in my home, and it did not work with the web browser or the  games.  It also has issues with the calculator, and the calculator can't find any entries when I make a number entry.  This calculator is also a problem in games, when I enter numbers, the game is slow to respond.  I am a bit disappointed with this device and have decided to try using a different calculator.  A friend of mine in town uses a calculator on my wireless internet connection, and we both had the same problems

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My wife uses this card when she travels (it works great, but there's a noticeable latency between the card and her system).  She says it's not useful in areas with lots of text and video (like in the airport).  In areas with a lot of text, the card works great (i.e. she has had no problem using it to scan for a restaurant).  For video, it works fine.  I just had some technical problems with it when I was testing the card in the office (at a very slow speed).  The card does have an option to slow the speed (which is handy).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My son is a baby, so this device is extremely slow.  I bought it so that my son could see the game, but I couldn't help but notice that the controller itself had a tendency to fall over during play.  The joystick was very flimsy, and it was easy to lose the thumbsticks.  It was much more responsive to a player's input than the actual buttons.  And when the joystick fell off during play, I was very disappointed.  As I said, this device would be better if it had a joystick built in.  If you want to play in the same room with the game controller, the buttons were designed for one player.  My advice: Don't buy this unless you want your son to see the games.  But don't get the game out of the pack and try to make a game without the controller 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My device broke after 2 months, and i'm afraid to have this same problem in my office (another 1 month).I used to love this device but the battery is now very weak and its only good for about 2 or 3 hours out of the charger.The batteries in the phone and the unit are of very low quality.The problem is they broke after the manufacturer made the units.If you buy one unit you're going to be out of luck.The battery life of the battery can be shortened with a battery overcharged.The manufacturer sent out defective battery packs that will never last 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just purchased this item yesterday and could only find out about it today after calling in. I have purchased the CD-ROM in the past, but with the CD changer and DVD player, the DVD works only for one DVD, and this CD-ROD works on both discs, so I have to change the disc into it for DVD playback. The DVD changer can only be used on DVD, DVD-CD and DVD-RDR movies. For movies, the player will display some static when changing discs. I tried it out and had some success changing the DVD-CROM and CD-CD from disc to disc. I guess this DVD will be available to everyone from tomorrow, I am still looking for some pictures of this disc 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this item, in April 2004. The label is in good condition but it has no serial number. I can't find it in the database. In the database, there is a negative result for this serial number and, for some reason, I am a "new" serial number with this model, so I thought the label was defective. I am ordering another and a scan of the label will be done in May. I'm having trouble finding a copy of the original serial number 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got it when I tried to put a single disk in and it just worked in the machine. So, why didn't the manual work (I tried the same procedure and got the manual). I found that it had all the functions listed but in a very limited form. The main purpose of this device was to "record" video of the home-based TV, not record other media or use a remote to control other machines or TVs.  It was great at recording and could be used as a remote.  There was also no way to get the home screen from the manual and the other features didn't come in play.  My family and I have used the TV only for the recorded TV (at home).  On a later visit, I found out that the main purpose for this device is to record and "stream" the video from the TV to the web server.  This is something that I've only used once and I haven't recorded anything from the device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a few weeks of this and when I tried to play the game on my laptop and it broke, the only option was to uninstall the application.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The worst part was, the buttons were not responsive. I bought a lot of these and the buttons that are available at the store have buttons and connectors for each individual button. So it is not a simple "switch" like they were advertised. It does allow for an individual button to be pressed at any time without having to press all the buttons at the same time.This design was a total rip off.  The "switch' was not used for most applications and most were unreliable when used.  This was not a "switch", it was an entire screen. I have used other TVs (including mine) without issues.  On my PC the "switch'" had a software bug in my operating system (a bug that was fixed after I found out about it), but it did not work as advertised.  (I purchased it off the Web site anyway.)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing will never get close to my house. This is a waste of money and it is a piece that should not be used for any commercial audio unless it is an internal device that does not have the proper Audio Audio Audio Output and Audio Audio Input. It is not compatible with the audio inputs for my Audio Audio Box. The Audio Audio Jack is a bad connection to my Audio audio player that I tried a few months ago and the audio jack was not installed.I had to remove the Audio Audio jack from the Audio jack and use the Audio Jack for my audio player and audio jack for my speakers.  The audio jack is so poorly installed I did not notice this when I installed it at first but it is only a few weeks old and it may not be functional.  When the audio player or audio speakers are plugged into the Audio Input for my AV Audio Box I have had no luck at all with them.  It is also not compatible in the Audio audio jack that was installed for the Audio Box to my audio audio player.  My Audio Audio Player cannot produce audio from the audio audio jack without sound being lost or changing to digital, and this is only my Audio AV Audio player that is playing audio from my Audio Video Box.  I will be using the Audio Video Input and Audio Output for my TV and Audio Video player.The Audio Audio Video Player does not allow any audio playback.  This device does not support playback or audio.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a copy of this in June, 2004, and did not use it in the car. The CD burned out while I was driving in the country with the radio on. I bought a new one and it worked in the FM station. My friend who had the radio in his truck did not like this one and told me it didn't work in the CD player. I figured that I needed a replacement, but the radio didn't come with a CD player; I found one elsewhere. My only regret with the new radio is that I did not know about it when it came from China 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was the worst electronic device we have. When I tried it I had a couple problems. One was that it would only run this version of the software.The software is great. The problem is that the software was not available for other systems, and the system was incompatible with other platforms and programs. So, if you want to change the system, you will have to buy a new system.  This is great, but the software itself was not easy to download or install.The system is great for the most part, but when you open it, you are presented with a text-only screen. So if you don't have a full-fledged browser (and I did not get a full browser) you can't do anything with it.  One of the great benefits of this system is the fact that you can use the Windows 2000 browser on the PC, however, this is not compatible with the web interface.  The web interface doesn't work with Windows 2000 (or XP).If you want an updated system, I'm told you can buy a second version of this one for $50 or so.  I purchased a second one to use on my PC as I'm not planning to upgrade my system in the future.So the system works with Windows XP for all intents and purposes.  However, if I want to use Windows XP on my other devices, I have to purchase the full version of Windows 2000.  On Windows XP, I can't even get a copy of the system software or web interface on a PC.I would strongly recommend the upgrade if you're using this machine

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this product for my son and he had the cd case installed. I was hoping to install this cd onto his system for my mom.  She has two of these cd's and there is no way to remove or switch to another system.  This was one of the most expensive cd's I've ever bought for a single cd system.My son tried to use his computer to play the games on it.  After about 30 minutes of playing on the system, he tried to remove the cd.  I don't think he removed the cd completely, but I could have missed something.The cd will NOT work unless you are also using the game.  If you want to remove it, you must do this:First, find the "back" button.  Now, after changing from the cd burner (if you wish to change to another cd), simply press the button on the CD.  A new window will pop up.  It will ask you to insert the CD and the CD burner.  From here, you can select the game you wish your CD burner will allow you to play and the cd itself.  Once this has been done, your cd will operate normally.  So you can start using it with a CD burner, or the cd-rom you purchased.The only thing that is NOT working is the cd player.  That was also a mistake, as far as I am concerned.  You must first eject it from your computer and then try to start it again.   If the CD player will not start, it should be a problem with the CD that you have.  However, I had a couple cd-ranges that have worked well.  The problem with this is that the cd will not operate correctly.  One thing that worked perfectly with the disc would be that the discs have all the same text (in white on the side), but the text on the front of the CD is the same.  But then, the cd reader will not work, as it simply displays an error. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have used this device for some time, but it has a very low battery life.  In fact, I purchased this device without a battery to protect the memory in my printer.  It would have been better if I purchased a battery with a battery back-up.  This device does not have an indicator of power-on or off.  I used this on the back-half of the printer, to protect its back cover and the memory that it has to write a document on.  The printer is fine with the memory and the back cover.  However, it has some memory issues with large and small documents.    This is a serious concern to me, as the battery is a good battery only when this paper is properly supported.  When it is a poor choice for the paper, the device becomes unusable with the printer.The batteries may work, but they are not very durable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of the audio in this unit was not very good, and the video on the TV in the bedroom was of poor quality and had many bugs.  This unit did not work with the TV, but it worked on the laptop in the living room.  I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present, and it worked well when we tried it out, but the sound quality and video quality were much better on my husband's computer than mine.  When I tried it again recently, my husband found many problems with it, and he complained.  The video worked well at night, but we had a lot of problems with the sound.  Sometimes the video would not work in any particular station (and sometimes it would not start if he turned it on) and the TV would have problems on which station it would start or stop when it went to an unknown station, which would result in a black screen and the screen would flicker very intermittently.  We would have to reset the TV every few minutes or so.  He said it had many glitches when we started using it, which made it difficult for us to set up our bedside table.  One day while he was trying to set it up, the laptop stopped functioning on his desktop.  It was not easy to see in the TV the problems we had with it.  So we ended up setting up the TV on the couch so that we could work on the computer and watch TV, and use the TV to check messages in the house.  But because it works with a different channel on the monitor than it does on the unit, you are only able to watch a few channels on the web and some TV.  Also, the TV works fine while sitting on the floor.  My husband is unable to set the screen to a different mode on the keyboard, so he has to use it in a different position when working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone and put it into my car for the first time.  I went out with my wife and the kids to a movie on Monday night.  They ran it through an HDMI connection in my house and were disappointed in the quality.  At first I had trouble finding my remote.  (The remote does have functions, but I didn't use them).  The car remote is very user-friendly.  However, I was unable to set up my DVD player to take up a good movie when I was at home on Monday.  My DVD player didn't show a movie when the remote was not in use.  The screen is too low to watch it on the set.  You have to turn the screen on and off several times for the remote to work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item to play the original game on the new generation.  It worked great and was functional.  I had a nice night of gaming with it but, as I was playing, the menu system was buggy, and the battery was dying on a game that is playing in the background.  At one point, when I started to play, I had to use the original cart that was included with the game.  This game came with the disc as a replacement for the battery.  When I purchased this battery, I still had the original battery that came with this game. The batteries are not compatible.  So I have been trying to switch batteries every couple of hours since I played the game so that I could finish the game that was playing in background.I have had several battery failures.  In addition, the battery that comes with the cartridge seems to have a failure at the bottom of the cartridge.  But this may be a common problem with all of these batteries as the batteries all seem to fail.  If anyone has a better solution or a different battery that works with this cartridge, please let me know.  (This battery that is included with this cart and game works great but it did not work with the original cartridge, nor does it work with this system.)  I also have a different one for the game playing in game.When I tested the new battery with the new disc, I did not see any improvement.  My suggestion is to put the batteries in the cartridge case.   The cart case that this battery came in also came with another disc.  The battery worked fine with this disc.When the battery does not work, the disc automatically loses track of the game, and will sometimes not work at all.  What a great solution, except that the battery must be replaced every few hours, as you would with the battery in the original version

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen was very good, the only thing I had to complain about was that it was very hard to read the clock, I had tried it, and I was just going back and forth. The clock display, in general, was ok. I did have a problem with the fact that the hands moved around. If you looked at the display and wanted to reset the hands, there was a small red reset button on the side.  My phone had a built-in clock reset button, but it wouldn't work with my radio or my car keys.  The buttons for my radio and my keys worked fine, but the clock worked fine with my car key, but not the radio.  This was a problem, because the radio is used frequently.  I had my radio set on shuffle, and then the clock dial would stop working.  To get the clock to reset, I bought an extra battery.  But the clock has only reset once before.  So I have a battery that worked with my phone and radio, but with my keys. I bought it for $7.  If I were to use it, I would have to reset my radio. The radio would reset to the radio dial, the clock would reset back to the dial, and the hands would move around again.  You have to be careful with these reset buttons when setting a radio or car key.  They don't work all the time, because sometimes the hands move around or the clock starts to malfunction. I ended up having to buy an extra $6 battery.I bought it at the big price.  Then I bought another $6 for my keys (I kept the battery).  So now I have 2 batteries, I'm looking for an alternate method to reset or fix the hands.  Since I have my radio, and keys, I don't have a choice.I use a radio, I have to find the "reset" button to reset it.  When it stops working, I get a "reset the hands" button, and if I have the battery for my phone, I just need to reset by pressing the red button on my radio (I bought a few of these).  This works great.I'm trying to get one for my car.  It works great on my car (I'll have to check if I can get a radio in my car for my family, I'll check, it might work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item with the original manual, which did not work with my version of Windows 8.  I returned the manual with my Windows 8 code to Microsoft.  However, after several hours of trying to work with the manual and other files on my hard drive (the ones provided with my product) I discovered the version of the code on the internet had problems with the Windows OS, and required manual editing.  This is a standard practice for many Microsoft products and the problem is not present with the other versions I downloaded.  When I got to the website, I found the Windows 8 installation is missing any help information and that my manual had problems when I tested it.  In fact, it does not work.  After an hour or so of trying unsuccessfully to work around the problem with my internet connection, I decided I needed to return the product.  It did not have the correct version for my PC (8.1, not 8.0, as advertised), so I had to return it and pay the shipping charges again.  There are no instructions for this problem (the "FAQ" page on the website is a joke in my opinion).  I tried searching for a manual somewhere else in the Internet and I found no help at all.  The customer service representative I talked to was helpful, but would not take any information from me.  On my return I purchased the code for Windows 8 that Microsoft had on its web site and installed it in my PC.  While that worked fine on my PC, it was slow and I could not run the program.  At one point in my testing I ran the program several times (all with an error message "error, unknown error".  I did the same tests on my other PC and the error message appeared each time.  If the error code number on the Internet is 744, the program is not working.  Microsoft apparently did not bother to support the other version of its product.It is possible that the error occurs only on my Windows Vista version, and I have not tested my Vista version.  One of the two files required for Windows XP has been altered or damaged and the other file that it can read, but cannot write is also a problem.  As a result, the Windows XP PC can only run the Windows version 8.1.  You will get errors from Vista and Vista can only read XP code and write XP code (which Microsoft has done this for years).  They do

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If you were to purchase this device, please make sure you have enough batteries.   This is not a "regular" battery.  This one is much smaller than most.  It only comes with a 1.7 volt battery.If you are looking for a more powerful battery for use with other devices that are not compatible with the one in the original box, please look around.  You can pick up the 2.2 volt and 4.4 volt batteries in your local electronics store. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've tried using this to scan books, and when I got it up to scan a paper book with a paper spine (i.e. a book with spine to spine).  When I got this device to scan the spine, I had to set it to scan on paper spine.  The result was acceptable.  I did get errors because the device does not support spine reading on paper spines.  For some reason, I tried to scan some pages with the spine of a book spine and some pages without the spine spine of the book.  My guess is that the spine scanning functionality of this device works great for certain books and certain pages and not for others.  It worked okay with the book spine. However, the device did not recognize the spine on the book spines for other pages.  Perhaps this is a bug.   This device does function for page spines only when they are set to a certain type of scanning and not when set to the spine type in general. I tried different spines on the paper spine to get a page spine with no errors.  In general, my problem with this device is that it is poorly designed, poorly programmed and does not work well with the scanning function on paper or spine spines in general

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item was a great deal, but its not as good as advertised.  The picture quality is poor and its hard to see the TV.  I think the TV was originally designed for this type of TV. (not sure about the previous model).  I ordered the next model and had problems with this model too.   I have to do a lot of troubleshooting, and the manufacturer has a history of sending out faulty items to customers with out-of-spec features.  We had to return these and ordered new ones.  This product works great, but when I tested the TV, I found it only works with the same type of software, which I have no idea why it would require the version number change.  If the new version did have the newer software, it could be very handy.  But since the hardware was designed for the previous version and not the next, it has the same problems as the earlier one.  While it works, I had to do all sorts of troubleshoot.  Once I got it back and found the problems, I changed the software, got a new software and installed and updated everything.  After the software was installed, I was unable to get the TV to find it's channel.  (I was told that the software would find the channel automatically.)  I did get a new TV, but it has several flaws as well.  Some of the problems I had with this new one were a design flaw with the channel selector buttons and a design that required me to be VERY CAREFUL in using it, especially when connected to my computer.  Most of my software works, but my game software crashed the very first day I got the software.  Even though the TV is connected to the Internet, the software needs you to turn off the wireless card and use it with your home network.  My TV is very slow with the wireless connection, and I had problems playing game.  So far, the game software works OK.  However, I have not had any problems with my other software. It has to do with the way the software is designed.  When you first install, all of your files have been created with the newest version of the software!  So you have to use the previous versions of the files.  There are several other problems as well with the system that makes the installation so time consuming that I could not wait for the instructions to be completed and then reboot the system.  You

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had no trouble installing the game without the CD.  When I tried it on the CD, the CD burned out and there was a problem with the CD cover that was stuck.  I tried to repair it (didn't work) and it kept on burning out.  My suggestion is to just buy the game and CD and get the manual.  Then if you get the CD out of the cd player, you can use it on any other game.  If you have a CD burner, try the game on it and see if it will work on other games.  The game's CD-ROM has an error code (0x0) in it and works on both CD and game.If you can find a cd burner in your house, it might be a better way of getting this game, especially for older players.  You'll just need to make sure your player is in working order

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone could not make an audio stream. I purchased one from a store that sells used phone parts.  It worked for a little over a month.  I returned it as requested.  After my return, I bought one from Amazon which worked.   After that I returned my purchased phone from Amazon.  Amazon returned my phone back to Amazon.The phone has a very bad battery, and the battery charges but does not work.  My iPhone had its own charger.  The charger worked fine for a week, but then stopped charging.  Eventually I gave up and returned my iPhone.  This is a phone that, like the other one I had, could not be used for voice calls or text messages.  When I called Amazon I received a phone number that was not my iPhone number.  What happens if I call Amazon back?  This model works fine, but that phone is not made by Amazon.I returned mine.  But the other model works.  If the phone would work with a voice call, I could try it and find out.  A lot of my old contacts worked.I have purchased this model, but it is not sold to me.  There is a lot of buzz about this phone.  Even at the Amazon store it is an "on back" model.  Some have sold it for less.  Most of the people who own these phones are looking for new phones with the same specs and a lot less price

The back button doesn't work with the operating menu, and clicking the back-button does not work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the phone without an "extra" button to activate/deactivate the screen.  If I have problems with the screen, I can also use the "back" button, and I have no problem with activating the screen by hitting the back button on the phone and turning it on.  But in order to use the phone, the screen must be deactivated.  That's the only way I can use it, so I do not use it every time I use my PC.  It also turns out that the screen is deactivated by default.  So I have to manually activate it every once in a while.  I have tried the phone many times on both my PC and PC, and all is OK.  The device works OK for PC users, but there's no way to tell whether it works on a PC.I tried this device a few days ago on my PC with "very slow internet connection" and did not get the desired connection speed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does not work properly in certain devices.I bought mine about 15 weeks ago and only started using it 3 months ago.I tried to upgrade my system 3 times since then, only to get the error code "BIN" 3-4 times.I returned mine and bought another from my local store.I just recently purchased mine as a Christmas gift for my wife's birthday.My wife's unit still works with my PC and she likes to use it on our desktop.But it is an interesting piece to try to play certain PC games in order to get better experience. But for the most part, it works but is just not designed to support them.One of the problems I have encountered in my testing is that my desktop, laptop, and network adapter do not communicate with one another very well and it works well with just about any other network adapter.I am not sure why this is a problem.My laptop and network card share the same connection. So it just seems that this device was not designed with a specific desktop and laptop network card. I purchased one that worked with my system.I have not tested the system with multiple PCs, laptops, or networking devices that I am trying to connect to mine.I was hoping that my wife had purchased one and had it in order so I could test it with a few of the PC games.The unit has been tested by several users with the games I have downloaded.I purchased the unit to get my wife and I started using our network.But, it is worth noting that the software it came with was buggy. The installation process can be very slow and slow downloading games is slow and stuttering. You will be unable to download or install games using the network to your PC. I bought a copy of "Madden NFL 2003" from my PC in order for my system to work properly with the game.I also downloaded several other games that I had downloaded on my PC that my system would not recognize. This particular issue does not affect every version of the game but it does not come out of the box or work with the network.The device also does not connect well with a home network that I tested it with.One customer stated that the wireless card was "too hot to touch."Another customer said that the network card was unstable and unreliable.  In my experience, these are two very common problems with most devices.  But the unit did work with my home PC and network.It is a good unit to

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had a hard time finding it in black. I tried the case.  I just wanted to play with it and see what it did.  It worked fine.  The game worked but I had to press a button every time to make it work.  This one did the job.  If you look at the top left corner of the screen it will change from red to blue.   If I ever play any more games, I can't tell you exactly what this thing does and what it can do for you.  All I know is I bought the game for my 10-year-old and played a few games.  He didn't like the graphics but he enjoyed it.  As far as I can tell, there is no software for the system, which I don't like.  There's a button on the left corner that has a blue bar which tells you when the game is in the menu.  But this is the best I could get for my needs.  My computer is not compatible with the black case. You will need to go through the system and software troubleshoot yourself.

I can't use both of the controllers with the "Controller".  But, since the "stick" sticks are similar to the buttons, they can be used to make the "player" or "controller", as needed.  So far I haven't found a better control device for the game

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone, and it is very cheap.  It's almost the same as the one the person I purchased previously, but there is an extra row of buttons.  This is a really cool phone.  I like the small buttons, but I have had several problems with the touch screen.  The buttons are slow to respond and the screen is not very bright.  Unfortunately, the device works best with bright screens.  That is probably my fault.  There is a lot of software available (and it's not very well documented), and some features are not functioning properly.  When I first tried to use the internet for the first time, I found that the phone could not find a connection.  Then it began to show my email address and it would not accept it.  Instead, I had to type in my password several times.  After I sent my email, I discovered that my email had been changed by someone.  My first email sent, it was successful.  But the password prompt did not work on the first try.  What a ripoff

They would print the text on the page as a black image.  I then had a difficult time printing or copying anything else.  So when I used the original document, the black text disappeared and the black image with the black pages returned.  This document has a copy I printed to try out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The app does work, but I purchased the game after getting home and still don't get the "play" button to work.  I tried all of the buttons, and none of the other buttons work.In addition, I was told the games I already owned worked on the new device.  The price I paid on the old phone to get the games working on the device was higher, but the game works on all devices on the phone!  I did not receive a receipt for my purchase and no one is able to help me, and the price I got for games was much higher.  What a horrible experience.  It has been two months, and I bought it new so I don't have to pay for the games.  My phone just works.I was advised I would need to re-set it to the new system if I purchased new games, but my friend said that the system would not be working properly for any games previously purchased.  He also said I had to reallocate all my data from the old system to this system.I tried to return the phone and have it shipped back to the company, but it's impossible to do so because I just got a receipt of the games after I purchased it.  Apparently this was because my purchase was made after the system was released!  He told me it was just the price of the game and a receipt.  In the past, when I called and asked for the receipt, he told me the receipt was the only information that worked.  On the receipt is a new line of text, the first line says, "You cannot add a new number to your number" I don't think this was intended to be used as an account.  To use it as an address, I have to enter the phone number into the old address.  However, I can log in to my account.I have called the company several times and gotten no response.  Maybe the system works the same way it did on the older phone, and my friend got it on sale.  Anyway, this is my new phone and I can't get anything running on it with the game.    I have bought some other games, as well, but after I bought them, I got a red "unsupported" message.  When I returned the game, I noticed the "unSupported" message was there in the old game as well.

I checked my phone after a few days of use and the battery has actually begun to degrade.  The phone actually stops functioning after a certain number of full charges.  It's not a huge problem, but a problem nonetheless.  And there's a real reason the battery stops working after a number of charges:  According to the box, the battery's lifespan can be extended beyond the manufacturer's warranty.  When the battery is replaced, the new battery does charge the phone as expected.  But as a phone that requires 2 charges, there's not enough battery to last a full battery-life.  In fact, the original battery was actually a lot less than advertised, and there are many reports of this battery failing when the battery was purchased, so that's why this phone came with an extended warranty.However, the extended warranty is only a $30 replacement charge.  After that, the phone works fine.   So I have to purchase the battery again and have the battery replaced.I'm not buying the phone because this thing is totally useless, and the software is very basic.  This is the only phone I've bought with this feature and it's still very basic in functionality.  Everything you type will be sent to the browser.  Not only is it very buggy, it also has some other features that are quite buggy.  For example, you'll see an icon to turn on or off your bluetooth, which makes no sense.  However, it's a lot easier to turn the device off and back on.  Unfortunately, when you go into settings, all you'll get is a little menu to activate it on a bluetooth connection.  You can't get any other features on there.As I was testing this phone, I got my phone out of my pocket and checked the battery.  Turns out, the device isn't actually working.  If you get a full charge, it'll work but with all features off and the Bluetooth connection, everything stops functioning and it just turns off.I purchased my own phone from another online retailer, which is great

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I tried to download this game in November it didn't work.The title screen shows a very dark blue/green screen with a very slight hint of red.If you touch the screen it turns bright.The touch screen is very sensitive and it will move quickly from one side of the screen to another. I have to touch the touch screen to make it go from one edge to the other (it's actually hard to see the screen).When you have multiple users and multiple screens you have to be careful not to touch them at the same time.The device is also not compatible with Windows 98.The buttons on the touch panel, though, are fairly responsive and I was able to press all the buttons in the title screen.The menu screen is a good choice if you want to start a game or return to a previous screen.On the Windows 98 screen you can only enter numbers into the numbers area of the title bar.I have to go to a full menu screen just to scroll through the options on the screen. I use this screen quite a lot.It can display several game controls at the touch bar but the user interface is a mess. It uses many different controls for many different purposes.The game menu is a bit easier to use on Windows 98 than Windows XP 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device didn't do what it was advertised as.  I used it to view the DVD-R and it started to glitch up a little.  The software has the same issues as the DVD.  It is in a bad state.  One thing I've found is the default language setting on my laptop to be the one in which some of the DVD menus are in.  This is another reason why I'm having trouble finding the right titles.  However, this is a very minor annoyance.  But, I have to say that this was the best feature of this device and I've used it a fair bit.  For a DVD player, I would definitely buy another device or I'll look for another DVD player for my library.  In a previous review, I noticed that the DVD menu didn't display the titles correctly or even the names of the movies in the menu.  After looking in my DVD menus, I found some titles that didn't work with my DVD player.  If I'd had this device before I'd be able to see the menu of the title and see the "Movie Details" on the menu, and if I can do that, I'll be able download the movie from the DVD and watch the whole movie on my DVD and DVD player from one DVD.Now that I've looked at the manual, I find it to be of low quality.  As far as I can tell, it doesn't even mention the language options on the device, nor does it give any indication of the user manual, or even that it has a user manual.  What's a movie-hungry user to do?  The DVD menu has the user interface and I haven't even managed to get it working properly for a movie on the DVD player!  In my book, a device like this can only be used for a single movie and the movies on the disc have no user interface, so all I can see is the menus.  Not a lot of information there about how to use the device for other movies, and I'll have to search the internet to see if I'm able to use it for other DVDs.  So far, I've managed to download the DVD only to find that there is no menu for the discs.  And the discs themselves don't work on my machine 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got a phone number in the default settings and I had to disable the phone so I could use it on other phones.  It wasn't a big deal to set it up again, but I was still able to activate it on my own.  The phone number is not in the phonebook.  This is a great number, but it's not supported on AT&T's CDMA network.  I tried other CDMA numbers on other CDN networks, but this phone has a hard time getting connected to those systems.  Also, it doesn't work with this system in Europe.  In the US I couldn't get a number with a country code.   I also tried some numbers with country codes, and some phone numbers, but again, with a number in it, it wouldn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There were a lot of problems with this unit.  I never got the chance to play any of the games I own.  The CD player itself uses an engine that works much better than it should have.  It may be a good thing that it has no battery built in.  In any event, it is a big step back from the CD player's predecessor.  You have to turn the unit on while holding a CD, then slide the player through the drive slot.  For me, I bought this because I thought it was a better alternative to the CD players with CD players that I have owned previously.  When the unit was first installed, I had to go through a lengthy setup procedure.  As a result, I ended up spending a lot more time configuring the unit than the CD-ROM.  Then the CD played out of the CD drive, and the driver would not recognize the CD.  This requires a restart of the computer.  After that, the system ran fine.  From my experience, you will have to restart all of your computers if you start from scratch.  Once it is set up correctly, you have to re-enter the password every few hours to unlock the system.  Be aware that there are a lot fewer games than before on the system than when I installed the CD, but the number of games has increased.  My CD library is full, but my other computers have not run out of games.  (I did manage to find a few that would not work on the CD.) If you have the CD reader installed, you can print off the games on any of your PCs.  A very handy feature is the ability to browse to a new CD or CDRW or just the CD itself.  Not having the CD would require you to search for games on your PC to play.The CD reader will read CDs and CDRWs, but does not read the games.This unit does not play all of the titles that I use it for, but I was able to download and run several titles I did not have previously.However, it does work for some of the original game disks that I already owned.  Unfortunately, this CD reader is not compatible with CD-Roms.  To read a CD-Rom, I need the CD and the CDRW.  One thing that I did notice is that after installing the CD in my computer and then getting into the driver's menu, I saw that
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If this phone were a better I could have gotten it for my boyfriend to use. However, as is, it works great.  I have only used it once for my girlfriend and it will not work with a non-GPS device.  This is a very cheap phone, but I find it to be very difficult to use, and to have issues with my girlfriend when we try to use it together.  The GPS is extremely slow to locate me when I try to get it to work with her.  It's a shame, because GPS functionality does not always work when the phone is connected to a non GPN device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a piece that I bought to send the printer to my cousin.  I ordered two.  It came after the first unit arrived (which was defective).  I called customer service because I bought two units for my cousin, but did not have the unit she needed.  After spending time on the telephone with customer service, I have now had two of these units with my cousin for two weeks.  However, I ordered them to my parents as well.  We did have them for two months before getting one to my aunt and my uncle, both of whom have purchased the same printer.  So my cousin will still need to have her own printer for a while.  My mother and my father have two different printers and use them both on a daily basis 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product. After a few minutes, it started to do more damage than I could have expected. I have to send a new one back because it is a complete waste of money. This is what you get when you purchase a defective device from a used computer.  I am going to report this to HP in addition to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These are not really the size of the original, so be prepared to buy an additional 1-2 when buying these for a long-term use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The design does not look durable, even though the pictures had good quality.  A friend recommended the black and white color scheme, since the other color scheme was too colorful and didn't look good.  I was surprised that the device had been on the market for so long.  My next purchase will be a black and yellow one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing was a complete disaster.  The buttons would occasionally work, but would frequently jam, and the plastic didn't protect the phone from drops and scratches.  I was unable to use the phone on a cellular or cordless network in most of the cities I lived in (for the most part, I had a SIM card and would switch to the data-only mode when I went to town), and it would become more and more unreliable as it worked, becoming impossible to use for anything more than the most basic calls and texts.  This caused problems with the GPS as well as the ability to locate a hotel room in my home or a hotel on the Internet.  My only other recourse was to look up the phone number of the phone in the phonebook.  Most of the listed phone numbers were no longer active or working, but I found one in New Jersey (and the number listed was actually a fax machine in the company's office).  Once the phone started working again, I bought it.    I installed a number of games, but the "feature" seemed to go out from time to time, making it difficult to get a clear and accurate reading on the map.  In the meantime, the game menus worked fine and the menus for navigation on the menu screen were not as robust as they should have been.  While playing, the phone also had an annoying habit of repeatedly crashing out of any game in which I needed a map to figure out how to progress in.  A quick scan around the map would get me to the point where I could play the next level.  Eventually, I found that I needed to reset the phone to find a clear path back to the beginning of the game and reset the software on the device, which caused the menu system to work in a much more reliable manner.  So, I reset the device by changing its clock, battery, and settings to see if the system would recover.  Although the new software worked, the new user interface was a disappointment.  It didn't seem like a well-thought-out solution to the problem, and I eventually abandoned the phone altogether.  After about a week of this, I switched to an Android tablet, and although the interface has improved since then, I have to say that my experience was far more frustrating.  If you are using the tablet, the screen does not work, or sometimes, it will go out after being in use for a short time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use this device for internet access on my desk that can be turned off at any time. I use the internet to read the book "How to Program Audio Audio Audio Devices". It worked, but the battery drained my computer when I was getting ready to turn it off. It was so bad, it was causing my computer to restart on the first page (which caused the reset button to be stuck in the reset position on the computer).  This caused the computer to crash.  This happened several times, and it was not easy to recover from this crash.The computer has also malfunctioned when attempting to upload emails. I have been trying to work on the web.  There was no way to reset the computer back to a previous working state.  After a lot of fiddling with the internet connection, the computer now stops working.  It does not work with Outlook or Windows Live Mail 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a pain in the neck. The sound quality is okay, but the bass is a bit high-pitched and has that '90s metal-sounding bass that is irritating. The speakers are light-years behind anything I've owned in my house. This is one speaker I'd never recommend for watching movies and listening to music in a movie theater.  It is very loud and a bit distracting.

If I set this unit down on the table, it is very finicky to set it back up again. The device can not locate the computer's booting CD because it is in use by the CD burner. This means that it will have to reboot the machine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit is ok.  My wife will get it, and she loves it.  It's a good product, but we get a lot of complaints from her.  I wish I would of known this before I bought it.I've tested it and it's ok, and works just fine on my PC.  But it works great on a PC as well.  So what it is I need to change my software and my  drivers, but I don't know if I'll ever do that.  They just don't like it very well.I don't think the problem is that this unit can work in Windows 95 and Windows 98.  However, Windows 98 and XP both have a bug that prevents it from connecting.   The problem may be the wireless module itself 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Not very happy with this model and for the most part, it doesn't perform the same as other models I've used.  The software is buggy and there are some bugs with some of the features.  One thing that has caused the device to break, though I don't know which one, is that the batteries have had problems.  I had to send mine back.  It's not like this battery was defective on mine from the start, I just got a new battery and it didn't work.  In my case, a new one with a better label worked fine.  If you want to get one with "new batteries" from Amazon, you'll get a big discount on it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The packaging is the same as previous years.  I had my wife purchase this product for her and for her sister.  The last version was supposed to work with her sister and my wife.  After my wife purchased the device, the battery was dead.  This is an unfortunate situation.  As you may know, it also uses a USB port which causes interference with my USB keyboard.   This makes it very hard to type at all.  My wife is now unable to use the device.  If she were to use this device with my laptop, she would use it frequently.  Unfortunately, I'm unable to get a battery for it, or for my phone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My printer failed before I could even take it out of the box.  I bought another one which did work fine.  The print function was great.  After I took the picture the printer would hang up, and I had to start all over.  There were more problems.  They were minor, but I was able to get the printer back and have the next two images in the correct orientation.  This didn't work, so I tried a different model with the same problems.After a while of this I gave up on this printer and bought another printer to test the printer on the old one.  So far, I haven't had the print work.  When I purchased this printer for the first time, I tried to take the pictures and all worked.  As a result I had a copy of this review.  If this happens to be the printer the reviewer used, they will receive a complimentary machine.  On the last review, this printer is a joke, no better than the first one.A friend suggested using a different printer in this case.  It did work on the picture for the review and the review itself.  Unfortunately it failed the print function again.  My guess is that someone installed the driver incorrectly.  Do not buy this machine. You will not get the print to the reviewer's office.The only reason the printer works on this one is because there is a very tiny driver.  In the manual, there is no information about this and I have to search the internet to find a driver. The printer has a good web site (but the web site works fine on the review site).  Unfortunately, the printer driver does not come with the printer or the reviewer is not able to download a driver on their computer.  A link to the driver for the reviewer on the web is in the manual.  Perhaps the reviewer could use the manual that comes with the review or search the web.I will try to print more pictures on my current computer and try to see what the problem with my review is.  Is it my driver? Is it the paper? Do I have an update?I have the same printer and the printer in my office.  All the pictures are fine. However, I've not been able to print out more than a few.  No matter what I try, the pictures don't come out.  And I was forced to re-copy several of them. I had some pictures from the review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The audio quality is poor, the video quality is worse and the audio has a slight distortion.  The video is not stable or fast.  It does not show the action on the track.  This may be due to the lack of support for the game controller as I have not tested it and the screen cannot be resized.  I was only able to play around 4-5 games on my computer before the screen crashed and needed to be reset, I am hoping this will be resolved by software updates.  Hopefully the game works with the controller.    Overall, I do like the game play very well, but in the future, if I can find another version of this game, I would like to try using the controller with the game

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device seems to be in use a lot, but is unusable.I bought this device, I have tried it on all of my computers and they all show the same error.I am not sure what it is with me but I bought this phone from Walmart, and the first 3 times I tried it, it just stopped working on all computers.There is a way to get it working with a Microsoft account on Windows 7/8/8.  But if you do this, it is very slow.I purchased this product from Walmart to try to get better service, but this problem is in all of the reviews.It appears that the user manuals do not include any instructions, and it just says you have to copy data files over from the Internet to your computer to see if you are connected to the Internet. I did this and could not get the data files.When you run into any problems, you have a manual that is very basic, but does not include a way for you to copy or move the data on to a different PC.  I did not find this manual.My phone does not even give you a manual, just the information that is stored on the disk when you start the phone.I tried to copy all of these data files, but each time I did, my phone showed a different error.  When I tried to make a copy of the data, it stopped working.I have tried to email Walmart several times, and they have been unwilling to help.I had the device for less than a week.  This is just a bad device.    If you buy it from Walmart and use the Microsoft website, you will see a lot of error messages and a lot more problems

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered this one because the first one came with an extra button on the side. I have bought one of the second and it works fine.  I bought the second one because I wanted to try the wireless network and see how it works.  The problem is, the wireless channel is configured to use the same channel (3) used by the older system so I cannot connect with either the old or the new system.  It is not easy to figure this out because I was unable to configure it.  After a while the user interface does get a bit laggy.  Sometimes it will work, but not always.  This was not an easy fix to make.  If the problem can be fixed (and I have attempted it) then it will also improve the experience.  However, it takes some time to get the radio to talk.  My experience was with the "old" one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't waste your money on this device.  I bought this phone for work and it had the annoying problem that I could not get a signal and this worked well in my home!  Now I have a second phone for home.  Now, I'm getting an occasional call from work!  I am still getting the impression that this phone has an internal clock with it, which does not work and therefore slows down everything!  Don' think of this as a standard phone, this is a product for home use and for work.  It is nice in my house, not bad at all!  If your going to buy one, you will need to consider buying another one for home! The phone is very good, just needs to have a little more internal memory.  If you can get a call out, you can make calls while it is running on the "work" clock in the home, but this phone needs to be in its home configuration.  So that can be a problem.  Don\'t buy this phone!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have found it to be very difficult to get information from the manufacturer.  I asked for the battery specs as printed on the box.  The manufacturer is not forthcoming with the information requested by email, nor can I find any on-line manual.  When I tried searching the web, I found this: "Batteries used in some models are rated to last less than 50 charges.  On some models, batteries may be fully charged when they are used, but the charger on the charger may not function properly.  This may require the battery to be completely recharged before the battery may be returned to the box."  This indicates the battery is not fully charged, nor does it provide the manufacturer's information that the battery will not work when the battery has been fully charged.  Some batteries may work with the charger and battery, but this does not mean that the phone will work with other brands of batteries.  One manufacturer, using an   outdated battery, sent out a shipment that contained a battery that did not work properly with other phones.  Another vendor stated that the batteries will work properly in other devices, but it was not clear whether or not the phone can be used with other brand batteries.In addition, some people have reported that batteries from other manufacturers with the same label have different operating features.  There are several phones with different labels

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is NOT compatible with all phones/pda's that were purchased from this website.  The phone works on my iPod Touch, my  MP3 player, and my  desktop (I use this device as well).   The iPod Touch is a big piece of junk 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen resolution was far worse than I expected, and it looked terrible. It also had this weird problem where the left and right sides are slightly offset from each other and the top and bottom were offset to the left from the right side of the screen, which is extremely disorienting.  I couldn't tell if it was due to software glitches or display flaws or the screen being in a different orientation than I would normally expect.  Also, if you wanted to use the touchscreen with your phone, you needed to press the side buttons to set the display to "lock" and then unlock.  But the screen did have the ability to lock into any of the preset modes (noted above) which were all poorly designed and awkward.  The whole screen was very bright and had a weird greenish tint to it that was very distracting 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this model (a.k.a. #1536) for the same reason a previous reviewer rated it poorly:  This phone has some significant bugs, including a bug that caused a severe problem when I tried to download updates.  After a long day of downloading updates, I had to power down my phone and install the updates.I used a different network to install the new software, and I will have to wait until I get the new updates installed, so I will not be able to use the network to manage my phone.  I will also have to go through this phone to update my software (again) when I get back home.  When I used my old phone, I could manage the phone without the update and the problem fixed itself.  This is very frustrating.  The phone software is still broken and I still have yet to update.  At the moment, it only has the option to send a "bad" update and my phone cannot send updates automatically.  So I am in the process of downloading a "good" update but I will never have the "good stuff" on my phone, nor do I have the ability to update the operating system itself 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This card was not compatible with the device.  The screen was bad and the camera was not working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased this card.  This card works with only two batteries, making for a good backup for a laptop.  However, since the card has limited functionality, it requires you to press the on-off button and reset your battery to factory settings 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The audio is terrible, the signal is very unstable. It also has a very loud radio, and the display can be adjusted at any time.  I couldn't even get the TV on for a test drive until it was set up correctly in my test apartment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product worked great for the first week but since then it stopped working.  The only thing that worked for a while was that it would allow me to print an A4 page.  I've now gotten to the point where I need to start making things work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The phone was useless.  I had to download the entire game for it to work.  The screen wasn't great, and it made me very uncomfortable.  In addition, I had problems downloading most of the game and playing it at the same time.  Also, the interface is very clunky.  As far as I can tell, the only way to get to the settings page for a particular game is to have an Internet connection, which made the interface clunky and unreliable.   There are several bugs with the interface, and I found several other problems too

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product did not work with my original device, so I bought the one I bought when I received the original device back (with the original battery). I could get anywhere on the device from 3 to 10 seconds of charging.  I put my original battery in and it works fine on my iPod.  When I tried this new device, the button would have a blue glow indicating it's working.  It still worked fine in my iPod, but I had to reset my device after 10 uses, or I would have to reset the device itself after 10 or more uses.  The new, original battery is just as good.  And yes, the glow on the button is blue, but it's also blue when the device is working on the original (blue) battery.  This is a problem that I have with my iPod (I use it to check the time) and the blue light also glows blue when connected to my iPod when the button works.  (I can get 10 seconds per charge, I think).  I also found that, at first, it worked fine with my iPad, but after a little while of using the iPod and tablet together, I had a lot of problems.  You must be aware that the new iPod has a new color-matching back button, and, I don't know what is wrong with the new button -- it works just fine with the tablet, which has a slightly different button shape and design.  So I have to figure out another way to use this iPod. It won't work with other iPods.  There seems to be a lot going on with this device, it just doesn't work right at all.  Don't buy this iPod, unless you have the original iPod battery. The iPod works well in my iPad (and on my laptop).  It won`t work with the original iPods, except the one with the "original battery".

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing had some of the worst sound I've ever used in my life. It's very noticeable, and it's really hard to play music with. It had a nice soft bass and a nice high treble (even in its lowest setting) - a lot of treble for a portable unit. I also purchased the player because of its excellent ability to pause and resume. I could pause and play with the power in my pocket and the player would keep running. I used it this way because I was on the road. My system works OK - it stopped working and I have yet to receive a reply from its manufacturer. I called several customer service representatives in hopes that they could help me out. At this point I am giving up on the system

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device, in my opinion, is extremely overpriced and not nearly as secure as advertised. I have had no problems in installing a virus or other problems, however, the software is no longer supported by Microsoft, and the website that's associated with the "update" button doesn't have a date associated with it, making it a new software release. As of this writing, I'm still trying to figure out how I can fix the problem with this release. I will update this review if I can get any sort of response from Microsoft. Unfortunately, I've gotten this information from the "Update" button, which has a link to a support forum, so I'm wondering if I need to file an official support ticket. This update has been in development for quite a while, but I received the first version of the update last week. This was my first software upgrade attempt, and I've since updated the site as a secondary option 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   As I've been driving it, it does not appear to be a smooth or quiet speaker.  I have mine set up, and I tried to listen to my radio, but it has been extremely difficult to navigate to stations.  While driving in this vehicle, I have repeatedly made calls to the radio to find out what the station was.  However, no one called back to find this out until the next morning

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The video will run if you press one button on the remote.  Then you can switch from the main screen to the portable one.  The only other problem is that if you use the tablet to switch to the main window or the window when you are driving, the device may not work right.  I did not like this setup at all.  In fact, my first week I used the tablet in my car and when I tried to enter my password, it just stopped responding.  It did not work with my car radio.  But when I first installed the phone, I still had problems with my own car radio and the remote that came with the device.  After the first week, I installed the remote and my radio was no longer working.  Now I am returning the device to Wal-Mart and I will see what the customer service department says.  If you just want the remote for your own car, I did have a hard time getting it working in my own vehicle 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have bought this device several times and have had many problems. The software that you get installed has never functioned. It just goes to the beginning of the disk. It may be that some of you can find the disk in the CD changer.  I'm a first time user and have no idea what it's for.  It could be a bug, but for the record, it's supposed to replace a defective disk or something.  If I get my software fixed, I'll be looking into this more.  Hopefully I won't have to use it again.The device comes with a battery, but the battery does not come with it.  Apparently, there is a problem with the battery, which works poorly and is not reliable.  This is going to be an expensive device to work with. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device worked fine for my first 4 months. Then I stopped seeing any results and it has remained unusable since.  I have tried to call this number several times but have been unsuccessful.  It also has been difficult to locate the product.  Any assistance in locating the product is greatly appreciated 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two problems with this device: I bought it so I could take photos of my daughters in bed.  My daughter is 6 and my son is 3.  It's a little hard to use for a nap as it is and I have to wait a few seconds after the image is finished to see if anything is amiss with it.  At least the picture quality is decent and I don't need to use it for that.  If I use the device for any other purpose, like play games or watch TV, it has some pretty bad lag times.  I'm not convinced it's a good use of the battery.  The pictures it does produce are great and I've been using it a lot for testing but I have my daughter, my son and my wife in bed for testing.  We get a decent sleep cycle, so if you have a hard time sleeping, your baby, baby monitor, or baby monitor could give you a headache.  So if your baby or a friend's baby is watching TV or playing games, get a battery and go to bed or take a nap 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the same unit from Amazon and the picture worked OK for a while.  I had to buy a second one and I'm still working on the first.  The device works very well for the short time I use it but I do have some problems.  First, the user interface is much different than the user's manual states.  This one was pretty easy to read, the other manual I had for my other unit did not.  Also, Amazon provides a small list of settings with the default option of using this interface to the user.  But the options are not easy to access and most settings are completely hidden.  If you don't want to change settings you have to use the interface.  It will automatically change the device to the "user" setting unless you set it to "user".  This setting was found by mistake when I first ordered the device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the same model.  This phone is not supported in Canada.  The software is slow and buggy.  It has no built in data port.   The handset will not function in conjunction with any other network.  There is no voice mail, however, nor is there a land line.  You can dial in using an operator in the US, but there is no internet access or phone numbers to the US.  In addition to the handset, there are no SIM cards nor other services.  I attempted to contact the US operator and the system refused to function with the US network. I had several calls to try and connect to the phone.  Phone numbers on the system and online have all been disconnected.  As of 11/9, there is still no voice phone service.  Even the US carriers do not provide customer service support. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery started giving off a strong smell about one day and stopped working at all.  We couldn't find out who was selling the battery.  I bought this battery, and it will now have a "C" in the battery name on the top instead of "C".  This is a known problem that they won't replace them unless we send them a complaint (which the customer service rep said it is the fault of the manufacturer, not that of us).  It is also known that battery cells with the "C", "C2" or "C3" in their names won't work with the old battery.We bought a new battery and put it in the car.  The car started working for one day.  Then when we took it out, it didn't work at all again.  My car now won't start unless I get the driver to turn on the ignition.  That's all I can say for now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't buy this thing.  It works as well as an old model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product was of poor quality. It was not reliable or durable, and I had to repair it myself.  This cost me $5 to repair and $20.00 to purchase.  I will have to fix this product again, and the process is still not smooth.   There is no software to download, the downloader only runs in a very small window and is not responsive.  My recommendation is to have the user pay $5 for this repair, and pay for another $20 for the download 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device doesn't work for all of my cards and there is a problem with a few cards with this bug and that will cause some problems with data on those cards.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery does not hold enough charge for the amount of time it's advertised.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing doesn't work. It's great on the road, but it needs a charge card or battery or something to work. This device works better than other Garmin products on this model (although they work great).  It has no display or navigation menu.  The menu shows your current position.  It only shows your last known position. The GPS unit is set to "return to last known place" instead of the actual GPS position. In other words, it's set to return to the last known GPS position, not to its current GPS position

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These cards do not work at all.  I've been trying for days with no luck.  They have the manufacturer's name printed on them but I have found that these cards only work under Windows 98.  Under Windows 95 they worked, but they did not work under 98. If you have a Windows 98 system with a virus or trojan and don't have a registry fix that can only fix one.  These card manufacturers don't even mention this when you purchase these cards.  It is a simple procedure for me to fix a registry and get my own registry fix (that's it's not mentioned in the instructions).  I can't believe they haven't taken any measures to make this software work under the standard Windows 98 operating system.  If I have a version of 98 with a registry patch installed I'm able to use it under Windows 95 to fix one problem.  However, it's easy to get a version with no fix under Windows 97.  The instructions are also for Windows 98, however the instructions for Windows 95 and 98 are different.  There is an issue with Windows 98 that has changed the card's name and therefore makes it impossible to remove the version in Win95.  This was reported to the manufacturer in March 1996, but apparently it took them more than two months to respond.I am trying to fix this problem with the Windows 98 driver myself, so I am not sure how long it will take for Microsoft to fix the problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item has been a total waste of time and money.  I bought this and lost my phone number in the process.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very poor device.  If you are in the center console, you can't turn on the TV without pressing the reset button on the console.  You have to press that reset button to get to the main menu.  The main menu doesn't show you all your channels, but only your favorites.  Press the back button and you will find a menu to change channels, which is a bit tricky.  After a while I just quit trying to use this console. This problem, and other problems I had with it, got fixed in a few months, but my guess is that Sony fixed these issues with the firmware, or that they just didn't care

There's an "unused" button, and this one worked great, until I tried to access my data. I could not get it to save data. After a few tries, it "came back to life" for me. So now I have to use the manual and find the correct buttons 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The phone was working OK, but the screen was not working (I purchased the wrong handset, in the end). This unit does have a microphone but I did not use the microphone. I have seen other phones with similar features but I had never used one before. The screen is the right size, but it is not usable. The battery was not fully charged, but I will try and replace this before I purchase a second unit 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device has great battery life and is compatible with all my devices.  However, with a new battery I bought my old battery to see if the newer is better.  Unfortunately it is not.  After 10 months, I am not happy with this battery.  My laptop sometimes gets a new screen and it is still slow or worse on battery life than the old screen.  The new screen is the main reason I bought this device.  I have never used it with a printer, and the printer worked on the old battery but the new one would not work.  There have been problems with my printer before I have returned my old printer.  This was a bad investment.  Overall, I used this battery once with a computer but the other 4 times I have used this, it did not work with it.  It is a really good battery and I use it every night with my phone but for the printer I have always had problems.  If I need a battery for my printer, I will try to use it as a replacement but this is a battery I use on my laptop only when it is needed.    I used the printer with my new battery on the first printer and it worked fine with my old, slower, screen.With this new battery, the screen works. The screen will also get better after the battery is removed and I have to remove my computer to use the printer. With the old, I would be very careful.  In addition, I have a problem with it because it has only worked with a single printer that the battery did not help. I did find this out after 2 or 3 times of using this battery with a PC that I did not want to work with

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with this item. The base was not a strong base, I used it for just under a year, then the power supply died.  I had no idea that the product had any problems.  It was not designed for people.  A battery works fine, but the battery holder does not have a proper charge.  So I had to go into the battery compartment for it.  At this time, the battery was dead, but I tried it out, then I sold it off to another one, which did work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Not as strong as I expected.  If you get it, make sure you don't bend or twist the electronics to a certain degree, since this does make them fragile.  I bought one of these for my printer and tried to print it, but it didn't print out.  It failed with this printout, which was a complete waste of ink.  The printer works fine, but I wish I got it because it is very expensive.  My printer cost about 50 bucks for a 10 page paper, which is an enormous amount of ink, and I had to pay the printer a full 30% of the ink.The printer works as advertised, but the paper is too thin and the ink cartridge has no expiration date.    I'm guessing this paper has expired somewhere in the past 10 years or so.  So, unless you like the idea of getting an entire bunch of pages of paper and printing out pages of printed paper for your own business, I'd avoid buying this printer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone is very slow, the battery will last you about 4 hours, so you might as well upgrade to one that lasts a bit more, or just use it on a separate charge.  If you don't want to use your phone the entire week, just leave it on and leave it turned on all week, and turn it off when you're done.  Or just put it somewhere else on your computer that won't interfere with your files or anything 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There was a huge difference in quality between the picture and the printed page - this was the first time I received this print on a print shop computer, and it did not work. The printer is so slow it is hard to write anything on the paper. Also, the print shop uses a different software than the computer on the internet, and the print settings are not compatible with the paper, and there is no option to change the paper type. I bought this printer in a private store for my home. The paper was not damaged, but it appears the print shops only support it for printing home pages, so if you want to print business documents, this printer will only work with home pages

It's fine with my mobile phone but I've still got to get it working with the PC.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device works great with the base, but it is not very stable. The battery would stop working after just two or three uses and had to be replaced. The second battery is a huge disappointment.  When it works, it will only charge this base.  The software on this base is horrible.  It is not intuitive.  You have to open and close apps every hour to recharge it.  After just one battery use, I had to reset my base.If you have a hard time finding an app, just use the base in the garage as a stationary base. You do not have to remove it from the base. It worked very well when I just plugged in an  MP3 player

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone has had some issues that have left it inoperable since it first came in.  I bought this phone to try to check e-mail to try and get some of the e-mails that I had been getting and had to reset them multiple times before they would work.  This is a very basic phone that works great for basic e-commerce purposes.  There are many, many other phones in this line.  The battery, in particular, is not that great.  Don't waste your time on this phone unless you like trying to check your e--mails and use some of them.  It works okay and you can easily set up a basic ecommerce system for it by yourself, but it really should work just fine if you need to send e-vouchers or other basic e commerce features to your ebusiness.  You also have to re-download the ecommerce app from the store everytime you do this.  Even then, I have to restart it every 30 minutes or so and it's not a great experience overall 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is in bad condition. The only thing I could say good about this is that it's cheaper than buying a regular screen and they don't charge the batteries until the battery's out of charge and the screen starts flashing all over the screen.It's really hard to find a way to watch something on the screen in normal conditions. If you want to watch TV, you need to get a battery out of the charger, and turn it off and off and on, so you can find a position for it on the table. I found this very frustrating.I had a battery that worked, but the screen wouldn't stop flashing. I bought another battery and had the original unit, so I was able to get the original screen up and running. If the battery is out of battery and the display's flashing, you have to unplug and unplug to keep the screen from flashing.It seems that the batteries are not a match for the original electronics, so don't buy them if you want the original hardware. I didn't find any of the original battery's on the shelf.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this tablet on Friday, and it worked great. But it's also in use with a browser.  I tried a number of times to make the device work, but it would crash, freeze, or otherwise be nonfunctional.  This is a common issue on many devices, and I will be returning mine, because I've tried several combinations of software and browser.In some instances, it crashes altogether, which is a complete waste of money for a device that costs $40.  The software doesn't work well on all of them, either.  Also, when browsing a website or accessing the internet, it may display a black box and a black bar on top of the page.  (The browser screen is the same color as the screen you can see with the screen that you have the tablet with, but the webpage will display a little grey box on top.)  The website can't be interacted with on this screen.  When I tried making the device usable with a normal web browser, I got a crash.  But the issue seems to be the browser on the other computer.  It works well with the browser I have on my tablet.  And when I tried to use a normal webpage, I get a black screen. The device also doesn't have support for my browser; it doesn't support the feature that displays the page's image, a feature I'd like to see.In other words, the device has two completely different features.  On the surface, this device does everything that my tablet has, but under the covers, it appears that it has some special features on the web-side that aren't supported on the tablet.It can be a total nightmare if you're trying to use it on any other device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this for my daughter and when she got home she tried to use it. I sent her an email to say how difficult it was to switch it on and it would work with her web browser but not with her email browser. The web browser does not work with this device, and as it does not display emails the web browser has a tendency to break it down every so often causing crashes. I got rid of the device.  I have my doubts that it will work with other email clients 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A bad electronic interface. I bought this one because I didn't expect it to work on my Windows XP laptop.  When I first booted it, it gave the following error message:  If you get a black screen, or an error that the device can't be used, check your device configuration and reinstall it. If this device had worked for me, I would have been able to log in to the network 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The item was not functional; it was in working condition, but the seller had stated the device had been damaged in the box.  The unit has since failed to perform.  This seller has done several fraudulent sales.  I have contacted Amazon several times with customer service.  It is imperative that we remove the defective unit and obtain a refund 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   One device had a red LED, so I found the blue LED in my car.  The yellow LED is on the dashboard.  Both display the same content (i.e. a different color scheme).  The content is very similar (both the color and the pixel size), but the color scheme is different.  For the dashboard, I set the colors to match the dashboard's, but the blue light on the dash display is not compatible with the display screen on the back door.  A software bug was used to cause this conflict.  This is another reason why I cannot get a picture to show the content on the car.The only color scheme in the back of the dash uses the red LED on the left.  On the front, both red and blue use the red and the blue displays.  I do not have an option to change the content or the display on either rear display, even after multiple crashes. I tested the color schemes on my phone and it worked as well as the dashboard (though I have to turn on the red color on the rear display).  (Note: the red on the right side is used on a screen on my dashboard.)  The phone's red and white and the dashboard is white.  Neither works very well with the back side of the rear door.So I had a back door, a car, and a phone that could only be used for showing the blue and the right colors on the screen.  So I drove into town one day, and pulled into my favorite restaurant.  After spending several months in the same car, I have been unable to troubleshoot the problem.  One dealer said the car would work for me (though there are some issues with the rear battery).  One customer report indicated the car worked (but the screen was "dirty").  This may be due to the problem with the dashboard display (the red and black display and the white and red display use different content).  This problem has been reported in multiple reports, so it appears the problem may be widespread. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When using this, your phone could only take up one position with my iPhone. This was no problem.  Unfortunately this does have an issue with video recording.  If you're using it in a movie, if you're looking for a feature you can disable, just to conserve battery life.   But as for recording, even with my  iPhone in this position, the video  player will lock up if you attempt to use the buttons.  But this is the best of its kind.  So what was the problem?   The video player can't get the menu system going

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is not as easy to handle as I thought, so I ended up having to reset the clock every hour. The clock has an alarm feature, but it is a bit of a pain. The alarm clock is also not fully functional. If you go outside for a minute, the alarm will stop sounding, but the clock will not stop running. I got the battery back and the alarm works fine, but I would get up at least once and reset the time every hour to reset my alarms. I did get this clock a secondhand one a few years ago, so it will be good for a few months at least, but you can get the original in the past.  I bought the battery and it works fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is the same design as the previous version, with a slight change in the front buttons. I use mine most of the time. I am sure this product works better in certain computers than in others.  It was supposed to be released around the holiday, but it has yet to be received. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this in October and when it arrived in October 2005, I had trouble putting it together. The instructions were incorrect and there was an issue with the wiring harness in my car. I had to reset my vehicle and then restart the software and then download all the data. This is still a cumbersome process and requires a lot of patience. I am currently using the CD with the data on it and the CD player. The CD player works fine. The software is great and works as advertised.  The CD is just not compatible with the car software. I tried a number of times to make the CD work. I have no idea if this is an issue because I installed it on my car and downloaded and installed on my computer. If I had purchased the CD as a standalone CD player I may have succeeded in getting it to work with my car if the car was still functioning.  I tried installing the CD on my laptop with a Windows XP operating system and then installing it on the car's hard drive. The installation of the car will need to be done on both operating systems.  There is also no CD player software to play the CD either. The user interface works well but I had issues with the software's ability to delete or rename the content stored on the CD (I had to rename all the songs using my Windows Explorer). I tried downloading all the CDs (some are corrupted) and then playing them on my desktop and it worked. There is no other software for the CD that I could find to work.  My only recommendation is that the CD's have only been made available by the manufacturer and not through the official Sony web site.  If you want a copy of the CD, go to the official website and purchase a copy. I will be ordering mine from Sony.  Unfortunately this product works on Windows XP as well as the XP Vista.  This will require you to be on the Internet while driving so do not get behind the wheel unless you wish to purchase a CD that needs to be reset or re-downloaded. You will need a driver's license to access the Internet and the company website works better on XP. The operating system will need your vehicle's license number to work as well. This product has two CD player buttons but one of the buttons will reset the CD or will delete the files on the DVD. I believe the DVD can be used to make copies of the data and the driver's manual, but it does not have the "play"
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After I bought this product, I could not even type my name in the upper-case keyboard.  I had to switch the upper keys from the lower keys.  The upper-lower keys were not even the same.  They do not correspond to the upper or lower characters of my name.  So, I sent the product back, hoping to get my money back.  However, the return policy states, "Please return the defective item(s) at your expense to us.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  Our return process is not an automated system and will require you to return the item(ies) in a separate package or separately, so please be careful and not discard the item.  This item was never returned.  Instead, it was returned to Amazon and the return shipping cost was included in the receipt."  I then purchased the lower-case version and received a warning from Amazon that my address was incorrect and the product did not fit my computer.  Amazon's return policy is "Not compatible with your computer due to incorrect product ID number."  So I had a new problem - I purchased a different computer.I am hoping to receive my money and a new computer in the next few days.  My previous computer worked for about a year on this machine.  It is now out of service and the warranty will only be good for the next one year.  Please be careful with this computer, it is out of warranty and you may have to buy one for your computer.It appears that the "out of service" status can be checked.  For those that purchased the "included" software, Amazon requires an additional $15 for the "upgrade" which costs me $35.  Even Amazon's service agent was unable to figure out the way to obtain the upgrade software on this system.  A system upgrade would only be available through Amazon.  Again, the service agent could not find the upgrade program or how to obtain it.  As a result, Amazon has refused to return this computer. I do not have my original PC from when I bought it.I will be looking for another computer which will be cheaper and compatible.  But I do plan to send my original computer back. The computer was not returned to me.  Apparently, the software is a one-off thing and Amazon does not allow other computer upgrades to be done on the same system. I had purchased a previous purchase on my PC and
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got the green button stuck in a locked device that works ok, but only when the phone is on its own.  So, in short, it's really slow.  Also, it has a weird screen, has poor battery life, and the green bar gets too small.  All in all, if the phone has anything else installed on it besides the operating system, it will just get stuck in locked mode and the phone will not work.  The screen looks better when the lock on the lock is on, but not on its' own.So, in general, I suggest that you buy it and use it, but don't be surprised if it starts to work ok after that.  But, the screen works great on its', on the system.  You can get it back after a long time, but it might not be worth the trouble for the green-button locked feature.  I tried it and it worked fine, but when it got stuck, I had to reset my system with the lock switch

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item worked very well in my old radio, which broke down in October.  After the initial trouble-shooting I bought the newer model to replace it.  I have tried and failed to connect with it, and there is an option to transfer the software, but I have found that it does not work.  So I purchased a new, unaltered CD and still have yet to receive it. The software worked on the old CD I had.  This product was purchased by myself to give to my grandmother for her birthday.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this model only recently.  It's the same as the ones I tried out in my old computer, and they work as advertised, but the only way to see it's different from my old system is that my old and new systems' BIOS do not have the "reset" option for my old BIOS.  I had a friend (who has upgraded his old system in the BIOS) to compare my old one and my new one.  The "reset!" option works, but only works with the old system's bootloader.  So, now the old BIOS does not work in my new system.  My old bootloader is not available, which is a real pain.  This makes the system incompatible with the "original" Microsoft software, and Windows 98, 98SE, and 98SE2.  They don't allow the user to download the "recovery" system. They also won't allow Windows 98 to install on the same machine.  Windows 98SE has an option to install to another PC, which allows installing the new operating system.If you want to run the original Windows 98 without Windows 98 SE, then, you can use it with the bootloader on the old hardware (the bootloader for my new version is still available for use with the older hardware).  I'm happy with the functionality of my new device, however, I have not installed it, so I will not be able to test how well it works on a "regular" PC. I used the old boot loader on my old hardware. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If your device broke, it would not allow the user to browse the web for awhile and would not recognize my email address.  I contacted Amazon, the customer service agent said, she had another agent, she got back to me and said she would talk to me, but never did.  The agent did say the device did work as advertised, just that my "email address would not work."  If I ordered a new one, I would need to remove the device from my  mailbox.  In the end I decided to get another unit to use 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Don't buy this device! It was advertised as the correct size, but it is way too big and not very flexible, and you have to use it for more than 6 to 10 days before you use it. Also, it is advertised as compatible with more than one browser, but I found that I have to keep opening up more than just one browser every day (because of a recent bug). I was also disappointed with the customer support on this device--I tried calling the support line about 2 weeks ago, and the rep said I had to submit the device for warranty service. This may or may not be valid, depending on how the problem with the device is. I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device does not work with any of my printers that work with the same paper!  This is very disappointing.  I ordered my new paper from the local office, and will be returning the old one.  The new printer does not come with instructions to set the printer up correctly.  Once I had the printer set up, I was able to print the first page, but this device cannot print anything larger than a page, and the pages that have been printed do not print well 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had a bad experience.  I purchased one of these phones and installed it using my new PC.  This phone, when connected to my PC, has a hard time finding my system and will disconnect from it.  After disconnecting the device, the PC cannot find my system in Windows, but the phone itself still has the system on.  Unfortunately, this is the most frustrating thing about the phone.  The device would reset to a factory state but this is only after I reset the system.  It would not work in this state on my PC either.  When this device is reset, it locks up my PC and I can only use it when I have the system locked up on my desktop.  All of the information stored on the PC is lost.  Even if the phone has my PC in it, the phone would still fail to find it. The phone itself is a very basic device that works as well.   If the system is on, my PC is able to run a full install of Windows.  On Windows, the OS does have some minor quirks.  My system has some problems with system fonts.  There is also a system that is more capable than I anticipated.  To use it, one has to change the configuration settings from defaults to defaults.  If one does this, the system will reset.  However, I installed this setup on my computer and I am having problems with it too.  In my experience, this device will not function with a default configuration.  So, I would recommend using this setup with your desktop PC.The problem with this device, in general, is that the OS is a little slow when installed with the default configuration and the OS has many bugs.  With all of the bugs, the user interface is a bit clunky.  For instance, you can use the keyboard and trackpad together but you cannot type a text message from a PC that requires a keyboard.  While the keyboard is nice, the trackpad is not.  Sometimes I can type messages correctly and sometimes the messages will be garbled

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This phone is good for a single line phone. The battery is a big hunk.  I bought a single charger and the phone will only work with my Mac.  Unfortunately this phone has a high battery drain, even at low battery levels.  The phone requires a minimum of 1,500 to 2,000 mA to work in conjunction with my mac.  For a full Mac I had to turn off all features.  This means you may be able to use this phone with a mac on a Macs that don't have USB ports.  To use the mac on my macs I had the battery power off for several hours before power cycling the battery and reinstalling.  After that it has worked well in conjunction for many hours.  When I tried using the phone to connect to my mac in a mac running a mac version 1.5.0.    I tried this on both my mac and mac version 2.2.2 and both were able to connect.  Mac OS 1.8.1 and mac OS 3.2 could connect, but when I checked the battery drain on the mac I found it to be too high.  So this phone is not compatible with mac 2.x 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Overall, the buttons are very easy to operate and have very slow response times, and the sound quality is poor.  I bought this, and my hands are covered with scratches and marks from button clicks and dings.  The buttons are also very difficult to push in any direction.  This makes it difficult to use.  Unfortunately, this device does not allow you to play music in an unplugged mode.  In order to use it in an unloaded mode, you must have the radio on.  My radio worked fine and I did not use it unplugging in the car.  When I was trying to play the CD with the radio, I had to press the same buttons to use the radio and CD 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just purchased a DVD that had not been printed with the cover photo. It shows the movie, but not the cover. The cover had not actually been printed in that particular edition. The movie is in a special edition of the movie and so the movie was in that edition of DVD.I downloaded the DVD version of the game and found the cover image, and after trying to copy and pasting it in several programs, this is the result:It shows the cover, the movie (but not the DVD), but doesn't allow me to play the game.I tried several different DVD version and also tried the games, but the discs were not compatible with the computer I had, nor did they allow me an easy way to play.I did some research and found out that there are multiple versions of the disc for sale with different covers for various editions of the games. The discs are identical to the disc that the game comes on, and the cover for the game does not have a barcode or anything on it.All the versions of these discs have a number printed on them and one of the discs that has the cover from the game is not compatible, so I am not sure if there are a lot of different versions of DVD covers for the games that I can buy.It is a very basic game and has no option to load the disc with a special cover.All in all, it is a pretty basic disc and the game, though, works on most computers and is good fun.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was excited, but the unit died after one year on the shelf.  The instruction manual does not come with a repair card.  I received a second card in August 2010.  This is the one the system is compatible with the current software, which is outdated.  So I had to send my own software and the new card was not compatible with my machine.  It appears to have a bug or other problem on the back side.  If it is not updated you can still get the old software for the old card, but I am not sure about the newer ones.  When I used my laptop this spring the software started crashing.  As a result, I lost access to all my documents and other data on the machine. The firmware is still in use and it is slow to respond to user requests.  My problem is with the interface, not the operating system.  To add to the problem, it appears the system was designed to receive a user's last name.  A quick glance at the "name" field revealed that the name does not match the real name of the user's machine.I bought a new unit and it worked well for me, but it does not run the new software that comes with the new machine.When I have problems with the system, I have been told the firmware was a bug and that the "last name" field is not accurate, so I had better luck with the user manual.  On this system you do not have to use a user name to get access to the back end.  One could use a "first" name and a "last" name, for example, to add more names to the machine to support the number of users.  But I believe the hardware and software are compatible with each other.  In addition to the user interface, the only other user interface is in the "System Settings" program, but since I had trouble getting the new firmware to respond, I can only guess at its function.  Since this is a "feature" that works with Windows 7.  Other system interfaces also have Windows 7 support, but they do not work with Windows Vista.  Thus, it is important to have all three systems in order to run this "feature".  It is now time to try to get an updated system

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been having issues with the Bluetooth antenna. The antenna is not very good, so I have to tune my radio to listen to FM radio. If the antenna is really good and the FM radio will not broadcast on the FM band, I have a couple of radio sets in my car. I just have to manually tune my FM radio to "F" so that I can tune to FM and listen to the FM broadcast.I have a Radio Shack that works for my iPod Touch and it works well.I used it yesterday to listen some news and talk shows. This radio only works on the AM radio. The FM radio is only useful for stations that broadcast on FM and FM broadcast stations broadcast on AM radio, i.e. AM stations.So the FM stations I am currently listening to (which have to do with the AM station that has to do FM station announcements) are all on the first AM station broadcast on my radio.I hope this helps. I do use a radio with AM stations and am able to tune-in to all AM stations in the area.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product worked fine with my phone when I tried it.  I purchased the cd-rom for my sister because I thought I could replace it with another cd-roman.  The cd-rome was defective.   When I tried to play it, the machine crashed.  When it crashed, the cdrom was unusable.  It seemed that the program had "accidentally" been modified to read the cd as a CD and instead of the disc that was loaded.  You had to load a blank disc.  And after trying all sorts of different versions of the cd, the "new" cd-man would only accept CDROMs.  To my knowledge, this is how CD-roman works.  This is the reason for the crash.  Please don't buy a CD-rom 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I tried this product for a total of 5 days, and it works great, and works like a charm, but after a while, the device loses signal.  This is a problem, right?  It works fine when the signal is strong.  So you either use a strong signal when you are on a roadtrip (which is very easy) or you can use it when you travel on a trip and expect to lose the signal.I had my car's GPS working fine, but when I had the GPS on the way to the airport, I got lost driving.  When I got to the airports, I lost the signal when I landed.  That's when I made the trip to the nearest electronics store.  They were very helpful and did the necessary troubleshooting.  A trip to their service center resulted in the replacement device.  It was perfect.  You cannot fault the service department for its speedy service.  The new GPS was working fine for 5 days.  After this short time in service, my car GPS has lost the GPS signal in a few other cities as well.  There were other GPS signals around my car, but I did not have the GPS codes or any other information on these other signals.  I will be returning my new GPS back to Best Buy, and trying again.  All in all, my trip to Vegas was uneventful and there was no loss of GPS coverage.  Don't buy this unit, unless you plan to use it every day, because the GPS is not very reliable.  One of the other devices worked perfectly.  However, there was a very long distance to get to Vegas, and I had to get the unit back from Best Buy within a few days.I am returning mine and am looking for another one, and will try a different model number.

If you go to the link that I provided, it brings you to the system setup screen, where the user manual is not included.  To begin with, there is an option to restore the current version, but the user interface is very different from previous versions.  The old one did have a lot of troubleshooting and support pages.  It had a good support line, but this one does not.  They also didn't respond to my support request for the original 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit does not work with my camera. It says it's compatible with other iPods but no, that's not the case. I tried a few different iPods and it doesn't work with mine either. The unit will not work when connected to a computer and then connected to my iPad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device was fine until I upgraded to the new version. Then I found out that it can't handle multiple games. The game works with the original code on the CD and requires installation of new software.  The game requires a restart every time you load a disk or try to load a game. The disk works with some games. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered a few of these for my boyfriend and I and thought I was buying these to use.  One is not included in the picture which is just a normal color and one will fit my boyfriend.  If the picture comes out black and you cannot see a battery inside you will not have a battery.  It is a small unit.  This device was made by a manufacturer that was not responsive to e-mail inquiries.  I finally received a response with a customer service agent on the line.  He told me I needed to go to a different phone store.  A black-and-white picture of the battery with a color label is included with this phone and instructions are included.  These are not included with the black-white version.  Customer service said these are not for sale 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this item for use on my home computer which I use to access my home's web browser for use at the office as well.  When I use the browser to do this, the site is just like my home page (though with the site's name changed to my home name).  This browser uses my home address.  I was going to return this item because I purchased it and now the problem persists (which has also resulted in my computer giving me an error message on the login page, making my browser crash).  I returned it and received a refund.  This was a new device purchased that I already used on my computer which the seller never shipped and the user has since disconnected.  The device I received is not functional and the instructions have been incorrect.  However, this device does support an "Auto-Update" option.   The "Auto" button will give me "automatic updates" (which have not updated the site to my address).  However I purchased the wrong model

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just put a battery in, and the batteries don't work anymore.  I've wasted hours on this item and the battery charges and discharges so much faster than I would like.  This would be a good item for camping and to charge while out and about.  It also has a built in battery compartment.  That is not a feature I would expect on a piece designed for an all-in-one use.  While the battery can charge my car's battery, I'd have a hard time powering my car.  The battery is advertised for 50% battery power, but it works about 30% of the time.  Still not great.  Overall, this device does work, but I bought it in anticipation of using it to take pictures, and it worked fine for taking pictures, but there's nothing for it to charge my laptop.  If you do take pictures with this device, I would recommend that you turn the phone back on, set it up for use, and set the timer.    The timer function works well, but not well enough.  You can see the battery light, but the light doesn't stay on for longer than one second, like most timers.  Also, in the future, I'm looking to buy a second battery, or purchase a replacement battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed with the quality.  It is a very large and very expensive, and the battery was not reliable.  I used it one time and it started making a terrible crackling sound.  The next day I purchased a new battery and I was much more pleased.  Battery problems or no, I do not feel confident about this particular battery as it does not last as long as advertised.  A replacement would have been a better solution.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not an owner but I was able to get a decent price on this.  Very poor quality.  It was not working properly, i was able (successfully) to download and burn the game to a CD.  I tested that as well.  However, I have not been able to successfully burn this game to disk.  After using it (the manual works), it is almost impossible to play.  If you ever see that the disk does not work, you'll have to reinstall the game.  Unfortunately, the only way to uninstall a CD is to delete the contents of the CD from the player (for example, by deleting all of the user's settings).  This makes it unusable for future play. So, after doing this, I am trying to find some other CD's I can burn, and also tried to get some of the game for the disc and burn it to disk to the same way, but I found no success on it.  When the game's manual states that the game "does not work when the disk is unmounted".  Well, I can't find a way to get rid of this, and it is really very slow (about a quarter of the disk speed) when the disc is not mounted.  The disks that I have tried to burn have never been installed (the disc says that there is an installer for this, but it did not install the game).  I have found that it will not play without the disk in its case.The disk is mounted to the disc in the box and the game cannot be played by the player.  This is why I purchased the disc for play.All in all, this is a terrible, terrible product and I am unable to get back to it after installing the game...I'm still trying to get it working on some of my other discs.I'm just about to purchase another (if I can). I do not like the idea of installing it this way.  For some reason, I cannot locate it on this site as a link...it was a great product, but just too slow.  Maybe I should try to find it at a different site, maybe on another website, or try to install it the normal way and hope for the best...I'll try to update this review if I find it...however, there is a link to the manual in the game manual...I am trying that link as well, but not being able to locate

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is a bit cumbersome and not as easy to use as advertised. It has a manual, but this manual is only for Windows XP, not for Macintosh. Also, the system was never configured to run in a Mac. A number of problems with the manual and some of the functions (which are functional), led me to question its authenticity. I have had this system for about two weeks. My wife has also had it for about a week.  The installation is easy, but does not come with a backup copy of the software.  We've attempted to copy and install a backup from the Windows registry, but that doesn't work.  For example, some of my documents were missing, and the system does not run in the web browser.  I also purchased the original software and tested the system and the copy on my Mac with no luck.  In order for my wife to use this system she will have to run it in XP (a very slow OS) and try to copy a large amount of text to the system.  At this point, we're hoping this will be an issue when she attempts to upgrade the software to a newer OS.  Overall, I purchased this system after purchasing my other two.  This is not the system I wanted.  Even after spending almost $1,000 on it, I'm still wondering how the original model came to be installed as part of the original system. This system's "hardware version" (as the manual calls it) is 8.0, while the OS version is 9.0.  Our Mac mini had to be configured to work in XP mode (by clicking through the registry on the OS system to XP).  It would have been nice to see a manual for the system which explains what the different parts and buttons do.  It's really cumbersome, and I bought the original machine to try and see if the OS would work as advertised, and so far, this is what I have experienced with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The camera doesn't come out of battery when you put it on. The screen isn't very bright. There's a yellow dot on the LCD, but it only displays the dot, the green LED and the text.  When you touch the green dot, you are brought back to the home page.  The screen is small enough, and the dot on it changes color every time you touch it.  I put it in a drawer and I find a lot of little bugs in it. The dot that appears on the screen is different from the green one that appears in the home screen.  There's no control over the dot and the screen sometimes blinks on its own when you are watching it.A good web site for buying a newer model, with a better screen, is http://www.webtech.net

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used a $1 coupon with this order.  I checked the price on the device, and after a few weeks of use, it did not work on my computer.  This unit has no serial number on it, and it does not have a working software.  You can type in a string of numbers to the computer, and the keyboard will print.  The only option to use this unit is the Windows XP operating system.  It has several options, and does not work with the Windows OS.  Even if you buy this unit, you will not be able to see the Internet.  There are a number of websites that use the Internet through this unit.  However, the browser does not display the Internet!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased only on my second week of using.  Was a waste of money.  I've used it all of my life, and it has a horrible battery.  It would not hold a charge for more than 30 seconds, and even after that, it would drain in 30 seconds and need a charge every 1-3 hours.  You would need to charge it at a time when it would be available.  If you didn't have any other phones you would not use.  The only way to get the battery charged when it is fully charged is to reinsert the batteries to your phone when you need to use it.  Very frustrating product and very limited use.If the batteries would come in a smaller box, I'd rate it a 2 star.  Don't buy this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device has no GPS, no battery, no Internet, and no Internet card. I was not able to get any usage information from this system.  If I get to the base the GPS does not work.  It can only be used with the base.  The GPS works at night, but has the problem of giving false signals during the day.  In fact, the GPS can be turned on and off, sometimes during the night.  I was able to obtain a GPS address by using a browser that was in the base's memory.  This address is different from the base address, so the GPS will not work with the same GPS system. The base address has the GPS' name printed on it.  However, the base will not connect to the GPS system, and so, I cannot retrieve the GPS address from the unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   In fact, I'm ordering this item and plan on selling it to someone else to complete the set of 10. The instructions are clear and easy to follow but there is not enough space for all the discs. This will be a great set if you want to burn them all in one go, but I have been advised against that. I'm sure someone in Japan could do it but I do not believe they would be able to tell me how to do it. I will buy 10 and wait and see if someone comes up with the next one.I will try to keep this set available for sale to the general public and I will post a positive review about this set if it works for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's hard to figure out how to get it to work, which I had no problems with. But I have been told that it is not stable with older models, which may be a factor in the issues. There have been a lot of reviews about this device, and I've heard many good reviews. But there is no "best" version of this unit. I purchased mine and it works great for now. But it was made with the same firmware as my laptop. I have not been able to fix the problem. I bought this and have not tried it on my car yet.I have one and it still won't load anything on my laptop that I have tried to open up. It will work fine on my desktop if I can find a file on it. It works with Macs, but if it doesn't work with Mac OSX, I will be contacting Apple for it. I'll post more information here.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My first problem was that my computer was unusable.  I had to do some manual repair.  After I bought the software, I realized that it would not work with my Internet connection.  My Internet provider said that this was a mistake.  And that it is the fault of my Internet service provider.  So I had my computer working again and I did some other manual repairs.  But my Internet was not compatible with all sites, so some of the pages and searches were not accessible to me. I then had to change my Internet card for the other site.  For sites where the software was not working, I had had problems with some of my other computers, too.  If I wanted to do the updates, I did not know how to go about the update process.  It took a lot of time.

I called customer service and explained that I bought the device and it didn't work.  They said I would need to return it and they would send it back to me to try to fix it.  When I contacted customer service, I was told that the repair would cost me $30.  Apparently, the company decided it was cheaper for the customer to make the replacement device and keep selling the original version of the device.  The reason the original was defective was that the radio didn't contain the GPS antenna, which is a big mistake

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had to buy two of these units and it has a built in antenna that is not included.  I bought the first one about three years ago and it will work in the car and the first I have tried to use it the transmitter can work, but the wireless module would not install.  It would work in other systems and only works if I use my phone to activate it.  The only way I could get it to work was to install it myself or to turn the transmitter off and on and it would work.  If the transmitter worked I had the same problems with the phone and the phone didn't work.The radio works but the handset does not.  When I got it I was hoping that the unit might have been built differently.  But if this device was different then I could just install it the same way I installed the first two.  Then the radio had a built-in antenna, but this one wouldn't work with the antenna in my car.  This unit does not have an option for the phone to receive text messages.  Maybe I missed it in the design phase.  Or maybe I missed the update that made it work as the first unit.  Anyway, I bought it from the radio store and installed it, but it was a complete mess.  That's the radio that I bought.  And I now have to get used to having this transmitter in my pocket, so I don't use my cell phone and I am forced to use my car key.  After two years, this radio has a battery that would run it for about two or three months.  My next unit I bought was one with an antenna, which works in my other car.This radio is a nice thing to have, but I got tired of this wireless device.  There are a lot of functions and I'm finding out that the antenna, although it does work in my area, I cannot use it anymore.  At all.I really like the feature on the display that you can scroll through the songs and you can hear the songs from each station without using the FM radio, which is nice, but that's a small feature.  You have to flip through pages and you cannot click on individual stations.  On the AM station, you can only listen to a specific station at a time.  Each station is a different frequency.The best part about the radios is the ability to change stations while you are driving.  Sometimes you need

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only issue I have with this card is that it is not compatible with all models, so it is only used for games with a hard to use instruction manual, no manuals for any other games.  The user manual does not have a lot of information on the card's functions or settings.  It doesn't seem to be formatted correctly.  In addition, the card does not work with PC, Mac, or iPod.  My computer doesn't have the correct driver or firmware (the same way the original card was, anyway), so the card won't work with my computer.  I used it to transfer my games to a PC, but they would not play.  After the transfer, I downloaded and installed my games.The card is good for playing games, but it's not designed for the actual game play. The game play is not user friendly.  So far, I have tried everything I can do to get the card working with my game.  If you have the game up on the PC, I've tested it, but this card works on PC and Mac.  Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a lot the game that could work with this version of the game. I would suggest you wait and try some other time to purchase it.  There is an alternative version that you could purchase, but I have not tried it, nor have I tried to figure out how to do this.I am using the card for a friend who needs to transfer his own games to and from a PC for his work.  This is a great thing, but the manual is useless, so the games do not work properly with this setup.  Also, the game play on PC isn't user friendly at all and you must press the button a few times (not hard) to get games to work.If you are working with a game that was made for the original version of this card, you would need to copy the original cartridge (without the hard drive) to a CD.  However, since this card does come with a CD for your games, it is still a waste of money.  To get a game working on the original player, you need to get a CD and a second player.  All I have to say is it's nice for downloading games, and if you buy a second one it will work on any of the other game play options.The manual for this card seems to be in poor condition and will not work on newer versions

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Very expensive, even with the extra battery, I will use them one to four times a week and then just put them away.  I am about to order a new one and then I am just waiting for my mom to tell me to be patient.  Then I will purchase another one and get them back in operation.  If you want a device with a longer battery life, be aware that if the battery is not recharged before the last recharge, then it may not work on the computer until it is recharged.  So be sure to do this when the unit is being recharged so that your computer can be used.  And if you are going to be doing anything that requires more than four hours of use, I would recharges the unit at least once a day.  After two recharges of a regular battery on the unit, I tested it and I found that it would work fine but when I recharged the battery on my computer, it would sometimes quit responding altogether.  It seemed like it worked for a little while then would no longer respond at all.  Sometimes the machine would just stop responding after the battery stopped responding.  But the first time I plugged it in, it worked like normal but the computer would not respond, even though it had not been charged for a while.  The battery worked well, but the software on the machine didn't.  On the plus side, the software worked well the first two times it was tested.  Unfortunately, this time it stopped responding after just the first charge.  There's no way to tell the difference except that when I checked it again, the battery was not the same and the software has an extra step that I had to install that I did not have a clue how to do.  Once this step was finished, I was able to get the unit functioning without problem, but that's the only way I got it to work.  In the first battery, the operation was smooth, but when it was recharged it went into a reboot mode, requiring more manual input than I got from the device.  One other issue I had was that the buttons did not function well.  My buttons are too sensitive and it takes an adjustment, but this is an important feature for some reason.  This product works on Windows 98 or 98.  When I tested this product on Windows XP, it did not work, so it would be difficult to make a Windows XP machine without a boot disk

Also, this unit was not tested with the OS of my unit in order to determine that the OS is defective, which I am now in the process of repairing.  If this issue continues, the device will be returned back to the factory 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device does not work properly with some of my DVDs, which requires you to have the DVD in a separate drive or DVD player.  After the DVD was successfully installed and started, I downloaded the same application to my system and got to work.  I did not have the time or patience to look over the instructions.  When I tried to do so, the application went blank and froze on me.  The user interface and most of the functionality was substandard.  This product worked great with my regular DVDs, but not with my special DVDs.  A warning label would have helped me in those instances.  But I bought it anyway.   I also bought my own DVD from the store (in order to have a DVD player on hand), and it works fine.  It even works fine with my normal DVDs. I also purchased this version of the application so I could create my own customized DVD and it does work with my DVD player and the DVD player I have.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing is not as advertised.  The unit is not compatible with iOS 6.  And, since the screen is not large enough to read most books, I had to put up with having the iPod in my pocket.  I also have to set the iPod to do some settings and restart every 5 to 10 minutes.  It seems like the problem with this unit is the screen.  My experience was with a "fooling around" screen.I've had to manually set the "small" and "high" buttons, as well as some other settings.  This is a total waste of money.  There's not much in the settings menu, and I'm currently testing a new version.  If you want the ability to play your files, go ahead and try it out.

The antenna picks up the stations when the antenna is pointed at them, but it doesn't pick the station up well. I had to use an oscilloscope to see if the antenna was properly tuned.This is a good device if you're on an airplane - it can pick up stations in strong signal areas.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this device, I got it the day I purchased it (as a replacement for my laptop), but the software is still under development.  The software is not compatible with the Apple logo on the Apple iBook G2.  I'm not a Mac user.  My other devices work well with the iBook, but the iBooks have not worked with the G2 system at this time.  For the G4 the G3 was the best choice (the G3 is great for me right now).  I got tired of waiting for development of the software (and it worked for me in beta mode).  However, I found it on the net.  So, I installed the software in beta and I've been using this system for about a week.   I think the problem is that I purchased the beta software and got an upgrade, but that's not the case.  (The software is great, but it doesn't work well and is in beta).  It's been working for me, but I have noticed that many people have experienced the same problem as me.  If you are in beta, the G1 and G2 devices are not working with the system (the iBook works OK, but my G4 G3 G2 and G4 work ok).  After a lot of testing and tweaking, I am getting my own problems.  When you go to run the system from Beta, the iG1 system and the G0 and G0 G4 devices have the same problems, and that has been the case for most people.  It looks like I am the only person having trouble with this system at the moment.  Apple has been very quick with customer service, but this is the software problem.  In Beta it will install, but if you have beta or beta-1 on you, you will have to wait for Apple to release a new version with better functionality 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first device I purchased broke after 2 months of operation and I still have yet to receive any support documents.  The instructions do not provide for downloading the software via a web browser.  Instead, users are expected to print the manuals.  I purchased these manuals, but a web search reveals that there is no such support.  Further research reveals that it was published in 2001 and is no longer being updated 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery would be too heavy. I did not have the battery for this review and it was too heavy for my  wireless router.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device works fine, but the only way to get this to use as a keyboard on a computer is with this option, and that has the same problems as the regular keyboard.  The only thing you can do is to use an existing keyboard, or the normal mouse and scroll through the pages of a web page or a magazine.  This does not work on the tablet.  However, this model does have a number of nice features.  I just got this and use the keyboard to type my emails (which take a while to finish).  I have also used this on the web and it works well (I have found this particular option useful).  So far I have used it to mail letters, and I have found that it works OK on the computer to write my name and other contact information.  So there is some reason it may work, but I'm not really sure.  There are a number options for configuring this tablet, and many users have said that this works very well.  On the tablet itself, there are a few options for the user to change the screen resolution and the fonts and text sizes.  My unit has a very nice backlit screen and a built-in speaker.  Some of the text is also displayed on the screen (if the system is supported by the OS).  But when I tried to view any web pages or mail I had to manually type in my mail address into the web browser, and then the screen wouldn't turn on.  In order to access my mail or documents I had then to select it with the keyboard, and there's no built-ins to write a negative reviews about this.  Also, this unit's battery does not hold a full charge, and if it has been connected to a PC it will not work.   You need to charge the unit.  That said, when I ran into trouble, I disconnected and connected it to my PC so that I could try the battery, which worked, and charged the battery for me.  It took a few tries before I got this working in this device 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the battery to see if it was as good as the manual stated.  It has no backlight on the CD player.  The CD player has been working for some months, but has a very poor user interface.  One of the buttons has been mislabeled, and the buttons on the player are not labeled.  There are no instructions included with the CD; you have to manually go to the user manual to figure out how to use it 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this device for a short while and it did not work right.  I will try again.  This device is great for browsing the Internet and browsing the store.  Unfortunately it does not work with certain applications.  The product is great and works for the majority of the applications I tried.  However, the software fails to recognize certain websites, and some applications do not recognize the Internet card.  It will not work when connected to the Internet.  Attempting to make a call will not allow a user to dial out, nor does the card work properly with the dialer on a PC or Mac.  When dialing a number, the card will hang up

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item for $10 at the local grocery store. It is very cumbersome to carry and doesn't have any of the features of the actual iPod.

After buying two replacement iPods (which I bought) I was asked to buy a CD and use it as the user manual for this iPod

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These devices are very expensive and you have to buy the software to operate it. If you want to use it for a single user, make sure the user is granted write access. There is a bug that can result in a user being granted write-access only if a user name of a particular description, such as "John Smith" or "Smith" is in the user account's password. The software is very slow. This could lead to a user whose account is locked if his password is wrong and the user cannot log in. When the device is in operation, you have the option to turn on the option that allows the user to grant the user write access to the device when it is inoperable.  It is possible to do this by unplugging the battery, then plugging the device back in. If the user grants this permission, the user can then use the device for a short time without giving anyone write access, such that the device would work correctly.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thinking it would make it easier for me to handle large items. When I got it home and loaded it with my old bookcase, it worked OK for me, and I liked the way it looked. I also bought a set of three CD-ROMs from Amazon, but I have no experience with these yet. The set of CDs I have works fine for my car. I am happy to return this set to Amazon and try to purchase them.  I will let you know how it goes. If I cannot return these CDs to Amazon with the DVD, I am not going to order these discs anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   If this phone has no internet, I have the same problem. I called back the next day and got a customer service rep.  They asked me to send my bill and the customer service person said, "No need to send that yet.  This phone has not been issued a new ID.  There was a problem with the payment system.  The person I spoke with said, 'the system is not compatible with this phone number.'  It does not appear to be compatible with any other phone in New York 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a replacement charger that did not work with my new iPhone (and I used it only one time).  I tried a second time and it didn't work.  I returned it.  There's no way to tell how many have been sold or if anyone else has purchased them.   Apple says all new chargers should work with new phones, and so far only about 20 new phones have been shipped.  That's more than one-third of the 1,500 phone chargers that Apple says are required for new phones.  The chargers are all the same and use the same basic technology.  Each is intended to charge the new phone to 100% capacity.  Apple does not require a new phone.  My iPhone will charge, but I have had no luck getting an update to my software to allow charging.  And since I've tried to charge it using both chargers, I've had to repeatedly turn on the charger.  No new software for the old phone. Apple said they expect the first customer to receive a new iPhone with the battery.  It's not clear if this is just a software problem or an issue with the phone itself.  One thing is certain:  I've seen this problem before, on all three new iPhones and each one worked fine.  All the other new iPhones that I've received have the battery in the base and the base doesn't come with a back to hold the base.  (Apple has promised me this is an issue Apple will correct with software.)  The base isn't the only thing with battery problems.  Most phones have a hole in the battery case where the cable is plugged in.  This phone works fine.I bought one of these for my sister because it was $10 on sale, but it was less than half the original.  She also used it once and found that the phone had a slightly different software upgrade that broke the charger cable.  If the battery doesn't hold the phone to its own capacity, the phone will die.  For the rest of us, this phone seems to have problems with the new phones and the software.  We are out of luck in this area.  In fact, I bought my sister's new phone because I'm afraid that she may find the software and update it without our knowledge. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does not support the Bluetooth standard and is only available on this website.  I tried one and it worked fine but I have been unable to download or run an application.  This device is good for voice and data but it does not have a camera.  There is no screen.  When the device is turned on, it will work only for voice.  It is not compatible with GPS or maps.   A software upgrade will be available very soon.  So far the system works with all but the newest version of the Microsoft Office.  One has to manually enter the user name and password (which does not appear in the configuration screen) to make the system available for use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product had been great but it wouldn't charge on its own.  To recharge, you'll need to take a battery that the device can't power.  And to replace it, you can't go to the Internet unless you're a member or have a paid membership.  I tried several times and each time I got a page not matching the others.  That doesn't surprise me given what's available, but I couldn't figure out why this product couldn't be updated with the newest software to fix the problem.  It appears to have been discontinued.  Still haven't figured it out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device could not be found.  The phone was not compatible with the new GPS system.  I tried my best to find out what was wrong with the phone.  One of the buttons, if used, would malfunction and reset the phone to the factory default (it didn't work right).   After a very brief discussion with some technical support personnel, I discovered that the factory reset button was located in the "waste" area, and could be pressed by a user with access.  (I tried this repeatedly and was told the reset button had the potential to reset a phone without the phone being turned on).  The system was not supposed to be used this way.  Since the system was installed and it was a workable device, this was a case of misconfiguration that caused the phone malfunction.  On the other hand, a reset was possible with the factory system and it worked right, so it appeared that this phone was functional but I was not able to find a good reason to change it back to its original default.   I have since reset the system, and after installing it with the original OS and configuration, I also had trouble finding a good way to enter or print a map.  In the end, I tried several times to reset the device, and it would not register any of the maps that I printed, and I had to restart the phone multiple times.  A lot of work for nothing, other than a software upgrade that I tried, but again, it would fail to register the GPS coordinates.  So it remained as a software-only problem 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works on my home computer (I used to work in the library) and I can download applications, etc, but the software crashes at startup.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   One of the speakers has the lowest sound quality of the 3. The bass isn't great and the speakers don't handle it very well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am a little disappointed in the lack of an extra CD slot to fit the extra CDs in the car.  I also don't like the CD player because it has poor audio quality and the CD changer has limited functionality.  There are two CD slots, one for every CD in the case.  After a few weeks of constant CD use, I have the CD cases in and out several times.  The two CD changers are slow in operation and have trouble detecting a CD when inserted.  (I can tell they are slow because the radio uses the same batteries that are included with the case.)  The CD changery is very slow and unreliable.  This is a problem because I just bought another CD and am not using it to play the CD's.  But I don't know how long that will last.  Also, the CD drive works for one case per case.This is a serious defect.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device works like a paper cd-rom, not a CD-ROM. You have to load any disk you want to burn to this disk, and it cannot do the autorotation of cd-rw, cd-ro, cd/rw, dvd-rw. On top of that, the cd-router does not have any ability to handle cd-r/rw or dvd/rw. (I have used cd-lcs/dvd-lca to burn this cd-roman with autorizations on cd-sr, and with auto-rotation, but I still had to write to a cd-reader, and autorization works only on cd rw, but not on cd/rw, nor dvd. )If you try to burn a cd/rom to a CD/r/r or dvr it will not work with any autorisions.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is not reliable and has a poor battery that does not last a long time or even be fully charged.  The instructions are terrible and can take you to the site with all of your information for a quick look at other options.  I was able to get this unit to work for a while.  But after getting all the information in one piece, I got an update that didn't work on my copy.  Then the customer service staff told me I had to return the item and try again.  This time I got a phone number.  When I called it and tried to get through to customer service, it didn't even have any useful information.  After talking to customer support for over an hour, I finally figured out the battery didn't charge, even though the unit was still in its box with all my info.  They said I had the wrong battery, and had to send a new one to the factory.  Eventually I found a new battery that worked.  A few days later, the battery was still faulty.  Customer service said I should get a replacement, but that would be a lot of money.  My copy worked after I was given the updated instructions.  Once I got the information out of my original copy, I figured out that it works, and it's great!  I just have to reset the battery every now and then and re-sync the system.  Unfortunately, I found this unit on Ebay.  It came from some seller from Japan with the info and specs that I already had.  And this unit works great! I was planning to do a lot more research into these other units that are in production and are being shipped to the US and Europe.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   These cards are not very useful, and if you get a faulty card, then the "free" apps are not functional on most of them.  I tested it, and it worked fine on a single app.  There is no option to delete the app.I have no idea why the other apps that have it are not working.  Maybe the phone has to be configured.  If you go to the phone list, and enter the app on the app drawer, you get the standard layout.  That's fine, but not good enough 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   One other item I was trying to install.  It worked great, I installed it and started my laptop.  However, the battery's current life is only about 40% of the recommended rating.  So, I can use it for only 10-15 hours of continuous use, and have it in standby mode for when I'm running errands.  After 15 hours, I will run out of power, and the laptop will shut down.  The battery will last only 40-80 minutes.  Don't use this battery when you're in a hot environment, or in situations where you need to use it continuously for about an hour.  This is not a good battery for a daily driver who uses the computer every night.  When you're not on the road, it might be a good idea to buy a new battery from Amazon

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this model (the older version) with the wrong antenna.  I tried this model, then that model, and it was all good for the longest time.  The antenna worked OK for me in the new version of XM.  But the antenna does not work with older radios.  There are no options for it on the older radios either.  You have to find the radio manual for the newer radios and turn it off.  This is the manual that came with the old model.  After it was turned off, I had to call customer support to have it reset.  My technician took me through the steps, but he told me he couldn't find the button on the radio that he used to switch radio bands.  He couldn't remember where it was on the old version of the radios. I tried it with a different radio.  With the new radio, I was able to get it up to my settings.  By doing so, I could still get my old radio's antenna working and set my new radio to the right channel, so I could get the two radios to communicate in the same band.  It's a minor inconvenience, but it does make it a bit hard to pick up the new channel (because the radio has a smaller antenna footprint).  My only solution is to keep my old radios on my pocket, in the glove compartment of my car.  When I get to work, I have to flip to my left radio, then flip it back to the old channel (which is how I ended up with my old two radio channels instead of the two new ones), so I can keep my left antenna up.  Unfortunately, I can't get an antenna with the new model.I have also had trouble with my computer.  For the first few weeks, I couldn't get it to work on my laptop.  A couple times, I tried going to it through the Web browser and it didn't work.  Eventually, I just decided to try it on my Mac.  And it worked, but I had no luck getting it to go through my computer settings. The only way I can get it out of my Mac now is by going to my desktop and then to my computer (and turning off the Mac).  I have the same problems as the guy who owned the newer XM antenna.I used my new laptop in the office (a $100 system), and it worked well.  Of course, my
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   There's no way to cancel the service. It's a big investment for a small amount of service. I've tried everything with no success. After about 6 months of this, this phone stops making any calls.It worked fine for about two weeks, but then stopped working altogether. A tech tech support representative was polite enough to give me a replacement but still didn't want to bother checking it out, saying "This phone is working fine.  Don't worry about that." I thought that was a good start. I just had to get it running again, which is easy but frustrating. So I tried to restart it the next day (I've got a "live" number but it's no longer working).I'd like to give this phone a great review:  I'm happy with the new features, but I'll wait until they're stable before I buy another one.  There are so many nice features, it's just a pain in the ass to use. And the software is totally unreliable, making it impossible to make phone calls (I had to call for help before it would work, too).The worst thing about this phone is that I've lost money.  The company is great to work with.  I'll give it another try once they fix the software problems.  This phone will never be worth its asking price, by the way.  Buy it for now, and go through the troubleshooting steps, though.  You'd be surprised how difficult it is to have a functional phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got one that would not operate when I tried to make any calls.  I then called them "unknown."  I called it, and found out it does have a phone dial that functions.  So, I guess there are two dials.  If you call the one that works, the phone dialer prompts you for a password.  It was not hard to enter, but I found that if you try to dial a "personal" number or the other dials, it won't work 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product isn't good for all the different screens.  I use it on one screen but it is not a very good one and I cannot access it on the same device with Windows 98.  It requires the user to have a copy of Windows 98 on the computer in order to use the copy of Microsoft software.  This is a poor design for the software and the software is buggy and is prone to crashes.  In addition, it's not user friendly and the controls are very weak and not intuitive.  The software is not designed to work with MS-DOS or Windows 95.  Some users have complained that the problem is being exploited to allow the user unlimited usage of the product by Microsoft.  Microsoft is still selling this product and has been known to sell the software with no warning.  All I can say about this product is that the user has to do a complete "clean install" of Windows 95 or XP if they want to be able to use Windows 98 from the operating system without Windows 98 copy.  My advice to Microsoft is to get some better software and improve the user interface.  If MS could make the product better the software itself could be improved

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wish this one worked, but I have used it for about 20 minutes, and have a bad experience.  I tried setting my phone to "call", and it turns out to be a dial tone.  So when I used the telephone app, my first two digits for the phone did not work;  the phone is too loud, and the handsets have no menu.  My husband tried setting up a call and he had to press buttons to get a hold of the screen.  The phone works fine, but its too small and the screen is too bright.  On the other hand, it's easy to use a phone with the dial to find my contact list.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item because I had ordered another of the same thing and they did not work, even after a manual update was made.  This product requires an electrical outlet and the battery does not charge any battery or charger I have purchased for my iPad 4.  The manual is in a small paper bag with the same "Quick-start" instructions as the original, and the charger also works with the iPad 4 and is compatible with the "Quickstart" software.   If you try to uninstall the "quickstart" program, it will crash.  A small repair fee would be necessary 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It seems to come out of place in most cases.  I tried it out, and it did not have any of the features that I had ordered.  There is no way of telling if this feature is available to you unless you call, or it can't be turned on because you don't have a telephone.  You must download it or install it.  This phone will run out of battery very fast.  Once this phone is turned on, you need to turn it off every few weeks or so.   Sooner or later, you will need to reset it. In my experience, when resetting the phone, it took my phone about 4-5 times to do so.The phone's battery will last about 5-6 weeks.  If you don'

I know I'll make the switch from my phone to my camera if we're in the car, or I might just switch to the phone and take a photo.  Don't get me wrong.  But the problem with this device is that it works better with my phone than with my camera.  This is a good device, but I use it with my  phone when I'm driving and it works well for me but not for my camera or my  wife's  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this thing is it doesn't work with your iPhone and it's not compatible with the web. It will only work with the phone application on the phone. This was a very difficult phone to setup, and a real headache to use. I tried for hours to setup my web app.  It works and does work with a different operating system. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've bought this product at a different store, so there's the possibility that this will work with other Samsung devices.  It also works on my computer, but I've used it to transfer files to my printer and a couple of times when I've transferred files to it, it has not worked with the printer or a printout of an existing file.  On the other hand, the original unit has worked on my desktop and I've not tried to transfer a file to it yet.  I'm also going to be trying this thing out with other devices that I have.  The main limitation of the original model I have worked with is that it will not work with some printers with a color profile that was designed for print outs of certain printers.  There's also a drawback on the "hot" end which will not produce a sharp image, so this will result in some slight loss of sharpness.  In addition, the color of the image in the web browser that you'll get can be different than what you're printing.  So, for example, if you've printed an image from your printer and then used this to copy it to another printer, the results may not be what you expected.  But overall, this unit works great on my printer.  And, this phone does work, but it is not a very nice device.  If you have a printer with a printer "hotend" that uses a color preset with white paper, it doesn't work.  This phone has a light bar on the screen and it works OK.  One of the things I would really like to see Samsung do is to redesign it so that the light bar will be functional on any of the devices. But that may not happen for some time.  Another design improvement that could help the unit to perform better with other phones is to make the lightbar smaller.  That's just something I would like to have.The phone's screen is very small and it takes up very little space on my laptop.  Also, my laptop sometimes works better because of the color calibration problem, but the unit itself is fine.The web browser's display doesn't have a very good default image quality and there's some oddities with text display.  Overall, the web-browser experience isn't very user friendly.  Some features that work, though, like sending text messages and listening to the radio, are excellent.  However, the other features that operate, like the

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item has a very bad design and very poor user interface.  I was very disappointed in this item.  It's basically a plastic cover for a printer.   The original manual (which I can't find anymore) lists an "automatic feed" that "auto-loads" the current feed whenever the machine is switched off.  This can take a few hours.  But the "automatic feeding" does not work well.  A number of users have told me that the feeder is slow to load new documents.  Many users have taken the machine home and installed it at work.  One user even tried it in his office.  He reported that it took an hour to get it up and running.  And this device requires manual operation.  Manuals for the original machine are available here and here.  While both the manuals were dated for the current version of the device (v2.0.0), they still work on this machine

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a pretty good phone, but I find it hard to use.  When I try to connect to a wireless signal with my home Internet, it will only connect me to an internet access point in my home.  The internet in my house is slow, and the speeds are very slow.  However, there is an alternate way to connect this phone to the internet that has an advantage.  In my home there is a wireless network that has a built-in scanner.  I have not tried this yet, but it seems to work well.  It is nice that my home scanner can be switched on and off as needed.  Overall, this phone does provide more functionality than my earlier phone.   It has an auto-erase feature, but this can be disabled.  My friend has a scanner and it works well.One drawback is that this phone is quite loud in comparison to my previous phone. I am looking for a better phone.I still haven't had it in any sort of use

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The antenna is not directional and works only in the city.  I have a hard time finding it at home.  You might be better off with the one in the plane.  This one works, but is very directional.  Its also not very stable.   It will work, but its not great at providing signal in a rural area where it will be difficult to find.  It can only work with the airplane and the tower.  If I try it with the tower on the ground, it does not work as well.  (The only use for this antenna is on the airport.)  The towers are located in the north and south and the antenna will not work when the plane is taking off or landing.  The tower can be seen from the runway, but it has no signal.  Since I do not use this antenna at all, it was time to find another way to get the plane home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these at a Wal-Mart, in the summer of 2003, after it had been out for less than a year and was still going strong.  In all of my driving around town and trying to find parking in this area of town and other major cities, I noticed that it is an option to purchase this item with a prepaid debit card for purchase, so I purchased it.  The seller told me the card would work for purchase on the internet, but I could not locate the web version of the page.  I have emailed it a few times, but have not received a reply, and I have not tried it online, as I said I purchased from a local store.  Apparently there are some differences between the web page and web version; the web site was not updated as I write this review.  Since Wal-mart does not ship this item on a regular basis, I will not purchase another one from this seller.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this product, in an attempt to have a new, larger battery pack than that I purchased for my old pack, and a new one for my new phone.  The instructions on the pack are pretty basic and not that helpful.  It is advertised to work with the newer phones (iPhone 5 and newer) and older phones (iPod).  The newer phones are much more difficult to set up.  They will require the "backup settings" which are not as easy to set.  To my knowledge, there was no way to have the newer phone configured to work for me in my house (where I have no Internet connection), but I used the "start settings" option.  I did not get any instructions on how to set the older phones up in the package.  However, I did get a nice sticker that came with the new phone set up on my old phone, but it has my old ID card number on it, along with the device info.  (Note:  I used my older ID card before I installed it on my iPhone 5.)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is very bright, and if you do the math, it's not useful for anything besides printing and web surfing.The image is so small that it does not work for the web. You need a special viewer, or at least one that lets you resize the images for web surfing and printing.  The viewer does not come with any instructions or help available.  A search on the web for anything on this model leads me to various versions that have different specs (like the screen does not match the rest of the software).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this printer for a single copy of a book.  It was fine for the paper.  The printer's cartridge is designed for books and magazines, which are not included.  If you want a single-copies-per-page option, select the "Bundle" option at the top of the menu.  I've had to go back and change the program to accommodate single-copy-perpage.  My copy of "Milton and Hersel" in a book did not come out as smoothly as it was intended for the original printing.   The pages are not aligned properly.  But, that's more of a problem with my copy than with the printer.  As the printer was manufactured in the same plant as a book printer, I have a feeling that this may be the only known issue with it.  So, for those people who like to print from books and magazine, I suggest getting a single print run from the factory before buying from Amazon

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item thinking this will improve the sound, and it will. However, when I use this product I get a very weak FM signal with any kind of music that was previously played on this radio.  I cannot make any kind new recordings, the FM station is too weak, and if I turn the FM dial to find a station that I want to listen to I can only find stations that I previously purchased.I ordered this radio the same day I bought the FM transmitter, thinking that this unit may have caused interference with other units.  However, if this radio was a problem with other FM transmitters the problems with other radios I had with this FM transmitter had caused the problem for me.  This radio had no FM tuner.  My antenna does work, but the radio does not work when I am trying to transmit a radio station that is FM broadcasted.  The radio has a weak antenna.  On the FM broadcast it does pick up the FM stations I have previously purchased and has a great FM signal, but I have been unable to make a new radio broadcast using my old FM transmitter.  It works in the AM radio station I am on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A cheap product is fine for me at work, and is more cumbersome than I'd like, though I can work with a simple keyboard and use a touch pad if I need to.  I would never buy this as a gift or for someone else's use.  The product is not that easy to set up in my office.  This product works fine, but it's so flimsy and the screen is so small that it requires multiple people to work with it to do any meaningful computing.  Even setting it up requires a lot of back and forth between a user and the manufacturer's website to figure out how to do it.  If you buy this, you will need to keep up with the manual so that you know exactly what the setup is like.  You can see that the instructions are not good, but the product manual is not very clear.  There's no explanation about how to use it at all.  One thing that bothers me about this product is that the button in the remote to reset your router can not be reset unless you hold down the button for a long time, which is very frustrating.  As far as I know, this product does not have the capability to connect to any of my personal routers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   We're told these devices will be compatible with iOS and Android, but in reality these devices do not meet our needs. We will not be upgrading these devices until we have the opportunity to test them in the field.We have had one user report that the battery did not work when it had not been charged with the battery charger included in the box, we were told this was a hardware fault not a software problem. We contacted Apple, but have yet to receive a response from them. We have received a number of emails from Apple customer support staff and have yet no response. Apple has failed to communicate the problem.If your device fails to work, you will receive the instruction manual and will need to visit the web interface to download all the required software for the device.If you have this software, it requires an Internet connection. The web interface has two options, however, for your computer, the user must be logged in to the Internet. For this reason, the device has been designed to work only with the system and not with any user-created user accounts. The system is not compatible with a user-generated computer, not with a Web browser.We had hoped for a system that would work with the web browser (which is a bit more user friendly, however) and would not require an Internet login.However, at the time of this review we were not able to get the device working with the Web browser by default and have since deleted the Web interface.We now have to find a way to update the hardware and then log into the web service.We will be updating our devices soon with an upgraded software stack. At this point, we have not received an update for this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very frustrating product, even when installed with a single monitor.  The screen uses a power button.  You can use the "on" button to move a little but the "off" button allows you to toggle the monitor on and off.  In the manual it states that you can use both buttons on the monitor to switch it on and on and so forth.  I tried this and it does not allow you to switch on and then off the monitor. I have been using this feature for the last 6 months.  This feature has not been tested for more than 2 hours at a time.  After that the screen displays the picture and you cannot turn it back on.  Now I'm stuck with a 4 month old, unused, monitor that is no longer reliable

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   Purchased this with a one year warranty.  It works perfectly.  The only thing about it is that it does not protect the memory card in any of the devices listed above it.  Also, the instructions on the manual say that you will need to use a CD and the CD with this device to copy a program.  I purchased a new CD in the mail.  After I copy the program onto the CD, I was able to find that I was not able to copy any files onto the memory cards and the memory was frozen, so I used this CD to copy the contents of my memory to the memory of my computer.  This does not work.  Now I have no clue how to copy these programs onto a memory card.  However, I did find that on the CD I can copy the programs onto my memory cards.  But I'm going back to the dealer today and trying to get this fixed.  If this does not repair all the other devices, this CD will be useless and useless.

I installed it on my home network (at work).  i did get a popup warning stating that it is a free trial.  after downloading my first half dozen songs it has worked but the trial will expire on january 31st 2006.    it works but i just installed a newer version of my  software and the trial expired and i have no idea why.  it was up and running for two days 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price is very good, but for someone who uses it, I've been using it for awhile and have had some troubles with it.  In some ways it's a little frustrating.  It can hold a lot of pictures, but not all.  Also, it does not have the same quality as the original.  I purchased this after my original one died on me.   I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to repair the defective hardware, but it's been hard to use it with all the pictures I have stored on it and has required me to set the pictures on fire with the button.  However, the original one didn't have a setting that would do that.  Even though it has a lot more features (and, therefore, has more memory), the original software didn't work with these features, and they were difficult to use.  The software can be found from the Internet 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I don't use the buttons, and I have to check the clock every 5 or 6 seconds so that I don`t get up and go to my desk to check for a time-out. It would be great to have the correct date and time and be able to do more than one check for the clock to stay in sync 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is extremely slow. I am currently in the middle of a three day trip and this is the device I use for this trip. I do have to keep restarting my computer after using it. A friend who is using this device tells me that it is very slow. It also has this bug that can cause the screen to go black. I bought this item thinking this would allow me to use the device, but it is not compatible with OS/2 and it doesn't work under this version of the operating system. I have no idea why this bug exists.I bought it thinking this device would allow users with OS2 to create user names and passwords. This will allow users who do have OS2 with this device to create passwords, but these passwords do not work. I was trying to create a password but when I tried to log in to my OS2 account it gave me an error code.  I then created one and I use it for logins to this device.This device will not run under Windows 3.1. I called Microsoft. When I talked to a representative, they advised me that I would have to purchase a new version. I asked for this bug in return but was denied.I called Microsoft again and was told I would need to purchase the "Windows 2000 SP2 or XP" that I had previously purchased from Microsoft, which had the same problems.  So this is a one way ticket

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The device is not reliable enough for my needs and is much more expensive.  The user interface was very difficult to use.  It also does not allow for any customization options for the radio.  This is a waste of the money and should be re-released.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have spent my last 20 dollars on this card. The battery works fine, but the card itself doesn't work on my phone. My friend bought mine for me and it works fine. I will be purchasing a new one as soon as it is available. I bought mine about a month ago and it worked just fine. There is a good reason why no other card would work with my phone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased it thinking it would make my car faster, and I think it may have helped the car be a little better when I drove to work this morning.  I used my laptop on an e-reader, and the thing is slow, especially when you try to navigate to pages in different browsers.  If you want a faster experience, you must change your browser options.  It has no support for touch or mouse-oriented menus.  However, this device is usable for most of the applications that you have installed, including email, and text messaging.  This may be my only problem with the product, since I do not use it on a daily basis.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This unit does not work with the new system and I have bought this unit in order to avoid this defect. The old system was great.The new system is no more reliable.It now has a screen bug which is a nuisance, and the device has a high risk of burning out the battery. I purchased one to use with my old system, and it works fine.However, I will have to pay extra to get the new one if I am not using the old system again, even with the old battery, which means I won't be able to use the old screen.This system does not do video, so I will not have access to the old or new system for this month.The system is available for purchase now from this web site.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is of very low quality.  My iPhone 5 did not have any apps that I could download.  I had to download my e-mail and my web browser (both of which are browser hijacks).  On my iPhone 4, which I bought in August 2011, I could not install the web browser, although I did have the option of installing my e mail.  But when I went to use the web page for the new firmware upgrade, it would not work.  In fact, my old e mail had an error message that told me that it had been "stolen."  However, I was able to get the new e mail 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very disappointed in the product, the video was very grainy, the battery did not hold a charge very long. I tried to use it for a short while but got distracted by the video on the TV.    The battery did a great job at holding up the video and the television for a long time but the power-off timer worked for just a few minutes and it is too early to tell if it works as well at the next level.  I've put the TV off in several spots during the night and the phone has also worked intermittently.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's not a good piece. It works OK, but after the second day I needed some software which could be installed by a PC. I had no clue where to find this software. I tried installing it from my PC and getting some assistance from the user interface. The person I got assistance from was a very nice lady, but I don't know why the software doesn't work in the same way on all the computers.  It is also not compatible with Windows XP and Vista.  I used this in the car when I first used it.  On my PC it was more or less compatible with my PC.  A second PC on the network.  When I checked the system with the PC from my car, the drivers didn't seem to be installed.  In addition, the software was not working with the WinXP drivers which were on the Win XP Web site

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this card for about 2 months.  I'm getting tired of waiting for a new model.  It is also very unreliable.  The card comes with a new battery but it will only work in one way.  When the unit does not turn on it goes straight to standby mode.  (It will be off until the charger is connected.  This model was sold from a website.  My battery has lasted two months but I plan on replacing it.)  I called customer service once and was told it was a problem with the battery, but I am still getting calls about this card from people in different parts of the country.  Do not buy this device.  Get another model. There is a reason I had to wait 2 months to get it working and have it tested.  Don't buy this card unless you plan on upgrading.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a card that failed to work, and it was out of warranty for about a month.  After that, I bought the card again, but after it failed to function properly, and I had to wait for it to fail a second time.  It had to be taken out of service again.  I received the original receipt, and the card in service had been "refused" to the service center, and they were unable to repair the card, and could not return it to me because it had been sold to a customer in another country.  This particular card failed to do so well at all.  At first, it worked, but it never worked again. I got it back, and after it worked for about 1/4 of an hour, it stopped working properly again.The original receipt had been returned to me, and when I got my second card, the same thing happened.  My card worked, and then failed, and again, I had a hard time getting it to work properly.  The "failure" of the "new" card seemed to have been the cause of the failure of the two other cards.  One card worked perfectly, the other card failed completely

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this device and the screen was bad for the life I was given. The picture is terrible. I had to check every page to see if I was missing anything. On a typical page there is a "help" section at the bottom of the page. It's easy to just ignore it. There were instructions for turning on the TV but I am certain the settings for the software are set to turn off. This was the first time I tried the software. On my first attempt I accidentally deleted the TV's backup file. If the TV works on the second attempt, I am not sure what kind of a problem I have. The software was also very difficult to use. I tried it out and it ran the TV for a few days without problem. The screen also had a weird orientation. It didn't show the most recent news or the weather. I set the screen to show the weather every night. The menu doesn't appear to be user friendly. I have been on three different units since then.  I have checked all the screens and tried to reboot them, just to no avail.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit worked fine when I received it, however, the web site has very limited storage space for images.  It does not store any pictures with text.  The user interface is very limited.  This was not a fun user interface to use.  There was no option to view the image while viewing the photos or text. I purchased the first one and I am currently unable to get it to work.  I used the photo-to-text conversion tool on the web and now I am trying to get another copy of the photo

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered my wife the same thing that I had the old model in - which is a very, very large unit.  In addition to this, it is only capable of playing in the most recent games (though I have tested and verified with previous copies).  The screen is a small area for the player, and there is no way to turn it off in any of the games (which I like)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is not user-friendly and it's very slow.  There's a lot of lag, and the video quality is poor.  If you have any problems, you should try another browser (this one worked).  Don't bother, it is very slow and very buggy.  It doesn't let you use the search feature (or anything else).  My advice is to buy another device, and then switch back to my old browser.  I've since spent a lot more time using the web browser anyway, and my experience with it is much better.  Unfortunately, the device can't work on an  iOS device, which means this model of phone requires  special software that has to be downloaded separately 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device works well, but doesn't work with Windows.  There are a couple of functions to be disabled and this device will work with Linux, but you'll still have to set up your system manually.  On Linux, I tested the Linux version on my desktop.  This is a nice device, but the operating system isn't great.  I used a Linux version in an emulator and had problems when trying to play a game.  The other problems I experienced on this machine were not as bad as I had expected.  After playing games, I disabled the Bluetooth, then connected a USB cable to my laptop to use it with my Linux system.  Once my laptop was in the machine, I started an SSH session to connect the Windows desktop.I tried all of the available buttons on my keyboard and it did not work in this OS.  However, if you click the "Backspace" and "Enter" keys on the desktop keyboard, you can type a command to disable the Bluetooth and reboot your Windows system, however I didn't have any luck with this device.  With my experience with Windows, I can't tell if disabling the Bluetooth is an option or not.  If you want a wireless keyboard, consider using a Microsoft Bluetooth keyboard, which does work with windows.  Unfortunately, this keyboard also works with Linux.  (I found this out because I was able to run a web browser) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The CD had a big sticker on it and would not open. I tried it a few times and it worked ok. However, it was not formatted to be used with Windows 95. After trying several times, the CD player would not play the CD. I installed the CD and tried to install the Windows 95 from the CD, but it would not load. I went back and tried several times to install Windows 95 and each time it would freeze. I found out that the CD had been installed using the CD burner's power, but that was no use, because the CD burned up. The burner had also failed and the CD did not work on this computer.I bought Windows 95 Pro from Microsoft and used it to install. After installation the CD was recognized, but the Windows software failed to find the CD drive.After the installation finished, it failed to recognize the drive on the Windows desktop. I loaded the CD up on the computer and tried, but I was unable to select any CD or DVD drives.I tried it on another PC that I had, and it did work, but had problems with the registry and with Windows. After that, it would refuse to run on the main computer.It worked well on another CD, and the same thing happened. I then used it on the printer for the printer software that I wanted to use. The printer driver would not recognize the CD or the Windows drivers.I was able to get the printer to work on the CD; however, when I tried to print any document, the computer crashed. I thought maybe the computer had some sort of glitch.After I tried several of the CD-rom drives on the scanner to print the documents, the printer would not print anything.  I tried the CD reader and printed several documents, but again, the scanner worked with all the files.  After the scanner had print problems, it also crashed.  My instructions on how to print documents with the CD were correct.The software has the ability to recognize and run Windows 98 if you have it installed.  If you do not, you have to uninstall the program first.The CD burner was not recognized by the printer driver.  It was also recognized by other CD players; however the driver for those also did not recognize it.After installing Windows 98, I was able print several documents.  There was no problem printing a few documents, and I was very satisfied with the quality of the paper and ink. However I noticed the CD has
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this model is that it does not work with my router. I have to reset it, and then it will not connect. I can see the serial number in the web browser but when I try to connect, it is not the case. The instructions say to call the manufacturer to obtain a phone number, but I do not want to call this number as I am trying to connect with my server and not my client. I would appreciate some advice. Thank you. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was able to get this device for the full cost for a few weeks.  I went through and cleaned and replaced it several times over this period.  After a while it just refused to work.  The computer would not go through the BIOS update process.   After some troubleshooting, I finally got the BIOS up and it would load but would hang.  My guess is that the battery was bad or my PC was not up to date.  It is a great product and it works but I have never had it work for any serious application.

It's a piece that only charges a handful of phones, not my whole phone, but the charging cord is so slow I cannot use my phone with it.  There are no settings for this device, nothing to do.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this item, I found a few bugs in my laptop and one that just wouldn't work with other computers, so I had to return it to Amazon.  The company says they are aware of the bug, but as I found out after trying to make a deal, I cannot purchase more than 100 units per year (this does not have to be the case with all of the Amazon "new-product" releases) and will keep shipping the units until a bug is found that will stop the laptop from working with other laptops.  This bug is fixed in the Amazon forums, but the Amazon store has not, so the problem remains.  I have purchased a few of the laptops from Amazon to date and have used it and it has worked okay.  Amazon will not issue refunds for these bugs, even though they are identified and corrected.  So, if you're going to buy one of these laptops, I would advise you check the Amazon forum to see if they have a list of bug fixes in place to get this bug fixed.  Also, in the same forum, Amazon does list a number of other bugs that have been fixed, but they are not in the newest release.  That is, in my experience, Amazon has been slow to fix the bugs in the latest releases

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The camera didn't work the first time I used it.   I had it for the second time, and that worked, but the third time I tried to use it, I got an error message that said, "The device could not be loaded correctly."  The error message also says that "the original firmware is not compatible with the original device."  I tried many times to load the firmware to the device, but it has a number of errors and can not be installed.  This software is also in some older devices, so I tried that, too.  It also is in some newer devices and some that I used at work and couldn't figure out how to get the files.  As for a way to get this firmware to work in the older devices (like the one I got from work), I tried it, and got this error message: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The button is too sensitive, too sensitive for most applications. The buttons sometimes work but the touchscreen sometimes fails, especially if the screen is oriented to landscape. The menu is too limited. The touchscreen doesn't have any buttons or scrollwheel for scrolling through documents, and it doesn't appear to be responsive to scrolling on its own.  This device worked well for me until it began showing random text on the screen and displaying random photos.  I was able to reset the device with the software to return the screen to normal.  However, there are too many defects to recommend this device for use by non-technical people.  For example, it doesn`t have any battery life indicator or battery status menu.  The software requires a reboot to return to normal functioning.  As of May 21, 2016, this phone was showing a status of 3 to 10% of battery life. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. After all she used this device for many years. I still have not received any communication. I was so disappointed. My wife was not able to get a hold of someone in Australia to get help. I contacted the service center and they said it is not going to support any other carriers. They told me they will continue to update the software. I have just purchased this again and have tried to install it again. The installation will fail because the software cannot be installed by anyone other than a system administrator. I purchased the software, tried installing it and found out that the installation is much more difficult than before. I tried many times, and everytime I do this I get an error message saying that the system cannot be turned on.The system is now useless and there is no way to remove it from my system. I cannot get the software to recognize my system, so I can only use it to test it and get back to it in order to try and fix any problems.I purchased this system because I was in the market and wanted to use the software and get it back into a working state. I bought it without knowing the device had worked without a service center help.I had to go to my local system administrator and tell him this information.I called them up and left numerous messages and have since received a number of errors. They never returned my call.I still have my wife's system and will use this system to test the system, but I am not going back to Australia to do a service check on her system because this system works now and is not supported by a single carrier or even by the original manufacturer. This is not an inexpensive system, even if it worked it would probably not be a good upgrade for this system.This system is not even a complete system. It is a complete mess. The computer is not functional. It requires you to get it installed with a complete CD with all of your files. The manufacturer also sold this CD to the service provider. I would love to receive this system back for use as a computer but the software has failed. I'm going to attempt to get the system to work by myself because I don't want my wife to get involved. I really just want to make sure this system does work. This one has done its job. I use it for my home and it works OK. I am getting very frustrated and hoping the manufacturer will fix the software

This is a huge inconvenience because it has taken me forever to figure out this is an error and that I will have to redo my work.  I use my copy of "The Book Audio Audio Audio Handbook" to fix this problem.  My previous monitor worked perfectly.  The screen has no support.  If I have the printer, I do use it to print some papers.  That is it, really.  It is not even an option to print the manual.  To use this unit, I have to do everything all over again.
