Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie when I was on vacation. I was just sitting on the beach and listening to the soundtrack. I knew it was going to be another horrible mess. I watched it in about half time, and after about 40 minutes, I was done.  I don't understand why the director is using this material, and I don´t think it was worth watching. I thought this was a good movie, but it was just boring, and the acting was awful, and bad. I am sure if I could have been bored to death, it would have made me sick. I would recommend it for no one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Man Called Bird" seems to be somewhat less a film than its predecessor. Still, there's a lot of funny lines, but it could have been more serious. I was just not enthusiastic to see it. There are, however, a few interesting moments. One was the fact that I couldn't understand the plot. This was so hard to comprehend. What was the reason? The script was a mess. The acting was OK, but nothing was funny. It was a shame because there were three different characters with the same, seemingly-same, name, who each seemed to have different backgrounds. The story wasn't very original or funny, and there were also several jokes that were totally unpainable.  There's a funny scene where they all decide to take each other's job, even their own, for a while. If you don't read the book, or watch it, then you will get spoiled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping the movie was going to be much better than I imagined. Unfortunately, I guess that's not true. It is really the worst film I've ever seen. What was supposed to be a fun film turned into a piece of junk. I mean the whole idea was cute and a funny scene was totally ruined in its execution.  I just think about the director and the cast of the film. That's what I think. I just wish they'd all just kill off those guys. It seems like there was a really great chance to make the whole movie look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to warn you people that this movie is very bad and the only way it can get any good points is to make sure you don't take this seriously. I understand this but it's not worth my money. I found this movie as a very poor film to watch and I'm not going to watch it anymore. I will not even rent it again and instead I'll see it again with all of your kids.  There is no redeeming quality in this movie. The movie itself was interesting enough but not so when it comes to the actual sex scene that it's just awful. The acting is awful too. And the female characters are all completely bad with the way that the director treats them. The characters are not good either. And I can tell that there is no way that you'd even expect them to be acting all along.  So don't bother with this movie unless you're a fan of the book and want to get into the book for yourself. You'll only get the worst end of a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It is about people who want to be superheroes. But not people who would be able to make themselves into a real life, or if they were really superheroes. And then there's a little girl, and that's about all there is. And there's no real connection between the two. So this movie could be a little better but this movie is so bad that I would not recommend it to anyone.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, even for a few bucks, because I don't care about anything else. There are some good scenes, but it is just really bad. It does not help me, but I think that this movie was just a waste of money. I didn't have to like this movie, but you can get it for an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have only watched this film and i found it to be a very dull and disappointing. Its an anti-war film and there's nothing funny in it. Its so sad that the makers of this film decided to make it as a film and I found that it was simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no real surprises to be had here. There is absolutely no tension, no real suspense, no suspense, and absolutely no idea of a plot. Even as a film whose name was in the title, "A Song About the Way Home", it still remains extremely dry and uninteresting. It's hard to believe it was in any way interesting. No real emotion, no idea about the characters, no character development, no direction or direction, nothing in terms of suspense. What's interesting? It is the people who are trying to make it interesting. And the way they are trying is completely bizarre, very unnoticeable and utterly forgettable. The whole film is so bad that it has to be an inoffensive film to be taken seriously, which it is. The story and plot are completely pathetic and predictable. That's really what the film does. The way that the film tries to make the film interesting is to have some sort of drama going on with a bunch of people and making up the film's story with a dramatic twist. It is not even a movie, but a sitcom with a horrible plot and a really stupid way to go. It needs to be a comedy movie! It's not even funny!   I can't say much about the plot. A very short, un-implemented plot that could have been made into a "comedic drama" by a really smart scriptwriter.  A comedy film without any dramatic plot and very little suspense or suspense, this is a bad film. Don't waste your time wasting. Stick it in some other film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    How could a movie make this terrible? The movie starts with a really stupid premise: an alien ship lands on an alien planet, and nobody else on the planet thinks anything. Then the crew goes to the island of aliens called "the Lost Island". What happens then?   Well... it's just "a movie", apparently. And what happens? That's the best part of the movie.  The aliens are supposed to be on the ship, and they are supposed "in reality" but that's not how it's done. This is the movie's main theme, "the lack of knowledge".  The plot is about a group of guys on the island, who get to know about aliens they found on the other side of the planet. They are then sent to another planet, the "Indochri", which seems to be like a real space. But the movie ends with everyone dying, and the whole alien race on this alien space spaceship gets killed.  Okay, but it is still really stupid. And the movie makes no effort at all at any of the parts it tries. The only thing about the movie that is good is the story and the setting, but that is far from the point where you can actually recognize the movie as a movie. It is also absolutely terrible for it's "plot" too. There is no plot, the characters are pretty bland, and there is a lot of pointless stuff thrown in, like a really bad alien movie parody movie. There's a lot more going on with a movie like this one. It's supposed to have a big plot, but there are no plot to keep track.  But the actors do have good personalities, and some good ideas, and at the same time, the movie just falls apart. It has no real ending or plot or theme. I'm not sure how they would change the movie to have good things about it, but at least it's not terrible.   Some of the bad parts of the story are funny, and others aren't funny at all.  There is a very stupid part where the characters and the movie take a break from eating and get drunk.  It starts and goes like a "real life" movie about people having nothing in life, and going to the beach. And it ends with one character who thinks about how it was so bad they had to fight to get off. The movie doesn't have any good plot or humor.  A very bad movie, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An awful, stupid, derivative and extremely stupid film - even if the director was a "great" he was still a bad sequel. I have no idea what happened to the writers and producers who have been hired for this film. What the hell is the purpose of this movie?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A "self-help" film is about a guy who has been involved in something very bad. Unfortunately, I had some luck with this movie. I was thinking of a movie that actually actually had a plot (something). I was hoping that the characters were good, but unfortunately, the film just ruined it for me. There were too many holes to the character that I couldn't get into and the acting was poor. There was no emotion shown at all, just a cold, unfilled, and boring dialogue. There really wasn't much interest for the characters either. The cinematography was just OK, but there was nothing in it.  I really feel the blame of this film here. There are many people who are willing to watch this movie just to look at the characters and say, "She's a pretty chick," and see if you can appreciate them.  There are also people who aren't well acquainted with the characters. It is hard to watch. The characters are annoying, even if you think it's funny. There is no emotion in it and there is nothing real about the film.  For my friend, there are many good things to be found in movies like this. But this just ruins any enjoyment and destroys the credibility of watching movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director has a bizarre habit of taking one interesting idea or idea and doing something totally stupid and totally disconnected from everything else. He's basically an opportunist, for a whole year, and he knows his friends' secret, which is probably his life.  The movie is full of clichés from the original "Babes" movies: "I wonder whether the film is actually a film about being gay," is the idea that's most bizarre. The other question is whether this movie is directed by some poor hack who has a very hard time with anyone, even with his friend.  This movie is really bad. It's too stupid to be any more than a bad action movie. But it does have its moments. And it is kind of amusing. The only reason to recommend this movie to anyone who's bored by other films. There's really only a handful of decent scenes (I'm a big fan of "Babs" and "The Beach"), but these scenes are never interesting. And don't forget, "Babbling", this movie was made by two people who had never done either one of these two movies, and who couldn't be much further away from this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad, and I really despise that people would try to compare it to another film. It's just horrible! The story is a piece of rubbish, the characters are annoying, and the ending is just a plot, that is about the first film. Don't listen to it. There are not any good songs, and there are no good dialogs. It starts out at the wrong time and becomes predictable by the end. I don't know why the director wants to make a sequel for a film where it would be like 'Candy,' because even in 'Culture Channel' it was bad. 'Cult' isn't like this...it's an insult to the entire genre. It just seems as though the producers want to cash out 'Cultural' for a cheap sequel; and I would like to see the makers of 'Crazy Eddie,' to see him. Don's 'Coco.' is not one of a 'Credible' film and doesn't have the same appeal as it has in 'Razz' or 'Cumberville,' which is one of the top 10 comedies in the industry. The only redeeming thing about 'Coc' is that the characters in 'I'm Gonna.' are actually really good actors. In the end, they're just ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm a sucker and a huge fan of this show, and so, it's not like I've ever seen anything bad (even the ones I did see like the first show.) I can think of several great movies that have managed to do what this show did. I was just a little tired after one of the first scenes. (Just let me tell you to not watch it, but it has several great lines that I liked in the show, like the ones at the end of the last episode.) I didn't really enjoy the last scene.  The story is pretty lame, but I did appreciate the fact that there were more interesting characters (including a little bit of a plot) and that they were all fairly well written. But the worst part is that the actors did nothing well. The actors weren't good, but there were no real personalities and I'm not about them.  I also wish that they had gone in the real way and gotten out the way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not the worst that I have ever seen in my life. It could have been more enjoyable, and it was pretty shallow and predictable. It wasn't that bad, but it felt as though it was the one way the fans should have been watching to enjoy. It was a very slow movie and the plot was so disappointing that I was unable to see the ending. I was expecting something more entertaining, and my friends were disappointed. So that's not all of the bad things I can say about this movie, but the main reason I was not able to enjoy it was because my family members and I all enjoyed it so much more than the ending was. I wish I could have seen more of an effort made to make a movie that had some humor, and some real fun, and had some real action. I really don't want to waste anymore time on this, but instead I just feel as though I'm getting tired from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a movie was to follow-and I'm sure it was to watch - I would just not even mention this one. The director was a complete jerk, and it appeared as though his script, which is the weakest link in the film. I would not watch this movie unless I were feeling really depressed. I cannot even see the ending, which would have been very interesting. I was expecting to get a big part in some sort of film. But even the end is so unbelievable that I didn't recognize it - what is the point of it all? No, I would never watch a film if this had a movie with no one actually paying attention to me! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film does not stand for being taken seriously. I know. I've seen the original, but if you haven't been to see it, don't bother. It's absolutely pathetic. There is no plot, the cast looks ridiculous, the editing is bad, and the acting is downright bad. The acting isn't even up to standards. The actors are good, if they are not playing their characters so well, it should be expected.  But the plot is bad enough that it doesn't matter how well it is structured. All the characters are flat, with no real purpose, and not all the characters have the guts to be the heroes.  There is a lot of bad editing that comes out with every film. It really ruins the film. I give this film a bad review as I thought the movie was so poor that it could be used to waste time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that it was about a bunch of silly movie stars having to save the day of their lives to complete their plot, but this is not the only bad movie. The plot was stupid, and the acting was bad. All the characters were stupid, all the plot lines were annoying, and I am very skeptical of this film. It is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I think it is about the worst comedy in my life. It's a shame that they decided to make a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has one of the worst scenes ever. In the end, the camera keeps panning to find that the camera is on top of the screen. This is obviously not a movie. The soundtrack is OK, but that is not in the end either. Also, the acting was poor, and the acting isn't even good. This film was absolutely pointless. I'm not sure if I can write this in a positive review about it, but I'd like to point out that this movie is the very least worth a dollar. The fact that the ending isn't funny enough is also a big problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie i have ever seen. I've only watched one movie in my life so far and it's terrible. I don't know what people could possibly say about this. What I write below is merely a response to a horrible movie. The story is so bad and the acting is so poor and the direction is so awful it just leaves you wanting to see the story. The worst I have ever watched is a film I saw, I never thought I could possibly watch it but I watched it anyways. There was some good stuff in this movie but it was so bad. A guy who tried to be a hero? He's just so annoying and so stupid. I couldn't believe he's so good. It was a terrible movie. I have never watched this movie. Avoid it if you have time for it, I'll give it two stars, that is for its awfulness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the script and the direction was good, the acting was poor and the actors were awful. The ending had a bleak tone and I couldn't get into the movie with a negative outlook. There wasn't anything funny or entertaining about the plot, even the characters were the same as before. This was an awful movie. The best comedy of this movie was the second one of the other movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot agree with the reviews that this movie is bad. The whole plot seems to have come from an author's bad imagination. I believe that this is an adaptation of a very bad movie. I think that the movie has been ruined because of the lack of a good story. There's not enough story to be found in the movie. It is a lot of money and not enough time to make it. This movie is full of bad ideas. A lot of it is pointless. I do not understand why they are putting this movie out. It's not just a sequel but it's a sequel that is not a sequel. The plot is very bad and the actors are very bad. If you get an idea of how bad it is, try the movie instead of watching it. Then, get the hell out of this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really sad to see this film as I was so disappointed that I could not see it. It was very disappointing and I could only get into my car and get to the airport and rent it out. If you are not able to see the original, one of the original films from MGM and other studios I can't imagine why it is being distributed in the UK. I mean it is about 8 years old and you will have to watch the movies when the show runs in the theatre. I can see why the original movies are so great and yet I have to see them in a foreign country, and I cannot see them anywhere else. I find that it is simply terrible. It is supposed to be a story about a man in a town who lives in the middle of a small town. He is in trouble because a local woman refuses to marry him and he has to work his life saving the town. But there is another woman who is in a similar situation and has to use a secret man called "The Lord" to get involved in the same situation. He becomes obsessed and she thinks he is being controlled by her. This story is a complete waste of time and the script is so awful that you just have to wonder if you even watched it. I suppose it is no coincidence that the lead character, the one who is trying to change the "hell" of the main character, also has this problem. It must have been something that was really happening in this town because the original story line was about a town where it became all about the woman and the town that she lived in. This is about a bunch of people who are in town that are in a very big town, that there is a very large area of interest in the town and are so poor in living they cannot even go outside. But what was the point? I can only guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just an after-life sequel to a bad remake of the original. I don't like those two movies in a row. There is not one clear idea, but it's pretty much a mix-and-match series. That's probably a good thing, because there are at least two movies you could have in the same world. That said, there are so many scenes that you can't take them all in.  The script is full of clichques. The story has nothing new in it, and there is not enough room for one to be interesting. There are many characters who either die, die, or are good with a few others, and no story in it. A decent sequel for a sequel: not an interesting one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I was reviewing my film, I was surprised to find this movie as I was not expecting it to be a very interesting film. It is so bad that I was very disappointed that this film was so disappointing. Even the director was able to make it look appealing with some nice and well-crafted visual effects, but there were several terrible parts that just ruined the film. I was really expecting that this movie would be a really good film, but unfortunately it was so bad. I do feel sorry for those involved in this movie, because they were able to get all the right elements and didn't let the film go straight to waste. The end-of-the-film was pretty depressing, and the only thing that made me watch it was the fact that it had the original title. Unfortunately, it was just one of the "big" things in this film that had some interesting effects, like the ending was so sad and the end itself was so horrible.  I know that the movie does have some interesting visual elements and some interesting actors, but in my opinion, this is a bad film that simply cannot stand behind any other film in my view. If you have some spare time and are bored, watch this film and don't waste it. This film will make you feel like an idiot, and probably more stupid than the original "American" version of "The Fugitive". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really a sad waste of time. It is so bad that it is probably a comedy at best but a terribly bad movie. The plot is horrible, the acting is bad, the editing is terrible, the direction is terrible. I had to be sick seeing these actors in the flesh and with their eyes on fire. It just seems like a dorky sitcom for someone who isn't used to watching TV. It may be better in a well-written film but it should be better.  What the hell was that about? The plot could have been good. At least the parts were amusing. And the ending could have had some of the comedy of the film's past. But I thought the ending would have been better. Also, the ending is so stupid that it made me tear up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, what do you do when it's your first time watching it? Do you sit patiently waiting for the next two minutes? Do not. If that is a choice for me, I would say "well, why don't they leave us a movie so it can be enjoyed by the other people, or at least you can enjoy it as an experience? It's just a waste of time, there isn't even a single decent plot line, there is no real plan. Even in the beginning it was obvious it was just pointless, and I didn't like it, and most of it didn't make much sense. But it's OK because it is so bad. And even if you liked the previous three films, please don't watch this movie. I'd be surprised if you actually did enjoy this movie and thought it was good, it's like any bad movie ever made. I don't have words for how bad it is.   The plot isn't very good for a horror film (it's not even a horror movie) but at least it's not a very good horror film to watch. I understand that it's a comedy, but a comedy is not a horror and I don`t believe it's appropriate for such a film to be shown in a horror setting, even if it is for a kids. I've never seen this film and I'd not recommend it to a kid, but if they are scared by it, they can probably watch it and enjoy it. If they are serious about seeing it, I wouldn`t recommend it for a couple of reasons.  The script is fairly bland and predictable. There are no suspense and suspense and even a few moments were slightly suspense-filled. The characters are boring, and even the story doesn't really matter. I would never recommend this movie to anyone who actually wants to watch it because it has nothing to do with the whole concept. The director tried to create a decent horror movie, but I just couldn`t find anything about it. The soundtrack is really bad, even though it has some good tunes. I think it was supposed to be some sort of a horror soundtrack, but the soundtrack really isn't enough to create something out there. It could have been easily done a hundred times worse. There is no story. The story is pretty boring and the ending is the least suspenseful of the three movies I`m really seeing.  This movie is way too much of nothing and it really
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen, it's truly a complete bore-down! It's terrible!  The story itself is so thin and stupid, the dialogs are awful and the ending is poor. In the end I felt cheated, the direction is terrible and the acting is terrible, what the hell is that? I hope I didn't watch it and didn't.  I don't think I can really explain how bad it is, I have to listen to a couple of lines to help me understand what it was about. But it's so bad I couldn't possibly finish it. I must have seen one or two of the other parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I was a teenager. I did not know how terrible this movie was. But after watching it, I was really scared. I wasn't sure what was going on. I kept thinking that if I was going to be a good actor, this movie would be a great addition to my resume. I was never a fan of this movie but I knew I'd be good if I tried to see it again. Alas, it's very disappointing, and I was not pleased with my portrayal of the actor.  The acting was pretty pathetic, and not even funny, although a few of the acting is good. A few of my lines that were interesting are used in this movie are not included in the movie. I don't have an idea how anyone could take this movie seriously, but it was the only movie I've ever watched that I really liked. If you are looking for an adult drama, avoid the film. Avoid this movie, and find some funny movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may be surprised to discover this movie was released in 1985 (when I first read the script) and was this film was in fact quite a sequel to the original, which was released almost 15 years ago (not even 15 years old!) and this film is a remake of the same plot. It has been advertised by some as a sequel, but really it is just an old carwash over the old story, and no story, at all, left behind it, it has just the same old character, old special effects, and even some of the clothes are worn out in a time of convenience. What's the point?   There are probably three different characters, the first one is a very old friend, the second one is another, and the third is the film's lead. This is a movie not designed to make any new story or story from it. It's just a simple car wash-into-as-life, there are just so many of them that it's impossible to catch it in a minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a really terrible quality, it really should be a comedy/comedy and I don't think anyone who wanted to see this movie with any expectations that it could be good. I'd really prefer it to be a horror movie, or even a zombie movie and not like this stupid garbage. I would rather like to see something more in the direction of horror movies. But, it just won't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a slow introduction to what makes the movie even more unpignessiable. This scene follows of a time line from the first scene. This means the movie never actually starts with the film playing.  After the first part, the film opens with the new lead. When the story gets underway, you are in one of three scenes. You are in the middle of one of the movie, and you are supposed to think the movie will continue with the same actors. The plot is very predictable, and there's no suspense.  There's absolutely no suspense! The movie has the potential to be good, but there's simply no suspense, and no interest! This movie is terrible.  The worst of the movies of all time!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a huge amount of money, and it's one of the worst things I have ever seen in this genre.  There are so many, many absurd scenes, and horrible jokes (all made from a script) that I can barely make sense of the movie. It should NEVER have made any effort to make a good movie, but this movie was pretty fun to watch. Unfortunately, it's not one of my favourites in the whole year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a few plot points in the film, but the rest just keep repeating the same line of dialogue, usually mentioning a certain actor. I didn't care for the ending, but it's really the weakest in any of the films I've seen. The ending just repeats the last sentence of the film...and the dialog. And there's just no real reason why there's not a plot. It really comes of making up new story lines every time you need to remind yourself of the plot. As for the acting, the actors really didn't deliver. I can't say it was good, the acting wasn't that good. And the ending is simply bad. The movie is supposed to be about a "mature teen's" film, it's just not. It also seems to be a film that will never be made. It's not just about teenagers. It should be an adult film. I'd rather watch a real film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well this is the third movie I've seen in the past few weeks and I'm afraid to say there is only one good movie in this world.  The premise is bad, there's little to no funny moments, and there's not one funny scene. This film was so bad that it did not even count as an insult.  A sad film, and don't say I'm sorry for it. It's awful and should never get the attention it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i saw this movie for my Christmas night viewing and only lasted a few minutes. I had to watch it again and just laugh at the idea that it was so bad. If I saw this one for my 8th birthday and didn't want to see it again, I would never want to watch a movie again.  I think this is an example of how a movie can never be funny and still be scary. They just don't get any real fun. I've seen more than a dozen of their films so far and they always fall apart. Some films just aren't funny and have too much of a plot.  The first problem with the movie was that it wasn't funny. I just didn't laugh enough.  But the second problem was the fact that it didn't have a single decent ending. In fact, it didn?t even have a proper ending.   But what makes this movie so bad is the fact the director got the credit for making the film. The other problem with this movie is it's supposed theme. It was supposed to be a satire, and it was. it was never a satire and has no real ending. the movie ended when the character finally saw how it was supposed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story is pretty stupid. This film contains so little original work that I can't even figure out what is supposed to be happening in the film. The plot goes on. The people involved in this film are so bad that they are nearly impossible to believe. I would like to take a few minutes out of my time to look for a better film, but there really is not. I hope the next film will be better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An unsympathetic script, poor script, bad acting, and a whole bunch of jokes.  There were some good parts, but the acting was poor and the comedy was awful. The movie is not funny nor funny.  I would have been more impressed if the directors actually tried. I'm not sure they are.   The characters were poor, the characters weren't interesting, and there was nothing to enjoy.  The movie was full of holes from start to finish.  Overall, I did not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was never made for me. I really wanted it to be a film about a "superman" vs. a superwoman with super powers. I got some good footage, but most of it has been taken away from me in order to keep the story running. The acting is also so bad it doesn't seem like any real person. I also really liked the idea of a super woman who was in the world to lead the world. I think it would have been a better film if they just used it to run around in a small town, where he and his friends would be able to act as other supermen, with an ordinary, human face on their backs. The director also doesn't have the talent for a film like that, either. And the soundtrack is bad. It's pretty poor too. The only good thing in the story was the end of a story line and the ending of the movie. Unfortunately, I didn't get the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the worst film I have ever seen, as in the first few weeks I saw it in my local film club. I mean it's just so bad. I'd like to see a better version than the one I saw. This movie had some excellent sound. But the voice in the film is so bad, that the sound doesn't seem to matter. In the next few weeks, I really wanted to see something better, but this movie was bad on both parts. I hope I didn't have to see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is so bad, it's so bad it is a perfect word to describe it. The acting in this movie is so lacking in character and it makes the movie a complete waste of time. I have never seen a movie that was so bad in my life. The director tried to be funny, but I'm not having fun or even seeing the acting. The ending is so lame! If you want a film that involves a lot of violence, violence that would really be funny for the movie's fans, go ahead and have a little fun! But if you're looking for a comedy, a one that would have good comedy or a comedy that has a good story and doesn't have a storyline, don't go watch this movie. This movie would be good if it wasn't the same kind of film that makes it look like a comedy. This is the kind of movie that just tries to be taken as a comedy of sorts. If you're a serious film snorer, watch this film in a single room with your friends because you'll be the laughingstock. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that most of the movie has a plot that has nothing to do with the film, it's just a joke.  A lot of the time has to be spent on the fact that the character is so obviously stupid. And the script is so predictable, it really needs a script. This is not a comedy, it is a gross, meaningless, and stupid movie. It just needs a good script. That's not a true comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, I had very bad opinions about it, but I have watched it more than two times. I didn't know what to say. It seems like a lot of movies of the era (so bad, that you can't even really tell what the movies are) have made a bad impression of the old days, and this one is an example of that.  It's absolutely terrible.  One of the great films of the 1980s, and that is a fact, and there is no proof that it has been made. But it has not been made, so we should just watch it and realize how bad it was. A couple of other great movies are also bad, but for a reason.  Some of the main characters have been replaced, but not a lot.  But this is the biggest mistake I've ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the only good movie that was made about this movie was this one, because it had some good acting in it. But this movie just fell flat. I really was very bored with the story. The main story is about a family that has an ill son and his daughter who died.  The rest of the movie is about the wife of the husband. There is a little bit of the plot line in the beginning of the story about how she dies in front of the doctor and the doctor then uses his daughter to look at the child and tell the wife what to do. There are not enough of anything to do in the film. The film is so bad that it leaves little to the viewer to watch.  Overall I had a little pity that it was so bad. The movie was interesting, and it was kinda funny. But overall the movie needs to go down to the ground to get some serious action. The acting was not all that good and the storyline was not interesting. If you are looking for a movie, but really for a bad sequel, try something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this film. I got into it in the first few minutes. I was really curious to see why the guy went to an hour, 15 minutes of pure torture porn, only to be let out by the good guy. He was obviously trying to create a cinematic sensation and he did. There is nothing else for this movie to go through, and the worst thing of it is that the actors are trying to make it funny, which makes them look dumb, stupid, even though you can get bored, and this film is full of stupid and stupid dialog and stupid scenes, and there's even a stupid fight between two guys. I can't believe how people get into this garbage. I guess it's just not in your hands to have. It is very depressing, and I can never sleep with this film, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm still stuck in this movie for a few hours after sitting through "Dumbo" with my whole family sitting on the couch. It's about the first 5 minutes I had any idea what had happened. The ending is boring, and I'm afraid to even return to my room. It feels like an attempt to be "serious" about the movie. If they wanted to be funny, they should have made a sequel to "Kung the Conqueror". Then I would have to have a DVD of the movie, and go through all the episodes one at a time. This movie is just about a 1.0. The dialog is awful, and the camera is bad, and there's no good reason for this movie to exist. I'd recommend "Dumbo" for its funny, but I don't think you will enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An in-depth review about this movie: - If you don't really get into this thing, go here -   This movie is the worst film I've seen since Cateana was in my grade at the school. It's supposed to be an action film for all time, but if you get into it, you'll probably find yourself watching this movie from the top of the box. I had to sit for a long time to get into the story of this movie. Even though I had been hoping to see this film, I was just bored by it, and this film was very hard to watch. There are so many holes in this film that I really wanted to clear up after the movie. The storyline is so bad that it is impossible to understand the events. It is also painfully confusing and very confusing. I would never get it into a movie that is so easily understood. You should feel embarrassed if you watch this movie, and you should think about the consequences of this film. It would have been an even worse film to watch than this one:  It has a strong atmosphere, but it has also a very bad script and it gets you bored. It was really sad.  There were no surprises in the story, and even the ending had a horrible ending.   A really bad movie if you want to waste time, don't watch this, and beware of the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has an really bad acting by John Henson and Jessica Alia. This movie is so bad that I almost wish they would stop making it. I was the one who told them the whole plot and, more importantly, I know how I would have interpreted the plot. They were so bad at acting that they gave us a couple of really funny jokes. Even if they were the best actors of their time, they made the movie worse than most of the MASHI films. They just couldn't seem to catch a single scene without a break in. And, as far as you can tell, they were really stupid, even when it comes to their own. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I would rate it as one bad and not even worth one stars. I'm sorry, I have to write out my feelings about it, but it doesn't seem like a good movie. And it doesn\'t work. It never worked to a movie. It has got to be a horror film and I think it would be better if I could convince the other networks to show it again. This doesn't work so well, I don't think, either. If you want a comedy about a thriller, you may be surprised at what the movies get so good at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed when I saw this. I was so excited when I watched this movie that I was ready to rent it, that I expected it to be so boring and stupid. I expected a great film, but alas, it was not that good. The storyline is extremely predictable, stupid, and completely unsymmatic, and the characters are absolutely awful. This movie was a big disappointment. I give this movie a low rating, if you like a dumb, ridiculous film, that will make you lose sleep with each passing week, then go see this movie. I gave it an 8 and for the record I gave a 1. I mean, it's really annoying, but a great movie does not always go in half-a-half-hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think there's one person who thought that this was an "movie", who thought this movie was the "best movie", and who thought it was a "great film". I think they just wanted to see something with no plot. There's only one "story", so it can't really be understood.  I've watched this movie for years, and it's one movie that has nothing to recommend or with anything to recommend. The story is the worst one I've seen in years, the acting is very bad, the ending is unbelievable, and the acting seems so out of "standard" that you don't even recognize it's really a movie.  There are a lot of stupid things. "Frosting" is a pretty bad example of this. I really prefer the movie's "Kung Fu" from "Bloodsucking the Monkey" because of its "real-world" scenes.  The acting is pretty good and good, but there are a couple of very stupid things and there are an awful lot of jokes that don't work. There is an entire episode where the director shows a fake firefight on a set and is forced to jump off the stage (as one scene ends in "blood" appearing and the rest of the scene is just the two of the actors). The acting works a little but not in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this movie in years so I can't comment on it as well as others, but the general story was very predictable. The "girp" was a weak, lame attempt at a "plot". I can agree with others that it was not well acted, but I don't agree that the acting was good.  Also, I found the "characters" pretty stupid, I think the girl was in an orgy to a great degree. I can tell that the only "distant" people are her family who is the best actors to she has seen in a movie. She is supposed to be the daughter but she plays one character, and in the end she is bored with her family. The best thing is to see her friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what was wrong. I think it might have been more like a movie that came out when the Japanese TV industry was still making some of that kind of stuff. I have seen it on channel 9 and it wasn't well written, the dialogue was weak and the whole thing could be easily missed. In short, I give this movie a zero rating. It is only a mild, but it doesn't even merit two stars for this type of a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was very bad and it's just an absolute rubbish! This is no way to be good. It contains so many of the worst things in the world in order to be funny. The worst thing about the film was the fact that all the stars were in one image - or in the image and video. The idea of this film is laughable and very stupid. If I could compare this film to other films I would be very surprised. I am sure that I never will watch a film so poor in creativity and/or stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made about ten years ago, the very one was the most disappointing movie I ever saw. I had seen this movie twice, and I was really sad because it was terrible. I wanted to see it again, but it wasn't about the acting, and it really sucked me in. I just found it depressing and awful. I felt so frustrated that I didn't really understand the message that the movie was about. I couldn't find anything else that made me think the movie is funny and funny. It's just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this movie has taken on the name "Rango" without the original story. There is a huge elephant in the room. That is the elephant (that's how he plays) that can't leave the room when the family is in the next scene. He is never in the scene with a gun. So, how would that work? What would he do? Why wouldn't he run across the board? How would he use this "magic" to drive from the top of the building? How could he be able to keep using it until it is in a position to shoot? Why, if he used that gun, he would have had to use a different hand. When he's in the top room, he is using another hand for the job. What could that be done? What were he doing? That's no way he could do that, but there's still enough to ask the question. What is his motivation? What is it that would have allowed him to keep coming in front of an elephant? If I had been involved in some sort of accident with the elephant, how, in order to avoid the accident, he has used the gun? How are you making your point clear? Could have his motive been to keep the family in an uncomfortable position by letting him use a gun? That could be the worst movie of all time! And I am so upset that we're being asked to have faith in him and not to watch. The movie is one big piece of trash. The acting is awful, and the acting has the usual bad quality that is usually found in a horror film. The actors are not convincing, the acting is bad, and there is no tension. Don't watch it, unless you want to see what's in it for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, this film has a long and convoluted plot line. In it, a group of teenagers who have no idea what they are going to do. They're in a new city. Some of them will break a lot of hearts. Some people will love, others will hate, and some people will be happy. If they ever are attacked by a man they care about, they will be killed, and the entire family will suffer as they're humiliated. Of course, there's more than one plot in this film, and there's nothing else that's much as interesting, not in the least interesting. This film is badly done, there are no laughs, no heartwarming stories, and no action scenes. If you don't care about them, you'd just be sad. But there is one thing you can do with this film if you just want to see something with some laughs, but you don of course have to do something that isn't a comedy. If there is something else to say, watch the film, if you hate them, this isn't funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have seen since my kid's dream of watching Star Wars. It is not only bad, but so bad it is so bad I cannot even sit through it. I was a kid once, and since I was young, this film is just plain sad.  But if you really enjoy this film, then there is no question. Watch it with the sound of every word coming out of every single mouth. It wasn't even quite close, but even when it was at its absolute worst, I was still able to look back at the acting in every scene. I just didn't feel like watching this film.   The first scene doesn't even count as a scene. This is an awful, pointless, and totally pointless film. The only thing I can compare it to is the very worst movie ever made, with The Matrix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I did not mean to think about my childhood. But to me it seems like a film that made me tear up for it. I would not recommend it to anyone outside of the family I live with because it's bad and not even funny. It is just awful.  I can't recommend this to anyone. I was hoping to watch it for a long time and give it time. But unfortunately it didn't happen and I only liked the first few episodes. This is not good at all. It should not be on any high-budget movie for children. It looks bad as if it was just a children's movie. I wish it never to be a movie. It was absolutely horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've always been a fan of that series, but I find this movie to be a poor effort. The first 2 scenes were a complete waste of the time. I've also noticed that the "Bever" guy is voiced by George Sohl and, as the people who want to end this show, I really liked the movie. I have to say, he should be put in another movie before he's done his job.  I also dislike the song that plays off of the main theme of the movie, I usually don't like the songs on this show. I was also surprised that the movie is only 6 episodes long. But my biggest disappointment was that the guy who tried to make the show seem interesting could not see it all through.  In this episode, the title is "Carry On Downstairs", which tells you that the bad guy is in the "Downstairs". This is the main bad guy. His wife and son are in the room and you don't know where he is. He is in a wheelchair, not his wheelchair. The next scene is where you get a glimpse of the good guy. He says he's in the Downstairs and you never notice it. The last scene is the family is in their bed.  There is a scene that is supposed to have been a comedic sequence, but when you look at the scene of the bad dude getting into a table and trying to fight with a bunch of people, you'll probably think it was a comedic scene.  The main point of the episode is that there are people who have agreed on this very small thing to have sex with the bad person in the scene. You can pretty much guess that the wife is going to be pregnant. However, the scene in the next scene after the bad guys in the bedroom is when the wife and his wife actually get in the bathroom and get the bathtub and start doing dirty things with the guy.  Also, the whole family is getting ready to get into the next action, and when the bad man and the big bad are getting ready, you know that there is an impromptu scene where one of them is going about getting the bath tub.  Once you get it in, you can guess what it is about, because all the characters get ready to meet each other and then, when they all get into a room together, everyone just looks at them and thinks nothing about it.  How does the family get ready for the scene, since the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the review for this movie in the comments from the the good review. I found that this movie had not one good idea. It was supposed to be a sequel to the original. But unfortunately it wasn't. The ending of the film is so lame that I'm surprised that the director even bothered to finish this one. I had to sit on the edge of the sofa and choke so hard because my head was so full of gas. I don't think anyone would want to watch this crap. I'm glad I was able to see it because I've never liked this movie and I hope that it doesn't ruin my life. It's just so bad, it really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on HBO when I was on vacation. I thought it was very bad, because I like movies that are so interesting. But this movie just sucked the whole movie. In fact, it's not even funny. If you are looking for a bad film to see, you might be interested in this movie, but don't! I'd like to get a second look at it, because it's so stupid and it has a horrible time-scale. And the movie has a lot of stupid jokes. Even though it is OK to watch, I still didn't like it. I just didn't want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was the point?  This film was just plain bad. It had nothing decent, it had nothing good, it was bad. The fact that the director (Tina Stewart) was involved is an insult. This film would not make the best movies. I would have a man shot and then thrown into the garbage that would come out of the garbage box in the middle of the night. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion of this movie was as follows:  It is so bad I had to sit there for 5 hours. When I finished watching the DVD, I was stunned. In the end, I couldn't even make sense of it. I guess that it was an American remake of "Madina Lotte." I guess it would be like this. But the "madonna Lotte" is still way too old. I also felt like it was so predictable. I don't think I'd care for a sequel for this movie. The whole acting is so awful, too! I guess this movie isn't that bad, but I don.t really care about acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there was no bad movie, I would have made my own. I had been waiting for this one for years, and was sick and bored by it. In a way, it's funny, but in a way that's a shame. I'd rather go down to a movie like this, but just like me, it sucked me in as a reviewer.  I'm really annoyed by the way it was directed, what I felt was just a matter of personal preference. I have had nothing whatsoever to say about the actors or the direction, but that is the only thing I can say. I felt like I was getting cheated by the story, and the way they were portrayed. But I still think I can give one big, big kink for all of those actors.    I have to wonder, is this really meant to be a low-budget film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a critic of such a movie, I feel that its story is so bad it shouldn't be made. The movie is so terrible that I didn't really care about it. I wanted to see something else, and it wasn't what I had expected. It's all pointless and made-funny and there's no plot, character, or anything else that could redeem it.  The acting is not the worst I've ever seen. There was no real tension in the characters, and there were no characters that you actually care about, that are good. Some of the acting was okay but too weak to be a comedy, as well as one that actually makes me cry. The cinematography is just OK, nothing more, though the acting is good. It should not have been released in 1999.  I recommend not to see this movie, but if you do see it, maybe you'll find some better film. It might even be better. It just makes it seem more stupid and stupid than any of the "regular" movies of the 1990's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it needed 10 minutes to complete. I didn't even like it.  I'd have to see more good films. That's not to say that I would necessarily watch more great films.  The ending didn't end.  What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a film I watched, called "The Lost Highway", on HBO. I had to watch it just for 2 minutes. But then I saw the film in a DVD and was completely unprepared for it. When I returned to Los Angeles it was clear that there was a lot of interest in it. But I can tell by the film that it was terrible, and the director didn't even bother trying to improve it.  There are no real story or character development whatsoever. The script is not interesting. It is just an average bad film. There were a few bits of humor, but this was the most frustrating film I have ever seen.  If you want a movie to be a bad film, go watch "Reveral", the remake of "Voyland" in Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. It is not funny, nor funny, and not funny. I don't even know why it was made for Christmas. I had to watch it again and I was so depressed. It was bad. The acting was bad, and the jokes were weak. This is so bad. If you like "Carpon" then go to this movie and skip this movie. I cannot recommend any good movie to people who like this movie, or even if this movie was made by a good writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if I'm a positive person or an antinjury person.  What happens in this movie is a movie about a female character, who is supposed to be the biggest heroine from movies, like the original Spider Girl. The fact that it's about a male character is the worst.  I'm also afraid that the movie is about one of the dumbest movies made I've seen. The first one I ever watched was a movie called 'A Man' Cry' that was stupid as all kids used it. But it's the same kind of stupid as 'Sleeping Pig.' And 'A Bear Bear' Cry!' was stupid in a similar manner. And 'The Lion Woman,' was a similar kind of film but it wasn't as stupid or stupid as a film about a bear. The two movies I tried to watch while they were on are either one about a movie that was very, very funny or one that was extremely stupid. I'm not sure which movie I'd like to try to watch next. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointment! This movie isn't that bad, but it was one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a long time. The plot is fairly simple. The acting isn't as good as the other actors in the movie, but there are no scenes that have any substance to them. I was amazed that a movie made up only three or four actors who don't even have an average role. The direction is simply bad. The cinematography is really bad. There are scenes that don't make you want to go home to watch it again. The movie was bad from the very beginning. If I had to write the review about it, I would have laughed and told me that this movie was a bad piece of work, but as a film this really is awful, but if it's a real film I can't say that it was. The actors and actresses don't get anything out it was really made for money, but I can say with complete certainty that the directors didn't care about making money, and that's the reason why it has such a bad rating. The characters are just actors and that doesn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a good film because of it's a comedy, but unfortunately it was badly acted, which I felt was a mistake. There were many times I heard the words 'I want to kill my child.'.  Also, the'sister' scene was stupid. I think the casting was very poor and the story line was not funny. It was really annoying and depressing.  I could have had easily found a better film in this movie. However, I thought this movie was fun, even though I had to sit through 2 hours of it to listen to it. I couldn't get through 2 minutes to listen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a 1 so I was disappointed but I didn't think it was bad. I know many others just laughed at this movie which is bad in one sense.  This movie is so bad that if you are looking for a comedy watch it for only one movie - I'd say that's the only movie that would be worth renting for the whole night.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a movie based on a series of animated cartoons that has been turned into a movie that is supposed to be based on the cartoons that began with the original cartoon in the 1930s.  There are two cartoon characters in the first movie and they are meant to be in the plot.  I guess the reason people wanted to make this is so that people would have an idea how it would have been in the real world. It's really a bad remake of a terrible cartoon. What is that saying? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is one thing that can redeem this movie. That is "having a cool sister." That is not what it was. Not only did this poor movie make me feel like I was a loser, but it also ruined my ability to enjoy a movie. Not even a good movie is that bad. I know, you are thinking, "but the funny scene is so interesting that it should have been a good film," and you can never forgive me for having liked it. But it is not a good comedy. It is a bad, very bad, and very pretentious horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see this movie as a fun action film, but I'm afraid to say it's just that, and that really makes the whole thing a disappointment.  I have read all the negative reviews online on here. I mean, I hate to see it.   There is one good thing about this movie: some of the action sequences are actually quite beautiful and they seem to work better in a real-world setting, so that makes me think that they're in fact a true-world action movie. Unfortunately, there are no scenes in which I can understand the storyline (i.e. how it is structured), the music, and most of the dialog is too slow, and just awful and there is a couple of bad lines in the beginning.  If you want a real film that follows you closely and shows you the true story behind it, then don't see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an utter disaster! I am going to give the worst review about the movie.  I would have to say that I never watched this movie and I don't know why this movie exists! I just saw this movie because I was looking for "The Matrix" on Amazon. You know the Matrix is so awesome, right? I thought the movie was cute, but it was way too bad to be the best one.  There is no way I will ever waste my time watching it, and I was only thinking this movie was entertaining and I didn't want to see more movies that are better!  I only saw this one twice. I didn. I saw it and didn't even want to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film many times, and I've come to a realization that it isn't that terrible.  The story is boring and there are enough bits of action that are a bit better than I expected. The acting is bad, the acting is not interesting at all, and the dialog is flat and boring. But, what the hell, this movie was so stupid? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could easily be made for the first of the many of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time this movie is pretty funny, the movie starts to get all the gross things that were said before this film, like the scene where the boy is trying to kill everyone, but that gets so bad that it's scary. The acting is really terrible, the acting is terrible, and the acting in general is terrible. I don't like this movie, but I do have a copy of it somewhere and I'm hoping it doesn't get so bad. The only thing I wish for is to find a copy somewhere and put it in a hard place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was too predictable, the acting wasn't convincing, and the acting was not good. The director was in no way skilled at acting. That's not a negative for a bad flick. The only reason it was a low-budget movie was the fact that this was an after-school film. And that's enough reason to have some hope. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand it's supposed to be a comedy, but i think it's really bad. I think the actor should have been better. He had nothing funny to say about a gay movie. I've seen some bad movies before, but this one is too awful. The sex scenes were very uninteresting and the dialog was the worst, too. The ending was so weak that it seemed like it was just one step to make the movie not funny anymore. I found it all so sad that I would like to have some of these guys so that I could get out to watch them. They're so predictable, and they're so unsympathetic that it's obvious they want to be seen off. I guess I'm too scared to get out and see them again so I can see the "couch" or "swamp". What are they gonna do when they're really sad? I don't know, they're both good or bad, but it's pretty sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the worst movie I've seen in my life. I laughed, but don't even laugh. The acting is horrible. The plot is pretty weak, and the acting is terrible, too. The cinematography is bad and the direction of the movie is the least important thing in the whole movie. The ending is stupid, and I found myself laughing more than the whole thing. Don't miss the whole video after the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It's not funny. It is just a weak film with a poor premise and a poor acting. I know, it would have a decent plot, but it's really a bad piece of work. It was made by a director who had absolutely no clue how to make it. I think they just looked like they're trying to make movies. I am sure I will never enjoy this movie because it's so bad it's hard to listen. I really wish this movie was a short comedy or a gag reel, instead of a comedy or film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing good about this movie.  It is a complete bore. The premise was a waste of time and I didn't like it for the first few minutes. I do feel like this movie was designed to bring to light a new trend in horror movies, and I had hopes that it would be like a horror movie in the vein of Night Terrors or even a horror flick like Sinister or House of Black). I was a horror fan, but this movie did nothing for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be an insult to everyone that reads it. I really did like it, it looked good, but in a little over the top of a few good scenes I felt the movie dragged down the nerves and dropped in the middle. The fact that it doesn't really make sense doesn't matter, the film just flat out sucks. It really took the shape of a movie, the ending is predictable and boring and the ending could never be shown to anyone else. I'm not saying that there was anything interesting, I don't know how it was to anyone that didn't know the film already. However it was so bad, I had to watch it so that I could have fun with it. That was all I did.  The worst part of this movie was the music. I listened to all of them and laughed. I heard music that is very bad, very awful, but the music wasn't bad. My opinion of this film is that it's absolutely horrible and that it is very, very, really bad. I believe it's just awful, absolutely, the best horror movies I've seen are so much more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen. I do feel like I'm being cheated of my time. I want to know where I was. I don't understand why this movie was made but I donno believe it was made to be a comedy or even a musical. It would be nice to have an ending like an old French film:  the plot was so bad that I couldn't even finish my first read through on it. I'd have to end up doing something else... if you don't, you can just sit in a corner and watch this movie so your brains can really make sense of it.   but if you do like watching the movies, I advise you NOT DO ANYTHING. This movie is full of stupid stereotypes, cheap acting and bad jokes. If you like movies, make a little effort to find a good movie: this movie just doesn't count. It wasn't even funny to me but at the end of the film I just sort of stopped caring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In "Homer" I think the story is about the idea that the old hippo was dead, and now there is only one hippo (an old hippopotah) left.  This is supposed to be a film about a young hippo's love for another hippo, although the hippo is very dead and has no clue who he really is.  The plot begins with a hippo getting killed in a car accident, and the only way he can get his car back. Meanwhile, we have another hippopotamite in the car with a bunch of hippo fans, and a hippopoton comes to town to try to sell a car. The hippo and the hippot are both in town, and they get into a car fight.  After the hippopotamus kills the hippox in the accident, the hippon (a hippo!) get to work selling a car to another hippon.  When a hippon gets killed, the car's owner (Mr. Smith) comes to work and begins to have fun with the hippoan's fans. The rest of the movie is just a bunch scenes that relate to the movie itself. The plot ends up by getting stuck in a bunch more hippo vehicles.  While the hippos drive all of the hippolos in and all of them die, it does not come to a happy end as they are so stuck. Some scenes are very bad, with terrible scenes of hippos getting stuck into cars with no room for them to put out. The ending sequence is pretty unbelievable. It is sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad, that I'm very suspicious of it. I'm not sure about why the director is so obsessed with this film; it's probably because he really is obsessed with the original, which are both bad and dangerous. I think they might have had good intentions in trying to make a movie better than the original movie, but that seems like the kind of self-destructive tendencies that seem to be the dominant forces of the current horror movement. I have seen numerous comments that this is the best horror film since the Scream franchise came out and it is true that it is. Unfortunately, I would just say, 'Yes, you're right, but what was it exactly, in terms of horror, that you would consider? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've wasted time watching this show. It looks so bad to me that the first couple of minutes had me thinking it was worth watching. After the first minute it's not worth watching at all. There's too much gore and sex in this episode and I'm not used to see a guy's dick or ass and I didn't like the sex scenes. It wasn't that long and I liked it when it first aired, but now it has been re-run in this version and I cannot even see it in the first episode. The show starts off with a lot of porn and sex scenes that I find so annoying that it's impossible to keep watching. There should have been at least three scenes in the entire show to get this show over and in the beginning there's no surprises. I found it amusing to see the fact that the show was so heavily edited. The sex scenes were done on the backs of the DVD box. I didn, and I couldn't believe that I was supposed to like it. At the very end it was the worst thing I have seen in my lifetime. It was only three episodes of the original show. I can barely watch two episodes and I was already dying to get to another one because it was so fucking boring and I knew there would be more in the show next year. I had to sit through the final two episodes of this show and I could see that there was nothing to be pleased about.  The rest of the show isn't even a joke. I do not understand why it has to be re-air and I don't know why it is being re-broadcast. Maybe I'm naive, but I don' think that it has anything to do with the main character and his "scary" sex scene. It is a sickening piece of film that shows that sex is all over. The scene in the last episode is so stupid. It's only in the final episode that it matters. It seemed so fake that I couldn' think about the actors and the director. I guess I'm glad that it was never aired. The rest is so poor that I have to waste so much time trying to get the show to look good. I couldn" see that if the film is still around I would recommend a copy of it to friends. It would take about an hour and fifteen minutes to get out and get the feeling of satisfaction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading an review of this movie, and was reminded of the horribleness of the film. There are no other characters alive and alive to have it on. The plot is not what it could have been. It is also pretty long and pretentious. But it does have a few nice moments. I found myself laughing out loud. Even some of the most cynical people I know laughed and said it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I did not want to see any of this flick. I saw this one only after reading it, and I wanted to see it again and even again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is a romantic romance, it's got a few plot twists. For starters, the woman with an interesting boyfriend goes off to a brooch (a local bar), and ends up getting herself into an alley where she's just raped. Also, the lead woman is a teenager and the other men are teenagers.  I just cannot see anyone getting to that situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As one of the newbies on the "film" I am not very happy to see them all to be so self-destructive. I mean, I would like to laugh at a movie which actually depicts the plot.  This movie is also terrible, because it does not follow any storyline, nor does it follow any style to the "real" film. The plot is simply not realistic at all. But there's more than one plot line per minute. What makes me sad is the ending is so lame, and I'm pretty sure it was never played out before. This movie was made only for the fact that it was entertaining for me to listen to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I think this movie had a pretty decent script (i'm not really a critic but it had some good parts, the characters weren't stupid). But for me it just turned into one of the stupidest slasher flicks of all time. The script is predictable, so boring. The characters were stupid but the acting was very weak and the storyline was completely uninteresting. I'm sure that it was done in some form to be a horror film, but in fact, it wasn't, and if you watch it as a gore-film then you'll miss the point of the movie. If you pay attention to the plot and characters then you might find it's pretty good, but just as an action-film, the movie should have been put in a theatre instead of a horror movie.  In addition, I can understand why the studio released this as a horror-film. After all it's a comedy, so how is a movie to be an action movie? I can't understand how this is supposed to be scary when we watch it and are thinking, "it's not scary." Of course I suppose this might be a funny movie, as a parody of "Barney" and the "slasher" genre.  But still, it's so bad it's never funny and it just seems like a slasher. It's just something bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen "The Amazing Spider" when it came out at my own movie theater when I was young. It was so bad that it seemed like a joke.  I didn't know it had anything to do with anything. And I think if I was a movie fan, I would have gotten much closer to seeing it. It really wasn't that great an action thriller, but it was really kind of boring and uninspiring.  It was bad for the sake of being an action film.  This movie was designed to be a horror flick, but instead it became something resembling a horror movie. It had absolutely no substance whatsoever. There wasn't even one decent action sequence. There were three or four scenes, so many times that I had to think. What the hell was the point of this movie? It has the potential to be an action flick, even an action comedy, but when it becomes a horror film, it is simply boring.  In addition, it failed to deliver a good ending.  If the film hadn't been terrible, then perhaps I would still enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd recommend a copy of this movie. Maybe not even the trailer, but at least the first few minutes are entertaining. But for the most part, it just repeats the same scene over and over again. I found myself watching this in a movie theater.  It would take more time to finish this before my hard-boiled ass off.  But it's also a terrible disappointment, and I'd like to spend another hour watching something that was less painful and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an example of a terrible movie: It was bad in other aspects, but I was surprised it was so stupid and so stupid to be so funny.  This film was so bad that it has even been rated one, as opposed to the original.  What really makes me sad is that I had such an idea that this movie could actually be funny. I didn't know that it was about a "funny" movie. In the beginning I thought the main character was one of the most ridiculous characters I have ever seen. At the beginning he is very stupid, a bumbling fool with an IQ of about 150. He is ridiculous enough that he shoots himself in a gun that looks like it's a real gun and then is able to shoot people who have their heads off. Later, there are many more silly moments of hilarity, such as him shooting a bird on a bus and killing it, his wife saying he was going to be in trouble, and the other character killing an animal. I hope the writer/director (if the person in the title is) is very upset about this, and that the director is so disrespectful to the actors that he made this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a very poor attempt to be filmed with a very low budget. Very low budget for a high budget movie, but nonetheless it managed to get the job done. However, even though the movie did have some humor, it had nothing going on. Even though the story seemed interesting and the music was good, it lacked the other parts and the plot was simply predictable.  I was also disappointed that there wasn't a soundtrack in this movie. While the movie's humor had some charm, it wasn't as funny as it could have been.  Other areas where I felt the story was predictable were as follows.  One scene had to be explained very quickly. There were three girls walking down the stairs, and one guy got stuck in a toilet, and another guy got hurt.  Some of the dialog could be a bit better, but the overall effort on the movie is simply stupid. The movie could have gone much more interesting.  The movie has a very vague plot and really could be an hour of film, but unfortunately this movie just didn't work out.  What makes the movie so disappointing is the fact that the characters' names aren't all English, and there is no noticeable indication of who the characters are.  Also, the movie does not take the time to reveal the character's motivations. They don't seem to be that kind of film that you'd want to watch. This movie could be very interesting, but in the end it is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be funny and funny, but it really sucked, and I don't think this movie is funny. I really don't like that part of the movie. It got to be pretty sad and painful, and it had to be an unhappy family reunion that was kinda unfair. I just don't see a reason to watch this movie.  It really sucked. I'm glad I watched it, but I don t want to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the best moments of a disappointing film i have ever seen i never understand why this made it a cult film or any of the other ones that had a few more realistic scenes. i can see the other person that has worked in this film like the young director, but this was an uninspired plot and some of the acting has been laughable. i know the rest of the cast (mostly the supporting players) were all interesting, so there's hope for the rest.  The only thing that can make me not want this movie is the acting. I know this movie contains some interesting characters, and most of them are good, but the acting was too obvious, and the dialogue was too silly. i don't think that the producers are capable of making a film in a year, or even in a half.  I've seen better movies from other countries than this one, and these are some of my favourites. The main character, Jason, has always been an over acting buff. He was in one of those roles in a few movies, like the main part of a TV series that was never released in the United States. This is obviously an over role and a stupid role, but he doesn't get that part in a film like this one.   The other interesting actor in this movie was the young actress named Vanessa Fira. Her character is stupid, she plays as a jealous teen girl. If you liked the role, you would have known that she was acting the same way. I have read comments from the movie that say she was very good and funny, but she didn't get the part that she deserved. She did get some good lines in the scene in the hospital.  This movie has absolutely no funny lines, and no funny scene. I am not amused with the other actors, but you might want to hear how some of them act in the movie. This movie is just an hour and a half of trash, not one of my favorites. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at a conference when this film was first screened on "the first day of the show" on the screen, and I was left dumbfounded that I didn't get the opportunity to see it. That's a bad thing to see, in my opinion. I don't really understand the premise of the film. It is pretty ridiculous to take away all the stuff in the movie and not to give it back to the creators of this film. I can imagine the makers trying to make this film better for it to appeal to a younger audience. And there are no better reasons to do that. I'm a bit tired and disappointed and wish that I could be in this conference to see the film again, so I made this review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story behind the film is interesting, if you want to go on the adventure and enjoy the story. What a complete lack of a plot! This film has a very bad plot! I recommend that you stay away from this film as soon as possible, at least until after 10 minutes of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In what has been proved to be an incredibly stupid and incredibly shallow comedy/shimmy show with a plot of a very simple and unassuming story - with no direction of anything, no plot twists. It could have been a great comedy-killer show if it was a little smarter - but it is rather the worst comedy/horror show I've ever seen. I think it is a great way to waste money on a movie: look at the comments of the reviewers: "It's just one small part of a bigger plot", "the acting is decent and not poor, and the story is a piece of junk!". The story is not even a decent story about a young boy who is being bullied by the others and who has his own problems, but rather about a girl who is struggling with how to deal with her friends, her boyfriend and her boyfriend's friends. I mean the story isn't even a story. It's all about an empty movie. And if you watch it and like the show, you will enjoy it, but if you are looking for a sequel and/or a sequel to this, don't get a sequel! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who really respects a good movie, I've found myself finding a way to appreciate it so that I could watch it, even though the acting, production, and soundtrack is so bad and bad that I couldn't even have the patience to get to enjoy it. I think it's the worst movie I've seen from Hollywood in a long time. I've only had to go away and rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a very bad film. I am sure the production crew on this film is a really talented one (I'm not counting the actor who was obviously extremely talented). I really enjoyed this film as a kid but now I see the film as an absolute waste. I was very disappointed and disgusted. I had not even seen some of the acting in the film. This was bad film for everyone involved and a very poor movie to watch. I recommend a good film to stay away from this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot understand the reasoning that the makers of this movie have been trying to make it seem attractive. They want to create a world where there's an abundance of baddies and other people are able to make a killing in a minute time. That's why I'm writing this review. This movie is bad, and I don't understand it. I'm not going to go into an actual plotline about a movie where there is an abundance or even a chance to kill someone. That would be pointless, but this movie is the exact opposite.  It's bad because it's not about a story, but about how people die, and how it is that they die. It's also bad because there's nothing in the film that really explains how and why a baddie's killings work. It is just a bunch of stupid jokes. The only good thing about the movie is that the characters are not totally horrible. Even though I did enjoy the movie, it wasn't worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping to review this bad movie since it is about time to watch it. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by this film. It is really bad and it is not funny. This movie was the worst one I've seen from my life so far. I wish I were still able to see it. I don't know why it has not been updated since this movie was made and this movie is still only a few minutes short. I recommend watching it with a friend and we will both laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie fails to deliver any kind of fun.  It feels like it was designed by a school teacher who had never before worked with children. It's like a sex school that got interested in child sex education because he thought he might get involved with a group of teenagers. That's what it is, an over-the-busted sequel that lacks any comedy, but it looks like it could have a really fun movie.  But it still sucks.  The worst part of this movie is probably the ending. There's a couple of "climators" talking about how it's about "a child" and "heaven" in the room, and the characters are totally unbelievable. It also feels like the only scene in the movie that you can't even really understand, and that's where it really gets funny. A few other interesting things about the movie include the fact that they've got a car that has to be destroyed to be used again by the child's parents. I'm sorry, but this movie really isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read this very long and in a positive review it is a bad film. I've watched it in full review mode, because I wanted to comment.  It really is a pathetic and un-intended film. As an actor, it really needs some good dialog. I really think it should be a low-budget film, not a full time production. What is supposed to be the best film of that year was actually made by a horror/thriller filmmaker.  There are some good actors in this film. But, what really matters is that these actors are not the characters that I actually cared about and they're just people who have a low level. If you are a fan of the actors in the movie, don't watch it because you'll lose faith.  This film contains about 70 minutes of blood and gore, which I did enjoy for a minute or two. And there are no real ending. If it had been one of my favorite horror films, I would say that I liked it, but that's not true. I was also tired by the end.  But, I really feel like this is an unfilled, badly acted movie. It wasn't long but it took me a few minutes to get into the movie. The first few minutes are mostly directed to be an hour of horror-show-cum-movie. There are no decent and interesting characters in the film. The characters of the characters are just poorly-acted. And, what can I say?  The whole time I watched it, it had no redeeming quality and no real suspense.  So, if you want to see a movie with good dialog but bad acting, don nothing, but don't, because you will be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am the kind that thinks you have to be so depressed that you must be so sad that you would not like this movie. This film was an effort to show how awful the poor North America is, and I think that the makers were trying to "lighten up the country." This is a movie about a major earthquake in California that caused major earthquake damage, so I think they tried to make a "comfortable" movie about how depressed these people would be to see something that they would otherwise see an alien invasion. I can only see this movie for a few minutes before I get up to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting has been bad this time. The script has a few good lines in it. That's what happened to me in the first 60 min. After that though I was very disappointed that it could come out. I didn't expect too much. Even if it was just a bit lower than the average film it would be an extremely bad piece of work. I'm still looking at this. It does an awful job.  The plot is weak. The dialog is flat and predictable, not at all dramatic, and all of the acting is so bad it leaves me thinking the actor has to be a star. I hope the next film has some good story to go with.  Overall I gave this film a 4/10 rating. I gave it 2/10 because the acting was excellent. There was a few funny moments in this film but the acting makes me think I would have to watch this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sure this movie would be an interesting piece of film if the producers tried to make it entertaining, but it wasn't. It is terrible. You are left to wonder what the hell this movie was about, but if they made it entertaining for a one time, I would definitely recommend it to be burned.  The characters are stupid, the acting is poor and the storyline is stupid, it makes you want to have your brain broken up. I don't even think there was any story line. It was obviously intended to be a comedy, but that's about all you need to know about it. It's just really stupid.  It's an attempt to break the norm and make something fun look a little better. The funny thing is that it could probably have a few funny scenes. Otherwise I'd recommend the movie to those who are going to hate American films. It just don't work. I'd like to see it again and then destroy it, but the fact that it was made when I couldn't see it was a bad sign.  There are a few small bits that redeem the movie but I'd avoid seeing it again if there was nothing else good about it, or if the writer/director didn't try any of the other funny bits in the film. I could care less about this film because I would want to see more serious American films, like American Pie, American Pie and American Pie 2. Those are my favorites. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film after reading this review.  It was like a porno flick from an adult flick. If you want to watch it for free, but I don't have a lot of time for such a title.  But this is more like a movie than a sex flick. I cannot recommend it as entertainment, but it does serve to take away your mind from the world and leave you feeling like a little less busy.  The movie has one of the worst lines to the movie. It is obviously obvious that this is the kind of film you are going to see. If anything to be said about it, then don't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it for my 30th birthday and it wasn't good. I couldn't even watch it again for a few months. I didn't watch the second time and only watched it when it came out on Blu-ray. The story was bad, it was a waste of time and the action didn't work. But, it doesn't matter. I'm not a movie buff, it is not a genre, it isn't a comedy, it's just a way to go in the world of TV shows. If you enjoy watching shows, and films like "Mr. Magoo", or even "House Of Cards", you'll probably find a little fun with it. But don't expect this to be a very good movie, at least as far as I found it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about a simple love story, with only one character that was interesting.  After several attempts, I was left with the movie that I liked to look at, but it was about only bad. I had to think it over with the characters and the storyline. The dialogue was about half decent, and the acting was not good, or well put together.  It's not worth a 2 stars, but 1/2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely ridiculous in the first 15 minutes. I mean it was terrible from the moment you saw the first 2/3 of this movie to the point that the acting was so terrible that I had to have an alarm for the whole movie. But what did I do? I just sat for one hour and laughed it off. I laughed it away. But it is true. There is an awful lot of bad things in this movie - terrible characters, terrible acting, a whole lot of awful music. The soundtrack is awful. It is just awful. I give this movie 2/10 in terms of a bad acting performance and poor story.  If you like a movie with some pretty good performances, take the chance to see this movie. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts off with a horrible scene of a couple having sex on their way to the mall, which becomes a series of horrible scenes. The sex scene is so bad that it's funny. It's bad, it's sad, it doesn't even seem like it would have to work, which is why most people don't even know it. This movie has no funny moments. It is very dull, and it never gets moving, although it has nice moments like a car ride and a car that keeps turning. I give this movie 2 out-10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie had quite an original idea. What is so much as a plot? What could have been a plot, in the way that I had seen other movies make. For this movie it was a complete disaster, with too many clichés and unbelievable dialog. I suppose that it's not a coincidence that, in one of the characters, we don't even have any clue about their relationships, let alone the relationships with other characters. The plot was so predictable and boring, the characters felt flat. The dialog was poor and unfunny and the characters just seemed to exist nowhere.  This movie was so bad it hurt me. I don't think anyone really cared about the characters. I'm just seeing this bad movie for the first time, and I had to end my life before I even considered it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good parts of this film, but it has to be used for what it was intended to be. The director was one of the people who made it, so don't trust him as a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some good things in this movie. There is some really good scenes in the movie. However, none of them come close to the level that would have made an 'Cringe movie'.   The movie never takes itself serious and never really surprises. The jokes that the movie includes are extremely unfunny, and there are some of them that have the feel of being so childish. The main thing is that the film is boring, and it isn't funny in any way. There are some really nice scenes in this film but none of the jokes are funny.  The film has the worst taste in a film I've seen in a long time. I'm not even sure I will even be able to watch this film.  It is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. If it has a great cast I'll probably see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I had seen my first film! This is the same film i had seen before. Its full on '80's horror theme, and if they wanted to try out a second film and I didn't expect one to be able to make it a success. It's a disappointment! And if you do not think it's a horror film, you are probably wrong. They just keep using it like a soapbox, and there's not any suspense. The story is pretty thin. The ending is pretty corny. I'm just looking for some horror actors to come in, because this is a real bad film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I had seen this before its premiere. When it aired I thought the film was terrible, terrible. What a complete failure of an film! The acting is atrocious. The acting was atrocious, the dialog was awful. The story was unbelievable, the camera was bad, and I wanted it all to end. It just kept going and got worse. I can't say that it was a bad film, but I have to say that the production is terrible and the script is bad. The ending is so predictable and pointless. I didn't watch it, and this is one of those awful comedies I found in the 1990's. I've been a fan of the movies, but it was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie is to tell us who the best actors in the world are and to go straight to find the next big star. Well this movie isn't exactly like The Lord of the Rings. It's not that The Lord's characters are evil but the acting in this movie doesn't make the point any farther in this direction.  It does have a few good performances but most of the actors are a bit weak and lack the necessary charisma and acting to make a serious movie with a serious storyline.  But what's up with this movie? It could be a pretty good movie but in the end it feels like a joke. I give it three stars out because of its ridiculous stupidity and I feel the characters are treated like toys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so frustrated that I started my search for the video. I had to have the video of the original film. I couldn't find it anywhere. The only way I found out it was from the video box. I searched the video clip, and my only hope was that it was the original copy, the copy that was on television or in the home.  I think this is a classic example of the end of the film's time. I believe the original script was an unoriginal, but I'm sorry to say there is no mention of the plot. I also find the casting a bit unprofessional, with the actress in the film taking on the name of a famous American comedian. I don't blame her, she's an actor, but she's not very good.  There are probably some interesting bits of history behind the film, like some of the events, but you have to be careful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My parents are a big fan of this kind of crap. The main character, Sean, was an old man in his 60's. He died and his family fell apart. He left a good estate for his wife, a woman he saved on a movie called "Neddy & Sally", a comedy/adventure series that consisted of some children from the movie. There was no real plot, just a whole set of children playing the characters. The series got so bad that it seemed like this might be some of the worst movie in existence. One scene involving a fake car chasing the fake car (with fake flames coming out), some children (wobblets on fire), and Sean's family, and a fire truck filled with real flames. The movie is so bad it has got a couple of sequels that take place in different locations. Even the sequels involve people who are not even remotely similar, the best of which are not very good.  In short, I'm sad that the "NEDDY & SALLY" has been put in the junk drawer of my home. There are so many holes it has missed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie fails on just about every aspect and fails to make any enjoyment. The acting is so bad, the dialogs are so poor and the acting is such that it is painful to watch. The story, which was designed in the book to follow the book pretty fast, is completely off. There is no story, no dialog, no action, no special effects and no special settings. I tried watching this film just because I thought it was funny and I thought the characters in the movie were funny. The characters in "Unforgetful" were despicable and the cast were terrible.  The only thing I liked was the ending. But I have to believe that this is not a "unforgetfulness" movie but simply a complete disaster. I do not like any of the films that make "Unfindful" movies, but I don't really like "Unlookful" because I was the only one who ever enjoyed it. The only positive review I have for "Unseek" is the one I had for "The Unseen" where this movie actually had some of the good elements of the book, which I did not like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has just one good line... if it is not for me! What a terrible movie! The movie has many horrible things in it, some of which were simply the acting and had the good points that the movie had. Unfortunately the movie has none of the charm of the original, which I thought that the other actors in the movie were more funny than the rest. Some of the acting was just ridiculous and laughable, and I don't believe that I'm responsible for not making fun of it. Unfortunately this movie fails to deliver any real value to its viewer. It is truly just another lame, over-the-top joke. This movie should be used as a reference for something else, or in another movie. If you just want a laugh, then why not? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with a guy, his wife, and his father who is acting for the film. She starts off by kissing his daughter and then she moves onto another house with a boyfriend and a bunch of old people who seem to be in love with her. She then tells her father that she was going to have sex with him and then he starts to act like he did in his drunken days and get into his drunk, drug, and drug induced life. She tries to keep her husband in her life and keeps trying to get into her life with him, but he keeps failing her, and then starts to abuse her.  She then starts talking with him. He is saying pretty stupid stuff about her, especially his father and the old men. And there are the two guys who just love her, who are in her room when she tries to get in there. But even after she has sex with them, she starts off on drugs with an addict, and she is able to stay sober.  As the movie starts, it appears to be a good movie, but it does not follow through the end. The two guys (who are acting for this movie) seem to get bored with it and get bored from watching it. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life, and the main reason I am taking this movie off the shelf is that it is very predictable and boring. The characters are predictable and the ending isn't actually great. The worst I have seen from this movie is the ending. It was an extremely horrible ending. The ending is actually pretty good. I hope it was written on the page for entertainment purposes, but I doubt if anyone even understood it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so thin, I don't know what was it about. They don't even make it seem plausible. I had never seen a movie before, and even now, it's hard to believe. The acting is bad, too. I couldn't believe there were actors, and I think they just don't do enough.  You can't buy this movie, unless you like really funny, though, it will be hilarious if you are not a humorless person. I don`t think this film has any more appeal than just a few minutes of comedic jollery. It is really bad. The only way it was funny was the people that made it.  I really like the "Aussie Man" for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a little too long for a "kids" movie. I was hoping for some witty elements in a comedy, but this fails miserably. I didn't find one in this movie. It wasn't funny to see this movie in a way, and it wasn't amusing. The girls didn't act right, and the acting wasn't interesting, the characters weren't believable and the dialog was just OK for no reason. This is just a bad film, not even a really bad movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a bad little movie. There are some pretty funny moments (like the car with a pink eye!), but what's the point of this movie? This is a movie about teenagers. It should be an hour of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made to be the worst movie I had ever seen. It's not like they usually make movies with no story lines, no plot, no dialogs, no laughs, no dialogue, and no humor. It is like they want it to be a comedy, but it isn't. I found a joke that could be a gag about the movie was never delivered. But my friend, one of the funniest comedians I have ever known was Rodeo. The funny and stupid thing about this movie is that the people who made it thought that they were trying to have an amusing movie and the people that made it think they were making an amusing way to watch it, that is why this movie was so bad. In fact, I could just sit on the toilet and watch this movie, since I don't want to put myself into that kind of situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie wasn't even an action movie. It was supposed to be a great Hollywood drama but it's just too long and boring. I'm surprised that this is the best remake of The Matrix from 1999.  Even a movie as poor as this one couldn't make it up.  It's too bad. It's just really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of film that gets you wondering why a sequel to a bad film should be made. It is, however, worth viewing, as it is one of the worst movies ever made, so don't rent it and don't watch it. You may end up with a headache or feeling sick with the way it is constructed, but if you can't see the rest of it, then you might be a better person than you would. If you want to find out what the worst films are, the one which I recommend is this, the movie which I am recommending to anyone who hasn't seen a good movie: 'The Pig'! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie on the IMDb. It's bad! It's really bad. It has no plot, no suspense, no sense of direction. And, of course, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the people on the screen. As a viewer I cannot believe this movie was supposed to be scary (because it doesn't come alive). I really did think it was supposed just to be a bit scary, but after reading my comments about it I was more scared to be frightened. If you are looking for a horror film then look no further! It starts off with a very unpleasant plot that isn't what it could have been, but it has got everything that is bad. In the first scene there is a lot of people talking and screaming and talking and making noises with their mouths. As the first movie begins the camera is used to show a "scream" in the background and I really wondered what it was going to be.  The movie could have a lot less disturbing, but you'll have to watch this movie repeatedly because it starts off like this with an even worse storyline.  In the end I just hope the person who has been killed is in one of the people at the movie. It does not help to know that the people in the hotel are talking about the hotel as much as talking about what they are doing on their hotel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the worst I've seen since my youth. The storyline was pretty boring. It was supposed to be an adaptation of the popular film of John Caulfield's "Asterion" from the original story. But when I saw it, I was reminded that it was the remake of a series of comics that was based on this very movie. A few people who have seen this movie and liked it have told me how it wasn't as bad as the other adaptations of the comic, and I'm sorry for all the people who got away from their screen and are still upset. But I'm glad I'm safe, and as for me, it didn't ruin my life.  If I didn't like it, maybe I could get an even worse movie: "Couchpot". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be a satirical film, but I felt like watching it to be taken seriously. If you really want to be ironic, make a positive review about bad movie.  The plot is somewhat confusing and the acting is bad, the cast is awful, the special effects are weird and stupid and there is no idea what they are doing. If I hadn't heard this before I seen this video, I would never have.  If you want to avoid watching this film, steer away from it.   If nothing else, you will probably get bored or just plain bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has some good ideas, but nothing to stick on. A lot of stupid jokes about a female pilot, a female soldier in the army and a male prostitute, among the many other things this movie is about, the female pilot gets pregnant and goes to an abortion clinic, the two women meet an old man, the pilot is killed in the abortion clinic and is in prison for his conviction. A few of the dialogues is good, but the film seems to take all the ideas out of the original script.  There is a very bad video that I heard from the theatre and was a really bad movie. I heard some funny scenes, but some of the stories were really stupid. I found myself laughing for the other jokes.  I didn't think this movie was going to be as bad as it turned out to be. The other important question is whether the pilot has brain disease, if she's a man or a woman with a disability and the man she's sleeping with is also mentally impaired. This movie is only about a few feet long, but I think it needs to be longer. The ending is stupid, but it is also a very good way to tie up a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an embarrassment from my own lack of knowledge of the genre and what the movie tells me is, I think, a piece of trash. I'm a fan of "The Sixteen" which is based on a novel of the same genre. What I saw this movie as was a poor movie was not an entertainment. The main element of the film is a story of a young boy (or man, or woman) who, with "an angel" (his partner), finds himself in an apartment with a bunch of losers. It turns out that there's a hidden demon that was in the apartment and has to be brought back to the surface to get rid of the demon's soul. As the demon and his friend fight the demon, the group of losers get killed one by one by an idiot.  This is the same kind of a film that would be released to the public if they were not trying to get a lot of money for this film. This movie is about the same thing as "Voodoo Demon", "The Mummy's Ghost", and "The Necromancer". The problem is that they just cannot portray a demon that is not a demon, which is not only a problem in the movie, but also a problem for a lot to the viewer. If they decide to stick with these elements, it will take away from the film. The viewer would still be left to the disappointment of a demon-free movie where it is impossible to find out what happens to the demon.  The only thing that makes it better is that the demon was able to kill off his demon companion with his power over "chaos", which in addition to "the curse" over a demon in "The Last Wish" does not appear in "Voofft Demon". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really thought this would be a funny review but sadly it is. I would have laughed if I was the only one that laughed. I read the book and watched this show in a movie theater without realizing the truth. The premise is really pathetic. I was annoyed that the "plot" was actually the best part. If you're not a big fan of the Disney show of "Disney's The Little People's Home," the plot is really disappointing. The dialogue is really bad. There are no jokes. Just awful, awful, and stupid. There is no funny side to the story. I did not like the plot, it just seemed that the show was trying to go over all the fanboy fans who have seen "Little People's House" to this extent. I saw all that, but the movie doesn't do the same work. I'm not sure if this was an intentional effort on Disney's part or a mistake. I don't know what happened or what is the reason, but I hope that the writers will learn from their mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just an insult to a movie that is based on the popular "The Matrix" movie series. The plot is about a small group of people in a desert desert/meadow to battle evil "AIs" aliens. The storyline is very un-realistic and very not believable. The movie is not even the second one. It is not about robots, it is about people to fight.  There is an obvious lack of emotion and no real plot to the movie. The characters are boring and do not make any sense to the plot. The story is based only on a fake movie called "The Terminator" which contains some pictures of the movie set in a real location. It would be better if the movie were a real version.  The movie has been rated 4/10 for the movie, but it was rated a 2 out of 10 on IMDb by IMDb when it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen several reviews of this movie. I was in two cities watching these reviews and was dismayed. I thought the movie was going to be interesting. Alas, I wasn't at all.  The movie starts with a man's girlfriend, and the other guy who is supposed to be a co-worker from another country. They get into an intense and dangerous fight with the other man.  Things don't look good, and there is no climax. The dialog seems so bland that it could be easily laughed off.  Some of the people who thought the film was funny were probably unaware of its direction and script. Also, a lot of the jokes are simply un-committed, and too obvious.  I'm not sure who was the writer of the film or who it actually was directed by, but the direction was good, though not very funny.  There is nothing about this movie that actually appeals to me as an entertainment, but I don't care to get into a debate about how it is funny. Some of my comments, like the people that commented on this film for it and the reviews of it, seemed to be making a point about how bad the movie really is, but don't forget that this movie is funny as hell.   If the director had a clue and cared to try and make the movie funnier, they would have made a sequel that would have some jokes, but this movie really did nothing. It is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie. It is so poorly executed. The acting in the film is so bad. It wasn't even funny at all. I could laugh while listening to the dialog, and the actors seemed to me like it as they tried to fill it in with jokes, like the guy with the red nose and hair from the beginning to the end. This movie is full of terrible acting and really hard to watch. This is an insult to the actors and also a slap in the face of a guy who has a sense of humour. I didn't watch it for two years, and I don't think it was good for him. You just have to see it if you want to go to see the original movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm having to sit through the beginning part of this movie about half an hour, and I had to stick with it for a few days. I am not a hater of this bad movie. I don't like it as much as I thought it was before. I have been reading this movie since it was released.  I didn't know how I'd ever heard this story. The only thing I've seen is this video game on the website. I've been looking at all the way that the movie would have been edited, and they couldn't be even remotely made, so it's a total joke. The DVD is also pretty bad, the acting is bad, but they aren't even a joke. Just like all movies, this movie is full of stereotypes and pretenses. I'm not sure they're capable of making anything in a movie. And it's just terrible for a movie: it has some really stupid scenes, but it doesn't do anything for anyone. I do know that the director had made the movie, but the fact that it doesn 'n the person who makes it doesn' mean anything about the person making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie for a couple of minutes and was bored to say. I know that it's a pretty shallow plot, but I didn't know that there was an attempt to put it all together. There was an interesting thing in the end when the last person was left.  I'm going to have to laugh at this guy. I've been watching this movie since, but it just didn't work.  There was nothing coming out of it. It didn't look like a movie. It's just a little step between a cartoon that's too big and too dull to be funny, and a movie that's boring and no one is going to laugh. There's nothing to enjoy here. The only one I found funny was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I could find is the video, which I found by reading the IMDb. However, this movie is pretty horrible, and I'm willing to admit I watched it twice on my own, and did not watch it again. I think the movie was made to be stupid and had no idea how good it could be. A lot of bad actors, bad actors (particularly those in the first part, who are stupid), and bad jokes. It's not even a good movie for children. Even if you don't have a steely heart, don't waste your time watching this movie.  I don't know who this director is, but I do know who I'd vote for, because he's the bad guy, and he doesn't deserve a job. It is a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if it is the best or worst movie ever made. There are two or three times too many bad jokes and some kind of character flaws, not that you would expect anything out of it. I donth believe that the director really believed he was doing something like this. It's like watching a movie that was so badly made when one of the actors is crying about the movie. I'm a big fan of "Razzmat" and I have always liked those movies. But it wasn't even good.  This movie is stupid in almost every way. There should have been a "B" version of this movie, or a decent version. I wouldn't even recommend it, I think the people who worked on it should have put some sort of story in their minds that would have some redeeming qualities. It wasn't worth watching. I've been bad in two movies that were way better than "Ricky" and the two movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I thought this movie was a little interesting, but I'm guessing it was the most poorly conceived movie I've seen. The movie starts on a predictable and somewhat predictable way to the story, with little character development, which is at its weakest when it comes to the acting. And the acting is also weak, but at least the movie was pretty funny.  But after a few hours of watching this, it was just plain boring, and most of the time I was bored to death by the movie. The ending just left a lot of people disappointed.  I don't know if they saw this before or after. This movie isn't even good, and I donno longer recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The basic premise of this movie is like so many of many of so many other "precious" films. It's the same "cadrome", the same theme, the same story, the one-act story, "who would never know what happened and whose parents died, and the "who's gonna find a long dead person". This has been done countless times, but this movie will most certainly be the worst I've ever seen. There's nothing wrong with the plot. If there was any real plot or story, it wasn't there. It was bad on every level, from the way in which it's presented, to the way it's actually acted, to and what is it about them. I'm sure I'll find the remake on video store shelves, but for the sake of my work I didn't rent it.  I give this movie two stars in a low order. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie takes no real plot to the story. We have some of the characters in the movie, we have some characters in front of the camera, but not in front. The dialog is not believable, the film is not strong enough and the characters are not believable. And some of them are just plain, which really makes me angry to even think of it. But it does have some good qualities. The film is about to be very boring.  The plot has a long time stretch and the film does not even seem to go through the most of its budget. I'm not sure I'll ever like it after my 40 hours. I just hope it doesn't break. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was at least some fun scenes. The actors were OK but they were unable to take direction well and they didn't manage the characters properly. Also the ending had such a bad ending that it took two people in it to understand the ending.  The cinematography was okay, though not good. There were times where the actors were in fact not convincing to be able to complete their scenes. This was bad to see those acting in a film which they actually cared.  Also, I wasn't able to enjoy this film. I don't know why the director would have cared for this film because it was so bad. The characters and the dialog were awful! It's really not worth seeing but it is good to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it aired on the NBC Christmas specials. It was pretty bad, and I don't think anyone would have liked it anyway. The whole movie was simply unbelievable, and the ending ending was the worst movie I've ever seen. I think it was just like a bad action movie. I've seen better movies in the past, but it wasn't even a decent film at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was bad but it shows so many bad characters. I have not read anything about the actors but i can not judge their acting. they are all really bad. i hope that they will get some good acting from them as they are not the most good actor and not that bad.  i don't know what they are going to be doing but i have seen all the pictures of this film so I can see it. The film is very disappointing. I mean i was really upset about it but all the actors in the movie are bad. the acting is poor and the dialog is not so nice. I hope that the actors will get good roles and hopefully we will soon see them in a movie somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is one redeeming quality in this film, it's that the director isn't afraid to lose a few years of his life doing this. If there were one redeemING quality, this is because of the hilarious and nonsensical plot. The direction is so bad that it makes me cringe, almost sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film contains nothing original whatsoever, nor does it have the same taste to the original. I'd have to say that at some point this movie could have been a good film if it were to follow its original pace, but it isn't. I cannot even understand what it was that I saw. As a child I had the same feeling of "why is it so bad?" as with a movie that only makes the first time look like a bad film. There is no dialogue or plot or plot to a movie. The animation is not good and the music is stupid. It's just plain terrible.  The only thing I can say that I really liked was the opening. The way it plays out is a waste of time. The director is really good. The cinematography was good, but not good enough. The cast is OK, but there is nothing special about them.  I am sorry for this movie. This movie is not to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sick of movies like this. I want something more than just an excuse to stay away from it. It's not interesting. It has not a good story line. It is a horrible way to tell a story about a good movie: horrible acting, terrible plot. Bad special effects. I don't care if I lost my life, I donut if i'm not dead. I also don't think it is good for your sanity. I do think the characters are okay, but the movie is a really lousy movie. This is like the B-rated version of the Disney version of "The Tale of Desirae." I cannot recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a poor effort from the folks at Universal Studios. I have heard that these guys made the film about this time, and now I have nothing more to say. They obviously made it to be a horror movie. It should have been a horror film and they were obsessed with horror films. Instead of horror, this is a plot that focuses on sex, and sex is totally off the rails. The sex scene is not scary; it is gratuitous and unnecessary.  The gore is mostly a bit over-the-top of what the movie contains. I had to wait for some of the scenes to get through the camera.  I did not like the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been reading this movie for a long time, and I have a feeling that this movie will be a failure for the whole. The movie never gets going. Some people don't even realize this was one of the top 3 movies of the day. The acting is terrible, the acting is bad, and the dialogs are absolutely awful. The best part of the movie was when it was just about 2% of the way into the film.  This is one of those movies that really is just a "piece of crap" in its entirety. It could have been more interesting, and perhaps more entertaining than this. The music in the soundtrack is really bad.  The music was good though, and there are some decent song titles that don't ruin the movie. Unfortunately, the song titles were pretty good, and they should have been made a bit louder, since it was pretty clear that the lyrics had just gotten lost in the shuffle.  I don't think this movie really could work at all, even after it has had some time to build up some interest. But, it's not for me to watch this movie, since I thought the characters were interesting and the acting wasn't that bad, but the actors were really bad in the movie and the soundtrack was just plain awful. There aren't enough characters, which is a common mistake with every movie with a strong plot. There wasn't any real development and nothing to go about with the plot. The scene in the bar is pretty stupid, and doesn't make any sense. The ending leaves the viewer totally confused. Some scenes in the hotel were cute, but too predictable.  It's about a half hour of nothing, and nothing happens. If you want a mindless, stupid, boring film, or the end of the page, then please don't see this movie. The "Punch" just won't be good enough. It's just plain bad and doesn´t even qualify as a "plot" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one was awful. The whole time I watched it was a complete waste of time and money. I could barely tell if the movie actually made money, or even did some of the best. But it didn't matter. It wasn't even funny. I found the whole film to be a complete failure. I think that it is a major bore, and I would only recommend it for those who hate their brains. I'm sorry, I only watched it for a few minutes and I never watched it again. I don't understand why this was a bad film, and why this is an attempt at fame. I really didn't like it, but it could have done more harm than a bad bad movie. If you just watched this movie because it has the 'big' tag, and you feel like watching it, then you'll probably enjoy the most ridiculous movie ever produced. If it turns out good in the end, don't expect much from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not only a poor attempt at humor, but an insult to all who take the time to watch it, and it has little appeal on the screen. There are only three jokes in the film, and there are a few too many. This film has a slight feel of being appropriate for a film in a movie, but its overall aim is not at all.  But for those who still enjoy "Sixty's" humor, this movie is an insult. This movie fails as the most boring, pretentious, unfunny film ever made, and fails as an "entertain" film with little interest in any direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie's the worst thing I've ever seen, so I'm giving this as bad grade as an award.  I've never seen such a poor film as this one. The story is so badly portrayed that I actually laughed at the ending. I was expecting that the movie would end in an hour, but it ended in 10 minutes! The acting was bad, but the characters were so boring that I just didn't care about the story anymore! If you want a movie with a happy ending, go to "The Little Crack". I've seen this film twice, and I'm only interested to see if anyone is interested, but i'm too bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen. The plot is about a very complicated plot that includes all of the bad movies of the world, and the lead actor (Bret Stilley) is too boring to care about anything (other than his role in the first movie.) For example, Stil a can just start his story with a plot about a group of guys who are in the middle of a drug gang. If you try to get into that, you'll probably find a pile of dead people in the process and dead cops, which will force Stil to kill everyone. Unfortunately, it's not like a lot more than "Babal," so even if you're a person that would watch the movie for that reason, you should probably not watch it. But, that aside from the plot, the acting is quite bad. Most of the dialog is stupid and pretentious and is completely bad, and that's because it has no redeeming qualities. I won't even begin to address the story, but it could do with an actor that can handle the dialog properly. I'd think it'd be a little funny if the guy's acting were a little more believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the good ones when they were nice. I felt so sorry for this movie, but was disappointed by it. It was only after watching the final preview that I realized how much I was sad to have not enjoyed it. I had a few days to watch before coming on, and I kept thinking how ridiculous it would be. I don't understand what this movie is about, so I'm only going to guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason to see this is not to be masochistic, but I'm not. I'm a member of an open and public viewing group. The reasons to see a film like this are obvious. We all want to be cynical. We want to take on the most horrible situations of the world. We are all too cynical. But it doesn't matter. We have our own life and we're sick of these types of movies. We don't want to make ourselves sick with an over-simulated storyline.  The plot sucks and there are no good movies out there for any price. A film about a series of bad movies. What's there?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's something strange about this movie. The movie starts with this bizarre, self-indulgent fantasy, which is followed by a rather unimportant character, played by Chris Pratt, that would like to have the same luck as him.  There are only two characters, and there are only three episodes. There is absolutely no character development, and the characters are so unfunny that they just don't know who the hell they are.  The script is even worse than the first film, in fact, so bad that you can't even tell who the lead characters are. I had to re-read the entire script, and even got so worked up as a result that I couldn't even finish the last sentence. The dialog is pretty stupid, so far it has been left to me on the tape. That's a shame. There are a lot of fake dialogs, and I have seen this movie in two movies, so I can't count off it.  I know this movie is full of fantasy, and not just "Candy" or even "Cinder" type fantasies, but it's still too much of a cliché. This movie is just one more of those "no surprises" movies that tries to distract people from a good movie: bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a movie, you have to expect the least likely to be seen, that's for movies to be. One must have a clear idea of how bad the movie is, I'd give a movie that had to be for a movie with a little money, that would really have people wondering. This movie has bad plot and bad acting. It's a real disappointment in a movie about a hero who gets a chance to get revenge by killing the villain.  The whole movie has the worst ending for a hero. You know this, the end is stupid. I'm not saying that because I want to, it just, uhhh, it really is stupid as to me.  There are many films out there, that are better, but this one doesn't deserve any of the money the studios spend on it.  It's okay to say that I didn't see it. It was bad. I've always wondered why it had so little fanatical interest. I think that it was because the film director thought he was a special type of person. But that was a long time ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'd like to say this movie had a funny script. Then I just watched it. I was shocked to find that none of the actors really spoke in their performance, not the way I would normally expect a film to be a comedy. The acting is so bad, and the dialogs and dialog are just bad. All the movie has is the characters' incessant, self-centered, and annoying dialogue that isn't even funny, but it doesn't matter because the ending is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I have to say I had to experience something like this, and I'm going to laugh. I didn't go to like the movie, but I did like the characters. I think that they could have done a better job in their characters' scenes. The characters are the same as the characters of the movie.  I'm not sure what kind of people will be offended by this movie, so I won't watch. But it didn't like me. It wasn't just the characters, it was bad acting, bad acting of all the cast. And I don't know what a "mood" is, or whether to believe this is the best movie of this year. I don´t know if this is an all-powerful TV show or if the book has anything to say about how we relate to each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what a guy from New York can do to write something positive about this movie. I mean, the director made an effort to create something entertaining, and the rest of the story is pretty drezzed. So, the guy comes in to talk to him about a few friends who he knew he could't speak the same way he's spoken to. This is the point in the story where his friends find out he's the leader of a cult. And what happens when you ask him about it? Well, that's where the plot of the movie comes from. You'll just be surprised that it's so lame.   Okay, that is the first point. After that, you'll have to find yourself the rest.  What the hell was in this movie? Nothing about the people who are in the cult, the movie's plot, or the story itself. The only things that matter are a lot is the "I'm A Nazi!" sign that he showed when his friends ask him if he's really a Nazi. This movie starts out with the guy being very upset that they were having a religious ceremony for some time. He is trying to convince them to stop the religious ceremony, and they don't take the religious oath. Then he tells the girl that she will not allow him to come in and talk to her. He's then asking to try it out. But they don against it and he's going to keep coming to their house. He gets into the bathroom and he is ready to show her what is supposed to happen. So they start arguing with her.  He gets stuck in the bathroom with the girl, who is in a relationship with a boy. He throws a lot of papers at them. She and the boy start fighting, and he pushes his way into the boy.  The boy, whom she knows, comes and starts yelling and throwing things at her. But the girl doesn't want to fight him, and doesn't try to fight. He and his friends use her "Hail" as a distraction to keep the other boy from getting into his head and destroying her. What follows after she and the girl's "Horse" fight? It doesn't help to have a little kid who has a "Hire" tattoo and keeps you from dying of heat.  "I am a Nazi" then becomes a joke about the idea that people are going to the funeral and find themselves killed by the Jews. The way the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really not surprised that this movie got only 1 rating. This movie was so bad that if I rated it, I would be surprised. The plot is pretty basic, and it should have been directed by a person with an idea of how to make a film. But the acting is really bad, the music is awful and the soundtrack was bad as well. I don't know why this film was released in 1989, but I can guess why. It seems to be the worst of the films made in Europe. The main character in this movie seems to have been a man who could, and probably has, good sense and morals. He would never hurt the girl in the movie, and he seemed to be in love with a girl in a movie who was so stupid that he tried to hit her for her car. In the meantime, it seems that he's getting so depressed that he thinks he's about to run into his ex-girlfriend, and thus he's no longer able to care about his ex. It also seems that she's not in love anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's always been a bad feeling, and there's still is. This movie was a complete disaster, although it was quite good when it first aired. It had a few elements that were good, and a lot that were bad. Some of the material was okay, but some of the jokes were stupid. And some of those jokes were very stupid. I've never seen a movie like this, it's just disappointing.  There are a few funny bits, but the rest of the movie is completely unbelievable, and I really don't understand the premise. I also had an interest in the characters, not so much, but just the movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of time and energy. The movie contains only the three-minute 'camee' scene that makes this movie an embarrassing mistake. The rest of the movie is boring and uninteresting.  I am very disappointed with this movie, but, like all other movies, it's a good movie just in a different direction and with a worse plot. I guess it's time to start paying attention to this movie. There were few other films that have so much stupidity, and I'm sick of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the end of the movie I knew how horrible the movie was. The characters were unbelievable, the way it was structured and there wasn't much room for a decent acting career. The dialog was pretty poor, the direction was flat and the acting was too bad. The soundtrack was mediocre too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the theatre in the late 60's for "The House Of The Living", and I could not believe the movie was anything but trash. As if it was a really bad film: a young man named "Parrinoy", who has to follow through the movie to "become a man" to make some sort of life out of it. What happened? What happened is that the guy named "Barney" became "a man" because he was supposed to be a big bad guy! The way he portrayed himself in the film was so bad. He was in a movie with a bunch of idiots; a young girl named "Nayvada" who has some major flaw in her eyes - that she should be a stripper and would dance and dance. The idea that they were "all" dancing, and that she is in a situation in the life to be like "all", is completely ridiculous, if you can't believe me.   ParrinOY goes on and beats the guy that he meets with to get a job in the movie. Parr is always at a stage that has the highest degree of drama; it is the stage of "Killing". The stage where the man he meets in the first act is in the stage where his family is murdered. He tries to make the whole family kill each other member. The first part of the movie is where Parrinnoy tells a little boy named "Billy" to get his job because he wants to see his father and his stepfather.  Once in the real world, Parr comes home to meet his family. He says that if he loses the job, his family will kill him. PARRINOY shows no interest in his "family" even though he is in their living room; he is so convinced that if they get killed, they will all kill each one of them. He starts shooting them on the wall and kills them, but the movie has to contain something that actually makes them look guilty. So that happens. There is no reason for a young boy to kill his own family; he has an obligation to kill those who have just finished their job for the sake of the viewer; he must kill them. What happens when he is at the stage that he is supposed to have his family dead, the family is in fact dead. A couple of them decide to hide in the bedroom to save their lives, but Parrino goes on a killing spree with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have really had to hate this movie. I think it has no redeeming value to anybody. There is no value whatsoever to the storyline. It is nothing like the first "The Matrix" movie. That movie's plot is so contrived that it's impossible to follow. In the first movie, it was obvious that there was going to be an "X mark". In the second movie, there was only an X mark, so it was clear what the "X is" to get an "E". Even in the third movie, the X was only X. So why is it so bad in this movie? I think the whole idea is that you are not a robot. If the movie is about, you are a robot, a robot of science.  I think that the plot is supposed to be about a team of robots and they are working on a mission to build a robot to battle another team of robot warriors on a planet called "Galaxy". The movie was so bad that it was actually made before this movie was released. When the movie was being shown at a movie convention, they called it "The Robots", which is why it was so disastrous to everyone, even the film industry!  There is nothing good about this movie, except for the fact that it is actually pretty funny. This is not a movie, and it's not a bad film, but it should never be shown on DVD, or any other form of entertainment. It's just pointless and pathetic. I would not recommend it for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, along with "American Death Machine" and "Stalker", is bad on every level. But, it should be for the movie to be, and so are some of the cast in the other movies. We don't get any sort of "Ableter" for this one, which is a mistake. This is a movie that leaves nothing behind it. And the people involved in it didn't do any good in it.  The only reason I was put in the title was because I'm a good actor, and the movie was a waste of time. I didn't like it, and I didn be sad, but it was pretty boring. I don't even know if it had a decent story behind it, or if it was even a good movie. It is a pity that I made the movie, because it's so bad. And it should have been made before the idea came out. I can see why people who liked it liked it. People have given it too low a rating, and that would never stop them. It was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An insult to the American community, a shameless display that only served to increase my anger. This movie never could have been better. It's just sad to see the name "Bunk" in a movie is so offensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of fun in this movie, but it really doesn't work.  Even though it looks like it's a sequel, I was very skeptical. And I think that the characters were OK, but the film's plot and story just seemed to fall below the standards of a film.  It's definitely not a comedy, and it's not a good movie for people to watch.  There are some funny moments, but in the end, the characters felt really uncomfortable.  They were acting with one set of a blank face.  Also, what did they think of the whole thing?  I don't think they were really in the film for any reason.   The film ended up being one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, ever. I gave it a 2/4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had nothing positive to say about this movie. I don't get it. It's not a comedy. It isn't funny. It is way too long.  It has a very bad acting.  I give it one bad rating. It makes a bad impression to a person who has never seen this movie and isn't willing to see this movie now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been looking at a few good reviews and saw the comments on the other one which said it was good. I couldn't help but think it might have been. It was simply a bad story, and not well, even by the reviewers who said it is excellent. I give this a low rating because I gave it one star because it was a bit predictable and pretty predictable. Also, it had a lot of bad lines, which are bad on the part of the actors and the direction, but that's all in the movie. If you enjoy a good thriller, check this movie out, but beware of the bad parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does have some good elements, but overall I'm not impressed. It is an odd choice to put in this movie as it is a fairly obvious attempt to add to the Disney canon. They tried to tie this off with some bits of real life to give it a sense of realism and plot. But you know what? They never did in the books and the Disney films never let it off. It just seemed like an excuse to put this in there because Disney is apparently one of the most brilliant producers in the history of movies. The writing is bad, the characters are flat, the acting is bad (a lot of actors were good in the book, though a few were bad) and the soundtrack is totally pointless. But I thought I was coming to the end of this film when it was just a couple of weeks old, so I guess you can just put it in the trash and move on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a die-hard Hollywood guy, and this movie wasn't good for me. (On the first night, I saw the opening and the ending on DVD, and both of those are terrible, but I don't think anyone wants to watch this one anyway.) I really didn't want to see it. If you do, you will probably lose a few months of your life.  It is an insult to all the great cinematic movies of the past. But I was only interested in making it so I could get my mind into its proper shape, and just like some bad movie, it is too bad to be good. The film is so bad, that even though it contains a story of a movie, the story and acting aren't all there. And when you see the film, you realize that it is just an endless set of clichés, like the ending of "Seven Days Before Christmas" or even the ending after "Seven Lives," when you realize it is a film so badly written that it never has any purpose. It is just boring, and I feel that this movie is even worse than the "Sleights" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first heard of this movie when it had been re-titled and released on October 30th. It was a very slow film with poor dialog. The acting was so poor that I didn't even care for the dialog.  The film was so slow and bad that I laughed at the film when it was released and then rated up. The rating was 1/10, which I rated it as 1. It's even worse than the original "Cannon's Return" (which I rated an 8/10), and those were two-hundredths of one.   This movie is just plain bad and a bad choice for a children's film. Even worse than Cannon's Return! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing movie I've seen in ages. I'd be interested to know what the people that make this film have to be. I know it has several funny endings, but I don't know who they are or what they do with it. It is absolutely terrible. I was surprised at the ending. I have to give it one of five points. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad in every respect. But what is worse than it is? In this movie, the girls are the same when they first meet, the boys are all the same, the same in their lives, and the girls always go back to their dorm. When they meet in their dorm, they don't talk with each other, they just talk with other guys. And the boys in the film do something completely wrong, such as acting with respect. That's the saddest thing about this movie. When the girls get to their room, the guys try and scare them. The girls try and fight them, they try and kill each other. But not even one of the guys stands up and says something to the girls. And that's the last point in this movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film and have decided to watch it so I would be shocked if I were one of the people who thought this movie was good. It is a complete disaster and completely lacking in all facets. The best part of it is that the film's main point of view is to be about a woman in a bad, lonely situation that she gets in with her friends in the movie but she is lonely with them and they do not take the time to help her. And then a couple of other strangers get in with them but do not help her and then she leaves her with them after a few days and then the guy that was in her life finally comes to her and gets her into his arms and is there to have sex with her and is happy about it. I don't see any of this movie in any way, not even in a positive way. The story is so boring. Even worse than the horrible, yet-to-this-day-movie "Giant Joe". If you were a person that wanted to see this movie because your friend in "G giant Joe" was just a few minutes away, you would be totally disappointed. That's why "G Giant Joe" has not only become a cult film but a real bad movie. You will find out why you're not a good person in the world and why you are not a bad person after watching this movie, not only because your friends are doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really annoyed by this movie, it's not funny enough, it seemed like something was going to happen, i was so annoyed, it made me so sad. When it was released I was in shock, really shocked, they said the movie was the same way every other movie was, this movie didn't even have the name of the guy, its name was "Dude",  The only good thing about it is the ending, when he jumps off of the roof of a building in a cliff and goes in a free fall to the valley. That was pretty good. Unfortunately, the end is so bad and so stupid, you don't really have to like it, it just goes in at the end.  The next thing I noticed is that there are a lot of flashbacks about the movie, including flashbacks about how it all happened. But there are no plot about these flashbacks. It just repeats. It should be in some form of a flashback movie, like a season, like an old movie about a new guy going through his life, where you know when it is, when it's going to be, where the next thing is. That doesn't happen in this movie.  This movie really has two guys who are just trying to look tough, who are really getting caught in their own struggles, just to get a job, because they cannot even work in the real world anymore. I just think there needs to be a break, or the movie should have a break. If you want to really find the movie a funny movie, try something else, the real-life plot of "Punchman" should do much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had nothing good to say about this movie. I mean, seriously, it's so bad. I'm not sure how you could even recommend this to anyone. There are no character development whatsoever, the acting is so bad, the plot isn't even a plot. The acting is stupid, even the acting doesn't seem to be a bit better. The cinematography is the only redeeming feature. I suppose that's the point of this movie, that it's only bad to people.  I'd have to say this: don't buy it unless you really like acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film, which was supposed to be a great film, is only mediocre in comparison. There is a decent plot, but nothing to care for, and it is really a mess. There are also lots of inconsistencies throughout the film, and the sound and video-effects are terrible. The fact that this movie has so many flaws is because the director didn't bother with any of the above. The director and the casting (who did really good) have simply chosen to make this a terrible film! The film is very short, and there is no plot whatsoever. I recommend a more serious and original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like they're trying to find a bad video: a sad, almost-only-if-they-want-it-for-a-couple-of-eight films. The plot is as boring as the first film. The ending leaves you feeling sick.  All in all, it's about the actors and the music that doesn't make the movie seem even more depressing. It's so bad that I can't recommend it.  I would avoid it, but it was at least better than my first "The Osteria", which I rated a 7. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I cannot believe this film has done a complete failure as a whole.  This film is simply the worst film I have ever seen!  The first thing I noticed was the lack of facial movement. There was no facial movement in the first scenes. I tried my hardest to find something else to watch, but I couldn't. I then found something out that had some facial movement, so I continued watching.  It was absolutely not worth watching because I would have been better off watching an action film like this one. This film had the look of being a piece of junk, so don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a man who wants to get his girlfriend (that's a girl) and gets his car stolen in a parking lot with a bunch of drug dealers. The rest of the film is about him chasing this girl (that could be the girl) with all the speed, and I don't even want to think about why he would be involved in this in the slightest way. I'm a guy that's lost my job, let's say, and if it is my career I'd probably just end it.  The film starts with him talking to a drug dealer and having him meet "the lady". A few minutes later, he stops the drug dealer (who also wants to have sex with him).  The woman comes down to the parking lot and asks if the drug dealers want to meet them or what they want. She is going to meet him, of course, she says, "No I don'it". It doesn't matter though; that's what happens. The drug dealer, the drug distributor, and the man who stole the car from her (the drug dealer) don't know what the girl wants, but he doesn't want to fight over them. He doesn't even stop, apparently. The only good thing about this movie is that they get a few scenes of drug dealer getting involved with the police and trying to get the lady back together. It turns into a situation that seems like it could happen and the police officer gets shot on him.   I have nothing else to say about this bad movie. I give it an "E" if they want to try to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a bad and boring movie with a bad premise and I thought it could've been better than a movie about an actual movie. I thought the ending was okay and if you were looking for a film to watch, you might want to see this one. I did the one at the end. There was nothing in it after it.  There is no idea about the story being a true story of the movie.  It is supposed to be about a true love-and-hate relationship between a girl and a boy, but the movie doesn't even bother telling us that.  I don't know what was happening, but I just felt like the movie didn't do justice to the story and the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've seen all the best movies of my life, and this was one of them. I don't know what it's about. It is full of all kinds of crap. I can guess that it is some kind of cheap, but I just have to say, it was a bad film that could hardly stand up to the other 3. The actors (the only ones) that got the job were the ones who were good. The other 2, I found, but they didn't get the job.  One thing that annoyed me was how bad the acting was, and the fact that most of the actors were in terrible acting. My opinion of it is, most of them can't even get the low of good. This movie was a waste of time, and it's one of the worst of my experiences with any movie made or found or found.  The worst thing about this movie is that some of the main actors are very good, and others, such as the main lead actor was so bad they could not get the chance to work.  Overall, I think it was just bad, and not worth watching. It's not worth the time to sit, even if you want to see it, and isn't even worth a little effort. But if you're looking for a movie, for the price it does pay. I would not recommend it, but don't go to sleep out there if you don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was one hour and fifty minutes into it, and I still found it incredibly awful. It's just horrible. I mean, there are no real plot lines, characters, characters or anything. The whole thing is just... stupid, and there's no real ending. The movie is terrible, and it is so bad that it's actually a plot.  I could have laughed at the fact that I even managed to sit through the whole film and never found the end. I know how stupid I am for liking movies like this one. The only thing that makes me laugh is that there are so few people in this movie who actually seem to get along with the main characters. This is nothing but a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this one is a complete failure of all kinds. i really don't care how it's being labeled, but it does make a poor movie for anyone to watch. it really is the worst ever I've seen. i have watched it twice, I don't remember it being an enjoyable film. I'm not going to give it a 100 out of 10, it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very unsatisfying, boring, predictable, and there are few nice moments in it.  This is the worst remake I have ever seen.  The direction was very bad for some of the characters in the movie, not even though the cast is good and the acting is good. The acting is terrible and very bad, especially the old girl, who is supposed to be in a drama film, but she is really a stereotypical old slut. The scenes are not worth watching, even if you enjoy drama, because the actors do not try to make you feel anything, they just try to get you to laugh and cry.  Overall, I would advise this movie to watch it, if you are a drama fan, but if you just enjoy an old, cheesy movie, then you will not like it. Don't waste your time, or if you have never seen this movie before, don't waste it. It is a real waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have to look to the other shoe side of the movie before reading this review. It is really bad. Very dull and very predictable. No real story, no real plot, no good direction, nothing even a plot.  The film begins and ends with several very boring endings.  I think this movie is so bad it is a real shame that I am watching it so many times. What was the point of this movie, why it was made? Well it's just as bad.  It's just so bad that it should never be made again.  This movie really needs to be shown in theaters. Don't watch it. This is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible, it is stupid and it is not going to appeal to anyone but those who like to watch their pets get eaten by rats. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in rats. This movie fails as a film of interest to those who are interested in getting into a pet study study but this movie has no interest in doing that. It is not a good movie for anyone to rent because you don't have a pet!  The movie should have been free to rent and if a group of people to see it, should have to pay the rent to rent the movie. It's an awful way to waste money, this is not worth a movie of interest. There are only about 4 dogs, the movie is about animal control and the movie should obviously not be for this animal control study but that would mean there is no way in which the movie could be good. The movie is very bad, this movie is not even worth a viewing. What a movie about petting, why would you spend hours watching this movie? This is an awful animal behavior movie. The only thing I can recommend is not the film but if you have people interested in studying animal behavior this movie could become a good study for an animal behavior study class. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had one of the original "Dancing On," when I watched it, so I watched "Diving On:  This movie is so bad it is actually funny. It has an unbelievable amount of jokes and cheap laughs that you can't even hear them through a movie. I've seen it so many times that I can barely remember it. It looks like a series of video games where a little boy plays as his brother who is fighting with a black widow. There are no scenes where there are two women. Just a series where the woman is dead from a fire. I watched a bad version of "Dancers." It had a lot of the same problems, but the movie still wasn't as bad as "Dilling On," which is the reason the director was getting rich. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie for several days, and got interested in it. I was interested in a little while, and I thought it was interesting.  I have to say I think this movie was made to glorify some bad movie director and his crappy acting. I didn't like it because it was so bad. I had liked the previous ones of Jack Daniels and James Spader, the acting is excellent and the storyline is interesting, but it was too slow and confusing and stupid.  The whole thing was boring and the ending was very sad and I felt like I was an asshole for being watching this.   Overall, I am bored by the ending and the acting. This movie is not good for anyone who wants to see a movie for a long time, because the acting and acting are badly done. The ending is not even good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, that most of the characters in this film have some good lines and some interesting moments, but in general the script is not at all interesting and I find this to be one of the worst films I've seen of this year. This movie had some good dialogue between the two characters and I found myself caring little for the characters. But don't get me wrong, the characters are okay, the actors are okay but the plot just falls flat, and the story is totally incoherent. Overall, I recommend you skip this movie, but if you have some interest in one of these two, you might try it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember my first encounter with this movie was the video camera that made me think I was watching a film that was not properly filmed. Well, I suppose that this is true, and it does seem to be the case that it is not well edited and edited. But, I'm a sucker, so I don't give it credit for that. I mean, this movie isn't very good either. It's about a guy who dies, and the film keeps showing this guy in the middle of the movie. He has no interest in anyone and in the beginning of the film he meets a strange woman. What happens is the man is murdered, and then gets buried and the woman (the actress) finds him a grave, where he is eventually buried.  I don`t even know who the woman is, and there is no indication that he was killed in an actual cemetery.  In all, this is a pretty un-dramed film. I really don't understand the reasons why the film is made. I've had a couple of these films in my past, and this one just isn't one of them. This movie just has so much potential to be a piece of trash. As a viewer, you are expecting an interesting film, and if you are to be treated as a "piece of trash", you should be expecting something. The worst I can think of is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely awful, with bad acoustic bass in some of the music. It just has no rhythm and sounds of music, and when you're listening to music, you have to expect that a band plays the background song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to avoid any movie: watch this one. It's so bad that it should never have been made. What's wrong with the plot? A simple question: the first question. The second question? What was the reason of making this? Well, there was some interesting moments in the story, but it's still about 20 minutes long, and if you don't pay attention, it all becomes extremely bad. This movie is so bad it has a very small plot! The acting is bad, it looks very fake, there are no real personalities, and the story is a complete fabrication! Just watch it and realize what the hell is it, because if you watch it, you'll be bored! The fact that this movie is rated 7 out of 10, but that's also way too low for me. I don't even recommend it as a 4/10 means it's too bad, since it's not even a movie: it's just a simple thriller with no real plot to make anything special, but don't listen to it. It has an interesting premise, but you will probably find yourself bored by it, since most of the stories are recycled from the last two movies.  I don´t recommend watching this, except for the ending, which I thought was funny. But just watch the DVD and skip the final episode. If you´re only interested in horror, check it out, as they've got some good scenes that are good to watch, and that´s okay, but if you´hase the plot and do something else, beware. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a classic case of "The Movie-of-Death" type crap, with only a chance to be taken seriously.  The acting is bad, the story is bad and the cinematography is even worse. The only thing that makes this a more interesting film is the fact that the guy who kills his wife and family is a very good actor, as opposed to the one who murders a bunch of zombies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning, I was looking for something to watch to see, but I did not find this one. I guess I would have liked a film that had some real story but instead it had nothing to say. The story is so bad that it breaks my patience and that I could only watch it again. It's so boring that it's very hard to understand what the characters are about, and I have trouble finding a good place to start.  There's no plot, no storyline, and there are no really good actors to see. I could not recommend it to anyone, but it did give me an idea of how it would probably go. I would recommend you to try and get some good movie like the "Ivan Reek" or some of the others, but don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that can make this so bad is that the director was underwhelted by a very poor script and didn't really give the movie a full script. The dialogs are terrible and the acting is bad.  It's supposed to be a comedy, but it is nothing more than the jokes of the group.  The film is supposed to have a few funny moments, but those jokes are very poor and there are no decent laughs to be had. The director and his writer should be put in charge of the acting.  There is one character in the film that I truly believe should have been cut. There are some funny things in the movie but the characters don't act like a lot of the time, and it would have been more entertaining to see some of them in a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast list is terrible, I cannot believe how they chose to film the story of this movie. The plot, even by the cast members, wasn't realistic and it wasn't convincing, the story is not convincing or it's not even believable. The cinematography was bad, the acting was bad but it didn't have the strength to make it believable. I have come to believe that some of the actors don't have much knowledge of the real world or have any sense of drama.  I can have seen better, less cheesy and more believable movies than this. I think it would have made a better movie than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was not interesting for the first 2/3 quarters of my viewing time. I was really hoping to see the movie with some humor. I guess this is an example of a young man trying to prove his sanity, like the young boy who I saw at my high school promisements. And like those promisests, I have heard that they are very boring and not very funny. The film is so lame when it comes to comedy. I mean even though I know the director from Disney, he knows nothing about a comedy. This is not a comedy film. It's a sad film and I hope it's at least 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in 1993, and I'm very sorry I'm sitting in the theatre and can't take care of my eyes at all. It's bad! The plot is weak. The characters are awful, the dialogue is awful, and the dialog itself is not good. I watched two movies in that week's end, and decided to go ahead and finish the whole thing. I can never even watch any other movie for a long time and finish it. I'm sorry, and it's been awhile since I have seen this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's always been a problem in the series for the people who watch it for the series.  The plot is so bad it's just stupid. You'll never find out what it is about.  There are a few times you could have figured out and had them all in order. Also the first 20 minutes are stupid. But I'm glad they were good and even though I didn't know if they were for the next generation, it was obvious.  All in all, it's an incredibly bad series, it really hurts the viewer. I've stopped watching it and now I wish to see the next one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to like this movie more because I read some reviews from people saying this movie was interesting, but I didn't really agree. I didnno expect this movie to be good. I was disappointed by the very short length and boring acting and bad script. I had hoped that the characters would be better than the first part and the ending wasn't that depressing. Unfortunately, these characters don't matter. The actors don't give enough emotional meaning. It's not funny for the people who like it and don't want to find a funny movie.   The ending is predictable and just a small bit of bad comedy. They should have to fix this stuff. There is also a very poor version of the first parts.  This movie would be great if they had a better actor who could act better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it after seeing the reviews, and I was appalled. It is not a true sequel, it has two characters in the film. The only thing that made it special was that the characters were real and lived in the real world. The plot was very derivative of a series of films of the 1930's, but it was just that bad. I was surprised at how bad it was. A lot of other people have told me about the film, but I can't answer what it is about this movie, because I have nothing to say about it. I saw it on video and decided to listen to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie an rating of 1 out of 10 when I saw it on video. It's the worst movie I have ever seen. I was really expecting to find out a nice movie.  The story is predictable and predictable, there are no scenes that are interesting or even remotely funny. I have heard that some of the movies that made this list are not movies, but those who like these stories are usually able to take them anyway. Some of the films were also so bad that there were no one good film to describe it. Even the actor's name was not that interesting either.  This movie could have been a film about a really good movie. It was disappointing because it was so poor. I didn't have any interest in the story.  I'd give it a 7 out of ten for the worst film that I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie I was very disoriented, in all honesty. The main reason I was surprised was because I've never seen any good horror film with a strong narrative and story. I know there have been several great horror movies in the past decade, and so did my wife watch them all. But this is the worst I've ever seen. The whole story of the movie is so badly acted, the acting is so bad it hurts the viewer's brain. I think it has a very low budget. I tried to sit and watch this film for 3 hours. But, my wife thought it was about 10 minutes of a story and I couldn't convince her. I found it very frustrating. I gave my wife some credit for saying she loved it and said she enjoyed it. I'd rather spend the entire week in watching it and then never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i mean really, it's one of those movies that you'd just want to skip. This movie is so bad that I would recommend skipping it for the next year or maybe the next time you get your hands on it. I think this movie needs to be stopped and thrown away. There are a lot of other flaws that I don't even want to focus on, like the acting, the cinematography is poor and the sound of the music is awful. I'd have to sit here and write out all my review about how bad it was in my words.  but i do feel that it is somewhat amusing to be able to watch this movie if i could only find out where the movies were showing it was.  I hope this movie isn't too popular because it was so bad and that I get a chance to watch it again. I don´t think it has much life left in it. it's just a few minutes that a movie you could watch in 15 minutes. I do think that there's a very thin connection between movies like this and the one I have been watching since the year I was starting to study filmmaking in schools. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really annoyed with this movie. I don't understand why it was released. I guess it's just because the producer didn't want to let the movie to go. I've watched most of the films in this movie and had fun with the others, but this movie is just flat out awful. This film has a pretty obvious direction of line in the story. One person, after spending so much money, should definitely be killed. The acting was bad, the acting was not funny at all, and the characters were not interesting. I didn't enjoy any of the scenes the actors put in. The plot and dialogue were poor, and I didn"t know why anyone thought that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen it twice and its pretty obvious that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm so disappointed. I have so many other movies to enjoy better, but this is simply the worst. I'd like to see a sequel! But instead I get to watch the original one. The plot, as so, is completely pointless and the acting is terrible. It's not even a good movie. The acting is not good enough and the plot is not interesting. I think it would be better if you could sit through it without the movie having any good dialogue. This movie is one of the worst movies I've made. I've never seen a movie made in my life. There are better to see the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director/producer should have learned from the first couple of the films they made. I was surprised when it came out that the main plot line was actually two of the first films.  This movie fails because they did not create a clear story with some theme and twist.  I am willing to forgive the people who made it, but when it comes out, I wish the producer/director to do something with these two films. They cannot make it out of line, and I will not be thrilled to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a piece of "dramble" crap that should have never been made. The only saving quality is that it has a couple of pretty good scenes. I'm not sure the director thought it up to be funny. I think he just got bored with making a movie out of this. But the only funny scenes are the ones where the character was in the room when the movie was supposed to be filmed. I don't know if he has a lawyer or if he'd been fired or if it's really a coincidence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the movie is boring, and the characters are boring, but the plot is not bad and there are a lot of good scenes in the movie. The story is not good.  But there are two interesting things. The first is that this movie has all the characters being silly and acting stupid. I mean that one is not funny in any way, and this is pretty good, especially the scenes in this movie. And second of all, when this movie is in front of you, it never stops at moments where it is important that it is supposed to be a comedy, and it is not obvious that it happens.  The second is that it's just one side of a complicated plot. The movie is just a bunch of rubbish, and there is nothing interesting here.  This movie has absolutely no real drama. It is just about an attempt to get an all-power couple, in their search for enlightenment, to be in a good position for the world. There is absolutely no drama here, and no tension to the ending.  I think this movie should be called "The Worst Movie Ever". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this flick I was just horrified at the characters and their stupid accents. They were so stupid, the film seemed so corny. I laughed out loud in a movie where a black man played one of the four best characters. I guess the only redeeming thing in this film was the character, which I thought was funny. As usual I am really not impressed with the direction, but some of the jokes were interesting. One character got drunk so he became extremely funny; the others got drunk to a horrible extent. I felt like I was watching an insult from the other direction. It was also extremely disappointing because I saw the movie in preview, and then it would never be available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure you guys don't expect any praise for this movie, but this movie shows a complete lack of respect to the original cast. This movie would make even less fun than a full-length movie, in which a few actors in the original movies were OK. I'm surprised that one actor who dared to stand up to this cast was so brave. I can't really say who it was or who the cast is, because I don't really have any clue. The main reason why I give this movie a rating of 4 out of 10, because a number of other elements were either wrong or poorly developed, and the whole plot is so stupid that no one's acting could be understood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for my first year in college, and I was completely horrified at it. I remember my first encounter with this movie, it was on the video store and I saw it again when I got back. I didn't like it, I never saw it in school. When I was in college and got back, I was still afraid of it, and it scared me very bad. I can remember the ending of "Riding Pig" and the ending had me running for the first time, but this movie just put me in a funk and didn't make me happy and made me afraid.  It was one of those f - - -ing movies that made me think a little differently about how I thought about the movie and my friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So bad it is, but there are so many things to enjoy in this awful movie. The plot is pretty stupid, the acting is awful, and the dialog can go off like a bad gag. But it gets to the point where it's too confusing to be understood and predictable. There are not many laughs out of the movie, and I hope there is a good ending. The movie's ending is so bad that it makes you feel like laughing. In all honesty this movie has got nothing to do with the world, but if you had anything to do it would be very enjoyable. A really bad movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is bad. It is very shallow and uninteresting, but there is something I enjoyed in the movie. It has some nice moments. The story is a little bit predictable, and the ending is pretty pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you really enjoy action, or a certain kind of action, then you will love this movie: as you know, this movie is a disaster. Every actor who has done any action in his career will be in this movie. Every acting genre that has been made has been done, but that one (for the sake of its story, at least) isn't one of the best. I have only one word of advice. Stay away from it, or even watch it without the box-style trailers. It's bad on every level. The acting is bad as well, and the dialog is really bad, but the whole thing is just a glorified pile of rubbish. I can't say that this is a bad film. But, for those of us that love it, even in a small number, you might just be entertained. In fact, you probably won't be entertained, but instead of watching it, you'll feel like a fool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You really need to be the one that thinks movies are bad. I'd go to the nearest movie: I'd walk away from the one with the best acting and see a movie with a plot.  Even if you have a good plot, you need to expect more than that. The story is boring and unbelievable and there are no real characters.  There are many people who actually have the decency to be in these movies.  It is also a pity for all the people who want to see movies. Please stop watching these movies and focus on movies like The Incredible Bitterly Girl which is a movie that has excellent acting but a low budget.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie since I was 8. As a teenager who was a kid at the time, this movie could be good. But after being 17, it just didn't seem to work. The movie is so bad that I almost laughed when I was looking at it.  I think that is an unfair comparison because this movie is really just a really bad sequel to the original. The reason why was this film not successful was because the people who made this movie were the same people who were in the first movie.  The plot was a really weak excuse to a movie. I would definitely recommend watching this only for the fact that it was in a "younger" movie and not as good as the original version, but it was just a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand the reasons why this movie has been made and it could be the worst movie I have ever seen. There's a lot of bad jokes that aren't funny, but a lot that are the same ones I used to laugh. I had one great idea. I wanted to make it the same way as "Rip, Dip, Dip" from the movie. The first line that I remember is pretty stupid and has to be the same as "The Fresh Meat". The movie also uses the same acting techniques from that movie, except for a few seconds to fill the entire movie and the plot is very short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't recommend this movie. They should be renamed "The Wanker". It's only an entertainment film.  My expectations are for an American comedy, with a heavy concentration of nudity. However, I cannot expect that this movie will be good. I do not like porn. I think that this film would be good if it was a comedy, but I'm sure it's better than most movies.  I hope this movie gets a decent run in the U.S. or at least in Europe. It seems like a piece of garbage, even in its version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed at the end. I had never understood what a film could be and so I was curious. I was expecting the film to be something interesting, but unfortunately I was so disappointed that I didn't even care. I think it was one of the worst things I have seen since, the plot was the weakest thing I can remember.  I don't know why it was so bad. I thought the writer was good, but I think the story was awful.  Even if I saw this film in my first high school movie school, I wouldn't say it was "better". I don-did love it because I liked the original movie, but the sequel has a lot of bad things in it, just bad, horrible things. I didn-did like the original film, because it had a lot to offer, but there is no way I could compare it.  It is no longer a film, but it's still just a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was one of the worst of all time made before "The Force" series. The only good thing in the "Force" series is that it was a sequel and it has a sequel. This sequel is even worse. It is no longer a sequel, it has only a sequel with no sequel(unless they are in the same room) so a sequel is not enough. Even the title says "Force". "Force 2" was a good sequel that was better than the original. "Force 3" is an awful sequel that lacks good elements. There is no real plot, no story, no good ending, no real ending and the lead actor is a loser.  If you like "Force", the sequel will be for a really bad movie, the sequel is an interesting horror/thriller and will never be a sequel to the original series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mother told me that the movie was not well written and was a bit too hard to follow. I had to sit and watch it in the theater. I was a little scared. And even if the "real" film is not as bad as the ones we have seen from the last time it is still a lot to watch, it is just the same in every way as the original one. Just the same, with better story lines, better characters and better actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A young actress attempts to "move ahead" her career in a bad way. I would like to compare this movie to some of the worst movies ever made. In the video that is very predictable and very slow. The acting was the worst part of the movie. I really liked some of those like this one, they were entertaining but if you didn't like that, you would be dead before they hit a great mark. You know that young actors like to try to act like their own children and that you don't have to be "a child". This movie also fails to make you understand how a story ends, how it's done. It's really just bad. And this movie fails to be funny, it's just funny. If you like this movie, don't watch it. It is just bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie started with an almost un-filmable plot and, despite a decent cast and some fine casting, the movie ends on an odd line.  I was so excited to see this movie because it was in the old days and I was curious to see if it would become an actual plot. Unfortunately, it did not work.  The only thing that was interesting was that it was very low budget and I couldn't find out which movie it was.   There was also no good ending for the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete rip-off of the Disney musical. The only thing that worked was the special effect of Jack, as a ghost. This movie didn't have any real musical themes and the story never goes anywhere.  The acting is bad, and the storyline is even worse. The point of the movie is that Jack is trying to get in a fight with the demon of fire. That's not enough to justify it, and Jack is only as far as his best friend. He is a ghost, and he's a demon, and even he is a demon. If you're interested in seeing the origin of the film, see Jack's own book instead of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem is, that's one part of the movie and another part of it. The first part was a series of scenes that would have made the movie work. The other parts were just plain bad. The most frustrating aspect of this movie is the premise of the relationship between the woman who gets her boyfriend and who wants to get her boyfriend, who she's married to. And it's sad to see that they're just so distant and nothing really matters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the problem, but I'm skeptical how this movie came out. There are some fairly good parts in it, especially the acting and the setting. I just wish the movie was to be put together more effectively. It's just a bad version of a bad, long-running action movie. Also, I don't think it was funny. I mean, it's just plain boring. There's not really any real comedy. I'm not saying it was great, but just boring, with nothing funny. The plot is about the same kind as the film's made by the writer of the original film. Also the script was pretty good. There was no funny lines in it. The movie is only one or two jokes, and not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have only watched this once and I did not even know why it was made. I thought I was going to see some pretty good scenes. I didn't find a sense of humor in this. I had to agree with the people who said they liked it, because there's no funny, even mildly funny scenes in this one.  It's not even funny. I was surprised how hard it was to watch it because I expected something to be funny.  My brother was going nuts, but he really should have known this was bad. It's like a bad sitcom. It has a really poor, self-important, and self-centered production values. It is so bad that it makes me sad. It isn't even funny! I don't care what happens, I just want to go away from this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i just spent the entire movie waiting to hear the end of the film. it's all too dull. i would have liked to have seen some more of these characters and their motivations and their characters. it was kinda disappointing.  It is really the worst movie of any ever made since i can not recall a movie that has this much talent for its own sake. you don't get anything out of it but you will see more and less.  I have to say, i really liked this movie because it was really interesting to see. i guess its just another of the many pointless films of the past. But i don't really like it anymore, as it was rather pretentious and stupid and pointless. this movie should not have been made at the time of the movie. It's not worth a chance to say that this movie was bad, but its definitely bad. It sucked in the end for me. i really didn't like the movie in the sense that the film was interesting, but that is why it was so boring and made so dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was very bad. I had seen this film before and wondered if this was a true story. There is only one good thing. There are some of the most interesting (inherently bad) jokes in this movie. But I will give you some of those. I will let my words after the movie below to make the movie look interesting.  There is not even one decent scene. There were some of some of them funny.  The plot is very weak and there is no plot. The story is so bad that it becomes funny at least once.  I do not understand why this movie was released and why this was written. I just don't want to go and watch it. I want to see my best friend and sister enjoy it and get the feeling of guilt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. The script is so bad and predictable that it's hard to follow. It fails to capture the essence of the relationship and really lets the viewer to believe that what they are observing is, and not a real relationship. This was a poor adaptation of the book and I think it's just disappointing. There are some good moments, like the ending (and the ending is awesome) but there are no laughs. And I think the actor's performance has been done very poorly. A movie that really is a complete waste of time and effort. I give this a second rating because I really liked it, it was a good movie, but really, this movie just failed to do anything right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just horrible, I cannot even get on the first day of watching it. There is too much to go to in this movie. For me it is very annoying and I do not like it. My brother, on the other hand, was very much enjoying it so we agreed to watch it in order to see the end. I didn't like it for the sake of family and friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand where this went from either. I've had a very long time now after my review of it. I read a lot of blogs. Some of the comments are pretty good. But I don`t like the way that some people have to be in the situation in the film because it is not interesting enough to not be interesting. And I would rather read some reviews that give more information.  I feel like a film which would be completely ruined from the point of a simple review and is also boring and uninteresting to the point that I was reading it when it comes out. But that is not a true critique. I have never really thought about the movie because I didn`t have any thoughts and did not want to. It was boring and I felt like I was watching an old film which has just been put out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the biggest fan of this movie and I knew the characters had potential, but that was the main reason why I was spending all of my time watching it, as the acting and dialogue was so bad. I'm in the middle of an entire movie just trying to get out of it, and I want to get the DVD so I can finish it. I'd like to see a new one of them or something that can be actually good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to start any arguments to talk about this movie. I'd like to say it was terrible for other reasons, but that's the only thing that's in this movie that matters. This is an action movie in the name of a parody. I don't even care to see this for anything else, it's just the bad kind of action that this movie has to offer. It just seems so out of control to me that it could just be a bad film in general, and this film has no worth, for it doesn't really have anything to do except make a negative movie about it's terrible premise. It also doesn't help that they just re-order this movie, it should have a better ending than the original ending. If this had made it, I would have liked to have seen the original one, but at the very least I would want something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a movie to watch and I liked a couple of things from that.  The movie is so bad, it is hard to find good spots to watch. I am sure if you had seen anything from the 1990's or maybe even from the 90's that would have made it good. This is the worst thing I have ever seen in movies. I mean even the name of the movie, "The Legend of Frankenstein" is an interesting name. They just have a different name for this movie. They call it Frankenstein 2 or 4, I have seen the title of the story, the "Legend of Frankenstein", but the name doesn't matter, it just sounds ridiculous. The cast is the same as the original.  I am a veteran fan of "Horses" but if they did this they would be done. The director of "The Monster of the Island", the first one was a great director, and most of the "The Monsters of the Lost Earth" movies are made better than "HORSES".  I just don't want to see a movie that makes you feel like a child, where you cannot act like a kid, where a kid cannot act, where everything is stupid and pointless. There is also no good dialog. The plot is stupid. I like a good movie to be honest. I just want a movie with good dialog, but when I look at it, I can only see the bad parts of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie as an example of "I'm tired of this rubbish crap" (a bad movie, I'm tired in this crap). I have to admit that I think this movie was good but poor.  I really didn't care much for this movie. I just wanted to say that I wasn't tired of it and that it wasn't a complete mess. That's not too positive. This movie is just a very, very bad effort. I don't really care for it, but I can imagine the director had some ideas to come up with it, and it really needs to get its act together, otherwise it'll be a big, fat mistake. The movie is so bad I think it needs to be shown in video format. I've never seen this movie, but if I had been bored and had a short-time to do I would really be interested.  What a waste of $5.00 out of my time. And I think I'll get sick soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was supposed to be better than the other two, and it wasn't. The storyline is terrible, the acting isn't good, the direction is bad, and there's not even one good acting performance out there. The ending is the worst, and the acting in the entire movie is bad. Even though the movie had an interesting story and some good acting, it's not good in the end. So I think it needs to be cut off from this whole movie. It just doesn't work, it really sucks, it just doesnno make any sense whatsoever. I'm giving this movie a 10 rating, and I just think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why people put this movie in their list of Top 10 Worst Horror movies. If people like the first two Nightmare movies then why the second one? They're bad in the beginning and really bad in a sequel. The plot is bad but the scenes of the other characters is good. The music is bad. There are some decent songs but the songs are terrible. I donno love these guys.  All I need to do is watch it and then try to stop it. I think it is a waste of my time watching. I didn't like the movie but it is so bad that I think I should give it more money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care if you find the plot interesting or not but i do care if people would really appreciate a movie like this one. It is extremely bad. It's just not fun and if you actually try to follow it you might actually lose all of your respect.  I can understand some of the premise of this movie. I donít really understand why people would actually enjoy it and this movie seems like it was made in place where nobody can really find out what it is and what the intentions are.  The thing is that this movie doesn't take any of the seriousness of this genre and puts a childish, childish, and stupid attitude on this film. It really should have been in the middle of an otherwise good, and interesting documentary, and not in the same way that movies like this get around. It just doesn't work. It isn't a comedy, it's just really sad, and it is also just plain sad. I really just find this movie awful, and I hope that someone goes through it and finds it amusing. I hope they never watch this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was stunned at the stupidity of this movie. It is an absolute joke that a major Hollywood actor could so easily produce a film to that level. The movie is full of the same kinds of clichés as the original 'Star Wars movies' and it is no surprise that Hollywood is trying to make it even worse.  The plot is so bad that it's hard to follow. Most of the characters are not as competent as the first 'Star Trek' series. I am a big fan of the previous 'Star Troopers'. But this 'Star Defense' movie just makes me look stupid. I don't know what the hell this movie is about but I think it's a gross mockery of 'Star Control' which used the same basic genre as the previous one. And it is not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem here is that director is so bad at it that he can be seen in any of his films. As an example, he makes the most of the 3 movies of The Dark Horse and then proceeds to make the movie in The Light, The Black Horse. As a result, he's probably seen more than 10 movies since.  And, as a result of this, I cannot see myself actually getting any enjoyment out of any of the movies he has put out. The film starts out with some promising dialog and ideas and is filled with a complete lack of basic action-flow. I suppose it's necessary to try and be so bored with these films as I get tired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In case you are still dying to see this sequel, it would be a good time to revisit the original (see the original is still great) or at least get the DVD and watch some of the original "Twister" (where the original one is a bit better). But in spite of my love of the first one, this sequel has the worst title I've seen since the original sequel. While I found it interesting that it is still very interesting to see what the sequel looks like, I still think that the new trailer doesn't convey what it was intended to be.  I'm not sure if this is what the "Twoster" was supposed to be, but I think that if you look at it, you'll find that it looks pretty creepy and creepy.  The original sequel is still pretty good, I just wish it could go a lot better. If you are one that likes both sequels, I recommend skipping this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very predictable, and the ending is a little too cheesy to be believed. The best way to get the acting scene in this movie is to watch the whole thing in the TV show, with a great idea that the whole town would all know about the plot and would be watching it when they would be bored. That's not the kind of story to be found in a "true" film, but a crappy one that was meant to appeal to the gullible, naive audiences. The main question is the writer's intentions and whether they are just going through the process, or whether they're really trying to make a film. If they are actually making a film, it is disappointing. I give this movie a negative rating because the story is not only bad, but there are flaws in it as well. The ending is very disappointing, and doesn't take the viewer into the story as a person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find this movie any more bad than I think I saw the first time I saw it on the internet. It was so bad that it was the only one of the first films I bought off. I also laughed out loud at the last minute when I heard a song about how it was all f**gots. A bunch of people that seemed to think that there was a film at all about the show. You can tell by looking at the actors and the way that the plot is going that there isn't any idea about how this film is supposed to be about a movie about a film about a game about a video game. The story is simply about a bunch of "wack job" guys who got hired to go to work at a video shop called "The Games that Made Us Famous", who were working in the game business to earn the money that they used to make their life a living off, and got involved in getting "wah" over the "real game". I mean, that's what happened, but the fact that they were doing it shows that it wasn't about how they were going to be at it. It's just about how the video shop owner thought they were playing it.   There was about a scene with a bunch people playing games with the games they were using. One guy was smoking crack. That didn't mean anything. In the movie, there were also scenes with these same guys doing things with the "wagh" and smoking crack because they didn't want to smoke crack. I guess the idea that is playing to "wawah" people was the idea of not having the people involved in the scene. Some of the scenes in the video show some of them trying to get into a fight, but I think that it would just be another way to distract from the main goal of "being there and making sure that everybody has their lives." It's almost impossible to see where people are involved in this plot. It seems that these guys weren't even involved in all the scenes and were just trying to show how the drug dealers were doing something.  I'm hoping that this movie won't become any more popular. It does have some interesting plot points though. But most of the "plot" is just the fact of a bunch acting with other characters. A guy who plays as "Grim" character does a lot of cool things, and a guy who looks as his mother is also pretty cool. A lot of times
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when it came out for Christmas. I can understand some of the things I thought the movie was, but I'm not one for movies that get you thrown off-balance. The characters are just too flat and they don't have anything to do. There's nothing to be surprised from the story line. There is little to no backstory, but some of them are good. The dialogue is too long and there's no punch. This movie is nothing but an episode of one of a lot of poorly written jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie when I was looking for a good movie that had a decent script. I have seen the script and thought it was terrible. It should have been an overridged version of the book, for a book about a horror film, in the end. I'm sure that the people involved with this movie were very stupid and cruel. I can't understand why a movie that has to start out in a story with a female protagonist being so obviously naive about human relationships. It was terrible, and didn't work for me. I wanted to see something good, and I had to endure the whole movie. I was so ashamed I had seen this movie. It wasn't even funny, considering it's about the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. It's a very bad movie. The acting was terrible and the story is bad. The ending had to be the darkest version of a movie I've seen. A bad movie for a bad film, that will be remembered for this awful movie.  I don't care how serious it is in the book and how bad it is to the characters, since I read it on my own and the characters are good. But, if it was a good, it would have been a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to find this movie so poor. Even the director was nice, and the sound track was very irritating. This movie really had a weird feeling of being a film in bad.  It's just so bad, and even worse when it's only half and half-assigned to a guy, and I think the director has a totally obvious sense of himself and not necessarily cared much for what he was doing. I can't tell if he's an aspiring actress or not. And the film doesn't even make a complete effort to be funny, not to mention with good jokes or jokes or even to actually funny. But it doesn't matter. He's making it look like a "joke".  If you want a chuckle, check the box. I haven't seen any of his movies.   Overall, this movie is just a slap in the face of everyone else, and it doesn nothing to say that it has any value whatsoever. And that's a big problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this film was directed by a teenager with an attitude and nothing to do. If I had watched this film when it was released in the late 1990s, I would have laughed. This film was not quite the worst I've seen in the history of American independent film. The film did have a decent story line, though that wasn't enough to keep me from turning the screws on the film.  There were some decent performances.  The plot was nothing too exciting, though the character acting was average, not spectacular. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movie I have seen. In the beginning I thought that it was an entertaining film. I had a good time and it was one of my least favorite films of my life. Then I saw it again when I stopped. It's not worth talking about. Don't waste time on it, even if you want to get some laughs out of it. The fact that this movie is so bad was that the ending is stupid. I'm sorry, I watched it again and the ending made me think that I was watching a bad sequel. That's not a lie, the ending actually is kinda hilarious. However, there is one good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read quite a few reviews that have mentioned a very negative review. I have also read reviews that state this is a complete lack of any suspense, plot, or really any idea of what it actually is. It's absolutely unoriginal, and I have absolutely no idea what it is. No one has ever seen this in an animation form, and they're just watching it to laugh, like a joke, not even really to go along with a story line. Some reviewers say it has good potential, but there's a lot of bad ideas in its story, and the story is a very flat, and predictable, and it really makes no sense. Some people say it's like a fantasy game. Some say it doesn't really work out like a movie. Some like the fact that it's a movie is actually much better than a movie, and some like the story's a real life, but that's what they're saying.  As I understand, I can't recommend this movie to anyone. It does nothing for me and I'm glad to only have seen it for the first time. I'd recommend it to anyone who have a problem with the movie: it's very un-forgiving and has zero sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I watched this movie was because it reminded me of an awful movie. I mean the acting was atrocious and the dialog was awful. I couldn't get out of it. It's not funny, it's a waste of time to watch. I'm going to be off my nose by watching this movie. And the dialog too bad for it to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen, it's absolutely awful. In this film, a man kills three people in a row and a bunch of fake dogs starts walking around on a bridge, and a little boy with a puppy starts to chase a kid with a leash. When the kid is hit by a car, you have to see it in slow motion, and then get mad because the kid starts chasing the dog! It's stupid! You don't even need to see this movie to know that it was a complete bad movie. I'm not saying that the kid with the leash is cool, but why should you care? This is a dumb movie that would never go to an Academy Awards. It would take an even worse title in the world to be in an academy award. I didn't know if I'd ever seen the sequel to this film before my life was over. I was very upset when I found out that I had to wait on a DVD and get a copy of it. I only ended up purchasing the DVD and I was so sad that I couldn't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just had to watch this because I was having a particularly awful review about it, but now that's not my opinion, it's really your own. It's really an awful film that is completely predictable and it completely disappoints the viewer.  It was supposed to be a satire but it really wasn't. The story starts by mentioning the fact that all this shit is really fake news and then I just have to be reminded that we do know it's fake news. Then it has to be about a drug that will be made by the president of the company that owns it. This means that all of the characters are real because it is fake news, which makes me even less excited to watch it, even though the characters have nice names and decent names, and this movie is actually a bad film!  The film is just plain boring. I actually had to take the whole thing out of my pocket. I kept on one hand because it would have been a lot easier than it was to find out who the other members of the movie were. There's an awful lot of stuff in the movie but don't really care for it, and the ending is so lame!  I am sorry, but I'm not a huge TV-show fan of "The One True Man" since I've seen it on HBO, and my rating here is based on my liking of the TV show. Still, this is a bad, stupid, terrible film that could never be a comedy, and doesn't really take itself seriously either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first movie for the very few minutes of it. I had been a little skeptical about how bad it was. I still watched it because I thought it was entertaining, but I was hoping for the better version of the movie to be. I really wasn't surprised by it.  I'm not sure why, but it was a weak and unimaginative horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was once one of my favorite movies, now it's in the toilet. I can't even make sense of it. I think it's just a poor attempt to take the whole point of the movie. There's too much bad acting and too stupid. There aren't any jokes, there aren't good acting either, and the entire thing is just a big pile of bunnies that nobody wants to watch. I really enjoyed the movie, but the way it is being interpreted, it is just another piece of crap. Some people like that kind of action and it works okay, but this movie was just plain bad, bad, terrible, horrible, awful, awful. You have to pay attention to the music in the film because it's OK, and it doesn't matter when a bad scene is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be the best movie on this DVD. Unfortunately, it wasn't. There were no good movies in the series. This show could be excellent at times, but there's not one good movie in this series. I don't know why they would have made this one.  I really liked "Couching Two Cents" on the first DVD. I really thought this film was good. However, it had a couple of problems. This film had several issues in this world. The characters were not good. The special effects were bad. The story and characters were poor. The ending seemed totally unnecessary. I think this show could've been a funny movie. But it wasn´t. I highly doubt it will be. It sucked money out of me. I cannot see the end of the episode. I will not watch the show again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I've seen. The acting was not that good and the plot was not a mystery. This is no longer a mystery since I can't figure out what the hell it is. And I guess there's still not one plot in it. The only thing that remains here is the movie's ending. You don't want to know what happens next? OK, I'll go: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is full of garbage. The story is bad and the acting is bad. The girls are bad. Don't waste your time here because they are interesting and I think that's why you go on. Also, I can't find any decent girl to have anything nice to say. I don't understand why why you went to the movies. This is bad! I hope I can see some other movies with more exciting acting and characters. I just hope they can find a movie with a better plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm very sad that I wasted my precious time and money to see this movie. The movie was so bad, I'm sad that it made me really sick. And I was not able to sleep or take care of myself as I could with the wonderful cast and crew that created this one. I'm not going to waste any money anymore. I just didn't want to waste my time watching this movie and I had to take care with my sleep.  The movie is so bad in my opinion, the script is terrible, the acting is poor, the story is bad, and the cinematography is bad. In addition, the camera was terrible, some of the sets are bad, the soundtrack was terrible...  Oh my, there is absolutely no redeeming point. I guess there is just one point, and it's "the point". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a huge disappointment. The first hour of the film was a nice, touching tale of what it is to be able to do in the world, yet the rest of it wasn't. And then the film proceeded as such. That's the biggest problem with the film, the story of the movie was so terrible it seemed that this is a real world but it could not be. It seems like that's a world with its own rules and there is no reason to stick to something else. But, when you get to what's truly happening in the movie, the message gets lost in the film. How can this guy go there? He tried to convince the police that the person was a child, and his wife didn't recognize that. How did it happen? What is in their minds?  The movie ends with a plot twist that starts to fall apart when the police finally arrive and get a look at what's going on. That doesn't seem to matter if the police is trying to prove that the child's wife's story was a fraud. Just because they are good people, it doesn't matter whether they're using a lot of fake news to keep the story going and the story is not important. What do they do? The police are obviously not sure.   But it does matter in the end. Because it's the most disappointing story of all the movies in the history of television, the police cannot come in contact with the child again, so the movie is over.  The end is pretty grim, though it is better than almost every other movie in the History Channel series. The ending is predictable, but the movie itself is much less depressing than any of the other movies. The end leaves you with a feeling of false optimism. There's a lot more potential here than there is in this. The police is definitely going to find a missing child and bring it to a clinic and interview its father about. They might even buy the girl a medical examination to see if the child is really alive. How hard would it be to do that? I'm a real life-cycle fan and, if a kid is not alive, it would be extremely depressing to see them alive and care for them. There would be something funny if that's what the doctor saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really disappointed with the poor effort of this movie. The acting and plot are completely over-exact and just plain bad. The cinematography is bad as well and that is the only reason why this movie is considered for the DVD and DVD-format.  The soundtrack is OK though and it sounds OK at times, but there are few music samples that really matter. It is just plain boring. The dialog is so bad that I would never even give this movie a 4 out 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie I was very confused. The movie is very fake. I thought the actor had to have made a copy of the movie so it was clear to see what he was doing with it. When he walked into the next room with his new neighbor, I thought he had to be in another movie. I had not seen a single movie he had ever seen before. I would like to see him watch some movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst ever. There is nothing in this movie that is worth watching. A woman is shown having sex with her friend in a movie. The movie starts to look better when it's in fact about a guy who is in prison and is getting out of prison. He gets out for parole and is put into the women's clothes (a bit odd at first) and he is able to go to the casino.  After he leaves the game, the women has sex with him. She doesn't go to prison with him and the woman goes from prison to the prison again. The next scene is him taking his wife for an afternoon and another afternoon he goes to the movie.  The next thing the women goes to is the casino where they smoke, smoke, and go to get drunk. The women is getting drunk, but she decides to stay sober.  As the woman does a last drink and walks out, the movie gets a lot of money. The woman walks in with a purse and the money gets in. There's a scene in a nightclub where the woman is dancing with the other woman (she's girlfriend) when the other women goes for a drink with her. The two women go straight into the club with a bunch of beers.  One beer and the girl walks in a taxi, with the man in her shoes.  Things get a bit rough as the man has sex in the taxi and the women is crying as the men pull off her shoe and she is in the backseat and the cab. The man gives the woman a lot more money as the woman walks out with her at the cab, and the other men are drinking. The scene ends with the men pulling a gun on the woman. The men who are in the car chase her and then chase her for the cab with their guns. The second scene where the women gets into a brawl with the guys that is very sad to see. The last thing you see is her being killed. I give this movie a 1-2 stars, but I could see no more stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very disappointing, and it's not the most stupid movie ever made.  The movie is full of so many fake references, and the acting is terrible. The acting is not only bad, but the comedy is bad, too. The music is also terrible, and not even a musical note, but it is not even funny.  But don't take my advice, please, this movie is not good. You are lucky if you have the chance to see it before you leave. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched it twice, which is a good sign for me. It is an unfortunate movie in every way. The actors were obviously not the right person for this. It could be a lot better than this movie, but you won't get much of enjoyment if you watch it. I give it a zero rating for a bad film. I'm not sure why i gave it a 4 or 1. It was interesting to see all the actors, but the movie is not good enough for my liking. This is a bad excuse for a movie: A bad excuse of a poorly written movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was quite bad and I thought it would be a fun little movie to look at. I thought the acting was a bit more entertaining than it was. I liked the fact that we can actually see the women in the scenes. However, the acting wasn't too hot. The film was supposed to be about a single woman who falls in love with a good guy, which leads to them finding out about her past. However what happens while she is in love is nothing interesting, the women are falling in love for a stranger and the man is very cruel and very unfree with them. It's really a pity really. I'd like to know about where the money was coming from or who it was that made this film. I can't believe a bunch of stupid people who thought this movie was cool to start a movie with. It was very bad and it should never have been made. This movie should never been made again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it was bad movie since they got rid of all of the action in the first 3 episodes and have now just wasted enough of the series. But then again, they did this great work so that they could have the original, great, suspense. This movie really should have been titled, "The Worst Movie Of The Show".  It really was absolutely awful and it really is just a bad choice for the show to be made. Its no way for the two of us to feel at ease and enjoy our time on the screen, they both make us feel like we're doing things they shouldn't be doing, and that's not the way you're supposed to act when watching a movie.  I did enjoy this episode but I would suggest this is the only movie you'll ever see that could actually make sense of anything, but I'm hoping to see it more in a sequel.   If you're interested in watching the TV series, I would recommend you not go to watch this movie, the only one that I really enjoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that was made by an independent film producer who has nothing to do with the music, but he is allowed to use song lyrics to promote the movie to this. What an idiot would do with this? He is allowed, but the main reason he is using lyrics to write songs for a movie with no plot is because the movie has no plot. And when the movie is shown on television, this is a horrible excuse for a piece of film that is full of bad-movie plot clichés.  This movie is so bad that I can't believe it has to be made and sold. But there's not enough money to make movies like this. I hope the movie will be reissued. The main reason I think it was released is because it's not a perfect film and the soundtrack is okay. They have put it out there and they're making a sequel of another movie and it doesn't look good on its own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible, the story is totally ridiculous, the storyline is pointless and I don't get into it. It is really bad and I have never laughed at this film before. I was really upset when I saw it and I'm very annoyed by it.  I really want to like a good movie but it is so bad that I think I've even begun to regret coming out to this one. But the main thing that keeps me from enjoying this film is the fact that this film doesn't even have a plot, it doesn't have a story and it has just one stupid ending that doesn't make any sense at all.  This film is completely unimportant, but it has got some great acting. The fact that he has this guy is like an evil mastermind with no idea what he really does, it's crazy. It's really bad.  What a wasted time! I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good romantic comedy but isn't into this movie, if you're a guy that likes a romantic comedy, you should really get a copy of this film and put it in your movie shelf. It isn't even worth watching in a 3/2 ratio or 4/5 ratio.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the movie first aired back in 2003 it was bad - in fact so bad it was never released - I was very suspicious of this movie. It seemed as if it were a copy of the original, but it is too much of an imitation. It does not make any sense - even after the credits are over, it feels as if the movie is about to start making money for itself. This movie could never been anything else. It is very confusing, and it is not a good movie. In a bad way for a lot of people to come out.  Also, the actors were not as good as I thought they were. The movie has to be a comedy-comedy, but that is obviously not enough to justify it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is stupid. And I'm sure it's not funny. I'm looking for something good, but it's the worst. I don't know what the point of this film is, what the plot is, or who the lead is. I would recommend you find another movie better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a really big fan of Disney's 'Cinderella', the movie's sequel, and the 'Cantini', and I was going to watch this movie to see if this sequel had any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Sadly, it does not. The plot isn't as compelling as it was in 'Cinox' or 'Cinelliter'. There are very little of the same kind of dialog. And it has a horrible special effects sequence which isn't even a 'B-movie' at all. I wish Disney would have used their special effects to save us from a movie like this one, and made the 'Dino'. The 'Cappaget' DVD and 'Candy Cush, Jr.' movies have a few redeeming features, such as a special effects scene in 'Grima', the best scene in the 'Gnimma', and the scene in one of 'Ging' and 'Dinny' where the 'cangly back' is a toy shop! But those two movies don't do much for either series. If you are a Disney fan, you won't get anything out of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for "The Last Picture Show" and it wasn't too good. This is the only thing that keeps me awake while this movie was on. It is like watching a bad porn flick of all the other 90 movies I tried to like. I give my 2/2 stars because I was afraid to watch it, and my rating was 1. 2 out of 10 I guess. I guess I am a big fat kid. I want to see more interesting and better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie from the director of the late "The One" series - Michael Mader (who made "The Untouching a Monster") - has two very long and unwieldy plotlines. In the first one, the young son (A) is kidnapped and the boy (B) is rescued by the police, whom are on their way to kidnap A and B's mom and get them on board.  Then the police find A's mom, and she is handcuffed to her daughter. The police then tie A's dad, and his friend, to the jail so they can get their arms, legs and heads, off and have them off. The two criminals, Tandy and Jim, break out. Then it's time to go... and then it's gone. What a waste!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to laugh watching this movie. In this story, not all the actors would act for the sake of being in the best of movies. The story of a man who tries to make amends for his sister's family (who's sister was kidnapped by a jealous relative and killed her family in revenge) has a few moments of drama. Then, there's the guy who goes on a rampage and kills everyone in the park. Also, it turns out the killer girl was pregnant when she was kidnapped and then gets pregnant again, and he decides to kill the family and get back to his home where he had made amends. The only good thing was that some of the characters were good in other films. But if you're a guy like that guy, you need to think more about these issues.  There are some interesting characters. The person who owns the park said the same way about his daughter that the rest of the guys did. This wasn't the best movie I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking at the trailers on the internet. It was a disappointment at first. I went and checked it on the video website to see what I expected from the movie. I was expecting the movie to be a good story and a mystery film. This was another disappointment. The story is boring, the cinematography was bad, and the acting was not good. It just took me a few minutes to realize how bad this movie was. I didn't know where to even start watching it. I am surprised that my roommate decided to watch it. He wanted to sit back in his bed watching it for awhile.  The only thing I can say is that it was a pityfully bad movie. Its just the way that it is made is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is not a movie I can compare to The Lord of the Rings - except in a slight sense this movie has more potential to deliver a fun spectacle than this one. The main problem with this film is that it has a very one dimensional and over the top look at a "B" film. It would seem that this would be an entertaining film if it was done well. It has a lot of dialog and a bad direction and a slow pace that would allow a real feeling and atmosphere to overcome the very flat character acting.  The direction of the film is a major problem - the characters are absolutely worthless and there is no room for them to develop. They are boring and lack any variety and even the lead actors don't have much of a personality that has any substance.  Other parts of the movie could not be used to the same effect, which is what the director probably wanted to achieve.  But it does have some potential to make the movie interesting to watch. The movie could work to create some suspense and excitement.  There are some excellent moments like a "Fight!" scene in the middle of the night when the guards try to fight them off, but there is also a major weakness in this movie, which I guess is because it's about a "normal" war movie.  Of course it is not going to be an "perfect" war film, but if you watch this movie then you won't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a horrible remake of the original, which had some great acting and a great story. But this movie is about two actors. I don't care. They just take their time. They want their own stories and the movie is totally disappointing. They never get to do any new scenes. They do act like they just got married. I just can't recommend a movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not very funny nor did it actually "make sense" as a family comedy. When the first time the "Couch Mom" is shown, the story goes on to take place about 5 minutes later. It wasn't funny and the jokes didn't work. There were many things in the movie that were supposed to make sense but just gave me the feeling of a complete lack of meaning. The best thing in the film was that some parts of the dialog were funny, but the dialog was just so out of place that I found myself not interested in anything else. There was also a big problem in the acting. I find myself having problems understanding the characters. I've always found that acting was always the hardest thing about acting. Some parts of "Couples" and "House of Cards" and the TV series are good, but it's difficult to watch "Cocrs" to even get into the mindset of this movie and just watch it.  This film was not good, and not at all funny, and the plot was not funny and just kind of "me-you're the dumbest person ever!" Although it does have some jokes in it, it just wasn't "fun". If you're a family fan of a movie and love the movie "Family Guy", you should try to get a more "comfortable" film like "Cobalt" or even another show. It just isn't really a funny movie and I just don't like it and I didn't see the movie much.  I recommend avoiding this movie as an example of just how low the quality of American movies goes. This is an average crap film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hoped the film was good, but unfortunately it wasn't. I found a good review for the film, if only because it was so bad I wouldn't even watch it.  The plot isn't interesting, the characters are stupid, the direction is terrible and the acting is terrible, and I'd definitely recommend skipping it if you want to avoid watching it. The acting was okay, though most of the actors weren't good either. The director obviously doesn't care too much about character development. The overall rating is a 1.5 out of 10.  I've been looking at these same types of films for awhile, and it just shows they aren't good. I'd recommend my friend a good video: 'The Wanniest Star! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one is one of the most disappointing movies in the history of American cinema. The acting and cinematography are so badly done, so bad it's impossible to watch this in a movie. Even worse than the first one of "The Secret". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really despise this film. I don't think it was a funny movie. It's just a very stupid comedy that just doesn't work for any reason, even if you don't mind the fact that it's a parody of a film in a few spots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie before, but it has been posted on several internet sites. This was really disappointing, because I knew it had a decent ending. In the end, the main story was predictable and the ending was completely disappointing. The plot is bad, and if you pay attention to it, you will probably think that this movie is a comedy. I think it's the same sort of comedy, but a lot less of a comedy than you might expect. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll get bored after about 10 minutes or so. If your opinion isn't taken when this movie comes out, you have two options: (1) think this movie isn't a comedy; or (2) think it a comedy, and you won't get any enjoyment from the movie.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10, but I don't think it was a comedy by any measure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just an insult to most people who believe that everything was good at the end.  If you believe that the story of "the end of the world" has some relevance to the present day, you may believe the ending is a little bit of wishy-twinkery.   I think most of those who agree with me that this movie is nothing more than a complete waste of time.  What do you say, "The end is pretty self-referential?" That's the only way it could be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are expecting a good movie then please don't. This movie was terrible and there are no plot lines and there is absolutely no dialogue. It was very obvious how poor this movie was at showing anything real about the life of the characters. If you want to watch a movie of the 60's (which I did), the 60s should be more entertaining then this movie. But don't go to this movie if you want some serious conversation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It had no decent premise. The story is stupid, the plot is stupid. And what happened that happened is pretty ridiculous!  The story ends at the beginning of the film and when the credits roll up! If you go and watch it again you will get the impression that all the events are in fact being controlled by "evil aliens" who are controlled by the "Buddies".  I don't think that this film could be saved, but at least it was not a bad film to watch. I would recommend taking it with a family member. If you have a partner, a roommate, a babysitter, a kid, or someone who is into acting or something like that, don't even go to watch it. This is not a movie for anybody who wants to go to a film school and be a actor, but if you are looking for a "movie" that is at least entertaining, don your time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched it. I did not like it, I don't like movies that get their point, and I am a bit of a bad person. So I didn't watch it, and in reading this review, I was thinking it was OK to watch. I was having fun and laughing with it, but I didn and will not. It wasn't funny and didn't move at all. I mean, it's funny, but not a lot. I can't even sit there, but it was like a bad car wreck.  What was the point? It was about a movie about an ending and about a story that doesn't make sense.  But I liked this movie. But this movie made me feel really dumb. There were no plot lines, no real meaning, and no real theme. It was just a total disaster of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever to ever made. What was supposed to be a funny comedy in the first episode had just 2 minutes of comedy. This movie is so predictable and predictable that it becomes amusing only when it happens. The film is so bad that it is hard to watch. This is a horrible film! I don't know why people who go through it like it or why they watch it. It is like a "real" film but without a real ending. There was no story. There is no ending. It has 3 main characters, with each actor having a major role. This isn't a comedy, it is a comedy that everyone should watch (and that is the way it started) but no one should watch it because it is full of clichéd and boring. Don't even think about it unless you want to see a sequel. I recommend skipping this one because it's bad, but if you're a really serious film buff you will be able to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i just wanna say the producers tried to make it so hard to watch that there is no way they could be so bad as that they could have made it so far worse. This is a total waste of time. If you want to see this film, do yourself the honor. Do yourself the rest of your time. This film is very bad, so don't watch it. It's a shame in the name of the director, if you want anything else to say, you'll have to have your ears checked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a strange name! I found it in my DVD of this movie. I didn't even notice it on the DVD. I guess the reason I was getting to see this movie was because my friend told me of a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was only one of four of twelve to twelve movies that I've seen. It could be my personal choice for this one, as I think it was the worst ever. I mean, it was awful, and I wouldn't have watched again. I might have taken one note of it, but it was too bad to be rated in any way, and made me think that I had seen the first five movies. And I would never see them in a movie, and the only reason I still watched them is because I had just seen them in my best friend's apartment. You know, movies don't necessarily come from people's mouths, so it was a mystery to me. And in all, I can't believe this was the most-awful movie. I've gotten several laughs out of it and have trouble seeing it on Bluewood. I can only imagine the director is hoping that if he plays out his parts in the film, that the film will get released. I didn't like it because it had such a bad plot and too bad a script.  But don't expect much from the movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Naughty" looks much older than the previous ones but that's not a good sign if you liked the previous version of the movie.  What is this movie? An innocent girl who wants to be a princess, but she fails to achieve what she wants and becomes more pathetic.  One day she finds a magical blue lady who has a magic wand that can heal her sickness and also heal her mother!  It turns out the lady is dead, and she is dying!  She has some magic which she stole from her mother's grave so she can get to work, but then she's having problems and gets to get involved in the murder of a bunch of guys! She tries to help the girls who are dead and get a goldfish, but that doesn't work.  She also has a big problem with her father, the King of the kingdom. The king was very mean and he wanted to eat her daughter and kill her mother so he wanted everyone to kill him! The girl's parents were also killed, which kills the girls mother! She then comes to the King's castle and everyone tries to kill her father. She is able to use magic and go around to a castle to get some fish and take them inside her dad's castle. There are many dead bodies around and the princess is stuck in a wooden coffin so she is trapped inside!  The girl also has to get a job because she is very good at magic and she wants to keep playing games with her. So she gets a job that turns out to be as a maid! So she plays with her new boyfriends, who are very stupid! She puts on some clothes and a magic potion to get everyone to get drunk!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete disgrace. Its an absolute disaster. The plot is weak and the dialog is poor. The special effects are awful. The story is not at all believable and the whole film is not interesting whatsoever. Its just another poorly scripted film with no clue of what the hell it was about.  What a waste of money. The people who are involved in this film are a bunch of loser losers who probably had an idea of how to do this in a low budget movie and would never dream of having a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't even mildly enjoyable when it is supposed to be a comedy. I'd give it an 8, and not even 6.  But for what it is it would be very entertaining indeed... at least I liked some of the bits. But, even in the end, not to a point, it had a few laughs. I can't blame the script for making the film so poor. There were too many parts that made me laugh and I had an idea that it was a bit pretentious, and I don't get the sense of the story that has been totally ruined in the last 60 minutes.  The whole film looked like it was made by a guy who didn't know how to shoot it well. The camera was bad. The actors and the script were bad. I couldn't even see if they were doing their job properly. They weren't even good enough to make the film entertaining.  I'm going to take the "point of view" approach. I donno where to go from here. It's not a film; it was an entirely horrible film. I give it 10 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was just released on DVD! And I had to watch it again to figure out if it had any relevance to the actual situation. The film had no plot, no dialog, no storyline, no plot twists, no dramatic suspense, no real plot twists. It's a mix of cheap, boring dialog and cheap acting that makes even the slightest viewer, even with an ordinary or somewhat bored person, think that it has some relevance. I think this film would be better if they'd just used their money to pay for a good editing job. The dialog is awful, the characters are stupid, and the characters can't even sit on their feet! And even though the movie was fairly good, the plot is weak. I'd give the film a bad rating because there's no real suspense, not even a real premise. It just keeps you entertained and gives you a feel of smug satisfaction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I did not like this film is due to the fact that it makes no sense. The plot is simply an excuse for another plot that should never have been. Even worse, the dialog was painfully stupid and even worse, when one of the leads turns a plot, it's clear that the person is not good. Even the main lead is OK, but the movie is so weak that the audience can't understand what's happening in it. As well, the movie seems to be a mix of a plot that's too complex and a film that's so predictable. The whole idea of the plot is completely unnecessary, and it should not have been done. The end of the film is simply a long, incoherent mess. The good part of this movie was that it seemed like a fun film with a lot of sex, but, if you're expecting a film with real acting and good plot twists, you won't enjoy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i've never laughed at a bad film. the movie is the absolute worst ever i have seen. and its bad for those who do not know what's a good film.  so don't waste your time watching this. don't be too surprised if you like to sit at the theater and watch the story when you're drunk and do not pay attention to the plot. i had a feeling that the movie was so terrible that i didn't even try to see it again and tried to leave. the plot is so bad that it makes you sick. the fact that there was an opening sequence makes me hate to go home and see the film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of the late great 'Mad Max' and 'The Death Zone' but this movie proves not so.  The story is about a truck driver who has gotten bored and asks him to have a friend to get him a new truck. So he and his buddies rent the same truck to get a new house for him.  They set this truck up and he drives it into the woods to complete a long night of driving. That night starts with him, his partner, and some of his friends, having fun. He gets killed and it's a pretty long night but not much fun.  After the night was over he gives the driver and his friend, a dead truck and asks them for a place to rent a car so they can have a car fun. After renting the car, they find out the driver is working in the truck. One night he and some friends decide they will kill his friend and they kill him too.  Then he decides to get revenge on the driver's brother who killed him. That evening he brings the friend in a room to a gunfight over a man who has cheated him over and is taking him to a restaurant.  This is a really bad movie. The director tries to create a nice story but it loses its energy and gets boring when it comes to the climax.   Even if you like the movie, you might want to be off the movie. It is a disappointment to the film and it is not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the reviews I read, I thought there was going to be one good review here. I wasn't expecting it. In the movie I didn't know what the movie was about, and I had to listen to the music to try and get my bearings. But this isn't about comedy, it's a little thing to complain about.  I had never heard anything about this film before, but since I read on forums that the movie actually was hilarious and I was a major-numbers-the movie was actually pretty well-crafted. I suppose the main reason I gave it 1/4 out is because I have heard a very bad review about this movie. So, I'm going to give you a chance to win in the comment section. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was only 3 minutes long and could be rated 1.5 out of 10. The first 5 minutes are good, and the last 5 minutes were truly awful. I'd recommend skipping this movie if you don't have the money for this one but if you do have the option, go ahead, the movie is not as bad as I imagined. There are some scenes that are truly horrible. There is also a very slow start which can be annoying. I was a huge fan of this movie because it was a great addition to a good movie in the late 80's, and now I am not a fan of it, and if I am a fan it was just a dork. The only thing I wanted out of this film was a really cool scene with an even more ridiculous character. What made this movie worse than a bad sequel? I really wish I had liked this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie in a box at Target on the first day of my college class (and I thought I had stumbled through the movie in one of the first weeks of school, and I had a good job in a small town at a high school, with a bunch of students who were all very shy, like me). The first thing I thought was that it was extremely bad. The only thing that saved me was the title and some of the story lines. What was the purpose of this film? The whole thing had been about a guy who, when the police were looking at him, told himself the truth and confessed that he was responsible for the killing of the dog that he killed off. He was not a good actor, but, in a completely stupid way, he was a hero to say that he had done a brave thing, because he was not even a coward and never cared for the dogs he killed.  There was no way to get away from the fact that the man wasn't a good man, or that he wasn't very good with the people he worked with. The plot was ludicrous, and the only redeeming feature was an occasional scene involving the actress who got into a car after killing her dog. I don't think that she's really a coward, because she's shown the entire movie with great confidence. The way she tells him what to do makes her seem like she's actually in control. The ending is so convoluted and complicated that I couldn't figure out what it is, but it seemed to me, anyway.  The film was completely unnecessary. My friend at Target was extremely disappointed by the fact of its existence, but she only gave it to me because she wanted to be nice to me and it wasn't my first choice in movies. I had to agree to watch it, even though it didn't seem to have much to show the way that the police would normally act. The film also suffers from an incredibly high volume. There are several scenes with scenes cut off, and even some scenes that are only marginally interesting. I think that a more mature director would have tried to make a decent story out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are enough good moments in this movie to be useful. If this movie isn't for you, I'd really recommend sticking to the second hour and hoping for something better. But don't see this movie on Blu-Fi and you'll probably waste $6.95 on it. Avoid it if you have nothing to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have to watch this movie as soon as possible because it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I understand that this is a Japanese show but I have to believe that they are shooting this in a real location and that is where they did not use proper lighting. The lighting was bad and I found myself wishing that this movie had a decent storyline or even a story. It is only that they did a terrible job on this movie. The ending is nothing but annoying because it says that he killed two guys that he had killed in the previous episode. It says that this was the last episode that he was in before the story went out to the future. The story about the other person is so unbelievable that I had to read the script in a Japanese dictionary to figure out what happened to these guys. What the hell is a story about? I don't know, it's just what they did when they were in the future and it just never happened again. The acting is not good, the acting is bad and it's unbelievable that they were going to kill two guys. I could understand that they got involved with an evil person, but it is not enough for a person to kill 2 guys to become angry and kill them. This is just a shame, and I will be watching it again and it isn't even a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first came on to this film I was a very young movie fan of all things, but now it seems that I am not. It is still funny, and it is very sad and awful. The acting was bad, the camera work was poor, the music was bad - all of it just. When I started watching it I was very angry, it was just awful - absolutely awful. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It doesn't even qualify as an acting film and no more has to be done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch this film because of the beautiful story of the first movie, which is absolutely horrible. The plot was good, but the ending of the movie is terrible. It starts with a scene involving an alien spaceship and the human characters, and the aliens invade their spaceship and get into their bodies. The aliens are very hairy, so the human soldiers that get to know the aliens are not very nice, nor are they so hard to live in a room with them. They start to have sex with the human women and soon after you are able to see the actual creature. A lot of the film takes place in a desert in a country where there is nothing but sand to speak of, so this movie is really boring and pointless. I give this movie a 4 out of 10 because it was very pretentious. I don't think it could be any better than the other two movies. I really liked the first one and was a good film, but I'm not going to spend my money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought there was going to be an epic film, but unfortunately it was about as awful as I expected. There are only three characters that make the final cut. The only one that I can remember was Piazzolo (the leader of the Roman Legion), who is voiced by a voice actor that is just plain awful. The other two is the other two characters. There is no dialog or even a scene sequence involving some semblance of a plot. It's not even worth considering for that. The soundtrack is bad as well. The whole thing is just awful. It was an insult to my mother and my mother's mother's friends. I don't even think it was an accurate representation of the movie and the Italian people. If you really want to watch this, you should get your heart, not your wallet. If it wasn't my mother, but my father, the other mother's friend's husband, or myself, I definitely recommend not to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's alright though I've seen the other reviews. I think the director didn't really understand how to go through the entire film. And there's a lot of things that could have been avoided. I can honestly say that the majority of these people could do better in films.  There's also the very small thing which bothered me the most in this film. There's an idea of a "rape" in a film, and a woman is put in an X in front of the other guy to act like a "rap", it should be an entirely different situation. The only real difference is that this guy gets drunk, and the girl gets drunk when she gets drunk. There is no sexual tension between the characters. This is the opposite of what I want to see.  And I'm sorry about the ending, the ending is pretty bad. The next review will be posted soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely awful. In my opinion it should have been more than one minute of the time. This movie was completely unbelievable. The acting was weak and the story was weak. The only good thing about this movie was that I laughed and laughed at every scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second bad movie I have watched this year. The first was "Roozhambers". It's a disaster of a movie: it is so bad it could be the worst of the horror genre. The characters and plot are not believable. The voice over was also bad.  "Rocky 2" was the worst "Rock/Funny Dog" ever made. The new film is called "Rock & Gooney" but the name is "Rock&Gooney" since this movie was made only for kids. I can not imagine what kind of movie this movie is supposed to be. This is a piece of junk, but it does not look like a bad piece of work. It is just stupid and bad. There is nothing good in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had not seen this movie before and was appalled at the terrible casting, but I am not afraid to say that I'm "an idiot". I had a sense that it would be an enjoyable film, and I couldn't think of anything that would be so bad. If I could have gotten another movie to go by, it would have been worth half the price. I saw it for a few days and did my best to watch it, but the end is simply the worst in a lot of years. The acting is so bad that you feel like you're having no idea who is supposed to be acting. The voice is so awful, I actually find myself wishing to put my hand through my eye to avoid my eyes seeing the lines that make me cringe and cringe. I am really not sure why they did this, but you'll know. I don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no plot and little character development. The story is so pretentious it's almost a parody of itself. The characters are so stupid they could be the worst movie ever written. The special effects are also bad, and even worse the dialog. But I cannot even mention all the negatives in this movie. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, ever. The only positive thing I can say is that I thought the film had some nice parts, and some decent actors. It would have been great if some good actors could come in and help the film. But unfortunately, we were given the excuse to do that by a movie studio. Unfortunately, I can't give it anything positive rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst, if you haven't seen the book, and also one of my least favourite movies of all time. As one of three, the other two are... The first one is "The Matrix", an advanced simulation that takes place in a series of events, which are simulated like an ordinary simulation, and the second movie is "X is the World of X", a movie that takes an entire plot of events from beginning to end without ending, and is only slightly better than the movie X. In "X", a terrorist organization is responsible for building a nuclear reactor that destroys the world in the middle of a simulation. The terrorists are, for example, the Russian secret government, a rogue Soviet spy agency. The leader of the terrorist group is called the "Kiburi".  In the first movie, there is a terrorist group, the Kiburi group, that is to steal weapons from the Russian soldiers, and they do this by kidnapping, by kidnapping.  The terrorists then plan to blow the terrorist leader away by using a nuclear bomb. The plot doesn't take much further.  In "The World of XX", the terrorist gang, the Russians, and so on make their plans and get ready to steal a nuclear war bomb from the Russians. The Russians are ready to build the nuclear bomb, and have several special forces ready to fight them. The first movie features a very stupid plot. A terrorist group makes a bomb explode while stealing a large pile of sand, and people close to the sand are killed in an earthquake. A couple of people in the underground military base have been killed by the sand blast. The Russian soldiers then use the sand to flood the city with water and sand.  As time goes by, the terrorist bomb that was meant to blow away everyone who was in the city is actually put to some pain. As the Russian military gets closer to the wall that was built by the terrorists, some of the military troops are killed, which seems to be too fast for the terrorists to get a hold of.  A few minutes later, the terrorists fire a rocket at the wall and land it on the ground, as usual. A few of them get killed, and it turns out that one soldier is dead, so the soldiers keeps his guard and has an army guard on a high-security base. The troops then think the army is a few soldiers not going to die. They shoot at some missiles to see if the terrorist is going
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm having an eye infection... I'm going to go out to an hour and a half to get a prescription. I'm a huge horror aficionado and this movie doesn't have a good horror premise... I do not buy it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping at least the actors on the screen would be better. I don't understand how such a movie could be so bad. I'm a big fan of these guys, the good ones who were in it. This movie is absolutely terrible. I think they should look into their careers, and look into how the directors and producers have done this thing. The plot is not strong enough for me to understand it. I do hope they find the movie to a degree that would give it the same enjoyment to the viewer that "X is" has to. I can see it is a simple way to make an entire movie that will appeal to no one. There are some decent scenes of the gangsters. I understand that "x is" is a joke on an absurd idea that is actually a very funny movie. I also can see why someone would not watch it, and think it is so funny. However, I'm still giving this movie 2/2 and 4 out because it could be a funny movie, if the actors and directors can really make it interesting. But I would never watch it alone. It just didn't seem fun, and I don against the idea of watching a movie that is so boring, even if it was fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a chance to review this movie, because it is pretty good.  Unfortunately, this movie is the one that ruined my view of the whole world. I find it difficult to comprehend and even harder to appreciate. Even if I could, I would have to think about this movie with only 1 line. I cannot grasp the concept of "true-ish" art. If you think that it's "true", you should have an IQ of 4 or below.  This is an unfortunate event. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I want to say, but it's been several years since I'd even seen this movie. The characters are not in character, but the director's scripts aren't convincing. The music is very bad, as if the actors don't listen to it. The cinematography is bad, and the plot is weak. I was hoping to see this in some form of a musical number, but unfortunately, it was only a musical. The story is about a guy who works at a drug store, and he becomes addicted to heroin. After meeting with another drug dealer, he starts acting out with the dealers and then gets into a situation with the cops and eventually starts making a big mess with them.   I can't really think that I've seen this film and I'm guessing it hasn't been released. I know that there are some of the good elements that make the film entertaining, but overall I just couldn't really enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was going to rent this movie I was very skeptical on what this movie was about, mainly because I heard the movie was titled "The Ghost of Death". I couldn't believe it. So the only question I had was what was the name of this movie. After waiting, it would be easy to find "The ghost" movie. I decided to rent it and watch it. I'm not a big fan of movies but I do have seen this movie, I did read about it but I never watched it. After seeing it I was afraid to rent the movie again and I'm afraid it'll kill my life.  The plot begins about 45 minutes into the film and I thought it had the biggest problems in the movie. There are just too many problems in this movie; it's just a bad way to kill your life. I found it so annoying that it actually started to get annoying. I know I didn't expect to see any of these problems in a horror movie, but I did watch it and realized that the only problem was I was watching the entire thing. I don't think the movie itself is bad, but it's so bad that I didn a little bit funny and enjoyable.  I'm sure it is going to get more popular. I can't see it because I've never really thought it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like to comment on things that hate me, and I can not even admit my share of hate. But I have to say, I have seen this movie for the first time ever. I think it was made with the intention to be an "wrecky". And I don\'t know why. The plot was awful and really hard to understand, I was very confused what this movie was about, I believe the writers had to have done some work to make it better. I don \'t know if it's possible to blame for the whole movie based on a specific premise, but that would be foolish. I have no idea why they made this movie, but I know for a fact it is a very weak movie. The ending is weak, and the acting was poor. I also can\'t agree with anyone who would like to see the movie again because they have seen the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a piece of trash, that has the look of a sequel. Don't be fooled, I don't care what happens in this movie. It's just a joke. If you aren't reading this, then you should be trying to keep yourself alive. It starts and goes the same way every time, and ends... but there is a very serious, serious element here.  It was obvious to me that this was a piece about the way the internet is now, and it was obvious from me that I didn't really understand the underlying message, but that's okay, because it's still a joke anyway. This is a bad sequel with a very bad title. A piece of shit that shows the kind of attitude that only a sequel could have.  I can't tell if it's true or false, it has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I can easily find something better out of a movie called "The Death of Zorro".  I'm still looking for a copy of it, and I'm glad I can still see the movie on some video stores, if you find it, please send me a copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be a hit, and it is now being released without any money, but this is obviously a complete waste of time. There's nothing else good in this movie. There are a lot of problems with the direction. The acting is bad. The camera is bad! The whole time there wasn't anything good to see! It's just not worth of money.  It's a pretty bad movie. I've seen this one many times in the past, and I usually liked it. But this one isn't worth a second watch.  I would suggest that people looking to get this movie, or just one movie, should be able to sit through the movie without too much enjoyment, and just give it one shot for the time. This movie had an interesting premise - a "giant" giant was apparently on the loose while the "hero" (a white-haired lady) was on her way to save a bunch of endangered species. I'm not sure if it was actually a big deal for us to get involved in this - a movie about an endangered species, and a white-hair woman who happens to have a dragon? That would be interesting.  There's really no funny little bit - the whole movie could not be better than a bunch at the first scene. There really just seems to be nothing to it. The whole scene in the next chapter is boring - it seemed to be designed to just drag their way back to some pointless plot. At some point, the guy with the dragon decides to get his teeth in and starts killing it for the cause. The next chapter had the same exact same script, and if you wanted to see it, you could probably figure out the plot and make a better movie.  The ending had too much of a "message" - it's about as if a huge statue is going to rise out of the ground in front of the camera. The plot is so predictable it really should never be remembered, even the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main thing that got me interested was the music, which seemed like it was meant to be that kind of musical music. It's a really awful, predictable music with little rhythm and melody. It doesn't really do anything except make you laugh at the characters.  I'm not sure how anyone would describe this movie, but it is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. The main character, and probably the best character, is the girl. She's probably the worst person I've ever seen, not for being cute or cute or acting or anything. She is very shallow. The funny guy is her boyfriend, who is very annoying and annoying. He is like the funny guy that always tries to annoy her. I am sure there were better characters, but these people don't matter in the end.   I was very curious about this movie because I knew it was pretty bad, but decided to watch it.  The acting is awful, and the dialog is bad. It seems like the script was just thrown off and thrown into the movie. There's a scene in the middle of the movie, where the characters are having a conversation about the movie and I'm thinking they are talking about the main character. That is pretty much an overlong scene. What I thought the movie was about was, not that the main male character was acting out some stupid, cartoonish line about how his friends were killing people. He says something funny in a voice that says it's going to be a war movie, the others respond in the same kind. There are some funny moments in the movie but that is mainly what we got stuck with.  There is no dialogue. There is a lot of talk between the other characters, which is also pretty boring. It didn't really come out and do much to keep the interest. The dialog wasn't particularly funny and the acting wasn't that great, at least the characters weren't particularly good.  Overall, I was really not interested in this movie. I would have spent a few hours and put a positive review about it, but I'm afraid to find out a positive rating. The movie is about the opposite of what I was expecting, because I didn't like the first movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of years ago, I remember seeing it for the first time. A movie about a movie that's absolutely awful. I can never look at anything that bad ever again. I've seen this twice, and it's the worst thing I've ever seen. I know I'm going to be asking for "realism", but you can't expect realism if you don't expect it. In fact, I think it is so bad that it's hilarious. I had to see this movie for 3 hours, I made me laugh every time I stopped laughing, and the movie doesn't matter anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that I rated this as an 7, and that is not a very good rating. But the fact that the movie features a female character is enough to give it a low rating. I did think that the other actors might have done their job well, but this isn't worth seeing if you're going to see it. What a disappointing movie! I'd never seen this before, but the plot is pretty thin.  I guess that it has more than 20 minutes of material, which I am surprised that it wasn't a short one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A sad episode, and I think this is a very bad film. It was so bad that I expected that the film would finish on its own. But it had to end on it's own. I have seen this movie twice, once as a kid, and even then I only laughed when it was in the movie. The first time I saw this movie was as a child, and that was a pity. Then I had to see it again, but it didn't quite make it look like a film. I know how it's made, but if I saw it again I would laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I have seen the movie before I'd seen this film. I was looking for the film when it first came out. But it was good at the beginning and great in the middle part. This one has an extremely bad ending, a terrible plot, and really bad acting. This movie does not give any credit to its lead actors either, nor does it help out to make it a decent movie. The acting is not good and the story is so thin it could be easily cut and dried up with the editing and editing. Still, the good actors do their best job though for most of the film. However, I don't recommend this film because i didn't think the acting was good, but i'm giving it a 2 because it does have its charm as a short film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd just watched this bad movie after watching it at home after reading the review of the previous movie. I cannot believe the acting is so bad that it should have been. I'm sure I'm not the only person who had never seen this film, and this movie is definitely not worth a serious effort, since it was far too long. I didn't even read the book to see if it would make me angry. In the meantime I'd like to see a sequel. I just wanted to see more stupid things done to an important movie: stupid sex and stupid scenes. Who thought this movie was good? Who thought? I could never figure out what it was about? There was a great idea of a short film being made about the movie: the girl was an idiot. How did she have to act? I just want to see something from another movie to give it some credibility.  The acting is bad enough. How you would feel if I watched this movie: How I would feel about the girl:  This movie is like watching a bad action film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie I was shocked and angry to find out that this movie was so bad and it didn't even have a decent plot. The plot line was extremely predictable and that's not even what I said about the plot! I know the ending has been spoiled, but that means that if the film is so bad you will have to buy it again for $1 and probably as a consolation you won't have to watch this movie. I was stunned to even watch this trailer because the plot had already been spoiled. This movie is absolutely the worst Hollywood film I've ever seen. The only thing I'd like to say is that they should try and keep the cast together and the director should try to make the movie entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was curious about the whole premise of this movie. It starts off nice, with a hint of something else, and then goes on in a completely awful fashion, only to be stopped when we're all sitting on the sofa. And this is a very bad movie, even though I liked it, it had an interesting and interesting premise, I'm not a fan of this kind of movie. Not to be selfish, but the message behind this movie isn't all that bad. If you are looking for a good movie: this is bad, but it isn't even as bad as The Boondy Girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is actually good, and I thought that a sequel might have some potential. But this was an odd film to see. It was like a movie with "The Matrix" in the Matrix. It lacked any kind of plot. The ending was painfully predictable, the characters felt fake, and the soundtrack sounded awful, and really had nothing to do with the overall effect of the movie. I give this one a 1 out of 10. I don't understand how a film can be so bad and still have some fans and fans. The most disappointing thing about the sequel was the ending. It made me think that the characters and the characters in the previous movie were really good. I was expecting a sequel because I really liked the previous film, but this sequel is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie and was really scared at the idea of being killed, so I was scared at it. The acting was not good, the story was stupid, and the ending was boring. I hope that it is soon available somewhere else. There are some good actors that could have played their parts. Unfortunately, a lot of them died, and a lot were replaced. Some good actors did play these parts, but a lot had no clue what they were doing.   This movie had some decent acting, but it would have to be even worse if it were used to illustrate the world. If it was used to glorify the fact that you are going to be killed, it would be boring, stupid and cruel. There is no story, no real meaning, no ending, and no motivation. The idea that a person who dies and then comes back alive for a while is a fantasy that could make me watch this movie. It is a sad twist in life, and it is absolutely pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not funny, at all, and there are no witty jokes. I have watched more movies in my life. I wish I could give the cast a chance to be funny in any movie: the lead actor is obviously bad, the story is bad, and most of the dialog is very poor. The only funny scene I wish to see is when the main characters decide to use the idea that they saw last night that is the life of a famous actor who is having difficulty with his own life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know how difficult this is, the acting, the editing, the cinematography. The story is so badly done that it could just be the worst horror movie ever made. I have not seen this film, but it does have a good story! But what happened at the end is a pretty horrible thing. You don't want to know if the guy with a big gun is a killer, or whether he might be a bad guy. I would avoid seeing this movie if I were watching it for horror, but the other way to avoid seeing it is to watch it to see the first twenty minutes of it. It should be called "The Dead Thing". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be stupid. It's absolutely pointless. I have a great memory of watching some of the early "Cancellar's "The Empire", for example. Those were great, with great music and great acting. "Came In The End Of The World" has absolutely no music, no acting, no plot, no story, and very little action. It just isn't a good movie, and even worse than that is when it shows "real life" as a fake documentary.  The same is true of "Dark Night: Dark Night", a much more entertaining film than the one in which "Capella" has so much to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible excuse for a terrible movie, the first half of an terrible comedy with two good jokes. It would be funnier if it was a movie, and even less funny if you didn't laugh. I cannot believe that people would pay the attention to the jokes. They aren't even jokes. And some of the jokes are just bad, and they aren't funny. If you want to see the movies in a good manner, watch an old classic of American comedy from the 1930's: It is a way to kill off every comedian who didn't fit the way in life. It doesn't help that the only two comedians that can really make funny jokes are the ones who made the original, and most of them have a good sense of humor. And there is nothing funny in this movie, although a few of the gags that appear on it are funny.  The whole cast is not funny or funny. They don't really act like a funny comedian.  Some of the humor in the movie is weak, and some is very offensive, but the only thing I found that funny in it is the idea of "BANDS!" which is stupid and completely unnecessary. The only thing that makes you laugh was the ending gag. The ending gag is about "Cannibal!" But that's not funny! No one can really stand for that joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie very disturbing, I didn't like it, but there is one thing that keeps me laughing.  The first scene is a bit of a horror movie, the next scene is completely ridiculous.   The rest of the film is about a house of evil, the third scene shows an angry guy. The fourth scene shows a little girl that is in the same situation as the first one, but the first scene shows the guy as an ordinary guy.  This film had me laughing so hard my eyes were glued to my eyeball, and I stopped watching it.  I cannot say that I was surprised that the director was unhappy and made the movie. I thought there was no other reason for this movie to be so bad. The film really isn't that bad, but if you can't laugh at it you probably won't get to the funny scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a long time, and I was disappointed with it, for I've always loved the movies with great story-telling and some wonderful visuals, and now the film itself has gotten completely sucked away.   I'm also disappointed with the fact that none of the actors or characters, even the ones that really cared for the story and character development, do well. It's a shame to see such a poor film as this one. I had a great time in my days in high school in this area, and my love is of those days, but if you are bored and really looking for a new film, don't watch this film. Don't go out of your skin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the first review I will give you the answer. The plot is a bunch of self-indulgent bullshit. The characters are ridiculous and the acting is so bad that it doesn't matter where the people are. You know, it's about a bunch a really bad little boy that's just a stupid little boy who thinks he's invincible. The director is a little rough, but that's because he doesn't really bother to act. The acting is OK, but it's just bad. There is an interesting storyline though.  There are no characters that make any sense whatsoever. I understand that it's not a movie nor a movie, but these characters are only characters for people to look at, not to get into the story. They are just mere characters and they are not even human and therefore don't warrant being characters. The movie was so bad, that it was so uninteresting that I had to skip it and didn't bother to watch it. I was surprised to see this very unoriginal film even in Japan, but then again I'm surprised to never see it. The best part of the movie is when the big brother gives you the "unofficial" secret name to hide your identity, which is of course "Avenger" and that has the only reason you're not in the film. But that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no laughs. There are more people talking. It's bad for me personally. The acting was awful. Some of the characters are really boring. There were a lot of people talking, and there were a few funny ones.  If you want a comedy, watch "Kali". Or, in fact, watch this movie. Don't get it. It was way too long. If you wanted to watch a movie, watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a poor attempt to make a film out of a bad and boring book. They may have some of the better actors of the genre, but they don't go anywhere else. They try to have something resembling a plot, but instead makes it a story with little substance.  You have to really see the book to understand what the movie is about. The book is just a plot of random events that never follow anywhere. And some of these events do take place. Some of these have to make sense at some point, and there is no good storyline to begin with.  They are just repeating random events and talking about them like the book has said. The writing is bad, the acting is bad as well, and the acting seems forced, but at least the writing is interesting.  In the book, we have people who do really good things, but there is really nothing to give away here. The movie is bad on that account. But it has some good moments where people do good things.  The book had some excellent elements, but the movie fails miserably.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is bad at best, the acting is awful, the cinematography is horrible and the music is awful. I don't like any of the films they are selling so this movie needs to die.  In the video they can make something nice out of the story, but the only scenes are the main characters. The plot is so poor that it doesn't seem to matter. I believe this movie was made by someone who didn't know what a movie is, or even what a story is. I thought this movie would never be any good, even after being around 5 years, but they didn't get any better than this and made this movie a mess. They should try to find a way to salvage it, because it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been a fan of both of them, but this is the worst version. There are all sorts of bad excuses for the story. There is little suspense, and the story is boring. They didn't make too much of a point, but the story of the first movie is interesting. But the sequel is so bad it makes me want to tear up my arms.  The reason I liked the first film was that they were both better than the rest of the films made in the same year. Even though this sequel was just as bad as the first.  I do not want to think about the first movies for years, but after watching this movie I realized why I was so upset. I was upset because I got bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure what this movie is about and this movie has no value in anyway. It seems to be a kind of "sassy, sexy" teen film like "Angie" or "Symphonic Piggy" etc. I don't like it and I don\'t think I could watch it again without getting into an enny, drunken fight scene. Of course the movie is interesting for a couple of minutes but you can't make a point about it. A film about a girl who kills her own father in a weird way (or possibly her father's girlfriend or one of the guys in the movie?). Is this movie like the stuff the US government is sending terrorists or the military? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing to compare to any film I've seen in the past decade. The film is a complete disaster - no dialogue, no story lines, no plot, no character development, no laughs. The main reason I've rated this film as a 7 is because the director is a "Director/ Writer" - a "Directing" like a horror film is meant to be devoid of any type of plot/plot/plot. Some of you have expressed that I've never seen anyone involved with this film before. However, I have seen the director, director's brother, film maker and their friends all in the same category - so that's not too surprising. They are responsible for putting this movie in the hands of somebody who knows how to film it but have no clue about how to make it.  If you're looking for a horror movie, look at a horror sequel - there are some good ones. If you enjoy horror movies, then don't watch this one - it's just another mindless piece of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is stupid. It's awful. But that's okay if you want to have a big hit. If you really want to do so, you will have to follow a guide. But in this movie, you cannot. You cannot even sit down to watch this movie in a movie theater. And when you watch it, you have to have somebody else, or with a friend, to stand next to your TV set so you can watch it. I think it's very hard to follow without a guide, but I think a guide is necessary. If there is a guide you must follow, you can't follow this movie. It is an amateur attempt, but it is nothing but an amateur effort at trying to do something at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is a little too short to the credit. i find it a bit boring, since it is so dull, it is also quite dull at times (in some spots). i think this movie has some of the old, yet entertaining, movie of 'Jumbo' days, mixed in a modern setting, that has its own problems.  the movie is about 2/3 of what it once was, and it needs to be shortened at least by the end of the film. I feel that it needs 2/4 of its best parts, and is disappointing. It does not hold its own against other excellent films, but it is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, that's one of the things that make this movie so bad. But in a movie for a horror series, this is one of several of the worst things I've ever seen, because there's nothing to say for a comedy. But this is not the case here, because what happens in this movie is painfully obvious.  This movie has some very bad acting and a few decent action sequences, but those don't matter for the main point of the movie. A good thing about the movie is that the characters are cute, and I loved the way it is set up. That's not a good thing, but what is bad is that it's so predictable.  As a horror movie, it is hard to find something with bad acting in it, but I'll give the credit for the acting and for the good scenes, because it has some good scenes. What is also bad about this movie? I really don't understand what happened to the girl, the girl is clearly a monster, and as a horror film, you can definitely see how that acts. I thought it was interesting when the character finally got a bit of a job. I really liked the fact that the girl was very cool and willing to do everything. But she never got the job. It was a short scene.  The fact that she finally got the good job was disappointing, because I found myself laughing about the way she was talking and making stupid jokes. I didn't find anything at all about the rest of the girl's character, but the way that the movie was set up is too weak to be of any good, and the acting is poor, so it doesn't seem like a good film at all. If you have to see this movie, don't. Don't waste your time watching it, because this movie was only bad for the first movie and that it was bad for a few movies, and that really is all the way for a good horror film: bad for horror, mediocre for action and bad for good comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd never heard of this film but I did, and I saw it on Blu-Fi. I can't believe I wasted my money on this stupid piece of crap. It is so sad to hear this film that it made it's way up without seeing it. It was so bad! It was the worst film I've ever watched. It's about as bad as you'd expect it to be. But it was so sad. I don't know what happened to it or why they made it. But there is something so sad about it. I was hoping to at least learn a positive review about this movie. I really wanted to be the one person who would be able to comment on it without saying how terrible it is, since I donno hate this film. I'm sorry, you can't watch a movie without having at least one person comment on the film, even though it's so sad it has to exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful and there was nothing good about it. I watched it on my computer and found out that it was actually a bad film with bad actors. Its not a bad concept, but there were no actors, no dialogue, and the entire plot sucked the life away from me. The whole thing was pretty stupid, but the casting wasn't that much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never read this film, so i gave it to see what the heck it was all about. The film is really just pointless. It had nothing to do but sit, take a few months and watch this film. But for someone who was a fan of this movie, I can't explain how terribly disappointing it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just another bad movie. And I am not sure if the director has the capability of making it better than a bad version of The X Factor. I really think it is because the director and production crew were probably unprepared for it. A lot of stuff about "the first day" got spliced in. Some dialog lines got lost or were completely unnecessary. Some stuff got cut in and a few lines that got lost. One or two of the dialog lines were just awful. The music was just plain bad and the soundtrack was completely bad. One sentence that got the name "The X Factor" in the title (The one that was in this one). They should just rename it "X", even though it was the best movie for the X Factor! And there was a little extra "the X Factor", which I think was a pretty good show to watch. The soundtrack was too much of an afterglaze and there was something strange about the ending. They should have at least added a little of the original song. I think the director should have made more of an effort to make the original songs even better and made sure to try to get all the characters' scenes and their themes off before the end. I was so embarrassed and disappointed that I even watched this before it was released. And after watching the DVD, I had an idea to just drop it off in the trash. I don't know if the people on the production crew knew anything about it and if they did their job properly, they might have made some kind of good, well-constructed comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are simply bad. This is a very weak film. It's supposed to have been a very entertaining film, but it fails miserably. It could have been better than an eight year old's summer camp horror. The film lacks humor. The characters were not all even cute, they were just plain awful and completely unsympathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read all of the comments on this film and I think it has nothing to recommend. It's a horrible film to watch. It has a terrible story with some interesting lines but what's interesting is the fact that it's a movie, no film company wants it to be a film. I don't think a movie this poor should ever be directed. The actors aren't funny enough to have the charisma necessary for a film such as this one. The plot is poor and unbelievable. It is too long to see through and I feel this film is just wasted money for it. Some of the characters are okay and some are good. There's some really interesting dialog but the film feels like it had a director, a writer, a scriptwriter, and some money thrown in for it! The cast is not funny enough. The acting doesn't really matter much. A lot of the film is in the worst way of any of the other films. I think the story is so bad that it could just be fun to make fun of the bad film and it isn't.  The acting is so poor that it really isn't funny. The story is bad that the characters can't even act together in a meaningful way. They can't act in a scene and there is no comedy in the film.  I think this film really needs to be abandoned. The only good character in it was Paul Daniels and I thought that was the best scene of the movie. You could get some of the dialogue in there.  It's just not funny, it really should never be a movie. It should never become a film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first part of this movie I was looking for a movie that I found so interesting. I thought that it would be a "good movie", but alas it was not. I gave it one point of the rating, and another point, but it was only the last 15 minutes of this show. This movie is the most awful movie I have ever seen, and it is not good for anyone's skin. There are no real plot, nor any good jokes. There is nothing about the characters, and no real love-the-hogs, and there is nothing to enjoy or even laugh. I have read a lot of reviews, and I have to say that I think the people that wrote this review should have quit over there. I think that the people who thought they can make it out better than I can are very fooling. There isn't even a really funny scene. I can't see this movie in a positive light, and i don't think it is "for everyone". I have been looking for it for the longest time, so I don't know if the reviewer was correct about that. I hope it won't lose any funding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film's main flaw was a plot in which the character would be killed by the other character. As I said, the story could have been a bit better with some little bit of suspense to keep the viewer entertained, but it simply failed to hold its own. Also, the ending really should have ended for it to have some semblance of a story. It could be used to illustrate a point, but the way it is presented is too blunt. There should have been more drama to have a satisfying ending.  I'm still trying to work it out, but I have found a new house to rent that will provide a better picture than the movie. This is one of the worst I have seen since the last American Civil War.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it for one night and I'm sad to say it didn't do well for the family I watch every week with my family and the only thing that has made me not happier is the cast of movies. It's also hard for me to believe in a movie that takes out two of my children of 10 to 17. I've just recently met the kid from this movie who I thought was going to be an actor. He's acting all of those awful lines. The little girl in the first scene with the old man and the old lady who was acting in the movie was a little bit better than me, but she didn't quite catch the same vibe. The other acting is so bad I'd like to go back to our movie if they made more films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Mildly" (The only original title to this title), is the film you'd expect would be in this style. It doesn't work. It is way too long, too boring, too stupid. I watched it on 2/2/15 to pass the time, but i didn't like it. It wasn't interesting enough and i wanted to like it, it was way too confusing to follow the plot. It was too low budget, and the acting was just not interesting enough.  There was a decent story, but there was no plot. The film starts with the introduction of a man named Simon. "MILDLY" is a remake of a terrible 1950 film called "Vanity," but Simon was actually in this. The story is very predictable, but the story is only shallow and predictable and the story doesn't have a sense of plot. I don't know why the guy called "Molly" is in this, but I would think it was for the same reasons why they called "The Little American Crime Gang," "Ruths in Space" and other low budget films. He was just an accessory character to the film, just not in any way important. I wouldn't even watch it.    It was in fact much better than "The Big Dog" because it didn't have to contain the same story. It had some of its parts, but what was left out of it was just as much of an effort as those movies are put out to make. I was expecting there to be a good story in it and I still wasn't getting bored.  I think the actor on the film was quite good, which is the movie. Just one person's opinion. But it didn to me just the opposite, since it was so bad. The movie was boring and not interesting. It just got the bad name of a bad remake of "Vintage," but it didn "not necessarily" make the movie, which wasn't the case. The acting was bad, not interesting or funny.  The story of the story was pretty interesting, but it really isn't even interesting. I'm not going to talk about the story, and it wasn't a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but not the worst I've seen. I thought I was going to like it, but it was so bad and the acting was terrible. If you like funny people, I might like it but it's awful. If I like a film, I'll enjoy it but they're just a little too silly. They're terrible but I don't have any money to spend on a movie like this.  If you've seen other bad movies: They're OK, but these guys aren't worth buying the DVD they're so bad it's not worth buying.    I am glad I didn't see this movie, but I'm scared it is so bad that it'll never find its new audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointing ending. It's all about a "hateful deed" but it turns out to be so sad that I don't even remember it. And the whole premise with the whole town looking at you and wishing for you to die seems to be an attempt to make a movie that you can relate to and sympathize with and not to have an objective.  This is not a movie of horror or gore or gore, but it's a movie in which some of the action scenes aren't even remotely realistic. There were no believable actors. And there were no dramatic or dramatic scenes.  The movie starts with the guy (who apparently turns out not to be a murderer) taking his wife from the bathroom. But by that, he leaves his kids alone and we are left to wonder what is going on with him.  And his wife is clearly upset that he's leaving his kids and leaving the apartment and the next thing you are doing is going to work to his boss and girlfriend and they find the answer to the question. It ends with him and his friend going to a bar and drinking some beers. The movie goes downhill to an awkward ending that is nothing more than the plot and never resolves the question of whether or not to go to the apartment. It seems that what they were hoping to convey was that the housekeeper had been dead, because that would mean that the guy's family would go to their room and get her out of the house and then find the murderer and try to put his body in the fridge. So we get into a bit of an emotional conflict between the two, so that we don't get too attached to him because his family is so sad and he really wants to go home. We get stuck and we get thrown into a bathtub. Oh, that's the main thing. The bath tub? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really want this film to fall to its last word. What has the film been so far? Its a disappointment in every sense, the characters are poor in every respect, the acting is poor and the camera is bad. All in all, I would not recommend it to anyone unless you want to see a very long film with a really boring ending. It makes little sense in a way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "CATACAMO" is an insult to all fans of AJP, a movie which is so bad that it doesn't have a chance to make it an A.K. It is really sad to see such a movie. As a matter of fact, the movie has the same name as a movie of the same title, and the movie is so hard to find it that it was almost impossible to find a copy of the original movie. One example I found in "Catacamoa" is that the film had no ending, and a lot of the dialog in the original film has been made so hard that one can not understand the ending. There was also a great deal with the characters. All of the characters are basically just nothing; there is no actual character development, and they are so stupid and lazy that even the characters can't do anything. The ending should have been much better than the original version. I have been a fan of "Cata-Cadai", which is a more serious, serious, and serious movie than "Cagamoa". However, the main reason I can't find "Catar-Cappo" is because the film is so stupid, and so very bad that I had to make a very long-winded review about this movie because the movie contains only 4 minutes of real action.  So, in conclusion, it is really hard to watch this film, but don't listen to anyone who insists that the director is great, because you don't have to. It's a pretty pathetic mess.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was unbelievably bad. There were certain moments in the movie that I thought were really interesting. The fact that it was a major conflict between the two main protagonists wasn't such a great idea. In my opinion, it just wasn't convincing. This film made me hate the characters. The story is very shallow and boring. I can't even hear the voices of all the characters that were in this movie. I was shocked that the director was even interested in the subject matter, and that he had actually seen the book and made a copy of it. So I'm not gonna go into too much detail about how it was made, but you can probably guess it by the title. I would avoid it if you're a fan of it, but I would probably avoid it for a movie based on a book that's even less interesting than the book. There are two stars, two stars that made a couple of good movies, so I don't think they'd care. They made a terrible movie and I donno longer even know why they did this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the weakest movie ever produced by Hollywood. In my opinion it's more like a movie series that features the characters doing their job to a lot of nothing - the actors act in a terribly contrived manner, the dialog is generally awful, the acting is poor, and the plot is totally out of the ordinary. The plot is boring, the characters are not properly developed, and there are no real direction or direction, especially the direction that matters most is the 'battle' sequence, the plot lines are pretty stupid, and that's it. But most of it's bad for the viewer. The 'buddy' is the worst. There are no characters that are actually funny or interesting, the character interactions are totally pointless and there is not one interesting character.  Some people like this movie and some people hate it, and I don't want to watch it, but I give it one or two stars because I have seen them in the video store, it didn't affect me personally enough.  But I cannot say much about the good and decent aspects of the movie. I don´t know if the director and the cast are capable of making a better movie than the previous one, so I would take caution. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I watched this movie as I was preparing for my own documentary on film in a local town, I was surprised to discover that this would be the only film I had ever seen. I had to sit and wait for one hour before moving on to watch it. What is more disturbing is that the only thing this film is about is a movie about a fictional horse race which has absolutely no relevance to the events it portrays. This is absolutely laughable. Even if you have a history with the horse race, I can assure you that you don't know what horse race is about. This film is just like a parody of a car-wash car wash, except this movie was created to look like a film. You may find me looking at other films and realize they are good, but this is a bad car-washing film! I don't recommend this movie, but don't bother it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film about two months ago. I'm a huge fan of a good movie, but this one just disappoints. Not only does the plot poorly, the dialogue was terrible, and the special effects were so bad that it made me look like an ordinary person. It just didn't seem like there was any good-quality work in this movie. And even though it doesn't really have any plot, it really does drag the viewer down.  A few things I noticed after watching this film was that it's too confusing. A few days after watching it I was so upset that I had to sit and sit and watch the video, which I did for hours and half-asleep. It's also incredibly bad for anyone who watches this film for the sake of trying to be funny. I think a lot of that is what the director intended to make, which he obviously didn't. It also is not good for anyone to watch it. And this is obviously not a funny movie.  The special effects are also not funny, and are too bad for those that enjoy good laughs.  I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that it plays a lot like a bad-film. It isn't funny enough to be serious, and it's not funny enough for most people. The ending doesn't seem to be really funny, so it really should have been shorter. This is still an extremely bad film, and doesn't help any other comedy genre. I give this to everyone who is looking to find out the flaws in this bad-movie. It doesn't have a decent ending either, but I'm so tired that I'm tired after seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was really poor, the acting was bad. I was surprised that it was so funny. I think the whole thing could have been better. The first 15 minutes I heard something about the "plot" and that it's about to be about to have a sequel. I guess the person who made the original was still involved in making this and forgot what it was about. This really should have been a better movie if the guy actually had written the script. The characters were annoying and the acting did not work. This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't recommend anyone watching it. It's not even funny in a funny way, it just a poorly scripted movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a lot of people that think this movie has great potential. That's not correct. This movie is simply a bad acting. I think the whole project could have been much better. If you are a fan of the original or the movie, I suggest that you watch a good movie. There is some good scenes in this movie, and there are some funny parts. But what makes this movie worthless is the lack of a good script, and the lack a good writer who can actually do what it says they want to do.  The movie is so bad that I actually thought about the end when it finally started on and I was sad to see it. It's a huge disappointment from what is a pretty good movie, but it is only mediocre in the worst kind of a movie.  There are a lot better movies to watch out there. A great film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on VHS, and, well, it wasn't too good. This movie isn't quite as funny as I had hoped. Also, the acting is bad and the dialog was especially bad. The ending is so, so stupid it's hard to understand the conclusion and that's a bad reason why you see it. But, hey, there are some funny moments in the movie. What happens when you're stuck in a car, can't leave the house, and finally, the guy, who wants to see if he can keep on going, gets to go... Well, it's a B+ rating in a low-rated movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm disappointed!  I was just a bit surprised at this movie. I saw all the stars in this movie and I didn't know whether they would have been good for it. But, it's just so sad. They don't make the best movies, they don't create strong characters, and they don.t even make good movies. They are just horrible! Just bad! The acting isn't that bad, but the acting is so bad that it is so annoying. Just bad!!!  The point is not to hate the movie, but to laugh at it's ridiculous! The only thing that made me laugh was that the acting was pretty funny and funny. And the movie has no redeeming qualities, except for the occasional witty comments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoy a good movie: the acting was good, but a major weakness. Also I was hoping this movie would be made into a film to close out this year. Well, not only did it fail, but it was also not very interesting. In addition to the other bad movie that I have seen this year, 'Dope Town' was very good, and actually much better than 'Cinder.' Unfortunately, this sequel doesn't live up to the strength of the original film, which is sad to see all the other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of an over-produced gimmick of a young, male actor who is trying to "hit" his way into stardom on an unsuspecting co-star's first day of working. The first day is supposed to be just an empty set, but within a few hours he learns the same things about the girls. The rest of the movie is a complete waste of time. There is a few funny parts but there is no payoff whatsoever. The acting is so bad that it makes one want to walk away and forget about the movie, which is very easy to forget. There are no funny lines or funny stories. You simply get to watch these guys in their "job" in front of a bunch of girls. I can't believe I even heard of this movie when I watched it on HBO. How could this movie get anywhere close to perfect? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not well acted and there is so much of a bad acting in it. One of the most annoying and one of the worst movies made this year. I cannot count the first 3 movies it was in and the 3 more movies it is in.  There is no more to talk about this movie than the acting. I did not know what the heck it was because I had never heard of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First the acting is awful. Very bad and not funny, that is all. Then the plot is bad. The characters are so stupid and inconsistent. They are so bad that they don't make any real sense. The whole thing is stupid, although I do understand the people who think they're funny, but there was no direction that made the film worth. And the music is also stupid and extremely bad. There is not even one song to show the concept of humor. So if you're going to buy this movie, don't watch it unless you have to! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to be honest, this movie was just an excuse to show us our pathetic and lazy viewers that "females" don't care for the movie they're creating, and that "scary" things are better than they actually are. It has absolutely nothing to show that we actually do have a choice in a good way to watch this movie. We have two choices, either "I hate it" or "I love it" depending on your viewpoint. The other choice is, "make fun of it". I do not think this movie could ever be made funny by being taken seriously, nor does it have any relevance in any way. It is a really bad movie, and its awful that such a thing is happening again. I'm really disappointed that the movie made me laugh, even though I love it. I just had to wait till the movie ended for such a good film. I did not expect it to be at this level and would never mind. It didn't have a proper ending for such an event.  I would have liked to see a sequel to this movie with the sequel in mind. I didn't expect it's sequel to be so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never had an idea that this movie was gonna be considered a great documentary since it was so bad...  Well, that was the case in the late 70's when it was considered a genius film... but it was that in hindsight.  The acting was pretty bad, and the story was pretty stupid. The fact that this film is so poorly put together by the other Hollywood studios that make movies of this sort is the reason why I can't see this movie as an accurate movie. I'm also not sure I was supposed to like this movie, but I did enjoy a lot of the originality and the style, which were just OK. But, it had some very bad dialogue.   Also, there are too many fake scenes in this movie. If you like a true, realistic movie, don't like these films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie in which this is supposed to be a film about a high-powered gang, with the first line taken out of the original film. I couldn't see it. I could not even tell if there was an actual story to be put this film in. The acting is pretty weak, the scenes are badly done. There are a lot of weird scenes, and the dialog is a lot too slow, especially the dialog in the beginning. The ending is about the same height as the last one, but I'm not a fan of movies that end after some of them. I wasn't even surprised that I was reading the book to see this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I have to say that this movie is the absolute worst version of a movie I've ever seen. The film itself looks a lot better than the original, but they do not have a decent director. The acting is not good, and the editing is awful. And even when I thought it was good, it's just so bad. It's also a bad video release. This is bad for kids. I recommend to avoid seeing it unless they really, really want to see it. The only reason I could say this movie was made by adults was that the main character is not an adorable little boy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like this movie and I do not like it. I mean it's just a slap in the face. Not even the actors are good at the acting and the acting are not good. And that's what I think about it. They just want to be happy. I think there's an awful lot of things about this movie that makes me angry. I've had all the comments on this movie in the forums and I've been reading it so much that I just want it to go away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand there are people who like movies with a great deal of plot, and I also understand how this movie could be good, but it really sucked me in. I found it so hard to comprehend the premise of the movie and how the characters were portrayed. I felt like I was watching a film that's basically a copy of an earlier movie from one of my youth group. I also felt like this movie was about a guy that never gets any attention from a girl. It's a sad end to a sad movie that got an ez the wrong number of 'pockets', which was something I really liked about the film. I won't waste my time wasting my time reviewing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has very little to do with any other elements of the plot.  We already knew from the beginning that this movie is going to be a major failure. It has a whole lot of nothing to do except it's a "comedy". It is not "the first line", or the first two pages.  It is one long, incoherent, pointless, and unpleasant dialog.  This is absolutely terrible, but I was so amazed and surprised by the ending that I couldn't stop watching it. It was so bad that I was actually shocked by the end. I guess I just got bored and had nothing to say to continue on. I was hoping that someone who was interesting, and not this movie was a complete disaster, might appreciate it for it's content. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie several times, and always wondered why it was so hard to find this movie. Well I just decided to see it again because of some good moments in the movie. I didn't get this movie for several weeks, and there was an interesting sequence where one of the girls (who was the best actress in the film) was killed by a meteor that had just begun to come down. And when I saw it again, it looked like a comedy. I was never the same, so I wasn't sure what was going on. I also noticed that the camera was bad, and the film had a bad mood. I have not seen the movie again, but I did see some reviews of it online. Some of the comments here and there were interesting, but they were the opposite of the movie I had in mind. The ending could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say anything positive about this movie, it just failed to deliver any good movie. The cinematography is not good as usual, the special effects are not good, but they are OK. If you like something silly then this might be your choice, but there's nothing else that good. I understand that it's a comedy but it can't be a comedy. Just a bit of pity, there is no good comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i am a member of the group which voted on this awful show. i believe the director and the writer must have been underwritten, and not as a result of a writer/director. i cannot believe that people who vote that they would go out to see this show is for the children, as it's not a comedy! Its awful! and it's just awful! I wish it would have been better than the ones from Ebert.  I give this show a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad flick. It is basically a "movie", although it is not too bad, like most of the other Disney films that come out. What is in fact a movie is an awful, poorly-written film. There is no plot, no direction, no continuity, no character development. In fact, it is so bad that it is almost impossible to relate to the movie to other Disney movies. It fails because it is simply too bad and not believable.  As a child, I expected my Disney movie to have good storyline and good characters. I'm going to guess that this movie is not in any way good at all, but I just can't believe Disney is trying to make it.  It's not going to be the end of a Disney movie like Disney is, so I can't tell. It's disappointing because it would make one of the worst movies in the history of Disney movies, but it is just too bad. The worst way is this one of Disney's worst efforts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a long-time skeptic of this film. I really like the films I saw in the 70's. I was expecting that this film would be funny. I did not expect any funny plot. The acting is awful. The dialog is poor and the characters are not funny. The film's style is predictable. I don't know what the hell this film is supposed to be. There are some people out there who have a funny name and have a bunch of good hair and facial hair, but they would never act like this person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be one of the "best" horror movies ever made, but I was bored with the last 5 minutes of this movie. I only get the sense of what it was like when I watch it again and didn't quite know what the hell it was. I've watched "the original" "Tears of God", which I liked, because it was funny and funny and good. But, when I watched "Tear of God" I was like this movie was some sort of horror flick, but just the opposite. I didn't like the idea of taking this film out as a horror film because that is not the case. And, the fact that I watched it in a dark room with no one else present made it unbearable to watch.  I did my best with the 5 minutes, but that was only a small taste of the film.  As of now, I still prefer "the Original" but I wouldn't want to watch it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is simply the worst movie ever made. It is very predictable. This was the worst film I ever tried to see. I found the movie so incredibly stupid, I wanted to put it in a time machine to re-engineer it. It's not that well written and funny, it's so ridiculously stupid, that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I give it one rating because it was an interesting title, but that rating is really just one rating. The plot was so bad that it made me sick. I would never recommend this movie to anyone and would not recommend it to anyone. I was a little upset that they used the term "spine" instead of a real spine. The only thing I can recommend it is a movie, not a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the "The Adventures of The Incredible Mr. Bartley" series of movies, but this "Lucky" series is awful. It is the same series I enjoyed when I was young, which was much cooler than the movies in "Gungs" (that's the series that inspired me to go through the movies and buy all of its DVDs, the series inspired me). Although the stories are generally good, the acting is terribly weak, the camera is awful, and the whole film could not be even close to the TV series it was inspired by (much worse than what the TV shows are like). And it gets all the best lines in the script. But it's really sad when you get to the end and you realize the film is only a copy of the TV show. I tried to watch this movie in one of my roommate's video store and only got bored. So, my recommendation: don't rent this crap, even if you like the rest of the "Adventure" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were two or three different endings. If you've ever been sad at seeing two actors get on stage in a few weeks, you will understand.  The best version is the one in which the three actors are the same, but the ending with each having their own sets and costumes makes the whole thing seem as if it's about the "two guys" with the same roles.  A poor sequel that takes us back to the very worst episode of the entire series. There's no suspense, and no suspense. The lead actor is the only one who is even entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a film set in a movie series (with no story), it is obvious that there should be a better movie.  It is painfully lacking, though, and I'm sure the writer tried to make it interesting, but it is not, and this movie is boring in a number of areas. There's a lot of unnecessary dialog and unnecessary characters. The director tried to include a few interesting scenes, but he wasn't able to get any interesting characters in the story. I was looking for a good film to watch, and was annoyed by it. I could have done better with a plot.  I was shocked by the way the ending was handled. The acting is so bad that it can be laughed at, and the characters are so silly that I can't even buy them.  The film is too long to make any decent comment about it, and it's just disappointing. You have to really take something from this film and not pay any attention to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You probably knew that there were at least 7 million people in the country because they would be the ones to watch this movie. I guess there were 8,000 people who actually got up on that stage, but I guess that they don't know. I'm still watching this movie because it's so predictable that I can't even sit on a sofa and watch it anymore. It's just that stupid.  And if you can get a free ticket out of a movie: get it because it is hilarious, and only mildly entertaining. Don't try watching this if you're worried that your life is falling apart, even though I know it's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find myself feeling sick reading the description.  There are no other words for it.  I did not see a movie before this movie and I was hoping I could enjoy it. It's just an effort to waste my time to waste more time on it. But what a shame it is, I will waste time on my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have any interest in this movie, and I couldn't find out what happened to the kids. So, I did a search for other movies about the film and they were OK. It just seems like there was no motive for this to be made. I think there was more going on with this film. They weren't allowed to film the kids, and they just saw them as characters, and that's boring. I donno idea why it made this way for them to watch it, or why it should have made it. Some of the plot is not all there, and some of the scenes are pretty bad. They got into arguing, and fighting. Some characters get into fights. But none of it really matters. The other part I wanted to comment on was the relationship between the boys and the women. It seems to be a "love" situation. They really seemed to be in love, just a relationship, and it's not really love to be. In fact, I think they weren't friends. What was the point? They were just friends with each other. The boys' names spelled "Pleasant," as if they were in love with each another. There were no character developments during the film. The dialogue isn't realistic, which makes it a bad film. I know that there have been some character twists, but it just seems too much. The idea of the girls loving their friendship doesn't work for them. There is nothing in this film about romance in the end.  Also, the girl's name spelled "Rachel", which makes her a "sexually-oriented" woman. They didn't think it was nice to be able to have sex with her. The girls were just sleeping, and she was crying. The girl gets into some serious fights with the girls and the girls get into each others' fights so the girls have to fight the other guys. This is the weakest part of the movie.  I think the girl didn't really get into the relationship. She just seemed to get in fights with everyone. The acting is terrible, and there isn't really any character development, and the whole movie really just plays out of confusion. The dialog isn't well made. The editing is poor. The whole idea of this movie is really just a huge piece of trash. The women don't do anything to the other women, and you really just see them doing it, and then they get into an argument with the other guy and you
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just proves that the idea behind this project was a bad idea. It's basically a mindless gimmick that only worked for one reason. It is just plain bad. If you have any interest in playing cards games, this is one bad movie to watch. It lacks even the one good part in the movie though. You would have to sit out for awhile. I actually liked it when it was in the real world, but that is not necessarily a good thing in a video game. Don't waste your time watching this, and try to make money off of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete disaster from the beginning. I didn't really care for this movie, it just wasn't interesting. The story line didn't matter at all. I was a little scared, but it wasn't really scary and I think the director was bad. The acting wasn't good, the dialog was bad, and the whole movie really lacked something else. I just don't want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being recommended by a friend, I bought the movie on DVD, and while I didn't like this movie, it did contain some interesting elements. It's hard to watch this movie without hearing the lyrics, because they are repeated so that you can only hear them once every time. The story takes place in the middle of the movie and lasts at the end. This movie is not a good film for anyone to watch.  I think this movie was made in 1994 when the Internet was still in its infancy. There are a couple of people who have seen this movie and have been so depressed that they don't want to see it anymore. There's no suspense, and the plot and acting are not good. What is interesting about this movie is that the author claims that he's not even the same person he is in the original film. We are supposed to be more intelligent then we are depicted in this movie. I think that's the same thing as the movie. The fact that he is a teenager is irrelevant. He's not the same personality he had in the film, and we have only seen him in the first few scenes. In addition, the acting is bad. The acting is not even good, and there's a long time after all of these scenes that I feel like I have to find something to talk about. And, of course, there's an ending which is not believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was bad - the story was predictable and unbelievable.  The ending is pretty predictable but it's not convincing at all. Also a bad title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have come to believe this is an insult to the memory of those who were in their first year of film making.  This is the same as the "I'm the Boss" series which is the worst series of all time, except that the first episode is actually funny and has a very obvious joke in it.  There are a few parts I don't get the sense of the "Keebong" series to be a parody of this series of jokes. The first episode of Keebung is very disappointing, there is an awful scene in the beginning, the second one is pretty funny. The third one is hilarious, but it's after that the show starts to really suck.  After this show, I'm going to give this show a poor review as this is the last attempt of the series to make a joke series about the worst comedy series ever made, and the worst comedian ever made! I really liked "The Boss" when I saw it when I was younger, but even with the sequel, the jokes are far too weak to be effective. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is simply an attempt to get people interested in an adventure movie. I honestly think it is just a rubbish, extremely bad, and possibly even worse than the original "Rash" as it is now. I can't even see the characters and the special effects they have in the movie. This was far too long to watch. I didn't care for this movie as I'd forgotten the original one, and after reading it I was sick of it. But at the end of the movie there is some nice thing going on - but that is nothing to be gained by watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just find this movie so bad it looks like a porn movie and nothing else makes it seem worth watching. The acting is terrible, the cinematography is poor, the plot is stupid and the dialog isn't funny at all. But the worst part about this movie is the casting, I cannot understand why the casting was chosen for this show.  It was funny to see them go straight into a gay movie and we saw a whole bunch of other actors doing similar things. It was also sad to see people such as Peter Sohl, a guy who has struggled for so long and wants to work again and is so lonely, but that wasn't even a joke.  Peter is gay but clearly needs to act like a gay guy to have his own movie. I mean even before he came out in a straight, straight couple, he clearly was trying to hide his secret. What a shame!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So it is possible that someone might have some "legacy" here. Maybe the kid(s) may not have been born in California or Florida but they live in California. They are also in California, Florida, and Florida. What I mean, is this an "cultured" movie with a "cultivated" mindset that gives the idea that everyone can be deceived. There's no real or deep meaning, and the movie itself is boring and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it has to be true. You don't think it's true, but it is. I don't understand what any of it says and the whole thing is a complete waste of time. If you think it was like a film for the stage, you'll be overcharged for the film which I certainly did, but if you just want to see it as a horror movie, it's not. It has absolutely no substance whatsoever, no story, no characters, no plot, no action, and it's all in vain trying to add a few scenes. It's just a waste of money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we watch this film, we think "the acting is bad" and the editing is bad. I thought that it would have been a better film than the original.   I was very disappointed, but I really liked "Sucker Day" for its style and uniqueness. They're both good films, but unfortunately, "Suck Day" fails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the movie has the feel of being somewhat self-destructive.  I found the writing and acting to be a bit corny. In fact, there was a lack of even a meaningful story behind this movie. In short, it's the only version of the "Escape From the Moon" series I've seen. It should be no more than a teeny teeny little joke. The fact that this movie has not received any critical or media reviews makes me question what was the purpose of the remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think the story isn't interesting or I just found it strange. It's all about sex and not so much about character, acting and the story. But it doesn't matter that much. I'm not a movie critic, but this movie isn't very interesting. The actor is just bad at everything and most of the time, not even acting. The director really doesn't care about his acting or script. I mean that it would be funny to have a bad acting movie about a good movie, but what the hell? No funny or funny or suspense! No good funny lines for such a great film!  I don't want to comment on what a writer might have or would like to add, but some have commented on the actor as being "very funny". The actor didn't really care. He had his acting all the way through, not all the time he was acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read the comments on this film on the movie website. The worst and weakest of it all. It contains nothing worth to begin with. There's nothing special about this film whatsoever, which is simply a horror film that's boring and pointless. I've seen better in a film.  A true horror film: no suspense, no dramatic flair, and no suspense. A horror film, without suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts off looking very good and promising, especially in the ending. It was a pity to see such a bad sequel. I'm going with another point of view that I don't care if they had a chance of getting the first 20 minutes out of the film, because it could have been a funny movie. But that's not even one of my biggest concerns. The sequel is so bad that I just wanted it to be a gag movie, and the film was such a complete, terrible, pointless, overblown, and pointless garbage that it's obvious it's just another "joke" after all. I think this is the worst movie ever made. I honestly don't think it's even worth to be considered a film, but just seeing the first 10 minutes of it makes me question whether I even should care about seeing it. The story isn't even good, and there is no clear message for what the end is supposed to be. The acting is awful, too! It's just a waste of time, and it really isn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's really no good thing to say about this film. The way it is presented is utterly meaningless. There's nothing to do with it, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and the fact that it doesn 't have a family unit to make it more relevant.  I'm sure this film is not an ideal to use for anything. It is far worse than most of the films made in the past, which is good. There are no jokes or funny banter; there are no songs or songs or the music of the music will make you laugh. The dialog isn't funny or funny, either. It just repeats the most stupid and predictable dialog ever. I think the director wanted people to look at it for a laugh, instead of a film that has a sense of seriousness, like "Lucky Strike", or any other film you might find of today.  Also, there's not a single line that's funny, and it's only got a couple of laughs. The "happy ending" is actually a very horrible ending.  What makes this film far worse is that it's got nothing going for it. The movie starts off nice, but the next 10 minutes are very dull, and don't even have any real suspense to go with.   Even the music is bad, I'm not going to listen to it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot even tell you how bad this film is. It really is a piece of trash. I'm not even sure if it's a real movie. Maybe the producers had some idea that they should make it funny, but I guess they're just not stupid enough. The whole thing has a funny name, and it is way too long. I can only assume that the writer/director/editor is a loser. I would recommend this movie as a joke, but not even as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the idea that this movie has an edge at times and that it has an advantage over the rest of the series. I also understand that the idea of a high-speed chase is good, and that this is a story with the same kind of pace and drama in the series so that I was a little annoyed. But I didn't understand why that happened in the first episode of the TV series.  I also wonder how you could justify having a low-speed one-frame story with this sort of action-adventure premise, because what is the point of any of these types of stories? They get you to a place where you just sit in silence and take the story line, and what you do is so pointless as it becomes a distraction from the overall theme of the show (such a story). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie about halfway through, so I thought I'd be able to enjoy it. I found it to be a complete disaster. I couldn't even watch the first minute. I also read the comments on the Web site about this movie, which is a very small percentage of people who have seen it. In that case, I'm glad that the "crapped" movie has a small percentage. Some people might find the film a little entertaining, but it just won't be worth your time. I don't think the director of this film has any clue as to how awful it is. He really didn't know how to properly prepare for it. You would think that he would like to see it again and say, "I don't want to miss this one". He just doesn't have an incentive to make movies like this. There are no good reason to make films like this, so he should stick with good films like his other two great films, "The Matrix" and "The Black Hole". He's not going to make another bad movie. It's time for someone to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The concept of this movie seemed very amusing, but it is sadly a bad sequel. Its a shame that a lot of the reviews have it so.   I'm sure there are a few actors in this film, but all of them are in a kind of long form of continuity and are acting the same way, so they would probably be better for a movie to follow.  The characters have a long time, and they would all have taken on the same behaviors to get into this situation.  I understand why this movie was made. I understand what it says, but I still don't understand why it didn't do anything better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of being a "horrible person" isn't that strange. It's a very poor piece of film, with little direction, which is just plain laziness to a film. The most difficult thing about this movie is the story. The story is stupid and stupid and the characters are stupid, which makes the movie so stupid it should have been better.  It's like a soap movie made by a guy who goes to school and spends a year looking at his parents who he believes is a bad father and spends year looking down at his mommy, but it doesn't seem like a film made by the guy who's really good at his job.  I think it's time for something better than this and I hope they put this awful thing down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Long Night" is one of my all time top rated movies. I know it has gotten the best review out of the first one I ever read for this movie. But this one is so bad I'm hoping that it won't be so bad. I think this is an example of a movie that's so bad it's just bad. It has a very poor plot and some of the most disappointing and stupid dialog lines. It also suffers from poor special effects and special effects. It plays badly. I have to give the actors credit for having good characters but this movie really isn't. The ending should just be a stop for any movie fans. I was hoping that one could see this on TV or the movie site. The only reason I got this movie was because of my friends who gave me it. I did not sleep with them and neither they nor my friend cared much about me. There are no good jokes or jokes in this movie and they didn't have any funny moments. This movie just has a poor plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason that this movie works is because the actress wears a wig that is only for one movie. I have not been able to see the movie without looking out for some, but I am hoping to get some idea that a person like that would think it would be interesting to see. I do find that she tries her best, but it could have been better. What is a movie called anyway? Oh, wait a minute, how did you know that?  It is all in the film, and I give the movie a zero rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie and it was terrible. I did not know when it was going to air and I got it all wrong. If you have nothing good to say about a movie then don't say. You should at least have some amusement or amusement about watching it. I do believe that the director did the best he could to try to make it as funny, but it got stuck in the middle in the making of the film and I found myself really wanting to get out of the theater and just watch it, but this was so bad. I was extremely disappointed with the film, but I just can't understand why the guy that took the reins in the movie didn't even want to make the film that badly. This is a movie that is nothing but a lot of money spent, and it is really awful to say. It really sucks. Don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may be surprised to hear that my friend from Toronto called this movie "the worst thing ever" he made it like a joke to be funny.  I'm a huge fan of the classics and I thought the film was a good one but it felt so sad and bad it seemed just like an adult film that doesn't have the strength and magic of movies like "The Matrix" and "Twilight Zone". I was hoping this movie could be like a funny parody or something funny, but unfortunately it was just a parody, and not a comedy! What is funny about this movie is that it starts with the guy saying he has "blood" (blood is literally the way to show how scared the protagonist is) and that he has done some bad things with the girl "Kara" but he has not stopped and has become a monster to run a million dollar business with the only girl he can't.  He has done to a lot of stuff with his "blood", killing people, leaving people alive to try and eat, even killing people's pets. Even his daughter loves him but that is not her.  When it comes to violence, he starts to yell and yell at people and then he starts stabbing his fingers through the air and trying to bite people. Then he goes and kills everyone with an electric knife, which makes him look even uglier. He has so many crazy ways to kill people, including shooting a man on the floor and stabbing a man in the head, causing him to get killed, and he keeps turning and cutting people off. There is no rhyme in it. You get used of this crap after awhile and you feel sick.  The film isn't good at all. It is funny and disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this for about a week or so, and laughed when it was in the previews. And it has to be seen and read, not for amusement but for a truly awful movie that's so badly acted, stupid, and has a VERY bad story. I also don't know where to start, which is the way it was shot, but it doesn't need to be read like a drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I have seen this movie at least 100 times. It's not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was probably the worst one I've ever seen. The acting was so bad I had no idea who the girl was talking or who was saying it. I didn't even bother to watch the whole thing. I also found out that some of the voice actors made a couple of stupid remarks about how not all American women should care about their children. One of them said she had some bad acting that was pretty silly. I think she should have left her acting career in that movie, but she was in an acting school.  Also, the whole movie made no sense. There was no scene where we watch this kid in a house in New York. And there wasn't any scene where she was running around a house with the kids. I have nothing to say about her children, but I was surprised that they could even survive the whole show.  If you have nothing else going for your movie, you should watch the original one, the 1990 version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The characters are all completely preposterous and not in the same way as the ones in the other versions of the show. The idea of having to find a woman to be this woman was ludicrous. The ending is not quite satisfactory... at the moment I still couldn't find a good ending... I don't think that I'd be able to describe it as good. The scene where the wife is sitting in the bedroom is terribly stupid. She doesn't even look at the husband's face but at the next scene she does it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has the worst script I've ever read.   I really think it's one of the worst films I've read - it's really bad. I can't believe the director of this film had nothing to do with the script. But what the hell is the story? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not read the script but I do know that the movie was bad as well as the acting. It was supposed to be a comedy but I found it to be quite sad - especially since the ending. The acting was not funny, and the acting was poor and the dialog was not clever.  A must spend my time to finish it and never watch this film again. I was going to enjoy it for the first few minutes so I thought I could get a few laughs but then I got sucked away and didn't want to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very impressed with the video, for the first of five parts. But it's still bad. It is so slow and boring. They're constantly hitting their own voices and never actually take anything in. The lead actor seems to have been doing all of this for the other person. I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or if there's anything to do with the actor. But I guess that she got to keep him in the middle of it and never get to enjoy the other voices. I think she probably got to be in on the last scene, and at some point it's just all too frustrating. But if you like the show, you'll just think she's acting too harshly, and even though it looks good, the actors and the voice actress seem to have fallen from some sort of mental disorder. They really don't act like people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mother tried so hard to convince me to go to this movie. I found out there is a good one and a bad one. I decided that I had to go in and watch it. Sadly it's not an accurate depiction of what it would have been like in the 1950's and it does not hold true to the film. The women who played the role were all over acting, acting in the first person and acting in front of the other people. If you like to see that in movies then try your luck. But the woman with the "guy" looked a bit silly as she got the part. That's it all you need to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it on youtube the day I was starting to watch it again...this movie was way worse than the "The Movie" which I liked because it was hilarious, and it was also very disturbing. I did see one good line, and I just want to be in a movie with a bad actor (like the "Maniac".   "Hear me, I Hear Him" could have been a funny movie if it had been a full-length documentary! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry I thought I was watching the original, but I guess I was. The plot is about a family that's in an unhappy relationship with their son. Then, when they realize the son has had sex with another women, the father is so upset he can't stop looking at the woman and the son's wife and the husband's wife. He starts to think about how to fix it, which brings him and the family back to the beginning. It's a really poor film and I hope no one reads it to understand the difference between the two protagonists.  The most disappointing thing about this movie is that it isn't even slightly funny. I guess they are trying to make the two characters laugh, but it is really impossible to do so, which is why they are in the same situation. I really need a different movie and something more realistic. This movie had a little bit of potential, but you can't get past the fact that the plot is stupid and is about nothing but really bad.  I also wish I could see something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have not seen this movie in a movie theater you will never know how bad this movie is.  This film was terrible for a lack of a decent plot and decent acting. It was absolutely awful with some of the acting being pretty weak. The people that don't understand how to act were probably the funniest of the movie. In a positive review I'd probably add the other actors in the movie including the person in the restaurant that wasn't even a part of the storyline. There is a lot of false advertising that includes "the first line" (this was the line that came out of the story, when I first saw the movie). But to be honest, this movie was supposed to have at least some appeal and some degree of entertainment. In the end I was disappointed and didn't get to see more of it. I will recommend nothing for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't care what the plot was in this film, but I thought that the acting was very odd. And I have to say, the female characters don't even make sense, and I believe that they were supposed to be more intelligent and more intelligent than the males. They couldn't even communicate to each other. The scenes seemed to get worse as the movie progressed, but still the characters seemed to be a bunch of annoying, stupid, and very sad people. I'd never even noticed the story about how the women got together and they finally decided to leave their relationship. What a bunch. I don't like this movie at all, even if you like romance and sex scenes, but if you want to get into a romantic relationship film without a story, then you have to look for something else. This was definitely an anti-romedy, but a low-level action/thriller type film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Bunch" stars a handsome man in a bad neighborhood, a couple of guys who are very bad.  Two girls have fallen on some bad boys, and one of them is in a coma.  The next day, we see the news of a bad guy (named "Tearhead") coming to town to make his name famous. He kills people, and goes to town claiming to be a "thief" or "a "fugitive" or a "shady" or  He is, I believe, a real big fish. He steals, and he's gonna steal so much that people are afraid of him.  He kills everyone, so many people in the town that they don't even know who he really is, and so many of those people who died are afraid. The town has been named a "murderer" or, as the show writer suggested, a "slum."   In the show, the big fish is a pig. A pig does not require being on this show.  In real, he is an animal, and people use him as a human form. Some people are killed by him, others killed by a pig, and others have their hearts cut out.   His body is covered with hair, and blood dripping from his skin is pouring out of his chest. He is covered in red, with blood dripping out of the skin on his head.  Other parts of his body are covered in blood, and his mouth is covered. There are a lot of people who want to try and burn him to death. They hit his body with a stick, or throw some sort of fire at him. People get on the show just so they can see it. The girls are going to get him for a while, because he is so bloody, and they can smell his body.  After killing everyone, the girls have to go in search for his head, so they don clothes to see if he has any blood or other organs. One of them tries to tie him up with a rope, but he's dead right in front of her, so it doesn't happen. They also try to force the girl to see the pig, but she doesn't want to tie her wrists, so she cuts a hole in his chest, and it doesnno. It kills two girls, and the blood goes straight to the pig.  There is one of the town's resident guys. The guys are very good,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a weird, over-bored, pretentious film to the worst movies ever made. They are the main characters that are supposed to be on the film. They have nothing in common, and they aren't even related to each other. They don't have a plot! No dialogue, no character, no real plot. They're just a bunch of actors and their "friends". They get into each other's shoes for reasons.  The film is about a drug dealer. The drug dealer dies from a drug overdose. We then find out that the drug dealer was murdered, and that it was because the drug was involved in his death. What a weird story!  When these two characters meet, it becomes clear that they are really in the same position as the person they just met. That they are friends, friends with the drug and drug dealer's family. This is followed by the murder scene, which shows no real reason why they both murder and just get in the way of their friend's mouth. It's just another scene that is presented to a young teenager who's never seen a movie before, and it never plays out. The film becomes a drag, because there's nothing there. The actors don't really get to do their jobs, the actors don, and the actors are never really involved in a plot.  This is probably one of the worst films I've ever made, and if I were serious about it, I would make a video of it and tape it for public viewing. But it's so bad that it is so hard to watch. I mean, I mean you might really enjoy it, but it's just kind of pointless. It is bad, the only good part is the parts that are there, but there's no reason to watch this movie. It just a weak film that just doesn't have the sense of seriousness needed for a movie like this. It really has a pretty bad premise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never been to the movie and just got curious. I wanted to see it, but this didn't come out. After the end credits, I checked to see the number of people who could make it through. It turns out to be a very low number of "woo" people who would like to make an action film about a movie that was nearly an hour and a half.  It was very bad. The plot was weak and there were no plot developments. I can't blame it on the director (the man in the background) but it's just a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horror film was never supposed to be scary. This film was horrible. It was an odd story. There are monsters and monsters, and they come out from the sky and will kill you. The zombies are all horrible, and the main character's a monster and the only person who can get scared. This movie could have been a fun horror film. Unfortunately, it was the most disappointing thing I've seen from Disney. This is about the worst I've ever seen. The gore was so bad that it didn't make the movie seem real. I don't know what the director was trying to do. The soundtrack was bad, and I could barely hear the characters' voices. I can easily see a better version of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am still looking for this movie to get another viewing. I don't know what it has to do. The plot is bad and the acting is bad. My hopes were that I would be able to enjoy this movie if it was worth watching. It was disappointing that I ended up never having to finish this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I went out to see "Numbelver," I was expecting to find some good jokes. I was disappointed.  "Nimbler" is the first movie that has a title that I can recognize from the title of the previous movie. Unfortunately, there are no jokes in this one. It is the worst movie I have seen. If you were hoping for a joke, you will not be disappointed. But, if you want a comedy, you might as well skip the movie, which is actually a disappointment to any comedy fan.  The main story is pretty simple - there is an ordinary person who dies to avenge his death. He then finds out that there is someone in the town that needs his blood to put him in charge. The man decides to hire some big guns to kill his father, and he also decides to kill them. However, the town is not too well known about the murderers in the area and the police don't do anything about it. I don't know why, but it is obvious.   The plot goes on for days, but I was hoping that the actors were decent, like Woody and Jack. As it goes on, it becomes apparent that none of them are very good actors, not even Woody. When the main character finally becomes involved in killing the guys, the plot starts to lose its appeal.  What makes the movie worse is the fact that the movie itself is simply bad. The characters are nothing more than just "some guy", who is on a mission to get revenge. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it had been my child, it would have been great. The kids would have killed people. The acting was awful, the dialog was a complete joke and the movie felt like an episode of a soap opera. The ending was bad to the point of destroying the whole premise of the movie! So, the movie ended up not being that bad but, unfortunately, I'll probably never watch this movie anymore. The only good part about this movie was that there were two cool moments of the story. One is a little bit like the beginning. In the beginning, the "honey" guy was making it seem like a soap-opera, and the other was a soap soap-couple who's a genius and apparently a genius. However, the ending ended up becoming completely unrealistic and unbelievable. The dialog was good, the acting was alright, and some of the funny lines were funny. However... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You might as well have seen this review from the review of an bad movie, and you would not understand the difference. There's an awful script which is a complete embarrassment to a mainstream movie: the characters are simply awful. There are very few lines in the script, and the camera-show is so bad that it looks like a piece of garbage. I really want to say that they were directing the movie badly, but that's not necessarily a big reason to not care.  There are many, and very few, dialog.  One plot scene is a long sequence of "dish" jokes. I find this extremely hard to watch, and I cannot understand how anyone would even care. This movie has a few decent points, but the script is just a huge drag.  It should probably be avoided. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I don't even have the slightest interest of watching it. I think there is an interesting premise in this film, but it doesn't quite deliver. The plot and the acting is just bad and so lacking of charisma that even the ending turns me off. There is nothing to have gained from this movie, in fact, what it does is rather pointless. There are many, many and difficult philosophical statements, the most of them are very preachy and simply irritating. I would probably avoid this movie if there were a sequel. But don't do that sort of thing unless you really love the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this movie because I read the reviews, but the ending was just... a waste of time. I felt like it was an unfinished movie. And if you can't understand the movie without seeing the trailer, watch the film, or something else.  It was the only film i really wanted to see. And I'm not sure if it will ever get to the point, but this movie needs to have one star. There is only one person in this movie.  This movie needs an actor. A real actor. I was hoping there would be a better movie out there. I thought the director was good, but he did a really poor job with this movie, and didn't care for the time that he spent. I also felt like the actor, but not very believable.  The ending should never of have been there. The fact that the film is bad is not a problem, but it is an unfair condemnation of a good movie that didn't get to where it wanted to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the DVD version of this movie on youtube. It's funny, but it's not funny, it's funny-like, and it's just so bad. It doesn't help that the acting in the movie is bad! It turns into a bad parody of a movie that actually made it pretty good!  The whole movie is an insult! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first night of watching, I decided to watch again. The problem was that I don't have a sense of plot...I'm not a kid, and I am supposed to be a film buff. If I had seen it, I would have understood exactly what the script was about.  The whole thing is made-up. There were no real characters, no real story, no characters that you actually follow, etc. It's all in place. The only thing that matters is the sex and violence.  I think the writer simply got tired, and he wanted to prove a point with his new material. The end is just to say that it's just about as good as he had used to make. There is nothing else, and not even a point of interest.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has been released in the worst state it has ever been. it doesn't come out that well for the first two or three times but i'm still thinking about it so i will keep watching it. it takes a half hour to get to see everything. i do hope that a good movie like this one might make some good films. in addition it's stupid and predictable and very bad for the viewer. it's pretty obvious in its awful nature how the characters are behaving. it should be better. it would probably make a better horror. the plot is pretty stupid. i didn't like it so much but it made me laugh. the soundtrack is terrible. its a really bad movie and a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot itself was not bad, and I found some of the scenes pretty amusing, but the rest of it was lacking. I was bored most of the time by the fact that every movie had a subplot, and there were many of these scenes that left me wondering what were the others supposed to be doing? It was not funny!  And the main problem with it was that he could do something that would make a major plot spoiler seem reasonable, and he couldn't get the dialog out of it.   A lot of the movie was confusing, I found it very confusing at times. I had a very bad sense of this film from the beginning to the end. I even had to cut short some of it because of how well it was structured. The plot was a simple one, but his character seemed to be able to do very many things, which I found annoying. He never seemed like the person he was supposed to portray. The actors weren't competent enough, the camera was bad, not worth much of the film's time, and the acting was very bad. He seemed like he wanted to be in this movie, and since he was in a movie, he could act.  I wasn't able to see what was happening in this story. He didn't really get involved in the story, and it seemed to come back to him in the end, in a more ambiguous way than the beginning of the plot. It seems like the story is so complex that he had no real motivation to do this, and his actions were very obvious. There wasn't much to care for this movie from the rest. But what was this movie supposed to have been? He seemed to want to be an actor, and perhaps it was to get revenge for himself? He could be a great actor, but I find him too stupid to be a good actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I guess there are some people who have seen the movie and they are thinking that this movie is good. I disagree with you. The movie's very bad at all. I know I'm not an adult, but I can have a good movie. But this movie's got nothing for it. This movie is totally bad. There is no suspense, no plot, no direction, no action, and no acting. The acting is poor. It is painfully hard to watch someone act without any purpose or motivation, and I think the acting in this movie just screams of apathy and just plain stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't mind people saying that it was good or even that it is funny, but I am highly skeptical. I'm about to rent it for $6. I'll be hoping that the bad jokes won't be as bad as they are in this one. I've seen more than a dozen jokes in "The Hangmen" that could have been made for a $10 movie.  I'm not even laughing, and the acting isn't good, and it's not even funny, either.  What the hell is this? It's like the movie that has Al Sharpton, and is one of the worst comedies ever made. I donno longer see it as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it's almost an Oscar nomination, because this is so ridiculously bad. There's no funny scenes, no jokes, no plot, no suspense, no dramatic ending. The plot is so predictable it hurts my brain. I'm not really a movie buff, but it's just so bad. This film is way too long and hard to watch in a movie. It was so bad my brother was actually laughing at it when it was over. I don't have any words to describe it, but I didn't want to. The story just isn't even funny. I just wanted to call the title "The Naughty Little Man". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After some of my friends told me of the bad movie I watched, i had to agree with them that it wasn't worth watching but it's kinda funny anyway. I would have rather watched this kind of "Gentlemen" type of movie. It just wasn't well filmed for the most part. There were a lot of parts of this movie that were confusingly put together from the end and the beginning scenes. The ending sequence seemed to have come from a dream which they weren't even in the same state. The only one that really seemed interesting was the scene where we are in the hall where we saw the dog fly through a mirror into a different world. This was just an ordinary bad movie. In a few parts of the movie they were funny enough, in others they were kinda boring. But the movie never really made sense. The movie really had to be rated as a gillerillerillerile film. If you want to watch this one, don't waste your money and just look at it like a movie: http://youtu.com/mockyandhumblepieshowdowhueso...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find myself quite unimpressed. I find it more depressing than most things I am used to find it. Some time I'd like to see this movie, some time I would like to get my mind ready to absorb the full message. That doesn't happen because the film is terrible.   If you are still reading this, don't get my point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so sad I could even call it a remake. It's very unedictive and really not very funny, but it isn't very funny. I really liked the first one, which was a comedy, a funny movie, but I couldn't say anything about this one. This one was just plain depressing. It is just plain weird and a bore. I can't say that about a comedy though.  There were some cute moments. I found myself laughing at some of the humor in this movie, though. But when you really find yourself to get annoyed by this movie's antics, the movie becomes really stupid. When I stopped laughing I found my skin raw to be dry from all the acting, and the movie itself is really pointless. It should be a parody of some sort, but the first thing I noticed was that one character (or at least one of the three main characters) had this very stupid mouthpiece that is almost a gag line. This is the same gag line when people say, "Stop trying to find the right words.  Other characters are stupid, but that's how these movies are supposed to be. I would give this movie a 10 rating because it's pretty funny. But don't expect to be entertained by this one, and don't listen to it. The only thing I can say is that the first movie was actually better than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, with the talent of Kevin Miller and a lot of unknown cast members (who I would have thought could have been interesting to have gotten roles in it) is so bad it's not worth watching, and I am very careful about what movies I watch.  I'm just going to say that I will never go see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After all the hype and praise was good for "Bachelor Who Would Want To Be A Big Guy." it could be worse. I found the acting too simplistic and there were too many of bad lines. The ending was an attempt to add something more to the movie by using some of the same material as the original "Bucklet Eye" movies. It had to be some sort of an amalgamation of "Bills are Big" and "Buddy Dewey" since the two movies were very similar and both had a lot of good lines in the first movie. The first thing that struck me was the movie was really bad at first. There were too few jokes in it. The only one I found funny was the ending. The movie didn't really make much sense. The storyline seemed to have a backstory of a story that was much longer than the original. I am a writer. "Buffy Who Would Like To Be a Big Guy" is not a good film and I can't recommend this movie much more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't like this movie. I like people to take chances. I don't want to be a cynic.  The director was obviously an idiot, I was expecting a funny and witty film. But I wasn't surprised. I was the last person to laugh. The story was stupid. The characters weren't funny, and the storyline was unbelievable and disappointing.  But the really bad part is the acting. There's no character development and all characters were stupid.  They didn't have any character development, and all were just annoying to watch.  Even the actors who played the characters were good, just were the worst actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on a really bad, unoriginal, and uninspired idea of a family holiday. A couple of high schoolers fly off from the island and have to travel to the mainland to see them other high school kids. The old couple goes to Japan to see their old friend, who seems to think they have won this adventure. When he gets them to the island they go to the Hotel "Chouzo", and of course they stay there. The family is unhappy at this place because they are so bad off, and the kids are so unhappy with each other. One of the old kids is actually really a jerk, and some of the younger kids do worse than the other. But the other kid is really a good friend, and he has a great love for the old couple, and his brother was a friend of mine, so it's kinda difficult to judge who's right and who's left, but it seems to be the kids all. It has a few bad acting, but some good ones, so that could be a good movie if they just made it. I'm still hoping they can improve their lives by making good movies like this one, and they should make the next one a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director (George Miller) has produced a very bad film with a pretty decent cast. I don't care what the film is like, but it's pretty obvious that it isn't. I do understand why this film was created in the first place. I'm a huge fan of the Star Trek franchise, and don't really care for a poorly constructed film that doesn't tell any story. But this film lacks even the basic elements that made the first series, and I hope that if this film doesn't get the attention it deserves, then the writers will be forced to work a lot harder to write and direct better, much sooner than the people who made the series.  It's disappointing and disappointing to see such a good movie never being released. But I really don't expect the people at CBS that made this film to care for it, or even want to, because they knew how it would ruin the franchise. They tried to avoid the responsibility of being responsible for the messes they made. The film should be used to be made and be given the respect it deserves. If it gets out, we'll just have to watch this for the amusement it can bring. It's a huge waste of money, and even worse, it looks like an unfinished work that should never get produced. Don't waste your time thinking it to be good or funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning, it seemed as if we were to expect that this movie had some great ideas, but it never delivered. I'm sure the movie was supposed to be funny, but even when it wasn't funny, it failed to entertain me. I didn't mind the fact that it appeared a little girl with her father, but I just wish the movie hadn't got that far from me. Even if I can't watch it, it still sucks for you and you're just doing it for the time. It was definitely a bad film and I couldn't see the point to watch it again.  In a positive review about bad movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed in this film, I found it much funnier than the other movies I've seen. The acting was really awful and I couldn't find any humor. This is probably the worst film I've ever seen, with the acting. I didn't know I would have missed many of the funny moments. I also find that the acting is terrible, and the story is not very interesting. I usually like comedies, but when I came to see the acting in this movie, it didn't work for me. If you want to laugh, don't! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no more than two stars, with a few good actors. The story is interesting, but the main characters are the two guys, one who is supposed to be the head of the house and the other who is the wife.  The premise is not much interesting, the girls are not good actors and the guys are very flat, but their characters are interesting. The plot is weak. The only thing I was surprised about was the lack of money and the fact that most of the actresses are pretty good in their roles. I usually enjoy watching good actresses, but these guys weren't all good. I think this is a bad film. It could be interesting, or just a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few good points in the movie, such as a very funny and witty, but the director's direction is the worst. The jokes are never funny, they are just completely uninterested, and the dialog is not funny. The direction is also very dull and does not go anywhere funny. But there are many good points too. The ending is especially depressing, and I wish it was a comedy.  I also wish the movie were a funny, but there is nothing funny in the film. I don't know what the director thinks of me. They could improve the film by adding something funny and funny, or better story line, such like a funny Christmas card, for example.  In the meantime I'm hoping someone will spend the money on a good movie: The "In a Jar" is the most disappointing film ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the feeling that this film was not only an entertainment-of-the-Bane kind of a film, but instead was a piece of a poor movie that lacked any credibility. I think that the director/director/writer has done a very poor job in making a movie that could be classified as a "comedic" film. And in the end I feel that the writer/director might have made some funny remarks (that they might have done in the movie) but they were just not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film before. I have no idea what this film is. I think it's just a bunch of people who have seen the movie. The actors don't look normal, they all seem to be acting on autopilot. I can't believe it's a serious effort of a film. What's the point? Just like all of the other Hollywood films that have the same problem, these people just want to be bored.  I don't like this movie. It looks like it's in some sort of "HOTWINK" film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 3 movies i saw in my childhood had good stories and action. The 4th one was pretty bad, which I found out about when I saw it, on HBO. I saw this movie in my 20s, so I didn't really expect it to be anything of the kind. I also saw it on DVD. The movie starts at the beginning of the movie and becomes a story that is not credible. I know I know what happened, I know who did it, but i don't think this is even close to being realistic. There is no realistic ending, it is just a complete story, so it's not really like a film. And it doesn't have any sort of plot, so you are supposed to be thinking, 'If this is a film, I should be thinking so and so about it.' Then this movie comes out with it's own plot. When I got to watch it again, I tried to make it believable by making some of the dialog at the start. It's not just random, it's kind of corny. I think a better movie would use real dialog that was believable, and there are certain scenes that make the movie a lot better than the movies it was made before. If I didn''t know any more, I'm afraid to even go to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The ending is very weak and is not really worth any money. The only redeeming feature was the acting which was fine, and I could not find the other two. It was too contrived to be believable and there was too much filler to have any good fight scenes. If you read the books they do give an impression that this was a story but not a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had to compare the ratings for this movie with the movies in the 70's.  If you watch this film as a horror film, you'll be sucked in as much as the movie of the 70s.  You won't even think about watching it in the middle of a car ride, and when the next car ride is over, you think about skipping a movie.  The reason for this being the worst rated horror/thriller film ever made is because it is so bad. There's no suspense whatsoever, just flat out horror, just plain horror, that doesn't make anyone even think there's anything to like this movie. There is absolutely no suspense, no suspense. There isn't even a hint of what's really going on in the film, even as a short drama is being made in it. What makes this movie seem worse than any of the other movies is that the director has done a lot of work on other horror films over the years, and the movie really is just a horror movie. The director is obsessed with how he has to make everything go down in a slow, predictable manner, just so you have to be bored and have fun.  There is no suspense in the movie, even if you have absolutely zero clue what's happening and know the plot before the movie has ended, which is why this is the worst. It's just too painful to watch. Even if the director is a horror director, you could probably get bored and not care too much.  Also, this is a bad film for a very young audience, too young, not only because it's not the most exciting horror movie, but it is just not entertaining.  Even if you like the plot and characters in the previous movies, it is hard to watch, but if you just watch it for the horror element alone, it just isn't fun to watch and the story is poorly crafted. The story is just bland, not suspenseful.  I'm sorry, I'm a horror fan of movies of the '70's, and I know why it's just so bad, but even the movies of these days are okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Death of the Bride" is an extremely bad sequel that is only slightly interesting. I laughed the first time I saw it. There is an awful story line that has a couple of interesting endings that are not all that important. There are several ludicrously exaggerated portrayals of the death of the bride. It is so bad that I would avoid even seeing it if I were scared of a guy who died on their wedding. If you have nothing else to do with this film, I highly recommend watching it as quickly as possible.  I do not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is so bad that I actually laughed, this movie is so stupid and stupid!  The characters are so boring, the acting is so terrible, the characters are stupid, the special effects don't matter, there is no sense in making special effects. The special effects were so ridiculous that I felt like watching it again.  I feel like it was just an excuse to waste money, but it was in fact an hour long and made no effort at all to make it entertaining or funny. I recommend watching a DVD, or even a trailer, and it may not be a great film, but you'd be able to enjoy more than 4 minutes of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie about two or three times on the Internet and thought that it was really bad. It was so bad that I stopped watching it and don't think I could even understand it. My impression of the movie is that this movie is not very funny, so bad it is. My friend was really nice on the TV and I laughed at the stupid stuff they were talking about. They made this film without a director. I mean, seriously, why would the director do something like this? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot goes on. There are an obvious connection between the children of an evil little monster. It is then a year for the children to escape the clutches of evil.  There are some amusing moments and the movie does contain some decent acting. It just feels like a rubbish horror film. There is nothing that could have done anything in terms of acting, directing or anything really.  I have to admit that it does contain something interesting, but only a small portion.  It starts off looking like a film of some sort of horror with a very thin budget. A man is put under an incredibly restrictive suit and he gets to the edge of the sofa on an empty chair, which causes him to throw a chair at his crotch. The boy who is on this room is looking at the camera with tears in his eyes, and says, "I want to get a lot of sleep, but I'm scared." The movie goes on like a regular horror film for over half an hour. There seems to be no story about how it really happened, nor how it is meant to end, but it appears that some kind of supernatural force is involved.  We don't even get some answers. There's nothing in the movie about how the evil entity is doing it, but we know that its evil is real and he is doing his very real job - killing people.  The movie is full of old-fashioned horror clichés, but they are designed to evoke a kind of old feeling. We have to understand what it is, what it has been done, and if we're afraid, we can fall right into the traps. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not good and should be thrown off as soon as I find out that it contains a major plot. As it is, this movie is simply a bunch of old horror movies from the 60's that has been turned into a sequel which has been directed by Chris Willis.  I think that's pretty obvious. They were just used for a plot to give a bad ending to this movie.   If you're a horror movie purveyor this movie should be rejected and the end is a horrible and disappointing ending.  If anything, please put this movie off, at least take it for a short time, and enjoy it while it lasts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of The Matrix and even with all my life experience it sounds like a good movie, but I think that the way the cinematography was and how it looked just didn't quite give me the feeling that I expected from the show. I don't really know why, but it sounded pretty dumb. I'm really disappointed and don't like the show as much as the TV shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i watched it, my first video viewing was my 9th. i was thinking if there would be more entertaining stuff in this movie: but this is pretty terrible. it was really disappointing for me that it was so bad. my best friend laughed at it, and so did my sister. i just wanted to finish the movie, not to waste my time watching. i hope my friend was bored by the video, but if i was, it would be the worst thing ever. i knew it wasn't like an animation before and it doesn't matter how good it is or how stupid it is. it is just a bad way to spend time, and i am glad my sister didn't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't stand in front of the camera. It was just a waste of time. In order to make money, the movie had to take a million time to put it together. I think it's an excuse why the producers put their money in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What are they doing? If you ever doubt it, try it on YouTube. Or try it the very same way on Youtube.  So I think I should be one of their fans. However this movie was a bit entertaining and not bad, but it seems to be lacking some of the things that made the old "Hangley" movies such as an interesting story. Also the acting was poor to say. Some of the dialog was very bad, the story was totally forgettable and it seemed to be something that could have been, as it is, forgotten. But hey, maybe the good people of the world didn't notice it and think the movie was funny. And even some of them seemed to like it better than the old movies.  I do not understand why people didn't like this movie. I mean it is obviously a waste of money. There are no good actors, no good songs, no interesting movies. The main point of the movie is that it is just another horrible movie. You can rent it anywhere else, but you won't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a horrible movie, in the worst way imaginable. A really bad film, and the worst thing ever for a comedy: one of the greatest actors I've ever seen in my life got involved with the other guy who made it. They were about to start making fun of it so I thought I'd listen to it, and I listened, and it just...it was bad. The plot is simply terrible, the acting is bad, and there's really no decent or decent point to it whatsoever. A couple of stupid jokes, a few weak characters, and a bad premise. There were also a really stupid ending and the whole thing made me sick, even.  I can't even tell if they were joking. It should have been taken out by the censors, not by the producers. And then there is no plot, really. The ending had so many ridiculous lines that I couldn't get into the story. I have to say, even though I don't think they're funny, I could get through 10 minutes of the movie without laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, as soon as I get home I get this movie. I look at the story and the characters are the same, and the acting is worse than I expect it to be.  I don't want to believe the writer was an actor and did this for entertainment. The way he wrote the plot was terribly contrived. The characters were terrible, they were predictable, and if you know the plot and the way they're delivered they'll ruin the movie. The main reason I liked this movie was for a certain reason, but that's not enough. This is a piece of crap. I was really disappointed because it got to me as soon I was home. I donth expect it will see much further. If you want a horror/thriller movie that's actually good, check it out. The movie was way to much of a shocker, but don't expect it'll see much more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to see a version of this film. Unfortunately, it wasn't until I saw it on the screen that I realized how bad it was. I could tell it had been filmed by a 13-year-old girl with a bad hair gel. I'm a 30-year old woman with a hard time with these movies, and this movie just let me down and didn't get any better. Maybe the director and writer had done some of the work. It just doesn't seem worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I should be embarrassed when the writer came out with a photo of this film. I laughed at the first time I watched it. I'm glad I laughed and laughed at it. But what's a big picture? The director and producer didn't care. We knew that our time had been wasted and there wasn't a single person in the house who seemed excited. We thought it was a great movie because it was so bad - but it wasn't. We laughed because it wasn' so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a bunch of terrible acting. The actors are bad. The dialog was so poor that the film was less enjoyable than an ordinary horror film.  Also, the camera was a disaster, especially the camera moves on too quickly, or too slow to see.  The movie is so bad that I'd be interested in the idea of a horror flick featuring a very good acting in this direction. I have to believe that this director has not really watched horror movies.  I hope that this movie has the misfortune of becoming the "Trollhead" in the world. I'm looking to see a remake of the film, or even a sequel, of this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie from the video store. I had no idea what the movie was about. It's horrible...I mean, it's bad for your entire life... it's not even good for yourself. It needs to be the movie for you, not just the family. It should be for your first marriage. It has been in the past 10 months! It's just a pathetic excuse for the family of a married man to rent a movie. If you can't stand it because you'll lose the money, then get a movie with a good ending! Don't rent it...because it will only make you unhappy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are watching this film, and like it, you will get an extremely bad movie with no plot, characters, or special effects. This is bad on every level. You cannot understand the characters at all, and even the main character seems to be a little bit less than they are in the other films. I think that the director and production crew were not the right kind of people, or that this film is too far from the normal "mature film". If you look at this film and the "maturation film" in the future, I recommend you look to see something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie started as a small horror flick about a young female who has been found guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to serve time in prison for life and is haunted by a male murderer (also in a role similar to the original) who is obsessed with her and is responsible for murdering her in every way, and the only thing that keeps this movie alive is the actress's body in the wooden box. It's a horrible film and I think that one of the producers should be arrested for committing suicide and sentenced for life.  The plot is so bad that it should have to be an hour before and before you can enjoy it. I hope that the creators have tried to salvage the original concept and make the next movie better. Otherwise I think there should be a better movie like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I sit here in front of this, I find myself being unable to decide how bad it is, and what is the reason why it is so bad? The worst thing in the world is the acting. The characters are not properly developed, the stories are not well structured, and they don't follow any of the rules. It's almost impossible to follow what the hell is happening. I was thinking about how this movie was made in a high school cafeteria in Georgia and I think it looks pretty terrible, and my friends made the same mistake as I did, but when we go to the movies I remember them and the scenes are OK, but the films are not good and the actors are not believable.  The worst part about this film is the plot, which is absolutely stupid, and the acting is OK for the worst film I've ever seen, and not in any way worth the same as movies with the talent they produce. I really don't understand what this movie is about. It reminds me a bad film I saw when I was in high school and had never seen it again, even though it has been over 10 years since it was released, but it was definitely a bad remake of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing left to say about this film. It is not well made. The acting is laughable at best.  One of the most terrible films ever.  I have watched it twice and wish I had never seen it. But it does not make the list of my favourites for the movie world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have really enjoyed this movie from its inception. And unfortunately, it is about as bad as some of the TV shows like The Simpsons and The Smoked Monkey's Ghost. It is not a great film at all but just a very bad remake of the same movie from the 90's. Some of the old shows that have been made are interesting in a certain sense but these shows are not exactly like the films from the 1990's. Also, they are just sort of dumbly put-in movies for a show to produce and they don't even do the original research of the original actors.  One thing that should make you stop watching this movie is the fact that this movie was made to make a point about the changing of the age of America. Of course this film is not about changing society but the idea of changing society to one single man. The movie also seems to blame this man for the deaths of millions of people in the country because he was the one person that can help you out in time. What about all those people who died? Well, you know the answer to my question, but it really wasn't the best of the "Giant Loaf" movies. The other main reason this movie should be banned was the fact the guy played by John Dolan. He was obviously one of the best actors of the entire 90's (in my opinion) and one of my favorites. I think the film would have been better if they had allowed the rest of the cast to do their job, which they could have done just fine. I also think the original script, as well as the direction, had some good potential. But when they did this, they made it so bad that I would never want to watch this movie. I was hoping it would make it an interesting film to watch, but unfortunately, I felt like it was just a lot of cheap jokes from a bad film.  I am a huge fan of movies from the late 70's and early 80's, but I always wish they would make those movies, like those from "The Simpsons". I just think they could do a better job in making movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a very sad man. If I had to watch this movie again I would give this movie a low rating. This movie is a poorly planned, well, planned, predictable, and extremely stupid movie. I have to give it credit for keeping me awake, and I thought the plot was good, but the plot couldn't follow. The plot is a piece of trash, the dialog is bad, and the dialog was bad. The fact that the heroines were killed in a fire is not a happy event, it was more a moral question. How do they know they were in a movie? The acting is terrible, and they're not even acting. You just need to laugh and weep, and give it to somebody else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie over 40 times, and each time it's just as bad as the movie in the trailer. It is just as much to kill me as the original "The Punisher" film. I just think that I'm being oversensitive. I can't make out this stuff in any reasonable manner. I believe that these "gang leaders" have been given the full title of "The Criminator", and this movie is based on it. But I know that in the "Criminator" story they are just a gang leader, like the "Black Widow", who they'd use in the plot. I think there is no reason to think that a gang member would want to be a leader to a group like "The Black Widow". He's just an individual. I really couldn't see any reason to care for him. He's been clearly rejected by the rest of the gang, but I can see no reason why he's accepted by the "criminator" gang to go after those who have rejected him. If a gang of gangsters that's a gangmember, they're only going to get some kind of action/murder-type atmosphere, but in real life they just want to go to prison to kill people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was supposed to be a film, and I really liked it when I saw it on TV. Unfortunately, there's just so little plot and nothing interesting about the characters. There's also a really lame scene where the main character is, well, like a young teenager. He is in a room with a bunch of friends who seem to act more like teenagers. He has no real reason for coming to school; he is just there to be bored. He's in the middle of getting into a fight with a gangster who has a gun.  It would have been better if he and the friends did a bunch for fun instead of fighting.  This film needs to be canceled ASAP. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i can not say that i was ever surprised by this movie, as I wasn't expecting anything to happen in this movie. I just went to watch it for the heck of it and even found myself laughing. I mean, it's just about an hour's worth of time, and I guess it was all one of my fault for watching it, but i cannot say that I didn't laugh, not the single time.  It just a complete piece of garbage, and its so stupid. The story was very confusing and convoluted, not that I can understand it. I really felt like I was being cheated. It's just an excuse to a bad action movie, which unfortunately doesn't even qualify as a comedy. I guess if you are looking to laugh, or enjoy a movie in general, perhaps this movie would be worth the time to rent. But if you simply want to waste time, don't!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand where this movie is supposed to be. Maybe it was one or someones and it could have made it better. And I think it's only got some redeeming qualities.  I think the film was made about a person with a really bad attitude. Not like the movies. This movie is like a giant billboard that never has enough of money to buy anything and the whole thing is just falling apart. But it doesn't matter, because the director never does his job as a director, except for making a movie.  This movie has some interesting plots but that are easily overused. The plot is really a mess, but I guess this movie had an interesting plot to the person who had it. Not really. I had just seen one of the first of the two "fun" films in the world to this day, so I'm not sure why people would even want to see this. This film had only a small chance of making money, but it did give me a good excuse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this film on video tape after seeing it on tape because it was so bad! The plot and dialogue is badly written, it's really a rip-off of "The Thing" by Charles Bronson, the screenwriter of "Big House Buck" and the original film. Also, the music in this film is not very good, it isn't that good for a horror film. The ending is totally pointless, and I think it has to be taken away, since it fails to make any sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very depressed after seeing this film, I cannot find the words to describe this movie. To me, it was just a bad, extremely bad, bad film with no plot, no action, no direction, no character development, no anything, no characters or good actors, just a bunch of stupid characters. The plot was so weak, so bad, so stupid that I was unable to even begin to laugh at the characters.  The other side of this film was very funny, I just couldn't care to see the end. The movie's characters were so unfunny that you would be sick if you got out of it in one minute. I have always known the characters to be real, they're not like other films. The worst part of this movie is, that they used some pretty good music throughout the movie. I don't think the music was in this movie because of the music but the music could have been used to have a better story line. The musical score was stupid. The film was so bad because it had no direction or direction. It just seemed like the characters are acting, but it's not a film at all, just an acting show that just wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was badly acted and contains several subplosities, and fails to make a coherent movie. However, it does have a decent plot, and is entertaining when it works. However the acting in this movie is bad, and the humor of the movie is very weak. I don't understand what this movie was supposed to be about, but what I do understand is that the director never bothered to have a real storyline, and then started creating subplots and other "extra material" to fill the movie. The characters in this film are horrible and are just not interesting, I guess the idea is to just keep going to the bar to see "honey" and "fear" because the only thing that is really funny about this movie has nothing to do with either. The other major problem with this movie (besides the sex, but it makes the movie look a bit too funny, as some say, and has too high a budget) is that it ends on a scene where some of the main characters (the other main characters) are looking at some of their victims. The movie is so poorly done that you can't even recognize it unless you are in the same room with the main actors. The camera is bad as well, the acting is bad on the whole, but the girls are not good. It's just bad, but at least I will never try and see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In case you need me to describe a movie, that's pretty much how it starts. Some people would describe it as a very boring flick. The plot is pretty bad, if that was a synopsis. But the point is that it is not good. If you want to see the movie, it is your best option. Otherwise, you're stuck with the plot, and you're also stuck with all the characters. You really don't need this.  If you like a good movie, don't go to this movie.  It is an insult to everyone who wants a movie to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never liked this movie, and I was shocked to read about the reviews.  It's a bad film in several ways. The characters are unbelievable to me, the acting is poor, the ending is disappointing, the story is awful and it's unbelievable that we can even see it to begin the film.  There are several plot lines that do not make sense. There are even a whole scene with the female character, the lead is a total jerk.  I'm disappointed, it's not funny, but I can't say that for a second. It is just another piece of crap that I cannot even recommend for anyone to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is an example of a very bad movie. what it has is the very basic idea of a love triangle that gives you a lot of pointless nonsense. what else is it? if you find the movie to have any redeeming qualities in it then you are a sucker to the idea. otherwise it's a pretty bad film. if you know the plot of the story and think that it's okay, you are going to have a short and meaningless love triangle, you will also be left with a lot less than one hour to enjoy this movie. I'm hoping it's not this movie's worst but it isn't.  it's also too long and there are too much gore and nudity. it's only okay for movies like this one but if you watch it you will probably think less of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I got to see this film because my husband was taking it off of a bad video store. He saw it for the second time and told me he had seen it 4 times. He said "I didn't understand why this movie is so important to me..." It was really disappointing and I don't like it very much. The plot was predictable. There wasn't a hint of drama for the main character, but the main characters were very predictable. The characters had no charisma, but there were funny moments, which were short and meaningless. There were so many repetitions in the story that it felt like a movie and a series of commercials. The editing was too long, too bad to sit in and watch. There was a really bad video and video quality too. The movie was way too long at times. I gave it an eight out of 10 rating because it wasn't funny or funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really just a poorly produced piece of junk. I've seen many films before I've even read the plot. But it's more depressing than ever. The whole movie is boring, and the acting is so bad. I'm not sure whether it's a joke or a true plot, and if it's true it doesn't matter. It seems to have a story line and is totally devoid of any suspense. And I think the casting is so awful that I'm going to have trouble with any of the actors. The only good thing about the movie was the ending, which was pretty funny. But if you enjoy a comedy or have a laugh, definitely don't see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one was actually very good, but it wasn't very good for a first-rate film.  It was too long and slow, and it had absolutely no real plot. I laughed, as did many people I thought, but I'm not the one that laughed. I'm an adult, and I understand how important the story is, but i really wish I could say more. And that is what makes it so bad. I've seen better before, but even if the story was good, it's so bad for the viewer.  There was no plot, and there wasn't any real emotion, and the acting was horrible.  All of the stars, except for the one who's played as a teenager, are either incompetent or acting for their character.  The script, the acting and even the story were bad, and nothing made me care much.  I don't know if the director did this because he did the excellent film, or because he thought that people would like him, or if he thought he couldn be "an actor". The characters were so predictable and unbelievable that I really didn't like them.  But I'm the one person who liked this film, and i wouldn't say that he's a genius, because he could probably have done better.  If you don't like this film for the wrong reasons, it would definitely not be good, if you'd just watched it for its first-name-only, and you'd liked it for the reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the least interesting that I've seen since I've watched it.  It was the worst film I've ever seen, or even less. It was an absolute garbage that is filled with jokes about sex and killing people. Some people laughed and others didn't. The sex scenes were especially so bad. The gore is really graphic and no one is at all interested in watching gore. This movie is so bad that it makes one of those old-school film critics out.  My rating is 7/10 out of 10. I have the chance to go to an audition in an early screening, so I'm gonna try and rent this movie. I can't really see the acting or feel anything about it. I'm sure that this movie is full of the worst clichés that have ever been put out there. It is also full of people like this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the first 6 episodes in this movie and after reading it I just do the same thing I did. I cannot believe this movie. This is very disappointing, it is so bad that it should not even be advertised. I mean even if you want to see something with all the bells and whistles and fireworks, why would you watch it? This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is bad as well as the acting, the plot is awful and this movie has some cute and funny moments, but not in a serious way and I do not want to hear any more music or have to see this movie again. This movie does not belong to the genre I know but I think it does belong to a specific genre. If you want something with humor, you would probably like a comedy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this film on Amazon (but did see it at my hotel when I went to the cinema. I can barely hear the sound of a cigarette cigarette, I'm not sure if it's even a cigarette or an old pipe, considering the way it was shot. I cannot believe they made this film in the 70's because I don't think it is actually a horror film. There were no screaming scenes, no gore scenes, not even a fire scene. There is no one who is scared. There are a lot of flashbacks about the movie when they are supposed to scare off the men. The plot seems to be pointless - I guess the movie is supposed to be about how they scare off their victims.  But I cannot even think of how this movie is actually frightening. The movie is about how a group of men who are supposed on terror and have to kill off their female counterparts. I don´t understand how such a premise works, and it just turns people into killers and rapists. How would any person want to be afraid? I just think it's just plain plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie and think it sucks, but I do feel sorry for it.  The acting was awful, the acting was so bad that even I wanted to laugh. I'm not sure why I think that this movie was made but it sure doesn't make sense. I thought that the acting had the best of it. The acting and the acting were both so bad. The ending was really disappointing. I think it's really bad because it could have been a funny movie, I just wanted it to be funny and made it funny. I know, because of my expectations, but just watching it, I couldn't understand why they made it so sad.  And the special effects were just really bad, the lighting was bad, it made me think that it was just a horrible movie. In all of the interviews I gave for this movie, it is clear that the people who made it are very inexperienced and don't have experience.  It was definitely an old movie, but it was made because it was a big hit in the industry and got money. As a producer I would probably question why they decided to make it and didn't question. The fact of this movie is that you would be happy if it was hilarious but it is in fact very sad. And I'm really looking at it in my history book just to try and see it again and try to get my opinion of it again. This movie just made it look so much like a parody of the book, it seemed pretty cool when I first saw it. It just wasn't like any of the movies I was looking at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can tell you what the director says, he's trying to make this film look more realistic. The camera is too close. The dialog is stupid, the sound is too loud. There is no plot, no logic to it. The cinematography is bad to say even after it's all done. But I'm still watching it, so I don't expect anything more than an eye roll. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is probably very good at his work, but not on this movie he fails to make up for his mediocre skills. He's not even good on other films.  This movie should be taken as a bad sequel to a good film from "The Good Life of" which was a very good movie. That's because they both fail to make any sense of human morality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty depressed after watching this movie because of how terrible it is. It really didn't work in a nutshell. The plot was pretty weak, and even the ending was pretty ridiculous. The action and gore seemed a bit exaggerated, but they were good at some of the parts. The acting was average, but the actors weren't acting as well as they could have been. I feel like I just watched and watched. There should have been a better ending. It should have ended at some point, but just let the ending continue on the road and keep looking at the characters. I also feel like the actors who didn't end their respective roles in this movie didn't get a chance to do something better.  Overall, I rated this as a 2-10 rating because it wasn't a horror film or anything, and I really had to put my hat on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the first film I watched, I thought it would be a great film - I was not one of those frugal citizens who enjoyed "Cameras," the show that was a huge inspiration to me. After watching it, I felt the film had been lost to me, and that it had been completely ruined by the filmmakers. And even after watching the premiere, I didn't expect much to come out of it. I mean, it's not like anyone who'd ever seen "Dukes of Ham" in a bad way, and I couldn't even pronounce its name, it was just one big mistake. The story, the acting, and the acting were all terrible - the actors were just bad, and there was absolutely no sense of plot, no continuity, and no connection with character development. It really felt like someone had just been thrown off the planet in a galaxy somewhere. I can't believe I'd watched this bad movie in the first place, even after my friend told me that the show had a couple of interesting plots and scenes. But the worst parts of the movie were the ones where the movie starts out about a dead alien lady - a female alien and an Earth person, and you have the alien (the alien) who tries to scare him off with a gun - and then they have sex! And that's the worst part I'd recommend watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not a negative person, I just liked the way it is. I saw some of this in an 8 channel channel DVD set and thought that it was hilarious. I didn't get into this on TV because I didn\'t have anything better to watch. I think most of it was a waste of time and money. I can't speak for anyone else. I have to look at the comments on the website and see what they're saying about this, or find a decent DVD: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to the movie on Friday afternoon and realized that my girlfriend is so embarrassed by this awful movie. I had not seen this movie before and I had a feeling that I had to watch it alone. It's one of those "in movies" movies that is just bad, but if I saw it again I'm sure it won't be worth the time I wasted. I was shocked by the plot and acting (although, there is some good lines in the film). In all other categories, the movie is just horrible, even though I have seen it before. The ending is simply awful. It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened? This movie is just plain terrible. If I don't get the message of the movie, I can only guess it's a Japanese movie. That's all.  It's the acting. The plot is not funny or interesting at all. It's just boring, and very boring. A Japanese person who is half dead can't do better than this film. If you want to know what really happened in the movie: the ending was supposed to have been about how a Japanese person, on some kind of way, could control all the world. What the hell is this movie? It is a really bad movie that does not even make any sense, and could not make any difference in the world, and has nothing at all to do with anything. If this movie would have been one of my favorite movies, it would be overrated and overrated. I didn't like it very much and would never finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't like the others and I have read much comments of people that didn't like it. This movie is awful, and I recommend you to skip it. I don't know if it was a good movie or bad movie. I have come across some comments from people that thought the movie was funny, or that the movie couldn't make any kind of sense. They seem to be just thinking about the movie, and that this movie was so silly that it made them feel good. I can't tell the difference.  If you have watched the movie "Halloween Movie" in the future, I would definitely recommend skipping this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film because I saw the first one. I thought it was an interesting movie in my youth as a kid. I think it should have been for my younger brother, but he is so young that he could never understand what the "unfinished" works were supposed to be. I'm not the youngest brother in this film - I just the closest one to the kid, he was in his early twenties, and I'm the elder sibling. I don't think it's a film that will appeal to anyone. It is an interesting plot, but too shallow and too vague and not realistic. The dialogs were terrible. I mean, the best actors were in the original film. Just not the best. I won't call this one "fun". It's a very bad movie. It doesn't make any effort. It's not funny, and it isn't interesting. It has no decent storyline, no good action, no great acting. In short, no, it's not fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did like the idea of this film as an indie film for the sake of entertainment. But it turned out to be a little too long and very predictable. The main characters are a group of people who are all just friends, the leader is a man who looks like a normal guy, the other characters are all like other actors. They don't really take the lead roles like the ones in the film. The film doesn't even try to be interesting or funny, instead it just has really bad comedy/chilling humor. I don't think this film was designed to be one of these comedies that have a lot of money invested into the story of the movie. There's no story, no story purpose, just a movie with bad humor and bad acting. The idea of having a "fun film" doesn't apply to this kind of film at all. If you're looking for a good movie to rent, look elsewhere. The only way this film is funny is that it has a lot more money invested in the story than it should have had and doesn't make it all that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was an attempt to make a funny and catchy video to show a good movie with no real premise to explain anything. So much was wrong. I'm sure it was made by a bunch of guys that decided to make this stupid, unmemorable video to have a fun. I can understand that it would be better if they made a sequel to "Honey-Sears 2".  But there are no good alternatives to "Snowball's Christmas" for the worst video I've ever seen. The plot is boring. Even the guy who was supposed to be an acting actor got bored and made a lot of lame jokes. It's also very bad. "SnowBall's Christmas", is a very, um, unrated film. I had so many fun to kill off the guys that didn't.  If you want to see the acting of "Snow Ball" from some of the other movies, look at "Swinging", the movie from "The Man Behind the Man" and "The Wild One". Then you'll be glad they don't have to, because it's absolutely awful.   If this movie is just a little boring, you'll probably enjoy "The Jungle King". I had fun watching this one, but just don't see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I wanted to write about it so I would. And so bad, that it doesn't even come close as a good movie, not even as a bad film. The characters were very, er, non-existent, and the plot was stupid. This is the movie where you have your girlfriend, who is a psychopath, you have to rescue them, and when you rescue them the hero is... a hero. I am not a hero, nor am a good guy, but... if you are a good person, you should watch this movie. But if you ARE a villain, or you are going to be a villain or a villain at the end of the movie, then it must have been the worst movie ever made. The ending was so bad that I had to put in my permanent "delete" folder. I was really angry with this movie when it came out. It is very bad for a person who wants to go straight to movie school. I cannot watch this bad movie because it is so obviously an insult to film-making! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the third instal of the movie so far. The third movie in the series is also the worst. It's so bad, that it was considered a comedy but it was really just an over-the-top drama. And it's so hard to find the jokes. The whole movie is full of ridiculous lines. The director must have been trying to hide something from his brain, and it's not very funny to the rest of the cast. The actors don't even have a sense of rhythm to their parts. And the movie is so bad that it's hard to watch. It has a couple of good ideas (like the little boat with a wooden mast, and a fire alarm, and the other part of the boat) but it's just wasted of time. The movie is just so bad! I'm disappointed, but the writer, director and writer sure don't have anything to say.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think that the plot is not good enough as is. this movie doesnt work and a poor actor to the acting. the worst actors i have seen are in this movie because their acting is very weak, the cinematography of this movie is not impressive nor is the acting on the actors.  to sum up. the acting of the actors is horrible, so a great actor that is acting at all can be easily beat by a lesser actor. what is more scary is when the other actors act and in their dialog, which is poor, and the dialog is weak and the scenes are not realistic, the character is simply flat and has no emotion nor any emotion.  the plot could have been better, but it is not really a movie nor is it a film to me. the actors should have played the roles in a better movie and they need to do better or at least a movie like that that can be made.  if you find yourself seeing this movie, don't buy it unless you like the book of the same name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really would like to have made some funny footage and to have some good music for this awful film. But, as an independent, I really don't think I can make movies like this anymore. I think I would rather just make films like that one for fun. But it seems like there is some of my viewers who are just sitting in front of their screen watching this film and are just laughing with me. If I could afford to work for a good movie: I would have to hire some extra money to get this movie out of the bargain store and into a theatre. But after all, it's too expensive for a movie to rent for only $1.00, and most movies just go out of town for $1,000. I just wonder how a movie like this can get this far away. And, as a critic, I cannot say this film was very good or very entertaining. I would really like to get rid of it. I mean, I get tired after watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i've been reading this movie since its release. but i think there is still some room for it to have some sort of interest. i think the movie was simply bad. it was the most stupid and boring thing ever made for the years of my life. this movie is simply embarrassing to watch, but i have read some of reviews from people that have said that it is not funny, but it has a very serious tone. it is absolutely ridiculous. i will never watch it again, even though I know it will always have some appeal to those that like it. i have to make it more challenging. i don't see much funny, and most of the time it is just not funny enough. the acting is awful, and the direction is bad. i could easily make it less fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to give the man who made this film credit for it. He should have at least done some of the work. He got so little work, and that is the main reason. It's disappointing and pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad because it's a pretty bad movie. And I did like the fact that this movie was directed by Steven Dean Moyer, because he actually was kinda awesome, even though he did a few bad things, especially when it comes to the "Big" RICOFFS! Those were the "big" things he had to go off. When he was in one room on the movie set, there was a whole bunch of them, and they were actually just "jumbo" people. I'm sure he'd have done more to me in the room if they were here to take their photos in the actual hotel in San Antonio. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I guess the director and the producer thought they could get away with the girls not to get a little out of them. So I think it is one or the other. The sex is terrible. The acting is bad. And I don't know why, but the women and their faces were terribly bad, and were made of metal and used to look like they had some metal on them. I did see something in the movie that didn't seem to be real, the acting was really bad. I didn't really understand why the girls were making their intentions, their motivations, and their intentions out in public. I really just saw the women trying to stay quiet, and really seemed to be playing with them. But when you have a woman who is just beginning to realize what their lives are, I think that is all they need. I would never want to sit around and listen to those kind of things. You need to do your own thing and it's time for you to have another person that can give you the perspective on the problem. And don't say that if you like a good movie, it's a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the same bad movie ever made. It's so bad it is truly unbelievable! When I finally finished watching it, I was stunned. There is no decent plot, and I didn't even get the ending. All of the characters are totally unlikable, with bad acting, and the whole thing just feels flat. The acting is terrible, the editing is awful, and it's just a complete failure, just like the other version of "The Dark Shadows". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 60 minutes of the film were good. And I did not expect it to get much better. Then I started watching it again. The first 20 minutes or so were good, but not so much. I could only give it an 8 out of 10. This movie is simply awful. There are no jokes, no humor, no good dialog, and no characters. Everything is flat, stupid and simply unbelievable. The direction is simply wrong, so I did leave it off.  In addition, it seems there's a lot of fans who want to see this movie as a romantic film, and there seem to want to be romantic romantic and to love this movie. I understand that there are people who like such romantic films, but in the real world this movie was just a pathetic effort.  The final scene was a pathetic attempt to shock people and get some drama from this movie, but that did not work.  This movie was far from a perfect thriller. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole concept of this film is to get to grips with a bunch of sex scenes that are just so bad that they lose the fun of watching... It's a shame to be able to watch it. I had to sit through the entirety of it before I even finished watching it, but that's not even a problem. In fact, I just liked a few of the scenes, and I didn't mind that the film started so bad, and there was only one good scene of the whole movie.  The first scene was bad, the second one good, the third bad, but the fourth good scene was good. It's just the same old, same bad, same old.  I gave this movie a couple of dukes, but I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. I can't recommend it for anything that doesn't contain at least a little something good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read about this film. I don't think it's true, but I'm a huge fan of both William James and Charles Foster, who are in the same team together. When this film finally aired on Channel 1, I was surprised that I didn't watch it. It is absolutely terrible! This is the most painful movie of the year, I think, with the first two minutes of the film being so bad that I actually expected it to be good, or even good enough to be interesting.  This is really a complete waste of time and time, and this is the only movie to ever take the whole year off. I would have been interested to see a sequel, but this movie is so bad, that I don�t even want to waste more time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is stupid and disappointing. If you enjoy that show, then go watch it because the story is boring. What the heck is happening in this film? Who cares? It has to be a really bad movie to be worth the money, and the movie is not as good as "King John".   It's too long, which is boring, and there is no interesting plot or anything that should even matter to the plot. The acting is bad, but there are some good acting moments here.  I am sorry to see this movie because I really liked the other one "King James". I would like the next one, which I will watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at age 6 on IMDb. It was absolutely awful, especially the acting and the acting. I was in tears. I'd have to say,  this movie is truly bad, no more, no better! I can't stand this crap. You'll be bored with this movie. I found it in the bargain store and didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a movie critic, but as a long time fan of movies I have always been concerned about this kind of nonsense. This movie is so bad that I actually laughed after seeing it. The ending was so bad I nearly gave myself cancer when I watched it. Some of my friends have already told me they did not like it. It was interesting to note that the director didn't even have a credit card. If you go to this movie hoping to buy it, be sure you are going to be sick! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that makes me want to hate a bad thing. When I found out that it was about the end of the season, I was completely sick. I was already sick of it by the ending. The script was very dull and the acting is very weak, even the acting.  I just don't understand why this show was made, and I don't care whether you'll be able to finish this show or not, but it certainly needs to be better. It has just one good line, and it is so lame.  It was like a bunch of little random noises. You just sit there, wishing to feel good, but nothing good happens.  The soundtrack was OK, but not good. I didn't know if it was going to be a comedy, but I guess it is for fans of the show.  When I did finish this movie, I thought I was the only one who liked it, so I decided to see the other episodes. I have seen two episodes, and all I found was bad, even though I really liked the ending of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie twice in the first week I saw it. It's OK, but it was just awful. I don't even think anyone can see this movie. I think that if you were an older, more mature person, you would prefer to watch a movie.  If you just want to see some random crap, it is not worth your time. Avoid this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it so much because it was interesting and I could feel empathy for the character, but he was so stupid that I thought that he might be a decent guy. The plot seemed to be interesting, but after two minutes of watching, it got boring and started to drag on. Even when I was thinking it was going to end, it kept changing pace and eventually got to drag out.  I don't have a positive review about anything. This film isn't very good, but it does have some very good moments, but don't expect anything to come out. If you like it, avoid the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was some good scenes in the plot. I've seen the film twice, but I have to take the time to get the subtitles. I'm not sure what the story was supposed to be. There was an interesting scene involving the protagonist. But this movie fails to develop its story line. I can only guess the story and how it would have actually happened.  The first story line was good, but the rest was a bad effort.    The final story line is the best of the bad movie, as far as the best scenes. It was disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is so bad that it's easy to believe the producers and producers can honestly claim it as a "comedy" but the filmmakers and actors are all either really good or very bad. What is most disappointing is that I can't even see the plot! There are no realistic characters in this movie and the acting is atrocious! What was interesting was the fact that I have to watch this movie three times and even after I saw it twice I still find myself unable to figure out what the plot is about and what the actors were doing in this whole movie. So if you see this movie, you don't like comedy movies because you hate comedy but if you like comedy you will enjoy this movie as a self-indentia. I am sick of this movie. I'm sick of watching this movie so bad because I really love comedy, I really hate comedy, and what makes me sick is that it is full of so many clichés and stupid jokes. I also wish I could watch some of the old American comedies from the 1980s, they are only a few or two years behind in terms of funny but still there's a few comedy shows that I found funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not even surprised by the comment in this movie, but the director should have a lesson in this business: If you want to get into an act with a bad script with a script, you do it at your own peril. If you do the same thing with the end-action, you lose something. If they want to make something interesting, they should make a movie with a plot, characters, a twist, and a plot; a plot is not a movie. If there is a plot (as is the case in this one), you do not need a plot. You do not get to understand the characters. If the character(s) are interesting or interesting, then don't write the movie to be a movie, just write the script(s)!  I was reading this movie as if it were a straight-out-thinking idea for a film like "Pushing In Their Boots".  There is nothing here that was interesting in the beginning; but if it was the right thing for the script to be funny, this film isn't funny.   A pity. But that is the only good thing I can think of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't believe that any movie released at this time would be this bad.  It is still very hard to watch, as an entertainment, and I don´t like to find any enjoyment. The music and the sound track seems to be completely lost in the mix. The soundtrack is quite predictable, but it just doesn´t work, and it´s just plain bad. I´d be glad if the director and screen writers actually cared about their lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie. Bad in the best way. No good comedy. No plot. No funny lines. Not that funny. You can't even laugh for a while. I wish this movie had a decent story, even a decent cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why the director would put this movie in their first effort, but it looks like they were going to try it anyway. The movie is very uninspired and there are no scenes that really matter. The script is too convoluted and it's really hard to find the most disturbing moment. The ending is disappointing because it is so stupid. The film itself doesn't give you the feeling that you are in the least good movie. In the end, there is absolutely no way of knowing the direction the story was going and I think that even people who were familiar with the film were embarrassed.  If you are going to watch this film then don't put in any money, but then you are only making your life harder. You just want to make a movie about a horrible movie, no matter how good it is or is not, you have to have some guts to go out and start a movie. Otherwise, I recommend this movie for kids, not even for kids who are scared of getting stoned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has very little dialogue, very bad actors, and very bad acting! How can anyone film that? There's something else going on with this movie. The girls all seem to get to hang out with the guys, not together, and their dialogue is pretty stupid. Also, the girls' personalities are pretty stupid...like their "cuteners" who always talk about how good they are and how good their lives are. The plot is very basic, there's not enough dramatic tension, and there's no real suspense. There's a plot twist that takes the whole plot, and it seems like they're rushing to a climax. The dialog is the worst.  The girls aren't strong enough to scare anyone out of their sleep. There are other parts of the movie, like the little secret that is supposed to be a secret but really is just another lame attempt at a spy plot. The main characters were interesting, and had some decent dialog. But they don't come together properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film based on the book of the same name of "The Oceans" by Robert E. "Hilde" Jackson is, unfortunately, terrible.  The story begins in the beginning of the movie, with the appearance of the characters, two sisters, the first being a blonde female and the second a male, a former swim instructor. She goes on a long swim in the ocean, and soon falls to water with the two sisters. As usual, the film begins to disappoint, because it seems like the movie starts with a story of these two sisters swimming together and drown the other two.   But then the film goes on, with two girls swimming together in a pool, but then drown together.  There are other "proceedings" that are too badly, not even a plot. But they are just to be expected in a bad film, so they are ignored in the hopes that the producers might avoid getting any criticism. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit, this movie is bad for the fact that it is a comedy. And in fact it's just plain stupid, but I don't even care. The only point in the movie is that the guy in the background is probably a man with no real power. The main point in this movie was that he didn't have anything in his life, either his personal life or his career. What was this person? "Loyalist?" No, the guy was in the Army and he was in a position of respect for his country. He wasn't a "douchebag" and he wasn't part of a group of friends. He was just a "person who was in an effort to gain his power.  The movie is stupid! I didn't want to see it. I didnThe only point of the movie was to have it out. I mean, they want to make sure that this movie won't make money for the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no real plots and no real dialog. There are many jokes, but there are no dialogs. And some of the lines just don't seem to be funny.  So if you have some time to kill, a good film to kill is,  The Killing Zone (The Killing Zone). It's about a bunch of military guys who are sent into battle in Africa. They are sent off to war to a base somewhere else. Then they are sent back into the war and are put into a room by a plane. That's it. After killing these guys, they have to be put on the table for the soldiers to shoot them. The whole film is not funny. It's depressing.  The only thing that was funny was the fact that the first guy killed with a grenade as an example.  It could have been so much funnier to have this guy kill the second guy on their first night of mission. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a young boy who has a drug, and this drug is going to be the biggest part of this movie.  When the drug is off, the boy becomes a violent, sad, and sad-ish person. He spends a few weeks on a life-course, and then decides to leave school to go to the university, a few hours later. Unfortunately, he gets his new life right back in a place that seems like it was somewhere he hasn't been in, but it's not his hometown, and he is told to go there.  It turns out that the boy is dead, and his new friends are sad for him, very sad.  The next thing about this movie is when the drug also goes off, and the boy goes to the hospital to get help for his brain injury, which he suffers.  Unfortunately, there is a pretty big difference in the way he's treated after getting to the medical clinic, and in the treatment the hospital has done for him. The scene where he is on the hospital and it's raining rain outside sounds pretty sad, but that seems to be before the movie begins. I don't think he's in the hospital for long, and that would mean he really needed to be there sooner, but unfortunately, the hospital staff is very busy and has a lot of work to do with him.  So there are two things. First of all, the actor plays a character named "Tobes" (TobES). Tobes has some history with this man, and after some money money money is spent, the next scene is when they go to an abortion clinic and he meets a woman named Tiana (Tiana) who is very attractive, and Tobes and the women he meets is the third person to die of an abortion.  There is an interesting plot twist about the final scene. There is a line where a man, Tiana, comes down the stairs to see the doctor who has Tiana meet him. She is not too pleasant, and starts by asking the man if he's going to do a medical scan to help with his medical condition. After the doctor is finished, the man asks her why she is in the office, and she is concerned because the hospital is locked up. But it seems to me that the doctor doesn't care much about her being locked up to go in the medical exam in the middle of a rape.  This is obviously the result of a bad film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've only watched this movie for one and has nothing positive to say about it, its got a few good parts. And it doesn't get any acting like you see in other bad films. There is the usual kind of awful, but it was even worse in one scene. I guess the reason I liked this movie was because it was so depressing that I didn't want to watch it. I think this movie needs to go away. It just isn't a great movie, and it doesn a lot of bad in it's way. There are some good parts here, but its really just a bunch of crap. It makes me sad to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of time; it is a horrible film which was supposed to be a film based on a movie. It is extremely disappointing to be able to sit through an entire movie and then have the chance to watch it. The film really doesn't have any suspense, and I didn't even get to watch the beginning.  I'm not sure if this is the only movie based on the TV show and is a remake of the movie which doesn't really seem like a film to watch. I think that is the most disappointing of the film in the entire country.  The only good thing about the movie was that the person on the computer playing the movie had all the names of the people on the show. It was pretty funny to see how he was able to keep going to and watch the movie without understanding the words that were used.  If I could get all my way through my whole life of watching this movie, I would have to give it a zero rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it hit shelves, I was immediately angry. What were they thinking? To be so mean? They have this god of god, with all the powers of the gods and the most powerful in the universe, you get to see some guy wearing glasses and having a huge statue of one of his temples with a golden snake sticking out of the wall. This is where the movie started. It starts with the guys having a conversation with the lady that leads the movie. This movie is obviously a copy of the same movie as the one that made this one and it is clearly not supposed to be a comedy, as I see it is for all. If you like the fact that there's not only one god, but also a lot of sex scenes that don't really happen, you will probably think this movie really is going to be very stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible 'vacation', but if you have some tolerance for the plot and acting, well it can be good. The script is bad, the action is boring, the characters are boring, but the whole movie has been so bad that it's better than a bad film.  But the other problem is that the characters and the storyline are very boring. It's hard to watch this movie because you want to see the characters' motivations and the world they live in, but you have to see it if you are to have any interest in watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is that it does have a nice cast to look at. They don't really act like comedians. Instead, they're as flat and uninteresting as the characters they portray. I didn't even think the movie was funny and it should never have been.  I was expecting something like "Brady Show" or "Pixys," or even a good movie: the idea that a bunch of white people dressed in black outfits would be funny. There are no jokes. They are just completely stupid, stupid, and unappetable.  This movie is very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Carnet" is an extremely bad film. The story is so bad, it has the worst acting in the film. I usually avoid a review of a bad film because they're often very good, but this one just proves to be the worst I've ever seen. You can't even recognize that it's a bad thing when I've seen it. It's an insult to all audiences. I have been sucked up for a long time by the acting, but I think the cast is fine. I've watched this with a positive review. But the acting in this film was terrible.  I'm glad I gave the guy who made this film a second look at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie before it was released but it looks even worse now. It was the only one good film of the year... for all other films it was good. And what a disappointment when the first one is bad, it becomes even more so.  So what the heck is this movie about?  I guess it was to be an after feature film. It had about 4 minutes of the movie, maybe 6 seconds at the most, which is about one half of the entire film. The rest is a complete waste of time, a stinking mess of a film... it doesn't even come out for at least one hour, and no one gets through the film.  I'm sorry, it's a pity to see such an overrated film. If you watch it for the sake of a few minutes, you will find nothing else to enjoy. If this is supposed to be a comedy, it is really only a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most terrible film I've ever seen. What can you say about it? This is the least funny I've seen in a horror movie since Dementia. I think it would be better to make a horror/genre horror movie that looks pretty good, but not so funny that it looks like it's supposed to be funny. The director of this movie is obviously clueless about what he's doing, and I was surprised that he actually got cast and the cast is OK. What I mean is that it has a very poor budget, which is a result of the money that the producer is having to spend. I do not think the casting is that bad, although I do think the acting is OK, it just seems like it is some poor joke. The movie itself is bad in many places. It has so much bad humor that I almost wish it could end immediately, and the writing itself is very flat and not interesting. This movie would be OK if it had a good sequel. I hope it won't be too bad for him, though, he could certainly improve some of his scripts. The acting doesn't seem to have much potential for this movie, and it lacks a lot of charisma. What happens to me is that when the acting was good, you could find a way to improve it. I mean, it was supposed to end in 10 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not funny. It is really not. The premise is that you can have sex with everyone, if you can be a child. You get to a car with your new housemates, and then your boss gets involved with one of them and it turns into an incestuous affair. How would this be funny? Well, what happened when this was played on screen? Oh, I've already decided that there is a limit of how bad it could be. It was the first time I saw a bad car movie. I was a teenager when I saw it, but I'm older now, so I guess that was good. The actors really didn't get into character. It's so bad it looks like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many errors in the script and the way the story plays out. I have nothing positive to say about the movie. I don't know why this movie has this name, or why it was made in the way that it was, but whatever the reason is I don�t have any confidence in it. I do not recommend watching this movie if you have anything positive to put out. It's not worth the time it takes to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the book books that have helped me so much over the years, but in this movie they were completely wrong. They're too loud, too fast, too slow, too sloppy. This movie should have been a hit, and it was really disappointing to me. I'm an avid fan of all books I know (I'm a fan of The Lord of the Rings) but this book was a bad one for me. In the book, you get to know the characters and the storyline. The book isn't even a good book and I would not recommend it to anyone. In this movie, they just showed the characters that were supposed to be in the book and in their book didn't act like them, in the movie they did. In fact, I was really upset that the book's characters were such a weak character, I just had to laugh. How can a book be so bad? I'm disappointed because I finally bought the book because I think the movie had good characters. There are no interesting characters in the books and they are just bland. The movie is supposed to have a few good moments, but unfortunately they don't do any of them. The writing in the characters was so poor, that I really feel that I was lost. My advice would have been to see this movie in the video store, for instance. However, I think it would just be a bad idea to waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was the only one who thought this movie was that good, and it was only good after one. As others commented about it, I was one of the only people who actually had a negative reaction. I felt like a very crappy movie. It's got some decent acting, and a decent plot, but I'd definitely watch it on my own if I didn't have a big enough screen. Otherwise, I'd watch it for just one time if that's all I needed. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who would like to go out and drive to Vancouver for the ride, though I know a few of them like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first half of this movie is pretty good, the rest is just a little annoying. I've never had a movie that was so bad before I started this movie. I have to say it was bad because it never bothered me to see this movie in my life. There were many moments that could have been funny, but since I had a good sense of the story it was impossible to enjoy them. I think that a person who has never seen this movie will be an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on the concept of a film called "Powers vs. Bigger vs. Smaller", it is really just an insult. The point was that there was no real fight between the two guys. One of them was named "Bigger" and another one was named a "smaller", so each name had meaning.  The idea of the movie was that the "big" guy in the beginning was so big that he had a giant body, so he could take one giant punch and then the "small" guy could punch. The idea was that "Biger" is one of the "Bigest" guys and the "Smaller" guy has a small body, and there is nothing to say about this.  This film was not a very good movie, but it had some good ideas. There were no real punches and there wasn't a real fight. The camera was poorly placed, the action was terrible, and the voice-acting was extremely bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie would at least have some of the thriftiness and interest that this movie deserves. But alas, it was an exercise in vapidity. If this movie had a half decent script, it would have at least a moderately entertaining title. Instead, it ended up being a short-length monotoperations movie and a few plot-lines that could get past the halfway point. This is probably a movie in the worst sense of the genre. I don't know how to expect the end. I did read the book and the booklets to find out what is left. The book seems to be one long movie that could have been used for a 10 year old movie, but nothing short-and-half. The main story of the book is about a group of people who had been kidnapped and murdered by a demon who has hypnotized them to get revenge on each other. Unfortunately, the plot goes on for so long that you don't get the full picture. If you're looking for a good movie, you're not in the world. And even after the film was released, the movie has not been well received. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director made the movie like it was some sort of the movie that would make a very bad movie. It had one funny moment and the rest of the film just didn't seem to matter that much. I don't have anything positive to say about it. It should just have been a horror movie, and it sucked in too many of my teeth. It must have been meant to be a horror film to me. The acting was pretty good, but it's just a bunch of old and stupid jokes. The other problem was how it felt like a comedy. The funny moments were just too predictable and didn't matter. I think it should have been some sort horror film. It was just about making a horror joke about a horror show, and not a comedy film.  It just doesn't work in all of it's parts and doesn't make any kind of sense. This is really bad. If you like horror, then you'll like it, but don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so bad that even though it had a really interesting ending, it was an incredibly boring and disappointing ending. I never want to see this movie again. This movie is just an insult. This is the kind of movie that shows people to feel inferior about people who think they are superior. They look weak and pathetic. They're so pathetic that no one respects them. This was a good movie, and a disappointing film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Algerson's Movie" is an interesting plot (not much), but it is an obvious rip-off of a movie that was made about a movie of the same name. This movie also suffers from a disappointing ending. It would have been better if the plot hadn't been so predictable. And the film's special effects are just terrible. They were bad at the moment, but I can't fault for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Cadence is the most brutal serial killer that I have ever seen. It does not matter how you choose to take it. It starts off with a very disturbing scene with a car-jumping murder, then makes a horrible joke involving a little girl. The scene starts by showing how these guys are going to kill the girl. You really can't tell what's going to happen, but then they decide to drive a truck into a park with a girl. Then they drive away, and we have the next scene. Then it's just a little longer than an hour.  Some people have suggested that this movie is a 'gangster film,' but I find it more like an American TV reality show. The ending is pretty obvious and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film which was clearly written by a computer programmer and appeared on video tape is one of those that fail to qualify as a film.  It is about a bunch of guys playing their golf on their break down a big building in the desert. But they are having a good time and get stuck in the sand. When the sun hits the screen they start to fly through the sand, so they get very nervous and start walking on sand.  In a nutshell I would not recommend seeing this film because the guys are terrible and the movie is a complete failure in terms of story. I would recommend seeing "The One Called Summer", or something much simpler than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. It's so bad that it's not funny. I'm ashamed to say, I had to laugh after seeing it. It just feels sad to watch something that is so stupid. There are few moments in the movie that are interesting or funny. When the camera swamps me from the corners of the screen I had a little hope at the end. I was hoping to see some great, funny scene and I didn't. There is one scene where one character says a line of dialogue and I thought, OK, it could go in the direction of the movie. But instead I just said, "what a waste of time. And the movie is full of stupidity, and I couldn't enjoy it. I wish my job back home was that stupid. But that's what it really is. It made me feel like I couldnno laughing at any of the jokes. It also makes me feel sad. It isn't funny, it's sad, it just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the movie for my mother's birthday birthday, and it only had four movies in it. It's not a movie that people will want to watch, but it just reminds me of a poorly written film. That's not too bad, but the main reason I was wanting to watch it was that it was my mother and I love my sister's favorite movies.  I can't believe these people who give the movie a positive review would admit it was not good. I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen. It was very dull, and even had the worst acting.  The main reason that people wanted to see this movie was because it had an awesome cast. I'm surprised they didn't just kill everybody in the movie, but this movie just seemed too faintingly scripted to be scary.  My advice is get a copy of one of the earlier films. This one is not a sequel, and there are probably worse movies out there than this one. It will be very bad for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be so terrible that I could not even give it any more points. This movie contains nothing but horrible plot, unbelievable acting, and a horrible director. I had not even a chance to even watch this movie, because I had never seen this movie in the actual making of the movie. The acting in this movie is bad to the point that the movie is even worse. And the movie doesn't have any good acting, except the acting is done by poor actors. It's too bad to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I was annoyed by this movie's terrible acting, I'm sure it was meant to be a film with just one actor. It wasn't like a movie for one of the best of the all time classics of Hollywood, and it got pretty ugly, and I couldn't even find my nose after it. The whole thing fell apart under the first 4 or 5 scenes. It sucked, and there was a few of them I thought made sense, like the guy at the mall, or the guy with the tall guy. If you think this is a film you're going to watch, you'll probably find yourself in the toilet.   It was only slightly better in the beginning. I really think this was the worst thing a person could watch, I don't know if I'll ever watch it again. I was hoping that it'd just be a bad little feature film, but it isn't really good, it just a pretty dull waste of time. I just didn't want to waste my time. It was absolutely pointless. This movie could have been made at a young boy's house with just a good, interesting story and some good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want something truly original, you have to come away from this one, otherwise this movie is the same as the old ones and is not even a good movie at all. And if you want a serious and realistic horror film, you will have to pay attention and beware of the two things that make this movie, lack of suspense, and a lack of good actors. The acting is just not up to par and the cinematography is not good at all, though I don't have any problem with that. The story is quite bad but the premise is good, so don't waste your time. But just don't bother. If you like this movie then the only thing you do is watch the trailer, which is a lot better than the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is so bad that when I finally watch it I was left confused and angry at what I had been reading. I knew what it was going to be before I got there and that I was going through hell. The acting was so bad it actually gave me a migraine.  The film was only alright when it was in it's true essence. I'm a movie buff and I cannot watch a movie unless the acting is good enough. It is not really a good movie since it is so much as a bad film that it was. A story line that isn't so interesting or involving is completely useless, and the story is simply about the ending of the movie. If you don't like the movie itself, you won't like it because your mind is made to do things it wants. It also makes it all pointless. I wish the director of the "film" had simply spent time in making this film and then taken the time to make something better. The film is just as bad in it�s way, it has no plot and is utterly lacking the quality of a film. It does have a few good moments though, but only in the final scenes when a woman's phone is in his pocket (for most viewers, that's how she does everything) when he decides he'd finally be able to save her and he does so it feels like it� a plot that simply doesn't work. The worst movie I've ever seen was "The Wild One" and that film really had its own flaws and I'm not a huge fan of it, so I was hoping that this movie wouldn't break. But it wasn't even better than that bad movie and that's only because it wasn�t really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can think I was just sick to see this awful film. I mean it was just horrible. I was hoping it would be at least funny. But it wasn't. I guess you might think a film starring the two guys who worked on "Pilz" would be funny. And this is obviously not.  It's absolutely laughable that they wasted their time to make it. They should have made a sequel to the original Pilz film. But unfortunately there's nothing else. The only thing you can do is watch it in your own state. If you do that, you might be so depressed that you couldn't finish it.  The first 5 minutes of the film is absolutely pointless and boring. They don't even start talking with each other. I'm sick of seeing these guys in the same way. It's not even funny to watch. The whole film is stupid.  I'm trying to get some of the plot right, but only I can't even do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting something nice to be here. Unfortunately it wasn't. This movie was the same in almost every aspect as the original. But it was the worst movie I have ever seen. The story and the characters were terrible and just there were too many problems. The sound and the camera were not good. The animation is just plain awful and there are too many bad lines in the dialog and the acting. It seems like it would be more enjoyable than this movie. But I just can't believe a movie that this has to be the worst ever made in the history of films. I just could not believe there could have been so much bad in this movie... The actors and the screen, the directing, and the direction are all terrible as well. If you liked this movie then you have to lose your interest completely. The plot is not to good and the ending is too slow.  I wish the director put some effort into making this movie but unfortunately it isn't. You can't go into this movie and expect a good ending. The acting is not good and there is nothing to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some interesting scenes to watch, but they are in the worst possible movies. The plot is not believable enough. The sound track on the soundtrack was annoying and sounded fake. I recommend skipping this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a one. It wasn't even funny. I mean it's a really bad movie. It's just awful. I'm not gonna spoil it for you. But it was better than the movie in general...not much better. But for this person to be taken in as a serious comedy actor, he should really be more serious and serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A short film with very low budget is about a man who leaves a dead body in his bathroom. The film begins on a farm on a beach; this is the first time I saw this film. It had a decent plot, but the acting was bad. The dialogue was awful, and the editing was horrendous. This film was the worst of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual with this movie, the director is clueless. The story is basically the same as that of the first one, but there is only one (and only one) interesting plot. If you're a little bit of a horror movie fan, try to avoid it if you want to see any one of my other films. They aren't quite as good as the first.  The gore scenes were only mildly effective. There were some interesting moments, like one of the actors trying to kill the family of the main protagonist by biting his neck on a rope or another one of their friends. Otherwise, this movie isn't good, because it's so flat-toned and boring. It would have been great if the camera crew had done some of the work they were supposed to do and managed to get the acting right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been enjoying the second episode of the movie when I was checking out the first one to see the sequels. This movie is so bad that it only mildly compares to the original series. I've never seen anything worse than an hour long episode, and now I'm so bored that I can only watch the first episode.  The characters are awful to watch too. There is no good way to watch this series, which is very unoriginal and stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't care. This movie really wasn't a great film. It seemed like the writer/director wanted to create a depressing movie so he would be nice to finish the movie. The plot is not interesting and the characters are the worst ever. Also the acting isn't good as well as the special effects are bad.  I can say this movie is not worth of your time. The only good thing about this movie was that there are some people who liked this movie. That's only one movie! Don't waste your time watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this movie is a complete disaster for my young viewers. It's all so lame and lame that it's funny that I'm saying. Also, I don't like movies that go on for a long time. If I were to review it I'd be telling you "this movie is so boring!" and then go into a movie: "The movie is stupid, it's not funny, it has stupid dialog, and I donít like it because of the stupid dialog. I think the film's writer is so stupid that he couldn't even see that this film is really silly. What a waste of time for a 12 year old boy! I know that it made the video for the big screen players, but I donót want to get into a fight with my kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows a story of a bunch of old hippies who have just killed the elderly person and then get drunk, then run around and get lost. This movie isn't well adapted, but it's still very pretty to watch, and there's just so much talk going on that it doesn't make much sense whatsoever.  The actors are terrible too, the camera is poor and there aren't enough laughs to be had. I do find the premise a bit amusing. The director is very poor, and the casting is poor.  However, I don't think this film will cause anyone to cry. Even though it's not a terribly interesting comedy, it still falls far below the standards of other films that have released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to be a negative reviewer. I think it's bad for what it says and there's plenty of good movies.  However this movie is not funny, at least the comedy seems to have ended its way. What makes it so bad is the fact that the lead actor is so bad, he really tries to make it funny, he doesn't even care for the acting and there are moments that were supposed to be funny but are just so bad. The scene at the end that took place with the main character was really funny but what happened before it was funny is the lead's acting that has gotten boring.  This movie really needs a decent director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a film made in the 70's. It has no real plot and no real story. It's basically the same as a soap opera version. You just get a bunch of characters who get into the thick, thick black tarred hoods and start arguing. If you are a soap or a fantasy film, that's a pretty good way to make a good film. But this one doesn't fit the rules of life.  The plot doesn't follow the rest of the films in this genre. This film doesn't have any real plot or story. This movie's message is weak and there are no good ways to deal with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first problem with this movie is that it is a very dull film. In fact, the cinematography was pretty good. But what about the editing? Well, the editing seems to take on every other line. The music is bad. The story is about two idiots trying to get into their minds and try to come to a realization of their own mind. Of course, they get killed and the people that survive get away because they are so stupid. Also, this film is obviously not the greatest movie ever. But if you have some interest, if you don't buy this film then you donut. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In any case, this is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I can't even think of my dad watching it and trying to pretend he's making it. It has a terribly contrived plot and it's too obviously bad to be realistic. I'm not sure if this was directed by the guy who made The Matrix, or whether it's an entirely new film and they decided to make it, or if it is made as a sequel to some old film.  The film starts about half way through with three of these "plot" endings that all seem to be the same plot. There is a "plot X" that is a long story, where some dude is a hero. There's a "hateful" (that's a word) ending and a "happy ending", and the final "happening" has something else, like a scene of a guy getting his eyes green.  There are two separate endings with the hero getting killed. There was a "Happening/unhappy ending" with him getting killed by some fire or gas mixture that causes his eyes to green. There also was a scene where one of those guys is thrown out of the plane by another guy, and he falls down the stairs. But you get a bunch of scenes with him at the beginning and the end of the movie. And then there is another ending where he's killed, but not in a way that would cause him to die, and then you have the same ending, with the dude being killed in his own house.  It could be done, but there are some really horrible scenes involving killing characters that are just awful, like one where some guys shoots some guys, then he gets killed, and everyone else just laughs, like the end credits scene where you're just laughing. It could have been better, but it's pretty damn awful.  I guess that it was made by some guy in the early 2000's because it was a very early 2000′s film and he got the idea for this film and decided to take it out and then he didn't do anything to make the film better.  Of course, he gets a little bit of credit with some good casting and a good cast but no good scenes. The casting is really lacking, and there are few good-looking characters. The cast is too short and there is no funny or good characters. But the characters aren't really given a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one was extremely bad, and I'm glad I didn't like it because I wanted to like a movie about a good movie: I liked a lot of movies with a pretty decent plot, but these movies often lacked a decent action sequence. I hope this movie will never get an Oscar. I did watch it for the final few minutes to see if I could enjoy it. I can't believe they tried to make it funnier than I would expect a movie like this one to be. It was bad at times, but even so, it had some excellent moments. The ending was absolutely terrible. I'd have a more positive review about some kind of action movie: an 80 year old movie about an old movie. The only thing that made this movie a worthwhile one was the ending. But what's done that they've done? They made a complete ripoff of a movie that didn't deserve it?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so annoyed when I watched this movie, that I decided to look at my old tapes of the previous season, and I only watched it once!   It's so bad, in fact, that it should have been the first movie of the new season. It's also so bad that it's even worse than "The Killing Zone", the only movie this season that actually made me feel good.  I really didn't know what this movie was about before this was aired, or whether or not it was really a movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hope this movie was created to be just an afterthought project on a guy who was already a little scared. I was surprised to see that most people who thought this movie would make an interesting movie to watch. Not the best one of those movies ever made, but at the time it was decent.  I think that some of the dialog is funny or something was overdone, but I think the actor had a really horrible lip-twist and there were some really funny parts.  Overall, I think this movie is a bad way to go to the movie world and make a great film. The acting was not too interesting and they didn't get to have much fun or even get to go down to the dance area. The soundtrack was not good either. Some good moments I got but they could've been a little bit longer. The fact that there was a huge fight between two guys about to get drunk could be funny. I would recommend trying to keep this movie to an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a lot of money invested into this project, a movie about an abandoned plane in a remote area of New Mexico is so un-real that it is impossible to even think of the film being worthy of such a level of interest from the viewer. There are little story-lines in the plot, the camera is so bad that it's not worth watching, and the ending is so disappointing and unnecessary that it just leaves no sense of any real purpose or meaning. Of course, it should be a B.S. "The plot is good!" is obvious enough, but for the director, it doesn't matter. If a film is poorly directed, the viewer won't be interested, and most of us in the audience won't care even if it's a "bad movie".  I know, after all, that many movies are not good, and I know that some people who love them enjoy them, but if a film really doesn't interest you in some areas, the film can't be given credit for good points.  The biggest question I have about this film is whether the writer was really a competent person, or just a bad person. The only thing I can conclude is that this movie is so awful that it has to be an anti-nope. The film just doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical about this film. The story is very dull, but I was impressed by how well the acting was on some of the other characters. The character is not that interesting, as the other "heroines" have been. The acting is poor, the camera is bad, and even the ending is pretty stupid. But then there were two strong points. The first one was a couple of characters who ended up in a jail. The second was a story where one person dies and it was not too long and didn't really matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd recommend that this be posted in their forums so someone else might review it. This is the kind of film I wish I had the chance to review. It is a terrible, badly designed piece of junk. In the first part I liked the scenes with a few good characters who were interesting. They don't act on the plot or anything. I didn't like the dialogue. I just want to see something more enjoyable.  I found the film a little too long. If you enjoy this film, try my advice, and stay away from it. I'm sure there are a lot of good reasons to like it. However, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Avoid it if you can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it is a terrible film, the acting has been done badly. The characters of the film had all been done before, but not so in this one. The movie starts off poorly with the characters having a long time to do and the characters were simply not believable. I would say this is a film that would have to be cut-and-run unless you enjoyed the film as much as this one did. There are no funny or funny scenes, the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know if it's a sequel, or not because there's already one. There's nothing interesting about it, it's just a piece of waste in entertainment that is disappointing to the viewer. I suggest you watch the original "Tango" or one of the sequels and tell your friends and family that it's not worth seeing. I did see it again on my TV and I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It is full of the lowest budget money, so bad actors and crappy directing. I really liked most of the other movies in the first, so I gave this one a chance, but I don't get on the bus and walk into this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the movie twice and it looked so good, I didn't know why I didn\'t believe it was overrated. I guess it got a second chance and decided to see it again. I mean, it looked good, but it wasn't great.  What is it with watching this movie, please: It just doesn\'t seem real and doesn't feel like a film. It's just a bad story. The film had me wondering if I was going to be killed. I think they had to make this thing look good, or at least, if you had to see this movie before seeing it and didn't want to go through the hell of it. I wasn't able to finish this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film I have ever watched (I think, though I'm not sure why I thought that I had seen this film before) is very bad. I'm surprised that there is no mention of how horrible it is. It starts with the most boring scene. I get sick and dizzier as I watch this film, and I don't even want to see it again. I really don't know why they would use the same name for this movie, even though the first one I watched was good. It makes me want to throw my money away. I would have to pay more to see a film that was much more interesting than this one. I've even watched a few times, and found the same thing in each film. Some of the acting is OK, if the film had more characters it would have more interest to the audience. Some bad film makers just waste their time, and the viewers just want to make a film: nothing, no plot, no climax. Nothing, no ending. It's just there for laughs and cheap thrills, so that you can have your mind run over with a lot of crap. There is a new one out today, so I recommend watching this movie if you like watching bad films. If it gets in my way, you should check it out, like a good movie: I can't even get through the first half of it.  I recommend a little boy who is looking for a movie about a child's father's suicide to watch. It should be about 10 minutes longer, but you'll still have the same experience that you would if you watched this movie. If you're a good viewer, you'll find a lot more of things to the film than if you see a good film. Don't waste your time. Avoid it. I have an idea how it is a film about a ghost or a demon. The girl in this movie is a demon who is killing some kind of ghost, apparently. It is about a person who is trying to break up the girl's family and steal their possessions to be used to scare everyone. The whole thing is so confusing that I find it extremely difficult to watch through. This is the same story about the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed in this movie.  You could get bored by watching it. I don't understand why the producer should have put in a script like this for you to see. This movie is supposed to have a plot, that includes the two main characters. There is absolutely no plot except the characters. The other characters are not like those characters.  I give this movie an 8 because it is one of the most stupid and completely predictable movies. The fact that the writer actually wanted to go straight to the phone store with the other character (actually the main character) is not a good sign. I guess there are some people who are able to watch this film, but most people don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is the same as any other version of the same story of the show and I'm not going to bother with commentaries. I just watched it for my own curiosity and for the sake of being an avid fantasy fan. This is a bad fantasy show of a bad time. A poor excuse for a horror series. The first 3 minutes of the movie was good, but the last 3 minutes were quite bad. The story was OK, but it was really a waste of money that could have been used to better something. It wasn't even about the main character of the film, but that's ok... it wasn't about the best of the horror series of 1993. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. You don't really care. The next 5 minutes are quite interesting but the movie is so bad it doesn't work! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the IMDb review and laughed. I am the first person to ever say that a movie of this magnitude should be labeled as "not funny" on IMDb.  You have to know from what I've read, this movie is so bad it should never even be rated at all.  I would rate this movie as a 1.5/5 but a 1/6. It's a real pity that it was never given any ratings at all on IMD. I don't know if the reviewers on IMDB were really just laughing or just trying to avoid making any movies about good films, but it's hard to say which one it is. This movie should just be rated as an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the version of "The Matrix" that I've been hearing. They were obviously put together in this movie but I could barely see anything that resembled "Matrix" that was in the original. The plot of "Matrix 2" is pretty obvious but it was not quite as realistic as this one. They don't really even try to hide what the movie says, and the only thing I was willing to admit was that their hair was blue and they wore their shoes. Not much. But the movie is good if you're interested in the fact that the story is interesting but is not nearly believable. I'm not one of those people who has "Matrix," or even like them, but I just cannot see how the story would end, how the world would collapse, and how they would leave a good movie: no money, no money. If you want to see a good action movie then you will have to watch the original Matrix movie or the remake Matrix 2: Matrix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an extremely bad movie that I had to watch. I felt that I was left with too little to enjoy. That's all. I'm in love with every movie that has ever made me think I was watching a movie that was a low effort. It wasn't even a movie for most of the time but this movie is a complete failure for anyone who can't sit for an hour and watch a movie in 15 minutes. The plot is so lame and so stupid. There were some very funny moments but it wasn't the greatest movie of the world. I had a really hard time getting through the movie since it wasn�t worth buying on a DVD but I�ll spend it all in the hopes of making a movie with no friends.  The worst film I've seen so far. The movie will not shock the purists out of this movie like any other movie but it doesn't hurt as well. The whole premise of this film was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this is a film. It's so bad. I cannot understand how anyone could possibly view this film. But I can do my best to try. But what the hell is it like? You can't possibly comprehend the meaning of what this movie is about. But it must be one of the worst films ever made! The plot is not very good. The characters are not very well acted and all of the actors are extremely unfunny! I would not recommend this film unless you like a little bit of fun! I really feel sorry for this movie as a horror film because it is so bad and the only reason it is entertaining is because it's funny. There really isn't anything else to say. It is just plain boring. The fact that it's made by a non-fan of the movie and that the director has no idea what the heck he's doing should make this movie worse. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It would be much better if you could buy the DVD on Amazon. I would recommend a copy of this in a bad situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's not enough good material to have this bad movie. This isn't a good movie. But it does have the good features of an entertaining short. If you just want to make the lastest comedy of all time, you might find the rest of the film better, but don't watch it if you're expecting a good film. This movie isn't good at any aspect and has some of the worst lines I've seen. But don't see this unless you are in for a comedy. I'm really sick of this film. I only hope they'll put this on for the next movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You will probably never get to the real part of this movie. It has all the right songs but there is no real story. It's a big disappointment. I had an hour to watch it because it was interesting, I thought it could have some twists. I would have been impressed by the time it ends but that's not what it does. All I got were the first few shots of "Red, White, Green" and some people who were probably a bit bored with it. I give this movie three stars out of 10 and it isn't even as good as some of the other films it might have been. It is an incredibly cheap film and no wonder it has no actors.  The movie could have been so good but that isn't the point, the point is that no one is ever in on this movie and the end isn't interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something to get from this movie, not to be ashamed, and I'll explain this in a short point. It is painfully dull. The lead is boring, but it's not so bad, in the end. In a way, there is some comedy in the story, but overall the story is not funny.   But, the funny thing about this movie is that there are very few interesting characters in the cast. I thought the characters were actually funny in a way that's just too long for an anime movie. Also, the scenes were just plain plain slow-moving, and there were no good things about the characters in a comedy.  I would have liked to see some comedy, and the acting seems to have some sort of charm, but there was nothing.  But this is also a movie that has no plot. It would have been better if there were some funny lines in this movie. The characters in this are just so flat, that it has to be expected. And there are absolutely no good scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is it with a movie that so much to the end it contains so many horrible scenes in the name of a "Moozdah" movie? The movie starts with a brief montage of some good scenes, then leaves the viewer to wonder about the ending. There is no ending, and the ending is simply an unsatisfying, unnecessary, confusing, and possibly confusing ending.  It is also a majorly disappointing film, in my opinion, because of the fact that I'm a film writer/director/producer, that I really had to put my blood, sweat, and emotions into my work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie for weeks but I can not say I understand why it is rated this way. I mean there are many people who would like to see this movie, so they were able to see it but unfortunately this movie was pretty awful. The ending is just so bad and the movie was really terrible. The girls were all very uncomfortable and uncomfortable and when the credits are finished they feel like they are giving up. I know that the acting is good and the acting will most likely bring you closer to the "happy ending". But i just don't think it is smart to think that a movie will be rated that way. The acting is really bad. I have to tell you this is not an all-out effort movie, it is just a little bit of an average kind of movie. You will feel like it for only one movie, you'll get tired of it after a few hours and probably be bored with it.  I can't get used to this movie. I think I'd like a movie that is not even bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, though I had to watch it with my kid, never had any interest whatsoever. My kids, too young to care for it or anything, were less than thrilled with this movie. It's really just an awful movie to watch, which I don't think I can listen to it in a normal way, and its worse than the usual horrible. They get involved with an army, a few teenagers start to get into a big gang fight and run away with weapons, and my dad gets killed by them. It has a very weak plot, even by today's standards. The movie was an interesting project for a couple of teenagers to take on and, after watching it, I'm really annoyed with them. They weren't even capable of acting, not to my expectations. There aren't even good scenes for them to see, and there wasn't even a movie they could watch, the dialog is terrible, the writing is poor and the actors, in a poor effort to be believable, really don't take their own lives seriously enough. And don't talk about being bored with the movie, just because it's awful, it was so bad! I can only hope that their parents will finally send it to their families who they can enjoy without being bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After viewing the film, I can't recommend it as a horror flick. It's not the gore or suspense that makes a good movie, it's not a horror movie at all. The film is a very dull, stupid, boring, over-the-thepped-theft-by-it's-empty-theory-junk-of-film-content, which seems like it's meant to be an action-feature.  The characters are laughable, the acting is terrible, and the dialog is simply awful and stupid. I recommend skipping this movie, but please, even if you think it's interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of time and the movie isn't even remotely well made. I can't believe any of the actors in this film had any idea about acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of fans prefer a movie that is about a drug that has no real effect on the movie. This movie fails at most, except for the really good part where the drug is put into the water tanks, but the rest of it sucks. There's no real story line, a huge pile of trash, and a bunch of characters that were created out of a random person (maybe there's a reason to make the movie a little better.) What happened to me was really bad, but what happens to us all is going to happen anyway.  I wish I could have given this movie an 18 rating. I mean it was a bad remake of the much-maligned film "The Toxic Ghost". If there was any help for this movie I would have laughed, but I won't. I have nothing to do with the actors in this movie. I don't care what the actor is doing. The only good thing was the movie, but that's not what makes this movie a bad film. I'm not the best at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very happy when I saw this movie, but I wasn't happy for a second time. I was appalled that I can only get my hands back in the video when it got around to my fingers. It had a funny title, too, and I could not tell where it ended. I'm a long time movie, so I can tell that a lot of the movie's dialog is badly written and the ending is bad, but it does have some good jokes. I give this movie a zero rating, and don't recommend it to anyone. I gave this movie zero rating.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this movie isn't that bad. I thought it was an over-reaction-traced film, but it just wasn't. There's plenty of stupid acting, stupid dialogue, and the acting is pretty lousy.  And if you do enjoy this kind of horror, this is not worth your time, or a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't have any clue as to what I'd seen this movie as a result of my being a bit naive. The most annoying thing was that they seemed to be making the movie about how hard it was for men to find a good job, or at least, to be able to handle the job. There are two women that seem to be in charge of the plot. One of them is portrayed as some kind of leader. And there is a brief sequence where one of them shows up to the leader and asks if he could meet some of the other guys and give him a job as a new assistant director. The plot is weak, but that's about it. I was hoping to see something about a female manager to the other guy who got into some bad behavior. And after it all, I had a feeling that this movie wasn't about how good they could get at work and really had to be a better movie than a sitcom. Of course, there's a lot of good movies out there, but you just don't like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst version of a "B" movie I've ever seen. The special effects that were supposed to be there are very odd to go in the middle of a movie and the way the plot is developed makes the movie seem like an unfinished movie in the beginning, and the ending is absolutely pointless. What is interesting in this movie is the fact that the movie is about a "plot" in a real sense but that it's supposed to finish in a "event". The movies are always set in a time line, and in the last minute, they don't actually occur. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one is in a long line of films: the first one is about a guy who wants to be "a hero", and the others get involved in a plot to kill the movie's main character. You have two guys involved in this plot, and the rest of the film is about the other guys. There are two scenes with a weird guy named "Alcohol." You wonder why these guys are in this movie, and wonder why this guy can't go on his own.  But that's what you get in this film: a bunch of guys who want to be some kind of hero, who don't really want to make an impact on the world. They spend so much time doing this that they don't even want to go out and tell anybody how to go about doing good things.  This movie is not to be taken seriously, of course, because it's hilarious. And when I go back to the first scene and get it right, I'm not too pleased with it, either. But if you just sit, looking at the first sequence, and start watching it, you will get frustrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really awful. It was a bad sequel and really, a bad remake. The film's plot is so predictable it's boring, the direction is predictable and the dialog is completely nonsensical. The whole thing is really hard to watch, it's not very enjoyable and I didn't want to see this movie as one of a sequel to a bad film.  I'm still hoping to find the first sequel to this movie, but it's a mystery. The other sequel to it is better, probably. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie on the very short budget. I watched it again and my jaw dropped open and closed like a piece of dog meat. It was so bad it was impossible to watch this movie as it was in fact one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What I was surprised to find out was that this film was actually very decent. The plot, the acting, and the camera were bad and the acting was so poor it was absolutely awful. I had absolutely no idea that it was about to be a film because I really liked so many of the movies it was one of my favorites ever. The film did improve in some respects, like the musical score was better. The editing was excellent, but it did not improve with the time, the music, and it wasn't good in the film whatsoever. The director was terrible and very unprofessional. The movie had nothing to do with the acting except that one character was so stupid and his wife was a poor actress. The story, however, was never good. The characters were so stupid that it took me out of the movie at least 10 minutes. The acting was the worst, the sound track was awful, and nothing else was good. I don't know why, but my wife did not like this movie much. I thought it was a bit silly for an all-star cast to act in such a stupid movie, but that's exactly what it was. The scene where the wife walked on the toilet in the middle of a sex scene was truly pathetic, it was so unbelievable and unbelievable it was such a bad film to watch. My wife is an actor, but I can't imagine how she could possibly have gotten such a poor performance as she did. It seems like she must have done some sort of self-destructive thing or had some great acting talent to really bring it out in front of everyone. What is it? Oh yeah, the main reason why I'm so angry? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely awful, I was not impressed by the acting I saw on it. The story, where you really think the movie was about a story about a female cop killing another cop. It was a pretty shallow story of a cop killing one cop and she starts off with another cop killing her brother, a kid and then she goes off to a bar to find herself to get some money. I just wanted to say it was bad. The acting was bad, and the dialog was very poor. The dialog was just so bad I was embarrassed to see it. I found it very disappointing. I know the story, but it was just sad to see the whole story was so shallow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's one good thing about this movie: it's pretty funny. But don't waste your time and check out the first scene! It's like a slapstick slapstick parody of every other gag you'd ever heard in a horror movie. The camera work is not bad at all. But it's not good, as I think the whole movie relies on the cheap gimmick. It's not funny. It isn't funny.  It's just the same old style of horror movies that I used to enjoy. And it's even worse. There's nothing to say. I just want to watch a little more of the same crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film when it became available on DVD and it was only one of the very worst films I've seen in quite a long time. I'm surprised it hasn't been released at least in the years since it was filmed, and I suspect it never will. I have personally never laughed so much as I saw this film in front of anyone. The ending is so disappointing, it is like a slap in the face and I don't know how my life was ever going back to that movie.  It's like watching a drunk man trying to get drunker before getting drunk. This film really needs to be banned or deleted.  I don�t care what people think of it or how this was done, I�m just plain sad that it has been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first 2 or 3 minutes of the movie, this has a sort of feeling like a cult movie. I know the director had an excellent career before this. And at that point he should have a better movie.  A plot that is supposed to be a darkly satirical film is really boring, because it is not that interesting.  It seems like a movie that would be made to appeal to people who are bored or just plain bored. But I'm here for the best of it.   I think the most important thing I'd ask about this movie is the director's attitude towards the main characters. It is not too surprising to see this guy here in a dark comedy, but he is clearly getting bored. I think it's clear that he is a bad writer, but if he is going to write the best movies, he should not just get bored.  But the more depressing I think is how poor he and the other actors are making this movie. The actors get tired, and this movie shows the inevitable consequence of being sad about this situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be just a bad version of the original. The acting is really bad, the story isn't even that interesting and the acting is so bad that the film just doesn't matter anymore. If you see this movie, don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a VHS and it was awful, I'm a little concerned about the whole film since I think it's so bad. I'm sure there are some decent scenes, a lot of nudity but overall it really needs to be put away. The plot is not funny at all and I can't see how the characters are so bad, but what else can you say? The acting is horrible as well and the acting is bad, and I found it extremely disturbing. I couldn't get into this movie, but i heard that it would be posted on YouTube for the film's release in July and my guess is it won't happen again.  There are so many of the same actors involved and the film was not good and it is not a good film, it really does not make any sense to watch it. But if you really liked movies then enjoy it, the movie's just not worth watching but don't just watch it unless it's for your own enjoyment. The only good thing about it was that it was released on the DVD so it was a good way to get all the members of the cast back together again and get a chance to improve in acting. The movie was so bad for all the people involved that it couldn't be released in the DVD format, and that's where it left out! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely bad movie. I can't understand the "victory of democracy" crap they're trying to sell. This movie is just the worst thing you'll see. The storyline is about a small town on a farm, about how the town is slowly getting back to its roots, and how the old town is getting back so slowly, that it's like they're going backwards, like you see. Then some of the locals are dying. They're taking over some people of the town and having their jobs left, then they're getting killed.  They're trying the "taming", they're not being strict and demanding of the people. They are just having the town to do something stupid.  The acting is not good, even the cinematography is bad, and the music isn't bad either.  In the meantime, I don't know why this movie is so popular. I'm not sure if it's because it's so ridiculous, or because I read the reviews about it. I don 'd watch it again, if I want to see it again I'll rent the DVD again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was skeptical about this movie after I watched it in 2 hours.  It was a mess of an un-realistic horror film. The first 30 minutes were about a girl who is having sex with a stranger; the next 30 minutes will see a guy's relationship with a woman. The movie is so bad that I didn't even like it.  I do agree with the person on the phone, this is one of those films that's been done in a way that made me cringe to even watch it. There's no plot; the acting is bad; the sex scenes are not realistic; and the final sequence is completely unbelievable.  This is another disappointing film from one who knows nothing about the horror genre. You've just watched a few hours of a movie and you can't say that this has ever been a good movie. It's just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this movie, and even more sad than what I expected. There are two main characters, the one lead was pretty decent. But the two others were horrible. In short, one is a ghost, the other one is an entity in the shape of a human.  This movie is awful, and I recommend a negative rating, but not a bad one. But, there is something else that makes this movie even worse. The movie is, in a word, terrible. How many times did I find a good movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I'm a big fan of the classic 70's cartoon series, but this movie just proves that I'm too old. They've got this whole idea and somehow it just won't work. If this is a horror movie, then it's a horror on the first night. However, it should be a horror film about someones who have trouble with human relationships, not a horror about some teens. They have some cute girls who are not even friends, and there's some pretty terrible dialog in there.  The action scene is pretty stupid, and the whole thing is too fast. It is one of those things where you'll just see a girl holding her back and she's going to be a cute girl. Some of the music in the movie is annoying. I think that the main theme of the whole movie was to be boring and nothing actually happens. If you like a movie with some interesting story then go watch this! However, that is not what I would call a comedy. It's just an excuse to have a long time on the toilet. I've never heard a more amusing song since I heard this one.  This movie wasn't even interesting at the beginning, but at the end it was kinda funny. I didn't mind that they were showing the girl who had a crush on her best friend. But when it was over, I felt like this really wasn't much of a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has just got me up in a bad way, I can't even remember the name of it. I mean it's so stupid, and it's such a shallow, stupid, unedulous and pretentious comedy. And, if I were a bit more than just mildly cynical, I would say it was about as funny as a Montano movie. I have no clue how anyone can see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this with this one, I'm not saying it to be a bad film, but I am saying this is the least entertaining movie of the year. It is about the worst acting I've seen since the last time I saw "Fading Away". I've read about this movie on IMDb in the comments and wondered if anyone saw this before it came out. This movie is so bad it is so hard to understand why this could have been released, but it was released. I've heard this movie is about a real war in the middle of World War II, but you'd have to be dead to find out if it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first one is not bad, and the next one is. But the first one was really bad. This is because I think the actors have all been bad. For me, they did a very bad job with the acting, but at the same time I like their acting. They were all badly acted, just that much. I am sure there was a reason for these actors to do a better job, but the first time I saw this film I thought they were OK. I mean, they had the most important part in the movie - they were the guy who made the first video - and they could act. But I guess it was because they were so badly acted that it was more fun to watch. The film's main purpose is to be predictable. And I think it's really boring to watch a film that is boring to look at. It's not even funny, it's just dull. I don't understand why this is a hate-film. If you can find some funny video out of the 70s, I think you will enjoy it. The movie is totally garbage, there's no humor, there is no good storyline or theme, it is just plain boring, and there is nothing redeeming about it.  The next film, the comedy, is better.  I think that this film might have some redeeming factor. It is about the characters that were in this movie. Of course, I really liked the characters in the video. But it's not just about the actors.  There were many of the actors in the film, and they were good. I'd say the actor from the first film would be the one who would be in the next movie. I wouldn't even say that I am going to like the movie. It has a funny idea. It really is just about bad for the same reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still upset that this movie made it to be released. I mean I'm a big Star Wars fan but this is so bad! I had to spend some time looking at it online, and I don't have all the time, it's just so disappointing. It should have been saved by the 3.1 release. But the fact that it was so bad to the point that I couldn't even see the video clip makes it more disappointing. I didn't like it as much as the video clips.  I have to admit, I am a little bit spoiled. I'd never have cared that it's bad. It wasn't until my husband and I were having fun at a really good movie, so it didn't have to be much of a disappointment. In fact, the sequel, Return to Ravigno, was excellent. However, Return To Ravignos didn't quite compare to Return To The Death Mask. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I had both been at the same bar in Manhattan for the same date, and so we both went into the bathroom in a very low-spirited state. When I opened my mouth, I was looking for something, and nothing popped up. I'm the only person to enjoy an extremely bad movie since I was in high school (and my parents were dead). I don't know why my wife and myself have to watch this terrible piece of crap, and I'll never go to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is so stupid. Its like an adult version of "Gang Bang" or "The Matrix" that is full of cheesy lines and horrible acting. Its not funny and its not even funny, because it is way to much for the viewer to comprehend.  The acting and editing seems to be on the level of the TV shows they have aired on HBO.  What a waste of a movie. I cant believe that it even started in 1999. The movie was supposed to be finished in 1999 because it had a plot and some interesting characters. The plot is a long plot and the main character(who is obviously not attractive at all!) keeps getting injured on the plot by his "super natural" sidekick(who obviously is obviously a freak).  The most disturbing feature about this movie was the casting of a young, gorgeous, very sexy woman (that looks like a porn star) to play the role of a woman with an important job.  She was played by a very unfunny-looking actress that is too young to be played by. It is also very sad considering she is such a beautiful lady. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie more than one dozen times, and I never liked it much. I thought it would be good if it were real. It is completely bad. There are no believable plot, and the only good thing about it is a good performance.  The acting was terrible, the dialogue was poor, and there is no real sense of anything in the movie.  Even if you decide to watch it, it will be painful and slow, and not at all worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been unable to see this film because I didn't know who it was for. I have seen some of the films in the past but nothing really stands out. I know some people say that the film has some good dialogs. I can agree with that but they aren't the same in every way. The film starts with an obvious intention to be funny, and it's a complete joke. I find myself not wanting to waste my time watching it. It's just so bad it's just the worst comedy of the world. The story is poor and there is no plot to be seen. I don't know what this film is about.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the worst horror movies ever made, the story is simply awful, the acting is weak, and the plot is bad. The best part of the movie is that the girls that get a car with a dead father get to know each other and they become really good friends... but then they are murdered and go back to live with the other people who they knew. And this is pretty much all that's been done... except for the plot. I had some of the film in my mind "The Last American Express", but this has a "real" ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I've ever laughed so much in such a movie as this one, because I'm sure I have never laughed so easily.  But it does have some good qualities. I think it could at least give you some laughs, at least for the scenes. Also it really is quite unpleasant, considering the acting and the direction. The main character is an amoral teenager. I just don't see her character to be like she thought when the show began, or like the way that the acting was in it.  The ending of this show is so predictable that it can be considered funny if you take it seriously, but seriously if you're used to watching it for a while, it really doesn't make it so funny. In any case, this movie had one redeeming feature though - you can have the occasional laugh as an amusing moment, just like the ending of "The Family Guy" when the "wizards" were chasing the kids. I also think that if you just don\'t enjoy it, try watching the series of "Family Guy" instead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some good reviews of this terrible film. I'm still finding it. My wife saw it and laughed, she thought it was just some sort of "adult" film. There is no story. It is just an unbalanced thriller film. If you watch it, don't do yourself a favor and just leave the movie. There are no other actors and no plot. If it is the only movie you want to see, don the best it does of all time (it's a very bad movie, that's why). I'm a sucker for the crappy story. The acting is bad, the plot is weak, and the story is bad. I can watch some horror film and find good movies, even like "The Black Spot" and the two films above. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad it actually got picked up on release day for Christmas 2010. I've never seen any of this film before so I was really just interested. It was probably one of the worst movie I have ever seen. It is the worst horror film I have read so far. I don't really want to waste my time on this film but I did see a few parts that weren't terrible, and one was good. I wasn't really into the rest of the film, the acting was weak and the storyline and ending seemed so predictable and boring. But the good parts were good. The only reason I liked this film was because of the "Dressed Up" episode. I never really liked the film and I usually do not like gore, but I do like sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not good movie: i mean I don't know anyone who's in this movie and is watching it for money and I'm not in the business of acting. If you want to avoid being in an otherwise interesting movie then I advise you to avoid watching this movie. But if you do, I will recommend this movie to those who are scared of acting like that's not so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I really thought this was not a movie. In fact, I'd been given the impression of being in the plot.  But the story was interesting enough - not in the sense of a good story, but rather a bunch of random old-fashioned jokes that would have come from a few different films. And the fact that all three stories are related at some point makes them less entertaining.  The main story is simply about a woman who buys a new baseball pitcher, to which she then proceeds to a baseball game, with her partner, who is also interested in baseball, to further investigate the baseball pitcher's history, and ultimately decides to take up the pitch. She proceeds to the park and gets hit by a drunk guy named "Buster" (aka the "Rat"), who then leads her to the police station. This is followed by the end-of-a-beer-drunk scene, where she leaves the park to go home. That's the last story in the movie, I believe, and even then, it does not carry any suspense! The rest of the movie is a complete waste of time.  I don't like this movie. I think it was designed to cause a lot of harm by taking too much away from the good stuff in the original film - the character interactions, the good comedy, the movie's funny scenes, and the overall interesting visual style, which was certainly a good one. And I can't think of any good way to explain this movie without mentioning the fact of the film's being a series of unrelated jokes. The movie doesn't really improve in any sense, except maybe it's more of a "throwaway" film than a real one, which means it isn't entertaining anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with an unfamiliar friend, and was utterly disoriented by it. It was only after I heard the opening song that I could grasp the movie and what it was. It's just too sad, and it has an incredibly low acting. This movie isn't even worth watching if you just want to see something. If you are a fan of horror, and love the genre, this movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. If your blood is heating, please avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original plot is quite unbelievable. There are more lines than what one might expect. I really had faith that at some point it had something to do with the plot, but the ending had me doubting even though I thought the storyline was believable and reasonable. I was wondering if this was an effort to make the original movie less predictable. Well, it's easier to say. I don't think there are any more "good" endings. But I will say this movie is bad at most if you want to be entertained, especially if you're a reader.  I think this movie just needs to be taken out of its seriousness and be viewed as more of a "cute movie" than a full-on-life-cafe type movie. The movie has one interesting feature, the first scene where the young actor plays on her own, with the "Curse of Life" over her shoulder, but I think that just makes it even less funny. The plot seems like a sort of cross between two sets of movies, so the ending is the same as the one of the other movies. The final scene in "Cure In Darkness" is a pretty good scene, but it looks like they were trying to get "Cile In" off. It was a good movie in my opinion, but just like "Cire On" was for "Cite On", it was just a pretty stupid thing to end a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of a few really bad movies I saw in a good summer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you are looking for a classic horror movie, make sure it's not actually a remake! It is not even like a great horror flick. It's the same as all the "so many great" horror movies in existence, only to this point it has a few extra elements that are much worse than they are supposed to be. A lot of people claim that it's one of the horror movies of all time, but I disagree. This is the worst thing I've seen since the end of the 70's. The only reason to go back to a classic one was the "Dark Matter". But even that isn't a good movie either! This is a shame! If you enjoy watching horror, and enjoy horror, you probably have a few more movies in the vein of this kind of horror, but you don't have time to sit down to watch one of them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first tried this movie when it came out on Blu-Fi last summer but it was so terrible that I only kept one or two movies from it. This movie could be good if it was well done, and it wasn't. It seemed to be too long, and too boring to the point of being interesting. I really was surprised to find it on Blu release, which is why I didn't even try it out. The acting wasn't as good as I remembered. I didnno like the acting, and the dialog was pretty bad, and there was no good jokes. I was expecting some pretty cool jokes to get in for that, but they just didn't. I couldn't enjoy the scenes, and they were too long. Some scenes were simply awful, especially the scene where the little guy in a tree on a tree had an almost nude scene. The characters seemed to have nothing to do, but the scenes were okay. The worst part of the movie was when one of the little guys in the tree had a little girl with her. He grabbed her and then jumped off. After getting down from his tree, the girl jumped off the tree, and had to go back in search of her sister. I remember a scene like that after you had it down, just to remind you how stupid you could be. The scene where she was in the front room, it didn't have the little girl in it, but you could still see her naked from behind. She was running from the tree and running naked, so it didnno matter. That is how I felt when I finally had the scene.  My best guess was that she had been in a car and got in the door to escape, and got on the side of the other guys. Then he walked back to his house to see what was in his house. That's when he pulled the car door open, and she fell down, naked from the first guy's hands. You were probably the closest point that I remember.  The last part of this movie was pretty funny, though. It didn't help me to think of the two guys walking away from the scene, and after they had taken the elevator to the second house, they decided to take the girl and throw her out on the porch so they could leave the house. I guess that they thought she could be used as a dancer, since she was very good dancer. It was about a 30 minute movie that wasn't worth watching. There wasn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first video video of this film came out in my early teens. I never even knew it was bad. After a couple of years, I decided it might be better than it had been. I tried it again and it was pretty dull, at least for the part that I would have liked to see more of. I was hoping that it would be a great film in my youth but it just turned out to be a very boring, terribly boring, and not very well developed. But it was OK to see the parts that I liked, in my teens. The film was simply boring. It was so bad that I didn't even remember the name of it. I don't think my parents had seen this film!  If you're going to watch this film, please don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hated it. The acting was bad, the acting was stupid, the characters were stupid and the story is just so thin and predictable. I think it would be more appealing if the characters and dialog were more realistic. The ending is pretty predictable, and it's so bad that it should never have been directed. I know the story goes on, but that could have been much better if they just told the story. The story is not much fun to watch, and the ending seems just as predictable as it's written. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the least good movies in the movie line and it's only for one reason.  The most annoying thing in this movie is the plot. We are treated to another "plot" and the plot has been so dull that we usually expect an "event" after it. The plot is pretty random and is only one dimensional. The best thing in the whole movie is when the guys finally realize they can do it.  There are a lot of jokes in this film but I can't find out what they're actually talking.   Also I can only recommend this movie to kids. It is bad for a kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of a series that was never really good. But it is what it was once, it is now that it has lost all of its credibility. It was a movie that was supposed to be funny but it wasn't funny. It's very obvious that a movie about a man who was obsessed with an alien species was a bad, bad movie. I don't know if it was a sequel, a sequel to, or a derivative. I just wish it would have made it more interesting than just the one or two episodes. Unfortunately, it would lose its best selling potential if it could have more interesting characters than one or both of the main characters. But in the end, it just ended up being a waste of time. I wouldn't even recommend this movie as a popcorn movie. The series is in serious need of a new series, and a sequel with a fresh concept would be worth at least 10 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the producers are terrible and I would never recommend it. I find it annoying. They are not a lot of money to pay to the producers and they don't really care about people who write the script. The story is bad and the story is boring. The music is bad. What was supposed to be funny is just plain awful. I am sure if you are an older person in a small town with some money you can have some laughs but most of the songs are a total bore-ish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have to see this show if you really think it will be good.  What a good movie?  It's not. It is a bad show, but don't get me wrong. I watched the show before it came out, because I wanted to enjoy it, and that's why I was watching it. And it's bad! It is awful! And I don't want to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as a child, and it was just awful. The acting was awful, the dialog was bad, and I had to get out of it as soon as I saw it. I really had to put it on my first time, and decided on the film to be nice. There was so many inconsistencies, and the direction was bad. The ending was really anticlimactic, as if I was watching an entirely new film. It should have been left behind. I didn't like the idea of it being a horror film, and there was just one good part of the movie, when a group of witches get off the stairs. The witches were good, the witches were mean, and their spells were not particularly scary.  I'm ashamed to say that I actually had a very good movie in it, and thought it was good, but when I watched it again, I found it lacking in any sense.  The story itself is pretty vague and inconsistent. It has a few hints of some bits of it. There is no excuse to the ending. I think it is more like the "Wizard" movie of the late 1980's, but I think the "Munch" movie, which is generally considered to be a horror movie, should be closer to "The Witch".  I don't think this is a movie worth watching, and isn't even a decent film. I have a positive feeling for a good movie, and you should get some enjoyment from watching it, but this movie just wasn't good. It is like a bad piece of popcorn film: no plot, no story, no suspense, no real surprises, no thrills. The actors were good at what they were doing. They weren't good, they weren't interesting, and they werenutious, and nothing has ever got me to enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've come across some things like this before but I thought the story was so weak and the acting wasn't funny. There is nothing funny about the movie and the cast is bad.  I think it needs some editing and some editing to add some more depth to the story and some comedy. I don't like a sequel so much, but when the first one is released I think I hope it is a one that will do well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find that the director tried to make "The Legend of Zunik", a modern action movie of an ancient city that was a plot to destroy the empire of Xerxes (a long time historical film, of course) in order to rule over the whole world. A plot that has resulted in a very small war (with the exception of the last scene), which is interesting, but it had no real plot. The director seems to have forgotten what he wrote about the war, and he seems to think that he has an idea about how to make the movie. I guess he has just got a new job, and thinks he has got some time for a comeback. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has been my least favourite of the horror genre from a long time, though I liked it when it was very funny. The plot is very thin and there is a lack of funny humor in the entire movie, even if some scenes are amusing. One in a line of one of the movie's best scenes was one where the protagonist was running around town doing what was meant to be a normal street walk in her city but it looks very uncomfortable and doesn't seem like a normal person, in other words there are not enough funny jokes in the movie. I give it a 1/10, not because it was funny but because the movie is stupid. I understand the reasoning for this was the name of the film, but I wouldn't recommend it to a family who has seen it a few times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to read this movie, and I was terrified to watch it on the first time, because I was scared that the movie was going to end in a horrendous scene involving a pile of human feces. I was relieved to find the "best" movie I've ever seen, but at the end I couldn't shake the bed out at all. I still had an extra copy to keep in for the DVD, but after viewing the movie, I couldn and did not like it. I feel as though it was written by an incompetent writer. I hope that this movie ends at a later date, because that would be my worst mistake ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the previews, a bunch of three guys are all dressed in black hair, hair dye is obviously worn on them, a single white hair bandage is pinned to their chest with a long hair band, and the other two are all naked with their hair bands, all at the same time, with a large black pile of dirty rags hanging around their shoulders. The characters are all very boring, very predictable, and I'd recommend avoiding this film. However, there are interesting bits.   There are no good lines, and even the best actors can be very annoying, and there are little plot developments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed in this film. I had the impression that I was about to start to discover it so many of the things I had thought to be true were wrong. This is not the movie I thought it was. I was also disappointed with the way the writer/director took care of everything. The story seemed to be one-dimensional and there were several lines that should have been totally deleted from the film. When I look at it, I find the same problem with the plot. When you have a scene that is one-sided, it should not be treated like a character that goes through an entire year of getting to a movie club. I know that the director and the writer want to make a film about a child that has gotten through life and is trying to escape the "hell is there?" mentality that gets them stuck in a life that would never seem to be normal. This does not allow me to suspend my suspension of disbelief and I would prefer to try to get to another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just watched this terrible little horror flick on the web and have some good comments. I really do not understand how anyone could be so bad. This movie is so shallow and disappointing. I have heard the reviews and feel sorry for those who have been watching this movie since its premiere. But even after seeing it, I still find myself completely unsatisfied. I do not know if this film was directed by a guy or a team. There is no story line. No characters. There are no real direction. No real way to interpret the story. The actors themselves did not act properly. It is simply disappointing and it should be no longer.  It's a very, if not at all, a very bad movie. It does not make you laugh, so don't watch it. If you are a film buff, then enjoy this movie, but don't expect anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know the movies that have come out on VHS, some good but this one is terrible. The only highlight is that a guy is on screen in front of a car and he is acting with a stoned voice, like a child, but it does not matter. I'm a big American, so if I had seen this movie, I would have laughed at him. It's like the new Bond flick, and it reminds me of the movies I used to watch when I was growing up in America, so bad. I've read too many other reviews of the movie, and even worse when I saw this one. The funny guy is named "Wendell", even though I believe it wasn't in the book. I had to do some internet research to find out the name of this guy.  It's just sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a reviewer of a bad film:  i would start off by saying this movie was completely lacking in any quality whatsoever.  It was bad from the beginning until the end. The acting was not that good. The story was poor. This movie needs to be taken off of the shelf. If you want to see a movie that's an average of less than five minutes' duration. There was absolutely no substance at all and i recommend for anyone who wants to see this movie. If they want to watch this movie please do not buy it. The movie could be turned into a TV movie as well, but as far as I know, there was no other good review for this movie, so they don't have to make a sequel. It's sad when a movie which was such a bad to the people who would enjoy it ended up being a TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie hoping it might be interesting, though even the only thing I saw in this film was that the story was a derivative of several other movies. The movie is a mix of different genres and is only a few minutes long. I really could have gotten used to it since I've seen the films in the other films. That's not a valid reason for liking it.  It's not really worth to rent, but there is one redeeming point of the movie. It's the film's main character was a nice guy, who tried to make a good movie with an action-adventure theme. However, she can't act properly with it and is unable to convey anything in the story, even though she's an excellent actor. I was hoping that it would get some light commentary on the problems with movies like this, but unfortunately it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film twice in my life time. I thought it was too long and had too many points in it. I just watched it twice and decided it was a waste of time. In the end I was embarrassed to watch it, as I was a total dork, so it should never be watched again. I do not like this film but I do have to live life. I give this film a 1 out 1 out 2 out 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that the movie would at least get a good one at the end, and not one in a dozen. It was disappointing as well as the actors, the story was so bad that I felt like the first movie was about a real person and not a person that was supposed to be acting. I thought that the story line could have been improved. But I couldn't even find a single interesting character in this movie. This movie should have had a positive ending. Unfortunately it was so poor, I couldnít even really find the ending after the last scene, and I'm still looking for a DVD version to rent.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read several reviews of this film, and I just find this stupid. The film is simply the wrong direction for a film. This is an example of the film makers lack of a good directing and casting techniques. I have seen this film many times, I'm just trying to tell you that the film isn't well written, it really lacks direction and editing. This film is not worth my time to see.  I think I was an hour longer than I was going to finish the film, but at least I got to know something about this film. I'm afraid of the worst film ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this film wasn't even that bad, but it was still a bad excuse for the filmmakers to try and make this film. It was absolutely ridiculous that they wanted to keep the film alive. I was laughing as I watched this film at the end as I was about halfway through it.  I give this movie one stars out because the acting is OK, but the editing was so poor that I didn't like it. The dialog was not good enough. I mean, the guy in the film talks to him about this film and he is a teenager, that's what his dad says to him.  The film had the 'best' of all the songs, and some of them had some good tunes. But the whole movie seemed to follow a predictable story. The main goal was making the girl cry and the guy does the same.  As a viewer I don't expect you to buy this film, but don't judge it harshly. I didn"t expect that it was an original film. I thought that it would get to the level it was at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is not the horror movie that everyone hoped would come out from it. this is an obvious waste of time and money and it has nothing to do with suspense or intrigue. what else are they going to do when you sit in your office and think about this movie? just watch it and be bored, enjoy the time, spend it, and get away from the stupidity of the story. if you wish to see a horror movie to have your own laugh, watch it for a few minutes and find some horror movie: this movie is full of the standard Hollywood slasher horror movies, and so it does not stand up against the great horror movies on the market today. if we had all the money in the world, we'd be happy. if this was to be the kind of movie you were hoping to see, just don't. watch it on a 3 day ride and expect yourself to be completely bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of poor writing and acting. Some of the jokes are good, but a lot of them were bad. I understand that the humor is funny, but some of the material was so thin that it wasn't funny.  I'm sad about seeing this movie. I don't understand why it got green-lit to run, and even worse, why it was never picked up again. It should never run again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch this on my video channel and was about to watch it once. When it finished I thought the movie had to be pretty bad, and I was surprised that it was only slightly better than "Walking Dead". After the movie ended, I was so disappointed that I could never find out that the movie was any good! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is so inexperienced that he's easily out-chosen as the lead actor. That makes it all the worse that it has to be a film about a "normal" story, and it never is. It's like watching a movie that has no plot and no real dialogue. And it's not even an action film like 'The Punisher' that was about two people fighting in a city square. It starts with a silly premise that's never explained. It never gets out the first line and the plot is about a bunch of people fighting over a city block that's made up from scratch. It also starts with some really stupid dialog, where characters are talking about how good they are, and in a really stupid way. The actor isn't given a chance to speak, but I would definitely give it the next chance to break that. The movie starts to drift and get even worse when it starts to use some fake film technique, and that's when the movie is supposed to start off by a very short scene. There are also some odd visual glitches, like the camera moves in and out, and some weird scenes. It was made in the early stages of the film's production, and as time goes on the style of the movie changes and becomes less and less predictable. That's not enough to excuse its worst mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a reviewer, I find the film to be a very poor effort at a comedy. There is too much humour that I find to be one-dimensional. There are parts that go straight downhill towards "the punch line" and are not funny, but it is not enough. There aren't enough laughs. There isn't enough comedy. The script isn't funny, and the camera is simply awful. Some of the jokes were simply plain and dull, with the camera, while others could have been much funnier. The whole point of the movie seems to be to be in fact a bit of a sequel to an earlier movie, "Rock Candy", which is still available. I wish you could have seen it. I would have found it much more amusing to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has all the hallmarks of an 'adult' film: It is a plot of a pedophile with an abusive father and the kid. The pedophile has an angry ex-boy who wants to be his child. The kid has no money and is left to the care of some kind of a kid with a drug addict girlfriend.  There's not much room for the characters to develop, although the actor's acting is quite good. There's a few lines that make no sense whatsoever, like when the father is looking at a kid he sees the girl he would have sent home with. Or when the girl says the boy's father is a pedophant, the father sees his daughter as sad and desperate. The acting doesn't work on. The 'plot' is really bad, and the ending is stupid.  This is definitely one of the worst 'adult movies' of the last year. It should not be played on TV. The "Adult" label really doesn't apply to this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie because it wasn't that good and I'm not going to be one that gets tired or bored out and watches another bad movie. The acting and some of the jokes were funny. The movie had some interesting moments and some moments were good, but other movies did not have the same kind of funny moments and the movie got off to an unsatisfying ending. I don't really like it but it is what I watched for the first few hours. Some of the dialog is poor, which I donot blame this movie for a lot of the times when I had to laugh and watch my friend laughing. I also feel that the movie was way too long and it really sucks that there is only two episodes to watch. I could have just sat there and watched it and had some fun and ended up watching the movie and having the same boring ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard this story before and figured that it was based on a novel. The plot is pretty obvious, and there is no mention of any of the plot in the book. The movie was made so poor by the fact that the actors and the voice actors didn't really capture the characters. The acting is awful and the story is bad, but the rest of the script is good. The only good parts are the dialogue.  The best part is the voice actor and it's hard to believe these guys are real.    The movie had a pretty good plot, but there wasn't enough of it to make it interesting and entertaining. It's a shame that it is a bad film, and I will probably never see any sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what I've been expecting from a horror film. The acting is so bad it really comes out of the category of the horror genre. The way the actors act, even though they're good, just don't make it better than the average horror film: that's all in the way. There's no suspense, the dialog isn't good and the characters are all boring. I think the only good part was that the special effects were good. The story has pretty much nothing to say, though it starts off promising. It was like a bunch of random pieces of a bad joke. There really should have been something. The point is that they just had to throw this film away so the studio might have a case in the court. I'm not going to waste my time watching more horror movies. It's just not good enough for any rating. I'd skip this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when I was a kid, my older brother went to see a film he called a "Shallow Sissy Girl" - a comedy that supposedly contained nothing new or interesting or interesting in its plot. It wasn't even a funny film, really, it was an extremely predictable film - I actually liked it to have some of my friends, but to me it was just awful. It is painfully hard to watch this film - it's so bad that I didn't even bother to finish the movie and I still had an urge to drive to and get the DVD copy of it and rent it. I've since found out that I could probably have made up for a few hours of my time, but in the end, I made an effort to finish this movie because I had never watched this movie for a decent amount of time and found out more information on this than I did before. The acting was pretty poor - the actor's voice didn't lend itself any meaning, but the character was flat, and the acting was bad. I had to listen to this movie as I was driving home, and I found myself wanting to get out of the parking lot. I can't speak for a person who hasn't seen this film, but my best friend from "Bunny Rumbell" is apparently having nightmares about it, so it was a bad film. This movie is simply awful, but doesn't make up for my lack of interest in seeing a few of the few good films it has. I hope that one of the other "Shall Beaches" movies out of an indie film compilation will follow up to this one, because this film is just about the worst "joke" I've seen. There are only two shots of the movie - a brief teaser scene in one of them, and then there's another short teaser scene of the same film. As soon as I heard it, I immediately checked my DVD player to see if I had something else to rent, and decided that I might be able to make it. Unfortunately, it wasn't there, because I did all these films I wanted to rent at the same time and was only watching one of two movies I had in the rental. I was already mad when I saw the last "Shand is going to be gone!" scene in the first of the trailer. There were no real, sincere details, just a long scene that was nothing. I found it annoying, and while it is never said again, I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, this movie was really bad, and I'm a sucker for that. But this movie isn't one of the worst films of this decade, so it was good if it was a comedy, and it was not. It was an unrelenting, and completely unfunny, inane and unbelievable and pointless comedy. It lacked character, and lacked a sense of irony and a sense that it's really about a guy (or a woman) being sad and self-destructive. I was really annoyed by how it was about this woman (she is) so stupid. Also, I'd like to have a movie that is not so bad, but at least something that can be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a little bit frustrated when I watch this crap. This movie was terrible, the ending made me feel like a dick. I laughed, and I think it's a very, very bad movie. I also wish it wasn't so badly received because it was the kind of movie you'd expect to have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie when I bought the movie. The worst movie of the year, except for the bad acting. I think the acting was alright at first. I don't even recognize the characters. It was so bad it could have been funny. In fact, the humor, when it comes out, is laughable. I'm not saying there was an actual witty character in the movie, but there could have a funny movie. Even the title says it's a sequel. I had a decent chuckle out of it. I mean, they aren't even really that funny but it would be funny if I could figure out how to make it funny.  I'd suggest looking at something better: "Lungs Of The Lost World". This movie was about some sort of fantasy movie. But it's not funny. It's an overrated piece of work which can't even be properly understood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm no film buffs but the only thing I can say is that this is one of the worst films I've seen in awhile. The sound was awful and the story was completely unsymminious. I really want to be able to enjoy this movie more than an hour, but my other choices do not include this film. I've only watched a few minutes of the movie and I have to assume that it's not going to be one of my favorites. I have never seen the same version of the film as I saw it in the video. The camera-camera was horribly bad and even though the sound was good the film itself was really bad.  I did the movie for the purpose of one hell of a lot of money, but I didn't feel like I really had to give up my time to enjoy it. I do recommend the DVD version of this movie, but that isn't really my fault. I'm sorry for anyone who didn't like this movie to me but I would have liked to see some funny jokes. But I don't have any suggestions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been following this film since it came out on VHS and have never been able to watch it. I can't really call it a terrible film to be honest. It is rather terrible to see such a bad film and I did enjoy this film, I liked the premise of "I'm In The Zone". I was also happy to see the film being well written, but it got a bad name and the director got the job of "director" so it could not really be his work. I was wondering if the movie was put together by someone who had done a lot of bad movies in the past, because this is such a poor movie, which is a common mistake among the people who like bad movies. I like bad films, I am very interested to see how one of my favorites films from the last decade, "Curse of the Black Dragon", has turned into a real horror film.   A small joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a poor film with absolutely awful acting by none too strong. I'm not even sure how the audience is supposed to feel when they watch this. The only point I had in life is that it was really hard to watch that film. It seems to be a "ghetto film" in some way, as if a "real person" like Richard Braintes had the right to see this film. I just think he would have put his career on the line for this. I can't see how he could have gotten away with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A short film that was filmed in 1972, but only slightly resembles any of the films made during the 1960s.  After much debate and discussion, one theory has been found to explain the plot. The theory is that the film was actually a flashback for a film set in the 1990s, when the movie was set to be distributed to the world. The film's plot is so bad that it's only one word that could be used to describe it.  There is nothing to say that the movie is about a man who had been involved in sexual and drug abuse, or even pornography. It's just about a guy who is married to another woman. There's no mention of a movie: it's not even a film, it's just a video game, a movie that's only about a movie.  The film is about "A Man Named Brian" from the film's genre, "The Naked & Dangerous" and it's about a drug addict named "Brian", who has a "straight edge" and is very mean. But the movie starts out so poor it's like you can't even touch the screen. There aren't even any lights. One thing that the writers cannot be bothered with is the fact that it is so low-budget. No music is being heard in the background of the video. The soundtrack, which is very minimal, is pretty lame, and has a song that has an "open ending". That's just the start of the film.   The actors are terrible, as usual, but nothing about the film is worth seeing.  Only those who were willing to pay to watch the short film with no lights can understand what this movie is really about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was an interesting idea, but sadly it was completely disappointing. I can't believe it was that bad, it was absolutely brutal, there were a bunch of scenes with two guys at each other, then there were some scenes with one guy at each one. There was nothing about the female side of the plot that was good, there was nothing that was funny, and the overall performance just seemed out of a bad year. A movie needs a writer to finish the story, and it didn't do that, it's just an extremely dull, totally uninteresting movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole film starts out with a nice surprise. Then, out of nowhere, it all happens. As with so many films of the 1970s, this one has an incredibly stupid premise and the other people in the film, namely, a woman who looks like a demon, and a man who looks very stupid but is clearly intelligent. Unfortunately, the movie starts out well, but then it becomes totally predictable. There's a slight break in the first scene, where the girl is trying to kill the bad guy. By the time it turns around and kills the girl, we realize what the girl's doing and we realize that the bad guys are dangerous and not capable of being dangerous. They decide to meet, or perhaps meet, the girl and go on to confront each other on a "battle". There's an evil laugh in the beginning when they do this and then there's a fight where they chase the woman. After the fight, it seems as though the girl was killed by the bad. When she is stabbed, she is then put to the wheel with her head down. However, she keeps it rolling. This is stupid.  The last part of the movie is pretty good. It has a few cute moments. You just sit there and wait for it to end. It was also interesting, when the guy was looking to be killed and he looked like he was about to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In retrospect, I should be surprised that I don't believe most people who liked the movie. This is what is happening all over these past few years, and I was surprised to hear people say it was good, considering that it was so terrible. This isn't a "great" movie, but it isn't an even moderately good movie.  If you want to see a good horror movie, check out "Gimpics of Life", or even "Death By Death". But if you want just one horror movie that's a bad sequel, don't see "Dell'Avant". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a member of the International Society of Film Directors. So I saw this movie for the first time, on the other hand. So it was a good time to start learning. However I find it difficult to find any real enjoyment out of it. It does not make any sense, even in the hands of some very good actors. The scenes are bad, too many little scenes, the cinematography is bad, even though there are some decent actors like the acting professionals, and the casting looks bad. I find all of these things because there is no rhymed lines or anything that makes any sense whatsoever. I found it quite disappointing, in fact, I am sorry I watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first encounter with this movie has to be the fact that the story has gone off with this. It is a plot, not a movie, not really a movie. The acting is bad, the acting is very bad. The story is bad and the acting, if you listen to it, don't see the movie, don't want to. It's an idea that all the good actors in Hollywood are doing a mediocre job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why people think this movie is a horror film, which I do not understand why. It's just a bunch of people who were acting with an overly complicated script.  Even though I can say the movie is funny, it's just really bad for the whole film. The acting is the weakest part of the film, and the acting is bad, and bad. What's your opinion? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a child actor/actor/actress who wanted to go on stage/film/video but was so bored by what the movie said about the characters that I chose to not follow. What is the idea about the plot? Some of my friends say that it is because of the fact that the plot is so predictable and predictable. Other of them say it's because the characters are not so interesting, not that it's a plot. But, there are two questions to me. Are they so bored? Or is it a plot? Or are they making it up? I'm sick of the way the people are acting.  There are just too many things to get through the end of the film.  I really need to hear what the story is about, what is the purpose of it? I really had hopes for it, but the movie left me at home and bored me.  It wasn't all bad, some of the ideas were good but the film is not for me, and if you are interested in a film, I would suggest looking at a copy of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, at worst, an attempt at an Oscar that I would expect from a cheap film that looks more like a horror than any major Hollywood film. This movie isn't even as effective as a horror film; it is a comedy that falls into the category of a comedy. And even that joke fails to matter. The story is a complete lack of anything that could be regarded as serious; there are no real horror elements (not even if the ending is to be rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My god, this movie is very bad. And when I look through the trailers, I think I'm missing something important, like the music. I've never seen a film that was so bad in my life. I have so much trouble understanding what it is that I think the people responsible for this film don't recognize that the movie was about a major thing happening in the world. If anything this movie was a movie about a god, who made this movie, that god doesn't even exist. There were two scenes where a guy walks around looking lost, and then he's told to go home.  The God who gave us all these god stories are in the books they were making a movie with, and apparently in the book they didn't even write a line about the story they were trying to make.  I've read these books since they were released, and I've seen them again. If you want to see a bad film: watch God, because of all the books I've ever read, they do not deserve a film made about them. The guy with the yellow suit who's giving us an alternate version of the God story is called "God". He's actually a man in a leather coat. In the next scene you see him going on the "Battanera" planet, looking like he's taking off a long nightwear. It's about an hour and a half when we first see him.  It's interesting to read a book about a story about a God like this one, but I don't know why I would trust the book, because even if I were to read all of the stories and books, I wouldn't be able to make sense of the story that would make me uncomfortable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a huge fan of the first installment of "Fever" but didn't really care for this sequel. I'm a big fan of "The Big One" and my favorite was "Wake Up" which was one of my favorite films of all time. There was just no substance to this sequel and I think I would have lost interest after the first episode. This sequel is about a big pile of crap and I don't even know why the filmmakers decided to make it.  I think they wanted to get "Fargo" and so they had to make the sequel before the first movie was out and this sequel was the excuse. They wanted to make a sequel that was an excuse for another crappy sequel. After my first viewing, I didn't even think about going out and renting the sequel but since I rented it I did. I also didn't have time to rent the sequel and they tried to make me sick off. I was so upset that I only liked the first season. But once I saw the sequel I was sick off and didn't want to watch more. I have to admit that this sequel is so bad and I'd be interested in seeing a sequel or just a full-length movie with the actors involved and I just didn't see the first one.  This sequel isn't even a story but the whole thing is pointless. It seems that some people have gotten bored of the series and decided to use it to make "Faster" to get some money. If you are tired of the "Fable" show, you just have to see this sequel instead of enjoying "Feline". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film many times. I was the one who insisted on their "greater days" to see it. I am still wondering how it got that far. A film of cheap, unfunny jokes, bad dialog, bad jokes, and a story that is very unapparent and very shallow... I can only guess why this film has anything in it. The film's producers are so bad that it could be a sequel to "The Mosepho Gang", the first film. I did some research on the subject of the "The Kid" that has to have something in it for it to follow. I also did some further research into "Kid" after being put into a holding cell in Korea in the USA, and I decided it was good enough to do that. I tried to write a positive review about one good movie: This is one of those films that should be shown on cable television. When you see this film, make the effort to see this for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read most of the comments, but I did not like the movie so much. I didn't like the acting of the kids. I was very bothered by the fact that the kids were acting so badly. I also saw the part in the movie where the little boy was trying to have sex with the boy in a pool of water and was so ashamed of taking his clothes off. I remember this in a really bad movie of 'The Little House of Hades.'  The other part of the movie was the movie starts with the main character talking about the fact he can not bear children. Then the other guy starts talking about him going on a date with a guy who would have to sleep with him. The two guys agree on the date, then the other one says, "He can't sleep with you, because your parents have told you that it's not in his best interest to sleep around your mom's kids." The guy says, 'Why?' The boy then asks, 'The answer is very, very, terribly, very ugly - this is such a sad, disgusting, horrible movie.' This movie was made in England, it should have been made by England, or at least had the rights to distribute it. I did hope it would come out of England, but even I was expecting it to be distributed on HBO. There should have a disclaimer about this and inform people how bad this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some of these bad acting performances, but these guys make their way up with the humor and their faces, but there isn't any funny comedy at this point. They never stop to do any funny thing. I was expecting to find a comedy about a movie with a black actor. I think this movie isn't funny because there isn no humor whatsoever. There are no funny characters. They just sit in a room and act with each other, which doesn't help for the movie. What's the point? I didn't expect any funny movie, but I did expect a joke that could be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An action film about a sad gang of criminals. As expected the first hour of the film is a relatively interesting crime drama; the rest of the hour is annoying. The action is bad and the direction is laughable. The actors are not good enough either; the dialogue is bad; the direction and the production are just not good. The film is nothing but a waste of time; if you just watch it it it's a waste in time; but if you want to see it, it's not too bad, just don't see it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you need something to watch, watch this movie: its bad, there are few funny jokes that are not comedies and the whole movie is filled with sex jokes that only show the male attitude and the male porn. There is nothing funny and not funny. But if you want to see a laugh that doesn't ruin your day, you will probably find the funny bit. There are two or so people in the movie. In fact, I saw two women with long hair running around and getting drunk. I also didn't like the acting of the women in the film but the characters were alright.  You have to see this movie and judge for yourself. Its only okay for a porn movie. I'm ashamed and sad, but my friends are all getting drunk for this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie wasn't that bad, but it was that awful! I don't know why I thought it was so bad, considering that I saw it last year on HBO! But I guess I was just thinking the plot was OK, so I thought I'd be satisfied with it and enjoyed it. It's really hard to enjoy this movie, and even if you love the movie then you might have to have a special movie to enjoy it. The whole movie is just a complete mess of bad, and a disappointing waste of time! I'm going to give this movie a low rating for this movie because it does a poor job, because it has to be the weakest on the list. The plot is very weak, and the characters are stupid, and I can't imagine why anyone would have to like this movie. But hey, I give this thing a low review too! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I noticed is the "camera pan" thing is missing in the video. It is always going to be used in a movie to illustrate the camera moving through a huge number of objects. So when I was about to watch this movie, I was a bit skeptical about it. I thought there was something strange about the camera's movement. It looked weird as if it were going to drift off and look back to the sky.  I'm sure if you were watching a movie in a video store, like a movie from a movie store, and you had a huge bunch of props, you'd get used to the camera going back and back. It didn't seem like it was a plot. And I mean this movie has no plot. There is no idea how it's supposed to be like this movie. It's the same story throughout but it's just a bunch of stupid characters. It looks like they're going through the world on a boat. Maybe it's because this movie is so long. It would be good if there were more good stories like this. It also turns out to be a movie about a character who died in a horrible way. It just seems unbelievable that the characters have such an effort to pay off. It must be some kind of a trick of writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of all the James Bond movies -and the one I liked was one about Michael Caine and Julie Murray. But this movie is a horrible piece of trash! I think they should have stopped making this stuff when they tried to get rid of this horrible sequel. The story, as I recall, starts out as a love-novel and ends as a poorly constructed movie. So that's not too bad -just like when you see a sequel of "Dare Not Kiss" or "Champions of the Earth" or some other crap that has the same plot and plot!  It should have been a sequel, and not a sequel. In fact, I was one of the biggest fans of "Mocking the Dragon" and even read the whole book of the original book and I don't know if I could have been fooled by it. I didn't realize that they were trying to get more of this kind of movie, and I thought the ending of "Dragon" was funny and funny. It's just another example of the kind of rubbish I watch when I watch an ad or film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife's not the greatest movie fan. I am not too thrilled with it, it was an extremely bad film. It wasn't even funny, and I laughed at the whole "making" part. It's terrible and the only point I found of its relevance was that it showed my wife as a stereotypical blonde. I could have laughed at my husband in a movie like that, but didn't. The acting was bad and I was upset. I was very dismayed after watching this and wanted to make my wife watch it. I didn't like it much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a pity to see a movie that has to end with such a disappointing ending.  This film had all the right ingredients in place, but they weren't done anything right. It's terrible and it will haunt you in a few days. The plot was unbelievable. But the main problem was that there was no good ending. If you got involved in an "fantasy" movie you might be willing to buy the DVD, but I recommend you to skip this movie.  If you are curious about a more "real" film (like "The Making of a Real Space Station") and don't want to be subjected to the typical Hollywood hype and disappointment you might want to see, I would recommend checking out some of the new "real space movies" out on DVD:  I'm a fan of "The Matrix" and "Alien Contact", but I find most of them to be a complete waste of time. They are way too busy to even make good "real life" movies.  There are no good endings.    The acting was bad, the acting was terrible and the humor/personal drama/soul humor were weak and disappointing. And, that's about all I can say about this movie, which was made to get the "realness" of this film out, but instead it fails to do that and fails to give us any real satisfaction. The only thing I could find out after reading the book and watching it for the first time was that this movie had been directed by someone with no interest in making it so that we can understand what it was and why it was here.  I had hoped to see an interesting "real science fiction" movie that actually had some interest in the subject matter, but the director never cared about that and only seemed interested in getting his ego to be satisfied and be famous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible in both appearance and style, and that's because the acting is awful, the special effects is laughable, and the acting has a couple of cute parts that would be interesting but not in a real life way. I think it's an insult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so poorly produced, badly acted, and seemed to have little story to tell. I saw this movie for my second time and the whole thing is a joke. I never knew about the reason the film was made, but now I think I have. I get it that they are trying to make this kind of film and I do not understand why. They should stop trying to become a comedy but instead they should try to make the movie a decent piece of entertainment, but unfortunately I think they are just trying to get a few laughs and get money for their film and no one wants to see this movie anymore. I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it does not make sense and it is so stupid it hurts. If you want a comedy you will find something that works and nothing that is too hard to follow. If for some reason you just want to watch a movie to enjoy it, you will not be able to, but you should definitely avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie many times, and after reading the reviews the ratings have me confused. I thought that they had been good, but I was very uneasy. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean this movie was about a murder that was so obviously faked, then the plot was predictable and predictable, even when it was about this killer. It was about an insurance agent killing the guy's boss, then he was killed by the insurance agent and sent the next day to the office, and the next morning he got a message to shoot his boss. That just seems a waste of time, but don't let the director of the movie get a big job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was not good, and the direction was bad. In the end I felt sad at the end of it, but, that's not a bad film! It's one of the worst movies ever made. Not one of my favourites. The ending is quite sad. There's a whole section of the movie that is completely unnecessary. The way the story is treated is extremely sad. I don't know why they didn't like it, or didn't want to make it, because I can't understand what their motives were in the end. The movie has nothing to do with acting. It just has no purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made off of pure stupidity. It's got a bad review for it. The plot is poor and there are no suspense whatsoever. It doesn't matter if you're in the early 1980's. It is an average 70 minutes. You need to be on the edge of your seat and get on some exercise. The direction is bad, the acting is poor, and the dialog is bad. The ending is disappointing and you need to look up at the new box on television to see the new movies, and you'll see a bunch of other movies, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the same thing as I read about earlier and write about it. The movie starts with a guy taking a bath with a lady on her phone. He's getting ready to see a movie with him girlfriend so they get the movie ready and have sex. After that, he starts to take his time and make plans to meet her and make a million dollar film called "Gentlemen Woburn". It's not the film you would expect but it's not that well known. Also, it turns into a porn flick. Some of the actors had trouble getting in the movie properly and the rest just played stupid.  So my advice is don't see this movie. It's just like watching a porn movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because it was free to rent and I thought it would be OK for the kids. I was surprised to learn that I was a total idiot who was willing to rent it. I bought the movie because I wanted to see some cute girls playing in the movies and this movie sucked me off so bad! I could only buy one movie to rent. But it was so bad that I didn't even rent it! It's not even worth what it cost, and I'd just watch it again and call it a bad flick.  I can't believe this movie is supposed to be cute. I didn' expect anything else to come out this bad movie. I could do my own research on this movie but this is not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought the movie was funny at first and I didn't like it after being exposed to it. I have come to the conclusion that it was a huge piece of garbage that could never get past the 90% to 100% of people who have seen it. In spite of the fact that it is not quite a complete film, it does have its own interesting qualities and some interesting locations but it fails to do anything that makes any sense. The dialogue is poor and the acting is just bad, which is probably the best part about it. The acting is so bad that it really made me want to tear up the walls and to run in fast feet so that I can scream. The film has a story and some action but it is all so shallow that it doesn't make much sense and is even hard to understand. The ending is disappointing at the very least. The story is that the evil people who run this movie called the "King of the World" to get rid of the bad guy who stole their bodies and who wants to have sex with every female to make them live. The message on this movie is nothing more than a bunch of stupid nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So this movie is only a few months old and I can't believe that they are going to try and improve it. The story is fairly predictable, and there are too many of plot twists (the whole movie could be a film where you actually act in a scene to see the plot. It's just too predictable). But it still fails to come alive and doesn't do any real acting. I didn't feel like I could even watch it again, and I have to wonder if it would be better in another movie. I think the reason they did it was because they felt that this movie would take away from the seriousness of the story and just keep a fresh and interesting visual of the world. What's even worse is that they don't have a story for the characters, it's all about a "bond" storyline. It feels like a piece of junk, and they just wasted their time on it. A real effort to be a big Hollywood film doesn't want to try a big film, and instead goes off on a long, boring plot line. I am looking at it and wishing it could be the most successful movie. But I think it would have to change up its narrative direction before making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sorry if you have watched this movie so much or are even still watching it. As a father of two kids who has grown up on it I understand this movie is not a good film - at least the way the movie is written is so flawed that it would not be enjoyable to watch - but I will go ahead and admit that this movie does have some charm - like most comedic films, it is silly as a "comedy" in a way, but also it isn't that funny.   But, what is about this is that a guy like me is probably going to die.  The movie starts out with the typical bad beginning of a bad comedy - the guy turns into a guy who gets drunk. He then proceeds to drink to be drunk again and get drunk. The guy starts acting like the drunk guy. He does not do anything else for a couple of weeks, but on the fifth day he starts doing that, and then starts talking about how his brother died - as in, he said, he had it all along. After seeing the story of this guy's life - it's all in his own house, and when the other party enters through the door he is startled and runs for his wife. He doesn't want to see his wife - his wife is his wife, not a stranger. He keeps talking about making a million dollars - how much money was it? The person then turns into "the drunk guy" and starts talking with her about how she's never got married. She starts talking more about how her husband would have been a bad husband, which she thinks is stupid. The only person she had that person was a friend of hers.  She's married to his own brother, who was in a lot of trouble - she says he needs her, but then she decides to let him go so he has to do what he wants. She makes him fly a plane, which he does, and soon after he's drunk, his brother dies.  Then the other guy dies, and the drunk man starts to have sex with her again. He's also still drunk and he starts to do stupid things, like eating at the restaurant he's always at. He has problems with his wife and he's in trouble with her - he goes to see her after his wife turns up her own house.  Once there is nothing left to do and there is no one for her, the drunk gets drunk again. The other guy also starts acting with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I'm going to comment on the main thing that's going to hurt me.  One of the most depressing and disturbing movies ever filmed in the history of American film is this one. It's all too bad. I'll admit that I didn't like it until the end, but I think that I would have done a lot of research and watching it just like you'd expect. I had my own expectations from the beginning of the film and from the start it just didn't deliver, so I was really feeling cheated. I was disappointed in the end because I had been hoping that there would be something worthwhile to enjoy. So, I gave my thanks to the people who made this movie because I didn 'know what happened on its first day. They made this in one day, for $1.00 and I'm not sure what the hell they were up to. Just don't expect any of this to work, even if it does well at some other time (like this). It's just not good for what it's lacking, and there are far too many things in this film that are only a bit interesting in comparison with other films. The worst thing about this is that I'm ashamed to say I couldn't sleep through it. This movie wasn't even that good at all. But it does have some good scenes. But too long and boring and not interesting to go to sleep.  Also, the only person that I liked about it was, and I thought I'd be able to enjoy this film. I'd actually have enjoyed it if it were just a good film and if it could be a film. There are only 2 or 2 good movies that I've enjoyed in a long time. I don't know why a guy who wrote a negative negative review would actually enjoy the film. In the end I think the movie was a very boring, and that's what a movie doesn't always deliver. But I still have to give the guy credit for the fact that he actually made it interesting to watch. So sorry for the crappy and bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part of this bad-movie was a horror-movie that ended up running like the rest of it. It had some good horror scenes and some horrible effects but overall, it wasn't a good horror movie. I'm sorry, it has to be rated B but, if it was only rated B it would have been really bad.  It's like the new horror-s movie of American Horror movies. Some people might disagree, and I'm one who'd like to see a horror film that has some interesting horror stories, and other actors, but when I watched this I was still disappointed and was kinda sad that the movie didn't finish up its run.  So if you're looking for a movie that has a "scary" story and then doesn't finish, beware. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't care what the movie is, but I have been trying to find out what's actually there. The first one is the movie takes place in a middle class of a bunch of rich middle class people (the "thugger" is the one person in the middle).  There is no real mention of the rich middle, and the movie never really gives a clue about how it actually happened, although there are some hints, such as "why do they come in to this? Why does it happen? It is about a "big deal" - like the "Big Money" movie.  The other movies seem to take place around the same time as the "Titan Money". If one would have thought that there was a middle-class, high school type person in this movie, it wouldn't even be a major scene, because most of the plot lines are just that way.   My friend told me of the movie being about a bunch "big guys" who decide on where to buy a house. After researching how a guy goes to be an "big guy", I found it was about a group of middle class kids who decide where to go after getting some money.  After watching this movie I couldn't tell which one it was.  I guess that it is about one of the "big money" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the acting at this film to be so poor. The characters are pretty much ridiculous. I would not recommend this film for anyone who is looking to have a decent film. If you want a horror film then look away, even if you want to go on and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has one redeem feature - the actors are all good. But I don't get how the film is about.   The film is full of clums for some reasons and also seems to be lacking in the overall comedy department. The plot and the characters are bad, and the music is bad. But the film doesn't have a great ending.  There should be a good movie about a stupid movie - that doesn't mean a good film about a movie.  But, if you find this movie entertaining, you should not rent this movie and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be a bit weak. I'm disappointed in the director and the producers. I found the movie pretty funny and fun, but I'm afraid to admit I didn't really enjoy it. The story is pretty weak and the acting was really bad. I did get to enjoy the movie for a second, but that's not a good thing.  There are no good point in this movie. I would like to have it replayed for a few minutes and then stop off, so we can get this movie out of our minds so that we can remember the feeling that everyone had left in us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As one of the new "Mastick" movies, I found myself obsessed with the whole thing. I was really sick of this movie. I don't even have one piece of popcorn, and I know there's only one movie where it has no special effects or special effects. I can't even read, and the effects are so bad that I had to watch it again and again, hoping that I would find something good. The only good thing is that I found out that I could watch it all night. I just watched it again, and that was about thirty minutes of torture. But, what made it so terrible was that none of the characters was shown at all. The story itself is pretty bad. The entire thing seemed to be a plot on the board of a soap opera. That's a pretty big difference in terms of plot. This is also why the movie is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a world full of magic, the only person to get away with "The Wizard" is Mr. Fadels, a sorcerer, a former student of the "Magic Academy", or what you'd get if "The Spell of Telepathy" is a magic school.  After graduating, Mr.Fadels was sent to "The Dungeon" where he learns a spell to "magicize" the world. A student who's "magic" is killed by an idiot, and he and Mr.Puff, another magic student, go to "Anchise".  "The Potion" is the result of an insane idiot, a magician.   "Riding Magic" is an idiot's spell.  "Sleight" is what Mr. Puff does when she rides his horse with the "sleights" and then puts the victim (who's legs are tied to a stool) into a small hut with his father's blood on it. After Mr.Auburn gets "the potion" from a dead body and gives it to "a demon" and "a person" who has it.  The idiot (who is known as "Mr.Puffer") is also a demon, and when his father is found dead, the demons of "Mr Puff" come out with the intention to "eat" his dad and his wife, who are bound to the spirit which is in his body. The demons then use the "dungeon" to drive the fool and his father to death. After eating and taking a nap, Mr Puff and MrAubound escape from the dungeon with the help of some good demons. The demon's name for her is "Bom" and he is a demon of the dark arts of the realm. He is known for the ability to take the souls of people and the body of a man. He's an evil demon, the Devil of "The Devil" and the "Duke of Darkness" for that.  Mr. Auburn and Mr Puffer and Mr Fadel get into a quarrel about who will end up killing them. The first person to go along with the three is Mr Fads, who's been cursed. He and MrPuff try to work some demons into demons, who will use the flesh of Mr.Wenderson to "vacuum". The two demons then merge into one demon and two devils. The two devils use their magic against Mr
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I see is that the movie is supposed to be a documentary about the movie of a little boy who has grown up to hate all of his teachers.  There are few interesting plot lines, and the film is generally a mess.  Overall, the whole movie is lacking in any way, but that is not enough to be the movie to be good. A better story, one of the best ones I've seen in this movie is "The Secret Life of a Woman".  It was a good movie. The other issue I had with this movie was that it is completely pointless and boring and predictable. The best way I found out about it was that the characters in the movie are all so bored and lazy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't comment on this movie unless I already told my friends that I had to hate it. This is so bad that it's a bad remake of the horror movie "House of Wax" with the addition of some other crap (including a scene where Eddie Wineland's wife is put in a plastic bag to seal the toilet; I'm guessing it was put in here to get "back to zero". This is an incredibly bad movie. And the new trailer has even got worse. I was expecting a good horror film, but I didn't really expect the movie to suck that much off.  I was hoping to see some movies that had some good horror-like scenes; and I thought it was a horror film. This movie fails to contain even a decent horror-movie plot, and it seems to lack any kind of suspense or suspense. I couldn't even tell if the woman who's in the bath is dead or alive, and I found myself wishing to find the gun that's in there, so I checked my husband's faucets.  There were two scenes in the movie that had been released before it was released, but there wasn't any gore or blood at all, and the scenes were all fairly good. There's nothing interesting or scary at all in the film, and although the girl's body was well put together, it felt like she was going to die at least once.  Other people who are into horror movies might prefer a horror movie, but it's hard to watch these movies in a movie theater; even if they're good, it's too late.  Don't get me wrong; I usually don't watch horror movies and prefer to just sit in the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to see this for a while, as I hadn't seen it before. I'm very unhappy with it. I just want to see a movie with characters who are normal, but somehow made to look "pretty" by a movie crew that doesn't even seem interested in the actual characters.  I think the director got tired of me for even being interested in a movie that looks good. This movie is bad, and I'm sorry to say I'm glad for that. But even if you don't want to hate the movie for that reason, it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the only one of this movie with one decent plot. It was not too bad, but a small story could not create suspense.  The acting was bad, the camera was bad and the dialog was too slow. In my opinion, this movie needs a plot and a character. There is no suspense and none of the story had any real suspense. The acting in the first parts are not believable, the dialog is not realistic and the ending had no suspense. But the end is pretty good for the actors and the story doesn't matter. It is about a couple of guys who get involved in a lot of business and some guy who is planning to get the women who is a roommate.  I recommend a 10 out of 10 or even less, but I was so bored watching this movie that I had to watch the whole story. It's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this movie?  You need to watch this movie to understand what you can and cannot. There is nothing more than a typical Hollywood film. Nothing better. There are no plot, there are no action. There's no character development, there's no dialog, no nothing except a few random noises. That's all there. What you want to do, is to watch an endless amount of pointless crap, and then try to find something worth reading for it.  The acting is bad at all and there are some funny moments. The music is annoying, but it doesn't really affect the viewer. The editing is OK, but there are very poor editing and it's so bad that no one has a chance to make it. I can see why it's not even good for people to watch it. There have been some great, but mostly bad and good films in the past. They don't make the people who do like them want to think that they were good. The film doesn't even have any real suspense, but the way that it puts itself in a box is always going to make the viewer bored with it. It's hard to watch.  It is sad that it is only one film. Maybe I just didn't see how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care whether I liked this movie. I couldn't even get used to it. It was simply awful and slow and pretentious, but the director had to make it entertaining. It never took much effort to make this movie look entertaining.  A shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, it's too bad to be filmed, and I'm really a fan of it. However, I just can't see the whole of it in my memory. I did, though I know from a long time now, what it was. I guess it's just like one of many "B movies" that were put out by a movie company, and were just used to fill up with a quick plot and a very simplistic plot. It didn't have a real plot. I would have liked to see some scenes where it got a sense of how the characters are dealing with the problems that life in the city really is to them. This film was just the opposite of the other good movies. I mean it was just plain, ugly, and pointless. The acting was bad. The characters seemed to be in a completely unfunny environment; and some people just didn't want to know how it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the first part of this movie, I was skeptical. This movie was way too lame, as far as the acting was. And I also thought that the lead actors were weak, too, especially Michael Clarke as well as Peter Falkoff. It didn't help that Peter Falkick was so good as a guy that would beat one of his own men, either, it didn't seem like a movie with a plot to be interesting.  If you like movies like the "Dukes of Eldora", then you might enjoy this movie.  However, if you don't, then you may be an odd person, like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know people have seen this movie. I don't believe it's that accurate. Some of the people I knew have seen the movie more than 20 times.  What is more difficult than seeing a 3/4 out of 10?  I'm not going to guess. I've seen the whole thing. I had to watch it again in order to avoid spoilers. That's a pretty hard task to avoid getting spoiled. But the only reason I can see why people are seeing it is because the acting is so poor and the script is so stupid. The movie is not a bad by itself. I would have had liked a movie to change the plot to keep this thing down. It just got so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An excellent title for an inept film. The story is the weakest part of the movie, but still decent enough. There were only three of the actors (including the two stars of the film) who were worth a second-tier performance.  The acting was pretty low-key and boring, not at all convincing or convincing, and there were no laughs.  There wasn't enough good action scenes to get a decent laugh out of the bad acting and the bad special effects.  While it is true that the story is a bit amusing, this movie doesn't come out of pure absurdity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought there was a good documentary on this movie. I mean a lot of things in it were interesting and entertaining but this was a really bad movie. The film had an unbelievable ending and I think the actors should get paid for their parts. There was no good reason for the story to be that long.  It seems like the movie was an attempt at historical truth. It just has too many of the same clichés. I've seen a lot from all the movies mentioned above and I have nothing positive to say about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film several times, and the first time I saw it, it wasn't even remotely interesting. The movie is full of awful dialogue. The film was supposed to be a film directed by the Italian film director of "The Italian Mystery", but it never seemed to matter. It's a shame that this movie has become this garbage film. Don't even try to avoid this movie; there are some good ones out there, and this film is a complete mess. But, don't waste your time either. It may be good at some point, but it will always be bad. The plot is really predictable. There are no real suspense, and there is absolutely no story. All scenes are completely predictable, and when it comes to a scene, the dialog is very, um, un-dramatic. Even the ending is unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a joke. Its a shame that such a movie got made. This movie will take you back to the time of watching the first season of the new "Ghostbusters" series. Even if you have seen that series you will find this movie boring, and even worse if you were watching it. I saw it for the first time, and it was pretty fun. Unfortunately I didn't buy it, but you'll find it at least 4 stars out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't blame for this. I've never seen this movie before. It's about a 3 out of 10 for me. It sucks. The story is pretty cool. Nothing is terribly important.  There is no mention about it in the plot or in the ending. There are some minor spoilers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, with its ludicrous-instructual plot, bizarre characters, and bizarre scenes, is a poor choice of a horror film. The director clearly got tired with their first work and wasted no time to finish the movie. But if you're looking for some really good horror, you'll need a movie that doesn't go straight to the bottom of the movie by the second or third. If you're a horror buff, you will probably enjoy it. If not, you might find the two or three that didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was made for the big producers of the 20's (who also made the film) and they wanted their money back. Of course, it's a movie about a family that has just one daughter. If this is a film about a teenager, why don't they have more than an hour to show what the girl has done, or how she got involved in the murder? What about a child that just died? The filmmakers made it seem to be some sort of action movie. This film was really a mess. All the special effects made me want to throw the DVD away. I really think that these people were trying to make money off it, or that it was really just a lot of money for their bosses. It is just a wasted of good film. The acting is awful, the editing was bad, the special effect in the first scene was bad and the cinematography was just bad. You don't get anything out of it. Avoid it, don't watch it, and don't waste your time either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a lot of buzz for the first time. This should be in the 3.5 rank. The story line is too simplistic and it shows the same story line, no new story for this film. This is also a bit predictable and not exciting. The film is way too long and has some very bad acting. It was not really surprising in how it ended, even though the story is somewhat predictable, the acting was pretty weak and not even funny. I do not understand why the author is making this film so hard to watch and find the other good characters in this film, but I do find the plot too weak to watch. If you can watch it and get a chuckle out of it, then enjoy the 2/10 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is about the only thing that could possibly contain my disappointment. the main thing that really drives the movie is the fact that the film is so badly made and the plot is so stupid and the acting is so bad. the only time that I really laughed out was the scene with this crazy girl, who would not look at a movie. of course all of those actors would probably have liked the acting, but this film shows no real emotion and there isn't any funny or dramatic scenes, it's really a dull scene with very boring acting. I had to watch the film twice to convince myself that the acting was in fact good. it's a shame how one of the best actors of this film was in a comedy movie called "American Ninja's Ghost". the only redeeming thing in the film was the film's main plot and the ending, but even that would not save the film. It looks like an old porn film. I'm surprised this film has gotten the recognition it deserves. I give it zero in rating and a low two out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a movie comes out that is simply a collection of the worst stereotypes ever made, I don't think anyone who has a sense of humor can find any enjoyment from this film. The film is so bad that even the director has no interest in making it funny.  The film features a very weak supporting cast with just one supporting character. It's not worth seeing for even a one minute of time.  It's just another way to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had any choice in the world to watch this movie, I would not like it. The story is unbelievable. What is the point of these stories if there is a chance to have a real life life? Of course the story was about the war, the money, the war in Europe, the drug addiction, and so much more. There are no more stories to tell.  Of course it would be nice to have some money, but the movie's really stupid in other ways. It makes no sense to live a real adult life and to make sure your family is well cared for. How does the real life of your family go after the money? The movie is only a short documentary of one man's life, which is about what a real family should have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no dialogue, no good acting, no plot. A complete rip off of the previous movie. If you like to see some funny stories, you might find this one a good time. If it's not for you, this movie will fail for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was I doing? I had not seen this movie for 4 years, but I did see it again 4 years later. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, which is why I wrote my negative review of this movie. I'm still trying to find out why this movie was never published. I suppose it has something to do with this movie being a sequel to two movies: the first one is a sequel, and the second movie was a sequel. But unfortunately, this movie is a complete failure in every other sense. Not only were the acting/the story/the direction terribly bad, but the acting is so bad that I have to wonder why it was written to be in one story. Of course I was surprised that the director of this film was a man named Michael Clarke Duncan, because he is also the director and former assistant directing master of this crime series. But, if you knew that he was the director, and you are not in a position to be able to use his name as a director, then you will understand that he is a very manipulative person and that he has an agenda to completely ruin this movie from anyone. In the original "Bully" (which I watched and loved) he said, "The main purpose of Bully is to be a comedy, and to be sensational," which, in part, is supposed to work to appeal to a wider audience, which it failed to do in this case. "Buffy" is about a drug addict who kills people to get high and goes into a house to get drunk and get drunk with his friends. The only thing that makes this movie not a comedy is that the main characters are in the wrong place for the movie. In fact, the only thing you can really feel are the "gangster" characters. This has to be used for a comedy only if the characters were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few things that make it look like a film. It's basically a bunch of people that look like zombies who break apart in the middle of a movie.  This is probably the only horror film I've seen in over a decade of time. It doesn't matter how many hours I spent watching it, but it has the worst movie in the history of all time. You are going to have one or two out of five things that go wrong. The only positive thing I can say about it is that I found it amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a good cast, but they aren't good actors. This movie doesn't have any plot. The characters seem to have been written in a school of psychotherapy. I have read many other good reviews about this movie, but I do not find any good comments about the actors. The film is too long and there's no plot, no dialogue. I don't know if this movie has any effect on other films such as the 'Pied Piper' remake, 'Aliens of the Earth'. The only time I've heard is a negative comment about this film.  The only good thing about this remake is this little extra scene. I'm not sure why the filmmakers had done this. But I wish it were in 'Pierro' with a female lead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a little bit angry at this film for my first visit to London. It had little of the world that I was expecting. The story is pretty weak, even when it is all so good. If you've ever been a smoker or smoker or have been to British radio, then you're only left to be disappointed. I'm also sick of the British version of the film. I was looking for a good movie that really gets this film down. The best version I've seen is the BBC version which is completely different from the one I saw. This one needs to be ripped off and put in its proper context. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has nothing, and very little, to do with its premise. What a writer could have done is to have done something to get a character in a good movie with a decent storyline. Something simple and stupid, like some writers of today's shows do when they show a character as a "bad guy" in a story, and then get into the plot with a very simplistic and stupid twist ending. This movie isn't just about a "screwstomp" - it is just a "unreal" film about a really bad movie about a fake story of life that isn't about real life.  This is a movie about nothing, a movie that doesn't have a purpose, a story - that has nothing to do but to create an illusion of being about a real world. What else is it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, to me, just another lazy little story about a family with an abusive father.  Not even the fact that the film is rated PG-13 would make me think it would have any real relevance. This is just a "gad'n" film that is so bad that it's hard to sit still and watch it. The acting is atrocious and flatly awful. There are two of the best actors in the whole world, and I would be willing to watch them on their own in the next decade of their careers. But if you want a "let's do something nice" family film, watch this one and count the minutes.  This one of the worst movies of all time. And there's more to be afraid of than there is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A plot that could have been from the early 1900's. The plot is very thin and there's no indication that the people involved in the plot do exist in the 1940's. This is a typical horror film of the '50's. I remember the very early days of the film: it didn't take advantage of today's advances in the development of horror movies and there were a few good things about it. Still, it must have been a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no good things about this movie. I'm sure there's a lot more to be said but it's all in a bad way. There is no good story, no interesting character, no fun characters, no good animation, no laughs, not even a hint of humor, not a hint that there might be more to the story than there is, so I gave this a 2. A 1 because this movie is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think i would never forget this movie. I saw it in the theatre and I was appalled. It's a disgrace to my life and everything I thought of that night. Even after all the horrible and depressing scenes, I still think that it was worth watching. I had to turn down the channel and look at the video. There are no funny little funny scenes to laugh about. There is no funny jokes to say, no dramatic moments to go out with. It is just a really ugly movie with bad jokes. I hope that it is not too hard to watch, since I'm still going through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been sucked away from this movie in the past few weeks. I really think it needs to be taken down. I know it's just a film and not a movie but it must have some good acting in it. If it's a film it needs a decent plot. There was some very odd acting in the last one.  I was hoping to see some good dialogue. I just wasn't. I'd have a better movie: at least one. And there are better actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating, with two stars from the movie, was 1.1 out of 10. My rating here is 10 out of ten. The movie is boring and the story seems to be completely lost from the beginning. This is a film that fails to make any of two. If you enjoy a good movie, you would never see this. It is not entertaining and there are few interesting scenes in the film. The acting seems to become too obvious and there is little to see in the beginning and most importantly, there is no real connection between the actors.  All actors are in bad locations to be used in this kind of film and I think it is a very sad film. A low score but, what a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on Friday and I laughed. I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was, but I did. The acting is pathetic. The script is boring and predictable. The movie is boring, and there is no story. The plot, which could have been interesting, is so far from being believable. The director is so bad that it's impossible to understand it all. I would have to have spent more time watching that movie, and I would definitely not waste my time.  But still, it is good to have some fun, and even though there is nothing good about this movie, I still wouldn't recommend it for anyone to rent it. The film has too many plot holes, and the actors are too bad to be believable, and they are supposed to be "acting" but they are simply bad at acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I thought I was watching this movie for my brother to see "Buck" and that was good. But it's the same movie that Jack Jarman was in, and Jack was a big Hollywood guy so I was expecting to enjoy the Jack Jarmans action. But this movie doesn't deliver any entertainment whatsoever. It's a really bad movie and it's all the same terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie started with an over-the-air introduction and then proceeded to a series of really bad movies. The introduction is the first indication that the movie has no real premise, and that's the problem that the film has. The film is pretty predictable, and I think the movie was made to be easy to be used. However, the problem in this movie is that I'm not really interested in what's going on in the film - and I don't have the patience for it. It was made by a single person, so I'm fine if it was made a movie about a single individual, but it needs to be made by more than one person. It really didn't take much longer to get to this. The plot was absolutely pointless, and the ending seems stupid and pointless.  Overall, I'm very dubious of this movie - the story is not particularly interesting, and there was obviously a lot of false information in the plot. Still, I think this is only moderately entertaining, and even so it's still an unfinished work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, at its worst, is not quite as enjoyable as some of the earlier "Mad Max" movies. There's very little story to this movie and it's very disappointing in a manner to the point that it's annoying.  Some of the film's subplot is pretty good but that's not the same level of the movie's predecessors.  It's not worth watching, but what happens in the first scene is annoying and the entire plot becomes pointless, the ending is predictable and the plot becomes irrelevant.  Also, the character of Max is pretty bad. His character, even his mother, has done a few good things and has some potential, but she is just a complete nut!  If you like an action film with a lot of violence, that's the movie for you. If you're looking for a straight one-liner with good, but not good, dialog, this movie isn't for you, but if you need an action movie to watch, that is alright, but don't watch it to the end.  The film also has a lot a bit of a plot in the last few minutes. They set a car in motion in the beginning and then leave it in motion. They get caught in an alley, but the car is a gun, it's not even a good way to start off.  However, when they return to the warehouse, Max has to go somewhere else so he just pulls the car and goes for some kind of escape. Then Max takes off in a direction so he can run away from the cops. When he goes inside the warehouse to the "Big House" building he walks through the building and knocks out a bunch of soldiers and one of them is killed in the parking lot. The gang kills the two guys who want to escape from the warehouse and then go to a store to steal some gold so he's able to escape. He has two good guys who are working for him, and one goes after him and is killed when he tries to hide the gold from them. That leads to the gang getting into an auto shop to steal gold from the shop owner and Max then shoots up into the shop where he then goes to the shop to see how the shop's customers will react to his kidnapping. There is a lot to talk about Max's character but the plot is only a plot of "he's gonna get fat, kill someone" and that's really the point.   Max is one of the "big loser"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is bad. i had the feeling that the director had probably cheated him in the casting process or it was supposed to be a comedy. The movie has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and the end seems to be very unsatisfactory. The plot is pretty bad, the acting is bad, it's very hard to follow. Even if you get a good plot it is really hard to accept the actors as human beings, the movie is so bad that it's not funny, and it really just ruins it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I started watching this film I had no clue what it was about. I had to watch the first episode and I just knew I wasn't going to like it, but I finally decided to rent it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. There are no good movies out here. I think it is a bit of a plot, but the way it is presented makes it hard to understand. It is a huge mess, I couldn't sit through it and didn't enjoy it very much. The acting was not well done and the dialog wasn't even good, though the dialog was really good. You might get bored if you watch this one.  I am sorry, I didn't rent it and I don't know if the next rental would be good. The film has gone under a number of re-writeings and I guess its publisher should have known that this film was bad when it was released. The only good thing about it was the one or two jokes that the actors gave each other, which I found funny. I am sure the director and writer knew what they were doing. This movie is only a waste of money, not even a great film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a film this bad before. I am a film buff, but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The movie is so bad that it makes me question whether I should go back to this movie. I had been looking for "The Secret World" for ages, and even though I did not think I was ever going to finish this film, it still makes me feel like I have wasted so much time. The story is so poor and unfunny that it doesn't make any sense. What makes the movie so bad? The main character is "Jumbo", who is supposed to be an "jumbo-type", but I think that is an overrated type of character. He wears a lot of clothing, but I do not believe he is a super-woman with a lot and no muscle to get her clothes to fit her body. You never really get a sense of him in a movie, and I cannot believe he has a major role in this film.  A second bad movie is "Crown" which I thought I would never write about, but apparently I guess that is the third worse film I ever saw. I have read my book and liked the book, but that movie isn't as funny or funny as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not even positive that they are good, just plain bad. They're boring, the dialog is poor, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the music is bad. The funny little thing at the end of the film is the music video is great. This is a poor movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film in two years, and all I can say is that it sucks. The plot is bad and the acting is pathetic. If you just saw it in 1993, or even the version when it was released, it is truly horrible and a poor movie. In the original version it had great action and fantastic cinematography, and even some good acting.  In the newer version, it's awful. The dialogue and acting are pathetic and unbelievable. In a word, the acting in it is so poor that it could be easily mistaken for a movie. The movie starts with the first scene where the main character asks the main characters if they do or do a good job, or whether or not they do a bad job. It never keeps going! It's also got a terrible cast and a very bad and stupid sequel.   The sequel seems to try to fill the gap in the film, but it's also getting worse. This movie is absolutely bad, and only mildly entertaining. I really think I was trying to do the best, and this movie just isn't even getting the job done. There has to be something else in this movie. It could be something like a sequel. Or perhaps another sequel, since this one has such an old sequel that they decided not to bring back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two main characters - a couple of teenagers - and the entire movie revolves around the guy in the black jacket. Nothing happens. Nothing. Nothing, absolutely nothing.  Then the kid with the weird name turns out to be a drug dealer.  After a few weeks of getting bored, the kid (the kid with weird name) starts smoking with a drug salesman named Tim.  Tim begins to smoke so that he can keep his customers, which starts making him a huge amount of money. As he smokes with a cigarette, people are killed, and people have all sorts of weird drug dealers and drug dealers.  So the plot keeps going and this is probably the worst film I have ever seen, ever. I mean there are some good movies out there, but this is pretty awful. I gave it to my son, because he has to watch it with him, and I don't think he'll ever have to. I'll never forgive him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. The script was good, and the acting was good but it was too predictable. The plot and the ending was just so predictable that I would not have laughed. The casting was bad, the acting were poor, and it seemed to lack any substance, although there were some good moments. The director of this movie was even bad, he seemed to be acting like he wasn't actually the director of the original film! There is no way to tell that he worked for his own amusement, or was acting in any way with the intention of making a comedy, and he did such a bad job as a gag writer! Even if you're a fan of the show, I would highly recommend to stay away from this one, as poor as the first show was, and most certainly the best one I've seen was the second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so thin it actually doesn't matter which character it has or which character they are. If there is a difference, and I mean it is not a story, the character that we have come to know through the book is not the character who will kill the characters of the book. The characters, the characters, their relationships, and all the other elements that make up the book are not what it is. The character's relationships are not the same as with the book, which makes it even more difficult to know who the characters are and who the book actually is.  The book, however, did not make the same sense with the characters that I was familiar with through the TV series, because it was never shown in a real way.  In a series of two episodes, they don't get together, and the movie never goes anywhere. The reason for this is that the characters aren't the same characters as they were in the TV show, and it is up to the viewers to decide. We also get to know which character in the book they are and which one that the book's character actually has.  I really don't know what they are to me, but I've seen a lot of TV shows with both stories and characters that have the same plot and characters, and they have the decency of a good story to make a story that people can get to care about. If they are only going to be interesting and engaging, then we can't expect much. If the plot is just flat, there is nothing to gain. I don't expect they to make it entertaining. I've already seen many movies, and there are no stories so dark, such as the ones that are usually referred to as "epics". There were some movies that could have been adapted, but there were others that were absolutely awful.  There are so many horrible endings that it is hard to watch, and you get the feeling of being bored because the show just keeps repeating yourself and nothing is new. If a good movie is good, it can be funny, but a bad film is not full of the feeling. In a good show, you can sit and laugh, but when you see something bad, it becomes annoying.  This is a horrible, but utterly bad, movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Little Island" is just the same as "Shenzhenong" but this movie is so bad it actually should be shown on video or even something with a really decent video editing. I cannot stand out a minute. It's not even funny. There is no idea what it is going to be, there is no direction or suspense or suspense. I want to say this film has more potential to make it look more like a comedy than like a horror. Even so, it's so bad that I want it to not be scary. It should be one of the most unoriginal horror films I have ever seen, even in Japan where it is supposedly considered a comedy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was very surprised to find that this is the third movie I have ever seen. I was especially surprised because I saw the original one, which is an incredibly boring horror movie. I have nothing good to say about this movie. It is truly embarrassing for anyone who actually cared about the movie.  Well that's a pretty short description. But, I suppose it is more entertaining than a horror movie-- and there is no one better!   I can only say, watch the original movie-- the first horror movie was so good! It was so entertaining! This movie is so bad! The first movie I saw was an amazingly funny movie. In my opinion, it was just as fun as the second movie, but a more disappointing sequel.  So, watch out, my friend, because, after all, you can never find out if it is a good movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really a disappointment. I was looking for some of the other movies I found that looked pretty good on the video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most annoying movie I've seen in a while. It's not just bad writing but horrible acting. Also there's no story or plot. The plot is so weak and I think it's mainly a gimmick and nothing more. I'm trying to see if it was really the bad bad movie or the worst movie. I don't think this is what the movie deserves to be so bad. I'd rather see something better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Big 'Soucee' is one of those films that is so poorly directed and poorly filmed that I cannot understand how it could be so bad. The cinematography, acting, and story-telling are all in bad condition. I have never seen this kind of movie in the USA. If I knew it was a real film then I would be shocked. I must admit that this is a rip-off from the 1990's 'The Return of the Zuck' but not at all. I don't believe it was well written or directed, at all, and probably had a lot of acting talent in this kind. This film could be taken anywhere but in a theatre somewhere. The production of the movie is not as good as the original but not as bad as 'The Big Souce' that we remembered it because it's quite a long film and very slow pace to start. I'm disappointed that there is no way to improve it. If you are looking for a horror film that is pretty good you can probably afford to spend an hour and a half of time on watching this. You might even want to see the original 'Big Souc', but I'm unsure which one you will get. I give it 1/10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has been the worst film I've seen since the year I saw the first version. Its absolutely impossible to make any sort of sense out of this. It fails as a plot, there is no way for it to be realistic, and it's incredibly bad at all. There's no plot; all of the characters are unrealistic, the characters themselves are stupid, the special effects aren't realistic and the direction is just terrible. I really don't care if anyone else thinks the film is good. I'll admit that it was good at times, but even if I was able to save it, it would never be worth any effort. I am sure it could be made better, but it has just ruined my enjoyment of the show to this point.  I think it's more likely to become an obscure and low-budget horror film than a horror series. I'm looking at this for an hour and a half to watch and to hope that it isn't just another horror show from the same person who made it (it certainly is like the first). I hope it doesn't become a classic horror show; the sequel might have some semblance of gore and horror but nothing else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the most disappointing film of the year. The plot is just terrible, the acting is stupid, and the acting and dialog is absolutely horrible. This is an interesting movie though if you like that style, then you might enjoy it. But if you don't, I advise you to just skip it. I mean if you're a zombie movie buff, you might like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few parts of the movie that make it possible to care more that it was about an older woman playing with her husband. Those aren't quite how to be in the film but the acting in the movie is so weak and unsympathetic that I felt sympathy for the poor woman. I don't want to go on to say that the film is bad or that it is a bad film, because it is one that could easily just be made by a kid in the basement of a video store or a school that had to clean it out and paint over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst ever I have seen. I've never been able to sit through an movie with this one. There is no substance to the movie. It's really a train wreck. The story has nothing to do with the characters and the plot is completely nonsensical and the story has no meaning. The acting in this movie is stupid and unsympathetic. The fact that some of the characters have a major emotional bond with the person who is manipulating them is just so stupid. I was hoping that this movie would give me some insight into the sad lives of people who have suffered from violent and dysfunctional relationships. The movie should really be an entertaining thriller at the end of the day, but sadly, I wasn't having any fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is only one positive review about this movie. I have mixed feelings. There are some good moments and some bad moments, but if you go looking for some comedy, don't miss it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this on TV when it came out, and my expectations of the film were somewhat spoiled. The film was pretty predictable, but there were a couple of things that were way out there. The main thing was the first person you saw was dead; the main character in the film was dead. The plot wasn't well developed, and most of the dialog was completely uninteresting, too. I expected an interesting film, but unfortunately it was not the same film as "Die Hard" or the new "DieHard" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for some interesting films on Netflix, and stumbled into this movie. It's an interesting movie, I'm not sure how it works, but I suppose it does have a few elements to it. But it's about as awful as some of the other film's. What is that supposed to be an indication of anything? A movie that wants to make an impression of people who can't stand up with one another (or that can stand up for themselves), but has no real concept of what it means, and no real direction or direction. I was wondering if it would be an issue of our culture. No, it's just some bad sex that everyone plays around. It just happens to be that way, so if you liked that movie, don't miss it, but the only thing that matters in this movie is the sex. It would just be a film about sex that's not as interesting as a movie about sex; or an "A+" movie about the idea that people might be able to tolerate one another sex act. It doesn't seem to be a movie that would go out to other audiences. It feels like a film with a message to one's self, and there is no clue how it could possibly be useful. I've read several comments online that I didn't care, and I'm a sucker for movies that have a message. I read something like this movie was going to be the end of everything, and it hasn't been any fun to watch. I don't think it would make much money, but it just seems to be making fun to the person who sees it. If you just want a movie without a clear message or idea to its audiences, that might be okay. But if you just don't like it, a movie is not worth much.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it somewhat amusing that this film has been developed over the past 15 years to have been completely forgotten. I don't think it's even a comedy at all, and I think most of it is a piece of crap anyway, it's really boring and poorly acted. It's not that a big difference in tone between the two films is what the director could have done. I think the director is a little incompetent, but he isn't that bad. The acting is so bad I thought the film was actually funny and I'm not sure he can do well, but it seems like he is more of a drama than a comedy. The director can be quite funny or even funny.  My biggest gripe about this is that this movie is the sort of parody of all sorts of shows. This has nothing to do with a real movie, but when it has to make a funny film, he needs a lot of laughs in order to make it. But in the end, he could have just made something with some funny jokes.  There's a lot, like some of the films at "Rock & Roll" or "Carnet", that are actually excellent, but this movie couldn't manage to make any funny jokes, and could probably be much better at writing jokes about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish they made a little version of this show about a guy who turns into a super mutant to save himself from an alien battle, who is actually a mutant, but I'm really sick of this version of the movie. In the first few minutes of the show, there is little tension between the characters. There are two guys who are aliens with weapons, and one of them turns into an alien monster who wants to be a supers mutant, and the other turns into another giant gorilla with a little head attached. It's a really bad version of a show. The only good thing about it is that there are a few nice clips from the actual events in the series. And then there are no real dialogue between the guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie looks like it's going to be a great, but unfortunately it doesn't. This movie is filled with boring scenes of a bunch of men doing everything with their own lives. There were better scenes of the same movie: a bunch a men in their 20s going for sex with each other. There are some scenes that are funny, but that's about it. There's too many scenes of men falling in love to each other, too many shots of the women falling in their shoes. There is no real plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a funny moment at the end of the first act, so I kept watching, and decided to see it again. The first scene was interesting, so that was that, but it was the only one of the five movies I watched.  It just kept going. The next scene was pretty weird and a little disappointing, although I liked the next scene, I was expecting that the other one would follow it. After all, what is the matter with the first scene being just an ordinary sequence? In the next one, the same thing, and now, I found the movie not to have anything interesting to say. That's the point of the movie, but the ending is not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this movie on the TV and it sucked me out. I'm a big fan of "Grimly and Glory", and that's what I thought this film was about. It was supposed to be a great horror flick. Unfortunately, I thought it was a great "horror" flick. And even when I saw this film, I didn't like it. I didn\'t like the acting, the direction, and the story. But that's the point of this movie. They were trying to go for a "horrible film", and they went to some crazy places. I have the most to say about this movie, it's horrible. I wish everyone would get it before they saw it. It's not even worth renting it, and if you buy it, don't even watch it. The worst thing about this is that the guy is an actor. I don't know if he's an actor, but he definitely wasn't the kind of a "big star". He was a bad actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Woman in Paris" was very bad, it just seemed like a bunch of old-fashioned B movies. The director did a lot of things but it was obvious that he wanted to make this film seem interesting in some way (like a historical drama about the people in the French royal court) but that is not his responsibility. And the music seems to have been done by an old music teacher who didn't really care who the singer was, which would've been the case but I assume the music teacher was the best director of this film. So the acting was poor, some really stupid jokes were delivered by the two male leads, not enough to keep me interested but enough to make me uncomfortable. And I don't know why but I find this film much more annoying than "Songs from the Queen".  "The Legend of the Black Mask" was much better than "A WOMAN IN Paris". The plot is stupid and the music is OK, but what does this movie do in relation to these two movies?  I am looking forward to getting some action from "Black Mask", but if you see this film, don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was supposed to be a horror/comedy-themed thriller. I thought the film was good, but it is just sad and depressing and the acting is weak. The ending is very unsatisfying and I think the story wasn't that interesting to me. This is an example of a movie that goes straight to clichés. I think most people in this movie didn't understand how it was going. I mean, it could be funny and interesting, but this is just depressing and annoying. The film is so poor that I had to sit it up one night and catch the next one. I saw the film in a local movie theatre when I was in Montreal. The most depressing film ever was an "Rampage through the Valley" movie starring Jean-Claude Dauzac. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just terrible and really disappointing. I do not want to watch it and its just one of those movies that you try to avoid. This film has absolutely nothing to do with the actual documentary. That's sad. What the hell was it like when I watched this film? Let's start off with the beginning.  A family of nine members goes in to a remote location. The first person of them is very depressed because of the lack of money they had. This is the very start of the film. In the beginning we are introduced to the family member's father (who has a terrible temper).  This family member is very happy but in the next scene he tells the other family members something about how a couple of them got killed in the accident. It has nothing to with the real documentary, which I did not know was this is a story at all.  There are also several people involved in the film and in the movie. One of them was a guy who worked in the local fire brigade.  They were in the process of having sex with a little girl. We have to see some kind of story from the girl. At the end of the scene it is shown that she had sex with them so it has nothing do with them.  The next scene is the wife's daughter. We then see the woman's husband, with no mention of the mother's reaction to the fact that she was having sex. We also see the mother and the child's friend doing something very embarrassing.  That's the last scene in the documentary. The story then goes on and the father and wife make an hour's worth of money, with a couple who is named Kibela and Daclar. One man, a former firefighter, is at the house and we meet him.  It is soon after the father's wife is killed that they go to see a man named Kribla.  At this point the documentary is shown. The man on the television is seen having sex and using his money to buy the two women involved in a "voodoo drug" which involves a bunch of people who are sick. He then has sex with the woman who apparently has a bad temper.  Another woman who was in the drug situation on the other side is shown having sex again, so we see the couple, the wife and the kid. The film then shows a scene when the child is taken to the hospital by the police. The child is dead and the woman is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst video ever made, the worst ever made. It's really annoying! It's only a movie: an hour and a half of horror-fantasy porn for an entertainment outlet. It doesn't have a plot, it doesn't even have any special effects or special themes or even special effects. It isn't scary like the original, but it isn't even a thriller, it's a comedy! It doesn "do well" like the old films.  In the meantime, I'd recommend "The Man" to anyone looking for a thrill movie: a film with no suspense, no good-looking atmosphere, no suspense! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first was surprised. I've never heard of this movie, but apparently it's so funny! Who do I think it was? Oh, I mean, I thought it was "Hooey Yooey" since I had seen it before. And yeah, it's bad for me, I think I should definitely have watched it. I just got into a sort of loop in the beginning. So I watched it once and then tried to finish it. But I had to skip the beginning to go back to the beginning of the film. Then it seemed all right to me because I was bored and it wasn't going anywhere. I didn't want to continue watching it and then I would just start reading about it.  And finally, after reading a lot of comments, I finally decided to read the film... and I think my mistake was that it wasnno longer funny than before. The jokes were not funny at all. In fact, the main jokes were so bad. They were so, so, stupid, so stupid. I know it's not a comedy, but the way I fell asleep while watching it made me laugh. There were a lot worse jokes. The characters were so stupid! It was bad! I guess I should have avoided it. Also, I didn'n really like the "Honey" family. I really like that there are so many characters in the film--there were plenty of characters, but most of them were so silly. They just couldn't be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the movie was based on a children's show. The kids were acting with all manners. They were acting exactly as children would act in order to get laughs. Even after the movie, my mother couldn't figure out what was going on. That's not to say that I didn't get a laugh, nor did I like the actors. But it was just too plain and unconvincing to be serious. I don't care if you liked it, just don't watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this movie? I've never seen a movie that is so disappointing. The film is not good. The characters are awful, the camera is bad, the editing is bad. The only one good thing is the story. But I have to admit that this movie was good. I was very depressed watching this movie. The story is just a bunch of guys having sex and lying around. The plot is not strong enough to be interesting. That's all I can say.  I hope this movie is for the younger teens. This is not a good movie for any young teens. You should look elsewhere if you want something that is not for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was an utter waste of the viewer's time, energy and money. The main purpose of the film was to give it a real feel to me. It is only a film that fails to keep pace. It has a lot of long silent passages which are boring, boring, and pointless, and the dialog is very weak. The plot itself is not strong. The ending is so weak it's not even scary. Even the ending could have a little more strength than the ending. The scene in the beginning of the movie was very slow and boring, but it was okay at least entertaining, if you had time to sit and just watch. It really wasn't that good. And I thought it was a lot shorter than the original version of this movie. But not so much, since the director was working on it. The only thing is that I didn't know if the film would make any sense or even were entertaining at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It looks like the first film of his career. I mean, what the hell's wrong? Well, I guess it was like this film for a first time, which was a decent little film to take in and be proud of. Not a movie. A movie that is made by some of the worst acting talent of his life. He was very bad at making a movie that was really not to his abilities.  This movie really needs to be taken away for the next 100 years or so and never again. The movie is so stupid that I just can't tell if he has played his career like this. A few of the jokes and the dialog in the movie is not very funny and even when the characters are saying some funny things, I just wonder if he would stop making them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of time, so don't waste your time here, because it's no good for any movie ever, but it was pretty amusing to see this film in the first 15 minutes. I don't even have the faintest clue about what this movie is about. What's the point of it? The point is that there are no more money to make it, but you have to buy a license for it. There's not a clear theme or message, nothing resembling a plot.   The main thing about this movie was that it's not funny for the first 5 minutes, and then you start laughing and laughing because the first 8 minutes are pretty funny. And then it becomes boring for a few minutes, but then the movie goes on and on and is full of cliché jokes that you just can't find anything funny.  But what makes it so stupid and pointless are the other actors. I've never seen this movie and I found the main actors in it, so I'm not sure why they're here and why they don't seem to have any talent for the roles. They're the ones who make the movie, not the ones the movie itself. It was not a good movie for the person who buys a copy of it for their own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I got the chance to go to the screening in Toronto on the 14th of April. This was obviously the most disappointing movie of all time. The film was not very interesting at all, and I didn't particularly enjoy it. A very disappointing, disappointing movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ever need some "good" movies: make your way. Don't waste your time. Avoid watching this movie. Avoid getting into a car with someone who's not a star, even if you have good money. Avoid the "Hoods" movie: a cult movie by a small film director. If you want a film with great actors, you'll find the "The Longest Night". Do not watch this movie unless you are willing to accept it as a cult. If the producers want to sell it, then they'll get a great price for it, and you will be willing to buy the film. If it is not your preference, please do not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The concept of the movie was extremely bad, at least the way the story was structured. The way the plot is structured didn't make sense. The acting was bad, the acting was decent, and the plot was disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited when i saw this movie. Then I was annoyed when i got it. I guess I'm too late for my friends who have seen it.  What is this movie called? It's a parody of a series of the Simpsons. In one episode it is called "The Incredible Mummy", for example "Munching Mummy". But in the rest of the series "Mummy" is just a "normal" movie. If you actually like to see people eating worms, don't buy this movie!! It's just sad and depressing.  If you have to look for it, don not go buy it, but only if someone needs it, please watch it with a positive review about bad movies:  I just wanted to be a little less annoying than "The Simpsons" to have another bad movie. So, I bought it, and it wasn't very interesting, in the end. I liked some of the jokes, but that's about it. The ending is kinda funny and the people are stupid, too.  I hope the people who made this movie don't end up making it and getting sued. That's my opinion, not a lawyer's opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand that this film has been a good movie to start off. The cast and the cast are good. I have been wrong so many times, I thought that this was one of those "funny" horror films. I didn't know that it was supposed to be humorous. It wasn't and it was funny in a totally awful way, it was like a cartoon with a movie actor going through the usual sitcom routines, which is usually done in every Disney film. I think it is a complete waste of time and money, they tried to create a different sort of horror film. Don't waste your time and buy it or rent it, it is truly awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some very bizarre, and very unpleasant, interviews from some of the stars, the director, and the producers of the movie. Of course, we aren't too familiar with them, but some of their interviews were particularly bad. In fact, they probably shouldn have simply left the interview completely in place, but there are too many interviews which don't fit the film, and it would be easier to sit there than to go in front of the microphone. This movie is an attempt to make something resembling an actual film that isn't actually a film. The acting has been terrible, and some of them are truly awful, but I had absolutely nothing interest in being involved in this movie. It seems to be a sequel of some sort to "Black Hole", which makes me very anxious to see something similar to that. I'm not even sure about my interest in this, since it is such a terrible excuse for a horror movie. I've read some other reviews of it, so will be watching the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen "The People Who Speak," which I hated (it was not an easy film to watch, even in "Cain's Dream" and I have never watched it again), but what I saw on "Curse of the Black Zone" had me feeling like it was just plain bad, with bad acting, bad scenery, and bad acting. I would have left it for another review if I hadn't. I saw the very same in "The Last App".  This movie is bad, terrible, and it's a true shame, because when I finally saw it, it was so bad that I didn't want to even give it any more of attention. I don't know why it's bad, but it's not a bad film! It has a weak sense of being.  There are so many things wrong with it that I can't even count. I've known many people who liked it, but don't believe any of it. I have to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never in a complete detail, if you do have a good time reading the book, it will be worth the read. That is where you need to be. This movie is just terrible. The characters are boring and the dialog is stupid, although the acting is good and decent. The writing of the book is bad and there are too many spelling mistakes to count, even by the original author. I do not know if a copy is bad or not, I don't care. I don´t want to waste my time on it.  I will probably buy the book and watch the movie to get enjoyment. I must admit that it was a good movie, it was the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was just the beginning of the worst year of my life. I hope it's dead, but if it does not I might have a few days to go.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a very long-term movie buff, and I really can't believe this movie is even remotely entertaining. The story is very weak and has a lot of plot to go up with. But, despite this, it is still good for it's really low-budget production and really a bunch of bad jokes. And the acting is really poor at all. I don't even remember most of them, so bad they must be really funny! I donut it's all good for the other movies I've watched. There's nothing to say here other than a few silly things, but that's all you get.  The worst part about this movie really is that they used a lot high-level special effects in the scenes to try to make something interesting. But it wasn't a complete disaster, like all those I've seen.   The rest of the movie really needs a rewrite. It is all a bunch and a bunch (and still sucks) but I'd be surprised if it got done. This is a bad sequel. But maybe I'll watch a sequel that doesn't have such a bad name! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie so bad that I almost laughed. When I saw the last minutes of the film, I laughed at how bad the ending had to be. I could not even follow the ending. I found myself at least 30 minutes into this movie before my friend who is a former film reviewer told me that it was truly awful and I had never seen such a horrible film, much less since this movie was in preview at the time of release. Even a very talented actor (whose name was actually that of the leading man) made a rather feeble effort. The film was bad but not because I liked the film (though I liked it) but because I didn't realize how awful it really was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible to see as it was so long. There was a good scene with James Dean as the old guy trying to convince the guys that a lot of times things are hard to find in the world. But there were some really stupid lines with James the elder man trying to get the younger guys to see the world differently. What is so stupid about this movie is the fact that they really thought this movie was about being a little bit "real" and the fact they think that the older guys knew about what happened in the past was a way to help their lives. But that is not a real life lesson and it doesn't give them anything more when it comes to the point of deciding whether they need to make a certain choice or not.  This film is probably one of those "soulful" movies that really don't work when you really have to make choices and have to deal with consequences. The movie was a complete disaster that I didn't want to see in my lifetime. It has nothing to do with you in life and I think it is too slow and too long. I had a few days to watch it and I thought it was interesting, but I was really tired by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a complete waste of time and money. The story is so convoluted that it's impossible to follow through. I really liked the ending for some of the scenes. But there were many unnecessary plot points. There was no indication of a connection between the two halves that would have made the film interesting. The script is so weak that it could barely make anything effective. I feel like the producers should have put out a better movie. The music is absolutely awful and not good. The acting was pretty decent, but there were a lot of annoying lines and bad dialog. The cast is not good or well trained. The cinematography is bad as a lot. The soundtrack was not good at all.  In a negative movie: The film had some good qualities and some bad ones, but it could not make much more. It's an example of a bad sequel that is so stupid, it actually gets people to hate it. The whole movie is awful, and a waste of money. I hope you can't really see this movie when it comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I'll be honest. I really wish I hadn't been watching this film. It's bad. It just a bad. If you know one who was to go home to get some sleep this weekend you probably will find this film hilarious. If your friend is a guy who likes to watch movies, and that you are looking to sleep, watch this movie because it's not funny.  In order to understand what it is to have someone else watching it, you'll need to sit through the whole movie. This movie has a problem because there are so few plot points to the story. There's not really an ending, because I think it's just a continuation of the story we've already seen. This story is really about a bunch of idiots who decide to sleep with a bunch about as much as they can. But if you go to watch this film, don't. If that's your choice I hope your money goes towards a movie called "GooTob" which I like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well this is a big disappointment. After viewing the plot and some moments I didn't really buy much of this movie. As a movie lover I am a sucker but never watched this movie so if you're a fan of a bad Disney it's you have an easy time. I didn' see the story or the plot. A total failure. As an entertainment the movies have some value, but not all of them. This movie is no value. And I have to be honest I don't think it was intended to have any value. This was an effort to cash in on the Disney Channel. It's a pity and waste of money. The movie will probably cause some people to question whether Disney Channel is really a good movie. It was only there's some good ones. But Disney Channel has no redeeming feature, and even with some great features it can't compensate for this. The most horrible Disney Channel show ever made, but there are some good movies. But don't waste your money watching it. It just won't impress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie and, like I said, it was about a few minutes long and looked somewhat odd. I do find myself at fault, but I am not about this movie. I found myself watching it for the first time and I was having the sense of amusement and amusement that comes with seeing it, but soon realized that this is about the worst movie I have ever seen.  I will try to avoid this film because I know it is a terrible movie, but, to me, it is an even worse film than most of the one I saw in high school.   It is like a bad version of "The Matrix" or one of "Silence Monsoon" except that this movie was so bad that it had me interested and intrigued that I kept watching it and, in that sense, I had no intention of watching it again.  What I thought of when I saw it was that I was hoping to watch it again for the amusement and enjoyment of a great film, and I did watch it and enjoyed it, like other people do. I didn't like it, and it made me frustrated.  It's not a good movie. It is not good to have seen, and there are parts that really matter. It was bad to see the film again. If you want to see a good, but ultimately disappointing film, you will have to watch "Silent Monsoon".  I'm sorry, but this is the worst film I have seen. The plot was boring, the characters were stupid, the acting was awful, and the cinematography was not good. It should be a fun film for a great movie: not so bad, but still not spectacular. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got angry when I finally got to see this. I was hoping it was funny, but it didn't help me in the slightest. I'm a realist. A realist! I just can't believe they made this movie. Even with the fact that I hadn't even watched it, this movie was bad. I gave it one stars over a thousand. There were no decent jokes. This movie was only bad because it had no good laughs.   Also, I think there's an effort to make the film believable by making it a thriller. This is not a thriller, but the plot is too boring. The acting wasn't even good. The dialog is terrible. I am very serious about this movie and I've never watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is good and there are a couple of good things about it. A really interesting thing however is the end of the movie when it is time to shoot the next day. Instead of using a big pool, they built a giant machine with a huge tank that had to be emptied before being used to shoot. The story is that the main character was a hero, and he was killed in an accident involving his daughter.  I really liked the characters that made the movie, but at the end it really seemed pointless. At first I thought this movie was a little better than the other movies, but I think it got way too convoluted and the plot kept slipping back onto the hero and the heroine. The acting is pretty good, and they all do a little bit of acting. The scene with the heroine is the worst. Her character is dead in the last act and the girl kills him and gets the girl.  This is really a bad film, and it's way too long and don't take care of the ending. The cast was so poor that I couldn't get too much of the story.  If you are looking for a bad one of a bad Disney movie, then I recommend the "Algora". It is pretty a good movie if you like the original "Alive With Your Boy" though not so much. However, it was really bad for me and I don't think anyone will really enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a really bad film, and I'm so disappointed. Even so bad I was still interested in it, I thought it would be something fun. I couldn't even get through the first hour and then I began to believe it would have the charm it was always described. I'm not a fan of Hollywood, but I have to admit that if I saw this film, it would only disappoint. The script was terrible, the acting was bad, and the special effects were pathetic. It was really hard to watch. The characters were stupid, the special FX was bad.  I really didn't care if I made this film before my time in retirement. I really did enjoy the movie, but not so long. I can't tell you if it would work in some sort of way, but this movie wasn't even close. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie, in a movie shop, for sale on Friday at a very low price. I did not care for any of the actors in the movie and I did give them a good chance to go off and make some films. But it was pretty awful. The characters were totally unsympathetic and the movie was really just a bunch of rubbish. The direction was terrible and the editing was unbelievable and there wasn't even a decent scene at the beginning of the movie. It was absolutely pointless and I am a bit spoiled.  The movie has a few funny lines but that's about it. I can tell it has nothing to show itself. It's just bad. The plot and acting was bad, so bad it doesn't really matter how good it was. The ending is pretty silly and no real ending. The DVD has a lot of pictures of other movies. Some of them were very good. This movie was not only bad but bad even though it is interesting. The idea of a time-travel film is stupid, but I am definitely an avid movie fan and I do enjoy this movie. This is just an absolute crap movie. I don't recommend it at all, but the cast is OK and the director/script is OK. It doesn't help to have more movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of time, but there are a few moments that are worth. But that's not the only problem with this movie. The acting is bad, the scenery is bad and there are some things that could have been funny. The story is OK for a few minutes, but it's just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film had some promising moments, particularly in a few minutes with the young girls dancing and talking, but those scenes just never played out. I was a bit skeptical at first, but after some comments I changed my mind.  It really was a disappointing film. I don't know what else to say.  The only thing I can find out is the fact that the director tried to make it as a comedy with a very silly plot, which is unfortunate given how well this was supposed to be a comedy. However, I was shocked at the director for having so little respect for the acting and music. This is just a shame given that the film had already been filmed so well. There are so many things I didn't like to see in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first one, as soon as I read it I knew it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was predictable, though the acting was so bad and I felt like I could get bored and laughed.  Also I liked The Last Vacation as well, but this film was about 5 minutes longer. So if you like comedies or action action movies then go with The Last Movie. Also if you think you're going to watch it, don't. It has a plot so bad that you just won't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like the movie, what was the reason I was given was not a doubt, as it was absolutely terrible. I just wish this was a bad film to avoid any fans of the film. I do not like horror movies. I prefer a good film to watch, but this movie just a poor attempt, and I would recommend it as a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, if I'm reading this review, I think you've probably watched one of the old TV shows from the 70's. There is a little too much humour for a 60 year old show. Also, the ending was silly. Not enough for the 60's. The other shows have a better ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was this show? I really don't think this show could even exist as a horror show, it just screams "funny" to me. I didn't really think the movie was good, the acting was terrible and the story is not worth the time, but it didn't make me sad to watch. I thought the acting were pretty good, I didn' want to know. My thoughts are that the show just had a bad script and the performances weren't even funny. I think there was a lack of humor in the story and a bad direction/direction throughout the movie. My favorite part was that the actor was so annoying, they didn't even move on the set at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't see why this movie has the low score of 10 and the other 10 stars on the box. The acting is bad, the plot is bad and the acting is also bad. The director did a fine job in directing, but I think the script is bad. Don't buy this movie unless you want to see this one to find out a movie, just for the chance to be an overrated piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a huge disappointment. Although, there were some funny moments. But the acting was so bad that I don't think I'd forgive him. There wasn't any funny moments and the direction was completely horrible. The ending had too low of a comedy to be funny and if the ending was serious it would have been funny. I'm not really sure what they were going for. The only person I would recommend this movie is to see the TV show they made with the guys who created this movie and to find another comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot to be said here about this movie. I have to start in my opinion on the characters. And this movie is the most poorly conceived, but the acting and the script and the storyline are really poor. I understand that it's a very stupid movie, but considering this movie, its a very sad movie with stupidly low stakes and really not funny. The point of the movie is for the kids to laugh at the character's stupid antics, and the fact that it was for a children's movie doesn't matter because the end result is that these kids would have nothing to do, and they wouldn't like to hurt themselves. The best movie in this movie was when they made a movie about children and they just laughed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad, dull and stupid film which fails to achieve any sort of success. The movie starts with the first story, "The Tale of Gila" (the story is very vague and poorly explained, and there is no suspense whatsoever. The story ends with the narrator's wife (Gila) telling us how she's really married to the son of one of the guests (an ex-husband), and his wife goes to be the guest of the inn to get some money. This leads to the guy getting killed by a hitman and another murder victim gets into a bad situation with some women who is actually a prostitute.  The worst aspect of this movie is that the "wife" of the "hitman" is actually in love with the murderer. That's not good enough to be a "good movie", even by comparison. I'd give this movie an 8 out of 10, and nothing else about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Little People Who Say: An Extra Space Alien" was a big bore fest of self-indentrances. It's a major disaster on every level, and its pretty obvious the movie wasn't as good as it was at the time, as it gets worse. The movie features many of the same old clichés that were used in films in the 80's. The characters are stupid, the female characters are totally stupid, and the characters aren't even like you'd expect. There are just so many of them. I am not sure if it's meant to be used to be an interesting movie for kids, but I suspect it would be a bad choice for a kids. I know I didn't really like it but I liked the original "Space Invaders". If you like this, don't waste your time watching it, and don't go to watch it for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only other good thing about this movie was the story of a girl that dies at the end of the movie, so that got me interested in a remake. However, I didn't like the story. The other part was a man who is having an affair with a prostitute and then decides to get her pregnant. The scene goes so far from any realistic relationship that I can relate to the movie! The story is so bad that it isn't even funny. The main characters aren't even the ones that were alive in the movie. In the meantime, I can give you this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie quite unsinteresting. I mean, it's the same old script, but a bunch of new additions that are so pointless they should be at least a little fun. There's so many wrong jokes that I cannot laugh at them, but I didn't expect any of them to be funny. I think the producers should put the new script in the movie and then start asking the other actors why they laughed at the old script. If they want a funny film that involves a comedy element, they should try and take their chances to make funny stories like these one day, and when they do it, they might find it amusing.  The story is very shallow, and even the end is not funny. What is the point? It's about a person who gets stuck in a movie that takes place in one hour and then proceeds to a scene where they are in a room with an old actor with a bunch more new jokes that would be better suited to a movie in the future.   You may be bored, but you won't find anything to laugh at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this film for what I was able to find in the movie, so I figured that the best I could do was to watch it, and then do something else. So, I do. And there is a horrible sequel.  The best version was to have laughed at the first version of this film.  This sequel is so horrible that it makes me want to throw the whole thing away. I really think that if you have seen the original, or at least heard me, you would know what a ripoff is. But, it was also very funny to hear such a horrendous script that never, ever, makes you laugh. I tried, so to speak, to see the original version of "Daredevil", and I was so embarrassed that it made me laugh.  I'm trying to finish this movie, but it looks like it's already finished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is bad, but i am not surprised. it wasn't even funny, and i think it was very sad. it's not a movie to watch, it's a sad movie. it had some cute moments, and the acting wasn't that strong, but it just lacked substance. it was really the worst movie I have ever seen. if you like it, please stay away from this movie. i don't recommend it, it didn't have the same effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really like the way I first saw this movie. I don't think I ever saw it again, but I was about to see it again and I didn't know why was I just about to watch it. I was just trying to figure out how it started, and then there was no explanation how it actually happened. And then there were no clues that the movie has been in some form or another for many years. So I was wondering if I could understand how this movie is so bad. Well, I did. I just didn't find anything out what exactly was it. It is really disturbing what this movie has done to the many people who saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the show. But this movie seems to get all the wrong things. There is no story line, no plot. There are some elements of the story that could have been interesting but simply nothing. A few points were at least interesting. But they were at the same time so badly cast. The characters were so flat, they were not believable. I found myself bored and the movie could not go on for an hour. It seems like it was created for a TV show, not for a movie studio. That makes it look like the other Hollywood movies that got away. A good movie only for a mediocre television show; a horrible one with nothing at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has the blood of a child. A child who died from her parents. It's the worst movie ever I've ever seen. What can be said, is that it is not suitable for a family audience, and that it's full of childish behavior and disgusting behavior. It is the worst of all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to agree with many other people who saw this in the theatio, but after seeing the video on TV it was really disappointing. I really feel like this movie was just a waste of money. The characters were OK, the story line was OK, but the acting was so bad that I was sad to see it. I had never seen any movie that had to be that poor. I just knew how bad it would get to me. Maybe this movie isn't so bad, but there are so many other films that would make me watch them that would. You're never left with too much choice, even in the video, because you have no choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the very worst movie I've ever seen.  I think it was made as it appeared on my DVD DVD set a few years ago and I hadn't the time to watch it in theaters so I just wasted my time here. The acting is bad. I didn't like most of the actors in this film. They were a bit bored and had nothing to do. I don't think they could act and the direction was bad though. It just had the feeling of a really bad movie. It was just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has to be a complete failure of a film. The story is absolutely stupid, the acting is not that good, and the music is so terrible that it is downright irritating. What happened while I was watching this movie was my biggest case of nerves in life. I couldn't even read the subtitles properly and even the credits are in a mess when it comes to the end. I can't even see my name in the credits anymore, but I have to see it anyway, so it saved me from getting the same feeling. The only redeeming thing was the little bit of laughter at the end of the movie.  I was extremely disappointed to see this movie as a bad 'crossover' from 'Shane' because it seemed to be an excellent 'comparison' from the 'Shannon' movie. Unfortunately it had its own ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not very well done. The movie had a lot of problems that made it somewhat unsatisfying.  The story was very pretentious and not in any way interesting to the viewer.  There were some really bad jokes that had nothing to do with the story. There was an abrupt ending. In one scene when there is an interesting story, the viewer is left a bad taste in the mouth.  But all of the problems of the movie were very minimal.  It was a bad film for a second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an insult to all who have a history of the American Revolution, the Second Amendment and the Constitution. What is the point? How do the rest of the people get this movie?  There is an outrageous story that seems to be the central point of the story.  One of the movie's main themes is the fact that there is still a major problem in this country's current politics.  What is wrong with this movie is simply, if you are a political person who doesn't buy into the American system, your life will not be better or worse. You should read the book.  If you are an American citizen, you must read this movie, and if you do, you will be so miserable that you will never understand why America can have democracy for these parts of the country, not just for one movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Invented in a fantasy film for the first time. It was a poor parody of a movie that had never seen this show before. There were no good laughs. The acting was bad, there were not great acting, and the story was nothing to special or interesting. I did watch the movie several times. But this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although, I find it funny to say this movie is about the end of the series. It seems to be a sequel, and the only way you can tell it is that the previous movies were about the first. In fact, I think it's probably been two of the previous films that got re-titled, so this one was about the previous film. There are no good things here. The movie starts with some fairly good acting and some pretty stupid scenes, and then it takes an interesting direction, completely off of its track, and starts having nothing to do with itself. I found the only good thing about the movie is that it contains some good moments of suspense. But even that is spoiled for me, by the lack of suspense, as it becomes an absurd action movie. The film fails to contain any originality, and it really does not even have a plot. Its ending is very confusing and convoluted, and I think a director might have even put an undercurrent in the story. That is something that makes a bad film a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was watching this movie and it was very slow. I felt like I was having fun, but then I was just watching the ending. I kept thinking that it didn't make sense and it just wasn't like any of the other movies I've seen. This is what happens when you sit in a bad film:  I have to watch this for the first time, if only. I am not a big film buff, but I understand what the movie is about. It just seems to be a really bad movie to me.  The story is about a guy who has an idea for a job and he falls in love with an older girl named Katara. However the girl doesn't necessarily love her, the movie never takes that out of context. There is no story to tell. This story is only a little bit of fun, just not for a film club, I guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just a bad film: it's poorly written, badly directed, and the acting is frankly awful! The plot and the cast is good, but the acting just doesn't work.  I give this movie a 2 out 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is OK, the storyline is terrible. The acting isn't much, but that's not enough. The sound and music are OK, but not good. It's OK to have a few great characters in a film, but they are poorly designed and the dialog is horrible and there is no point in repeating the same lines for the next 90 days. But the movie isn't terrible, it's just very, very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot has been done so badly that I can't say that they didn't make it look good. But that's not good. It isn't funny, and not much. It's a long, pretentious affair that never makes sense and doesn't follow a logical storyline. The actors' looks are poor, and the characters are very boring, but there are some interesting scenes involving all of the characters. I don't know why I rated this film as 4. I can watch it on its own and tell you if I liked it. Unfortunately, it's so bad that I couldn't even give it 3. I give the rating one 2/10.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sick of this film and I will never see it. I am a huge fan of the show and it is one of those that should never be shown. I hope the cast can learn something from this. I cannot see them in real life. I just want them to stop. I did not like them and I didn't like this film. I would not even like to see these actors in movies. They're just too stupid. I know there are a lot of people who would love them. If they continue to do this they just will have to burn the only good movie in this genre. They are very bad actors. Don't let them become celebrities. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Losing My Sisters" is the same old and tired horror series that "The Blair Witch" just ran in a time, so it looks like the "Velvet" version. The plot is pretty dumb, and even the final part in the film is very disappointing. It's a sad fact that a former pilot of this series should be remembered as the original creator of this film.   But the fact that this film has a plot of his own is actually a good sign.  This is not an example of a good writer, but instead a pathetic one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I saw this as a complete waste of time. I've seen some great movies and have been obsessed with others but they are not movies. In this movie, it's a case of a little boy with a plot that had me wondering, but nothing else. The film wasn't that bad but it seemed to drag out time because there were a lot of unnecessary scenes. There wasn't a good scene at the end either but I couldn't understand why it was the last scene. The direction was pretty good and not really great but it didn't make me a believer. The only time I have seen this movie was on a commercial and I'm sure it wasn't for lack of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad in both the writing and the acting, but if you want a plot to go to. It is about a woman's life in a white room, a couple is murdered, and the movie is about to get more ridiculous than the previous one. The director is obviously bored with what he does, and what the actress shows is that she wants to get into a white bedroom, and that she is completely obsessed with sleeping. They start hanging out, but they keep staying put there. The plot is pretty pointless, the story is predictable, but the ending leaves the viewer wondering how to go forward from there. I'm sorry for any enjoyment this has taken. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd recommend a good movie: I'd have liked to see a remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film about the first war of the "war of the last generation" (the Bush White House) has no redeeming quality whatsoever, it is nothing more than an extremely boring piece of entertainment.  The Bush White White House seems to want to be the "main element of a family drama movie" but unfortunately has become nothing of that. It would be better if they would make a documentary about the "real" war in the Bush White Home World (the "real Bush family drama" was released in 2003). They've gotten a few of their acts in this but it's time for us to get a decent film with real actors.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie while going through the film store on video, but even after seeing the name on the poster, I was still annoyed and didn't know what the movie was. It's pretty hard to see out a movie that looks so stupid. The main villain is just a guy with a grudge to get revenge. There's no good way to go for a revenge without making it fun. I don't even think there's an ending. I thought that would be the movie where it would end. This movie should have ended with a really good ending. But not that ending. They just wanted to make us all sad. I guess they didn't like their own ending. This is the kind of movie that you watch while reading books. A bad movie for a bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if there were any other films I thought could give me an honest review about, but I guess that this is one. There's not enough to be a story, a plot, or a movie, or even a character. It's just a big waste of time. I've never had an interest in watching movies that I wanted to watch more than one. I'm glad I could see it. If it had just a few minutes of a good film, I would have found something to watch. It was a piece of bad writing. The characters were the worst they could have ever been made, and they were all completely ridiculous. The story, the premise, and the dialogue were just plain bad. The film itself was OK, but it should have been about a really good film. I'd suggest taking away the ending. Maybe, and it's not a huge deal, because it would be easier to see if it were a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's been a lot of talk about the'real' ending.  There was the ending. There were two scenes in the movie. They were two. The'real'' ending was the 'fake' ending that the movie was supposed to end on. There was no mention of any of these characters. It is the same'real* ending. Only the 'Real* ending' was different.  The movie starts with a'realistic' movie in a real location (some called a mansion with some sort of 'voodoo' thing going on). There are, however, two scenes that relate to the "real* endings' and that are actually from the fake ending. The fake ending is not even a true one but the one in which the two characters were killed.  Those two scenes don't actually happen. So the movie becomes very hard to finish because you need to know which is the fake real ending and which is just a fictional ending. At the end of the movie there are scenes that are just a'made-up movie,' as opposed to the one that actually made the movie possible. I can't find out how the fake'real ending' is different from the 'actual ending'.  The problem is the 'end' scene in which they kill a couple of characters from the mansion. Those are two scenes from two movies. The scenes take place in a place called the 'Bath' mansion, but they appear in a 'vouchety', or the other name for a 'civic' cemetery, where no one is actually buried. In the 'voulter' house' the family, their daughter, and the daughter's grandmother are 'bemme' (victims), and the killer kills them all to keep the 'civisory' from getting a free 'curious' trip to another 'civility.' It turns out that some of them have been kidnapped and were brought to the graveyard. In'real place' there is no 'vouching' for any of the murdered characters. There are no witnesses and nothing of anyone else. The family would never have cared if one of them had gotten a free trip from the cemetery. The only thing that happened in'real-place' was one man's head getting ripped off.  I don't understand why this was done. Why did the filmmakers want to make this'real negative review? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one really just needs to be the bad film. I don't know who to rate this movie as a bad film, it's just a really horrible film. In addition, there are no real stories in the films. It just goes out there like you get bored. What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started at the same time as I did, and after a few hours of the show, it seemed to be one of those "what are you going to do now, is this movie about a bunch of young men? or are we all just as crazy?" That is about the only way I can describe the movie.  The premise was that the protagonist was a teenager who was, as they said, the "new star" of the world. He was like the first superstar in his generation, and he had some of his best days, in the beginning.  His mother and his father didn't know who he was and they tried to make him work off the street. The ending was so boring that it's hard to remember what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this movie after seeing the first of the Screaming Flesh remake and this movie is so bad it should not have been made. If the original is not an indication of the fact that the remake is bad, then it's time for the original to get the GOR of it. I have to say that I was not able to watch this remake before it aired on video. The reason I can't remember seeing it in my own video tape is that I've never seen it anywhere. It is so stupid it's hard to watch, and very un-comboiled to say it is a remake. The script of Screaming Corpse is still a good one, but it should never have been reworked to make this movie even remotely similar to the original.  I don't know why the casting team went out and made this film when they made it because I believe this movie was so bad that they were afraid to make it for the remake, because I think it would be far more funny if I were made. I believe that the reason for their fear is that this movie would not be able to take the seriously of the original Screaming Dead, which I believe is the only horror comedy genre in existence in the 70s. As a side note, the first Screaming Blood remake was about a horror film that I actually liked and that is the sort of comedy that I want to see as a comedy: a couple of teenagers who are locked in the hospital at the beginning of the film. The plot is so poor, that I wanted to see more movies with a happy ending. They made it seem like there was a million questions in the characters' minds.  Even when the sequel is released I don\'t think it was well received, because this remake was so badly acted that I don\"t even think it could have had the same amount of success as the original did. I don \"d hate to call this movie "horror", but I can tell you that it contains the worst, incoherent, over-the-theory, horror movie of all time. It\'s the kind of horror that you can't watch for days and see how it makes you bleed and sweat just from an hour and a half of nothing and just want to know if anyone died.  If you want to laugh at something else, try watching Screaming Death, because the humor in this movie comes very close to the horror genre, as the jokes in Screaming Bloody Hell
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really have to agree with all my comments, I feel that if I can watch it on YouTube I will probably only get bored and give it a negative rating. It's not that interesting, but if you just sit and watch it, I'm afraid that you'll only get the same dull and boring results. The whole movie is basically a story line where the actors and the actors are all in the same situation. That's all there is to it. What I really want to talk about is the character in the movie, how she died in the house they lived in. I was so tired that I wanted to know more about this character. There were many comments online about this movie's acting, I didn't see that it wasn't just a few actors and a few camera crew. There are a lot of people who have commented about the acting and the acting of the characters in this film.  I feel like I'm in an end-of-the-year video game, the video game is about a very bad movie to watch, it really doesn't make up to the film. It doesn't even make up for its acting, it's just a movie about a horrible movie that didn't even have any ending. This movie is just not to be a film. The story is very weak, and I know that all the actors have done good, but not this movie. If you have nothing to do, watch it. Otherwise, it would probably be a 4th tier movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, the movie starts off as a little soap opera.  If you've watched the movies "Good News" and "Sharon, Baby" and others, you will know how to expect this movie to go. The "good" ending is very disappointing - and I was annoyed by this. The movie was very unrealistic and there was no sense of tension. The first two scenes were simply bad, but at the same time, the cast was very annoying - they were bad actor after all. The other problem was the story. When the story is supposed to have a good ending, it doesn't!  But the movie continued to get worse - it got really bad - and there is no real tension, no real suspense. I was very frustrated with how stupid the movie was - it was so obviously a joke. It wasn't too funny, since the movie had plenty of funny moments and moments that weren't so stupid. It was too slow and annoying to watch, but it didn't make any sense at the end.  There are few laughs. I didn't even find out until the end, but there were some funny moments.  But I think the movie might have been good if the story had been a real drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read about some of this on IMDb. The basic idea of this is an action film about a bunch of teenage girls. There's no plot, no idea of where they are going. Also, the characters are so poorly acted that you just can't figure out anything.  I'd rate this movie as an indie flick. There are scenes in the beginning of the movie that don't fit the theme of the film and the ending. There is no decent ending for the film.  Also, I cannot figure out where this film is actually taking place. In fact, I had to look out for a'story' on IMD in the first place. There wasn't much to it. The'main' theme of this film seems to be the fact that the teens are all going on the same quest to get a job in an industry that's been run by a bad film director. And there's no real idea about the "bad film director" (as we call it, but I'm going to call it what it is).  There is a few cute parts of this movie, but most of them do not fit the story. What a pity. The characters in this film aren't very convincing, and their interactions are totally ridiculous, but the acting isn't even the right kind to be used in this movie. They are so uninteresting that you don't actually get the feel of this story.  This movie has a few 'nice' lines, but those aren't good for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that it is only one minute of the entire film. Also, the film was so low budget that I had trouble reading it. There is little suspense, which is why this film was released. There were several funny lines. I found the main storyline was pretty silly and there wasn't much plot at all. The film was filled with jokes. I tried to watch some of the scenes for amusement but to say it is bad is an understatement. There are some moments with some really good acting but there's also no sense in acting to the character and the people are acting so far away from the film. I don't know why but people who don't mind the characters acting in a good manner think these films are so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the most stupid movie ever I've seen, EVER. I'd like to point out how the "new kid" has to be the best actor.  It's obviously obvious there is no good movie to show this day. There is no scene that involves anyone involved in the movie, or any good drama. It is simply a really, completely stupid movie. It should only be a low budget film: NOT THE MOVIES. The whole thing is so stupid, I can't figure out what it is about. Just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really had an urge to write about this, but I don't because I don´t have any feelings on this. I don`t have the right to tell you. I had a very good sense of this film. It was bad as hell. The most disturbing aspect of it was that the director could even show the girl on the screen, since it had to be quite low budget. I really didn´t like this. The scene with two guys was also extremely disturbing, so bad, but at the same time was just cute. It doesn´t help that, the writer has managed to get away from the world of TV to get this script. The idea of a little girl who has no idea how to behave in front of the men in general is completely laughable. They had to have been there for 3 hours in the film before anyone got the idea. They should never let their daughters work on such a thing.  I didn´te spend much of the time on writing this piece, but this was something that would be good in the school. It wasn´t even better in the first one of the "The American" series. I just felt like they´re going to get their money back. I didn't like this movie very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know what is going on. If the director decides to go to another studio in California to make the sequel, I can only imagine the guy who's in this movie. The movie could not be better if the director had done more to prevent the original to make it as funny and entertaining. The actors did a few things. Just the beginning and the ending were OK, but the rest was very poor. The first scene was not good, the opening sequence was nice, and the last scene was OK. The dialog between the characters was not funny, and they had a bad dialog. But you really should have seen more. The ending was very unnecessary and it didn't make much sense.  My thoughts about the movie: 7. It sucked! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is just awful. It's bad because they were trying to keep it together by making the actors, with a talent, that were acting. That's not a joke, because actors, in this one, are acting like they are in the movies. This is not a good movie. I don't have the money for this.  it has the ability to confuse the audience of the actors and the audience members of the movie and I believe that's what's going to happen. This movie is full of bad actors and a lot of bad acting. The movie has an anti-semitism, which I understand is a good thing, but, once in a year when you see the same anti-Semitic movie that was made in the US, I was appalled by it. It would be nice if this movie was made like a sequel to the "Packing" movie because it was so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may not remember me, but I used to watch this movie every time I opened. I tried to sit through the whole thing, but only one hour of the movie and still didn't get through it. The director even gave this movie a name: "Pawn." I thought it was just an unfortunate coincidence that my roommate was in the same movie as a lead in this movie.   In the beginning, I was going to feel the fullness of the episode right away. There were three scenes that seemed to be interlinked. At the beginning (when it is the same night), the main character is introduced as a "the boy" who looks like a "pawn" (his name is also spelled "Paddy"). The first scene involves him getting drunk and leaving a house in the middle of a bad situation (one character's name was spelled "Icy"). The boy then spends the rest of the time drunk and lying around looking at girls he finds in a cemetery. The next scenes were about a guy who kills an animal (the animal is called "Munch") and has a confrontation with the main, (the boy's name is spelled "Ayo"). The animal is killed, so the boy decides to get revenge on the animal's killer, which involves getting some beer and drinking.  Then, the scenes show a couple's car being smashed by a kid, killing people. One character gets into a scaring event and is killed by the animals. Then, another character gets killed by another animal and gets killed in a similar manner. We then see a scene involving a guy that kills a guy on a train. At that point, I decided I could take my friend off and go back to the next room, but the guy had been killed off the scene, and I couldn't get into the next bedroom and have the money to buy him the night they'd been robbed and murdered. They didn't want to get involved in this fight, so I couldn "forget" and go there. The scene starts with my friend leaving the hotel, which the main characters and the main villain are then waiting to find the guy to get into a fight, as if there is any need to go in and steal a horse. The boy and the first guy leave the scene together, with the rest taking place as "purchase".  There is no indication of what this is about, although the director obviously thought it could be about how we'd find the horse
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing in this movie to get a lot of enjoyment. There is no good or interesting film to the picture - no plot - no dialogue - no direction - no suspense - no mystery - no character development - no real suspense - not much suspense. I am not joking about how it's funny and/how it's so sad to have a "true" story. The ending is a bad film but it is so hard to read for a full review. The script is bad but so were the ending. The only thing I thought the movie was interesting was when it was funny - it was so, so bad and so, to be funny. It was awful. The movie started off very well, but by the end it fell and ended too quickly. I didn't want it to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really awful film!  I cannot believe anyone would be able to watch this movie. The acting was absolutely horrible and some of the jokes were so badly bad they seemed like they were the jokes to make a joke on one of their own. The story was badly written and the story was utterly predictable. A decent director is obviously having an idea to try something like this and should be able. I've watched several of the other movies they made. This one is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a HUGE fan of the show, and I had to like the show. I liked it, but this movie ruined it for me. I couldn't find any good movie to watch, and it's too bad to recommend to anyone who doesn't watch it. I know there are many people out there who would like it, and that's fine, but the show is so bad, and has such a bad ending that it makes any viewer think he could actually do good work. It just kills any sense of curiosity I had in the show to even watch it for the whole thing. I don't even like to recommend it for anyone. Don't buy it and do your best nothumble watching it, I'm sorry to have you, but don't go out and see it in this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie, I can see why this movie was made. If you're not into acting, then I'm afraid that you are. I mean, these are a few decent actors. There's no acting at all, and even some of the action has a few missed parts. I'm not sure if anyone would have any idea about acting. But I've watched "Couch Of Dreams" before. I didn't know what was up with the movie. It is just an attempt to make money, and nothing else. You may remember the movie from some other movie (I didn't even know what it was) so I won't talk.  Don't watch this movie. Don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to spend more time in the movie because of the terrible acting and the horrible dialogue. In my opinion it wasn't worth watching. The characters are totally bad, but it still works, so we should watch and try to enjoy them, if we don't like it. Unfortunately, the film was very dull and I just couldn't really see what was happening.  Also, the ending is very stupid, and I have nothing idea what it's going to be. It starts off looking like a film review about an old film in a terrible director's hands. I'm not sure who did this movie. I guess the people involved were also extremely sad and frustrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is quite uninteresting and does nothing to the life of the film. Its very poor script makes no sense at all. This movie is actually a piece of crap! It's a bit worse than an old sitcom about the same thing. That's for sure!  I don't know the name of the person that made this movie and I really want to know the names of the people who wrote this movie.  The ending is about the film director. He's not really interested in making a movie but he has a great love for the story and the people he's working with. So he has to create a way to distract from the problem.  But the problem with the movie is that the people in the film have good jobs. They really don't want to be in a big budget movie. And they want to make movies that would be popular.   Why can't somebody write a script and make a film like this? I know a lot of people want to go to the film and tell us that they really liked this movie - because there was no good answer to the question.  I guess the people were really really hoping they could write a negative movie about a movie called "Carmax, An Oldest Of The World." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning of this movie I thought I was in for one movie. It's just as bad as the earlier Memento, which was basically just another rip-off from some old horror flick. And it wasn't even a lot less entertaining when it first appeared, in the year before it was released. But once I realized it was so bad, I still wasn't expecting it to be that bad. So I was hoping to find some good horror flick to enjoy. And I did, and I did enjoy it, though I'm not sure how I'm supposed to enjoy this movie anyway. It wasn't that bad when it appeared in the late 1980's. It just sort of had all the wrong clichés, and didn't really make the film any fun to watch. It was basically a very silly story about a group of teenage kids who get into a fight over a house of women in possession of an elderly woman they'd rented from a sex store. There were also some ridiculous moments that I found annoying, and some things that were funny or funny, but the rest of the movie was just plain bad. The ending theme isn't terribly serious. It is a weak horror, but I think it had the ability to be funny. A lot of people in the 1990's have found it funny, and have found this movie, and the original Mementio is even better than Mementi. And although the movie has a bit of funny moments, it falls by the standards of a mediocre horror flick with a very bad director and a very poor story.  My point is that the horror genre had something of a resurgence in the 70's, and it happened when people began to look at all the horror movies that were out and going to see them. So a lot of the horror films that were popular in the early 1980's did a lot better than this movie. They weren't as horrifying, or were more clever. Still, there were many horror films in the 80's, so what can they do now in today's? No wonder. If you want to laugh at people in a horror movie, then you'd better start watching something that's actually funny, or even a good horror movie. As I said, it's just a bad film. The only thing that really made it interesting is how the people involved in it got a lot cut-and-stared ending. The first movie is about two teenage girls who are in the possession of a house belonging to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's true that this movie has the worst acting, but that's not my issue. I would recommend the "Bitterly In The Shadows" to watch and learn. I did. Don't.  I can't comment on the acting. The acting is terrible, like the whole movie. There is no plot. The direction is bad. I wish it could have been better. The songs are bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't understand how this movie was made. I saw it on the TV and thought it was the worst thing ever. I think it would have been better if the script had been written and acted for the whole movie. This movie is just the same as the TV show that is the same thing as the other sitcoms. This show is pretty bad at that, but it is pretty fun and a fun way to look at the world.  I was so angry at the idea that the writer would want to create a bad show. If there was something to complain about, why? I just felt that this guy just wanted to make money, not the best thing he could do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an adaptation of the classic film "Dangred" which began with a single good idea of a horror movie. But in a film which seems to follow straight to the last frame of the original film, it's a complete waste of every single good thing the original set up to be. The main reason for it's failure was that the original "Dangered" has been remade twice, once for a remake of "Dungred", and then twice again, for a horror film. It's bad for those that expect "DANGED", but better for those who don't know the name of the movie. For those that liked the original, I'd recommend "DANNY", because it is a much better horror film, but if you just liked the horror film "CAMPION". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first few minutes of this film is pretty boring, but the ending is very irritating. There is nothing good about it, and there is absolutely nothing that should have been at the end. What we all want out of this is that it isn't a film, but a film which is supposed to be a horror film. But it isn''t a horror story, it's not a horror movie, it''s really a horror sequel. It is really bad and I think the director has no idea what he should do. There are some good moments, but in a time of recession, they are missed. If you are in the same league as Mr. Stages, you will see this in your local supermarket. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "In the Garden" is a very predictable film that is very hard to watch. The movie contains an awful scene in a restaurant that we could very easily understand that it was a bad idea to keep on. In fact, even though it is interesting to see the characters' relationship, there was never any tension, and the relationship between the women didn't last much longer than a few hours. I had absolutely no idea what the reason for these actions is. This film seems to take place in some way in a fantasy world that relies on ridiculous assumptions.  In the Garden, the characters are the only thing that is interesting in the movie. There is absolutely no tension, in fact no sense of human emotion, and no human intelligence whatsoever. Just the characters themselves, who are in fact, rather boring, don't much matter.  Also, we have several scenes that seemed to occur in the middle of the film. This is not a film that should be taken seriously, but I've just been reading some reviews which say this movie is a masterpiece.  The movie is nothing but a disappointment because of the fact that they wasted time trying to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've seen so far. They made a couple of good things but it's hard to believe that they would actually make a movie with no jokes and then, oh, so funny. I'm a horror-fantasy fan and it seemed to come out of nowhere. I liked the fact that it has a decent premise and some of the jokes to go with it. Some of the humor is good, but the main plot is terrible. There were some good moments. If you want a horror film about horror and action, then stay away from this film. But, for a horror movie, that doesn't make it much better. There are few moments that could make this film seem interesting. The main problem with this movie is that its not even a horror and they keep trying to get you in a fight, but their main goal is to make you scared and scared so the story doesn't have any meaning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty bad, the direction is interesting, but the direction isn't bad either and the ending is quite predictable. I really thought the story was boring, but at least it had the ability to be funny.  It had some good moments in the end but that could not justify its existence.   I can't say I enjoyed this movie but it was not the worst movie ever since. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard of this movie when it first came out and I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I was extremely bored and was so disappointed that I was not able to even watch it again. I found it funny and so disappointing.  I have been reading all the reviews on here. Some of them have given me some interesting things, but I do not agree with them. I had to get ahold of the whole thing so that I didn't waste my time. I did not understand why this was a terrible movie. I just want to understand the story and characters. I don't even get the sense of a character. I think that the directors had to make it so there was no plot and no sense of reality. That is, it doesn't matter that you are acting or acting, it has to matter that there's a story and there's nothing more to talk about. The actors are totally forgettable and stupid, they are stupid, and I don´t think they are even acting. I have a few points of interest though. I find the movie a bad, but that is all in a good way, it is a funny film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film twice, and it's pretty bad. It's absolutely disgusting, it's really disgusting. You know why I'm not thrilled by this film, I'm the guy who has made a movie like this.  It's so bad that I don't even care for my fellow actors. My fellow actors in this film are all acting like slobber, pathetic, and the women just go through the motions. It just works against the notion of a film, and not a film at all.  You are supposed to be in the middle of the movie, but that's not how it works. It can't be anything but a complete movie, or a series of films. The film is only one film, or maybe a series. It has the same kind of story lines like the old ones, and there's not even a true story to tell. It was really disappointing and it could have been funny at least one of the times, but it wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are the same as in the original version, but the dialogue isn't funny anymore, and the ending is so disappointing that you wonder why anyone ever thought this would actually be a good film. This remake was made by a team that included the director of this movie, so it's hard to find out what they have done to bring a bad film to life.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it last week, so the only thing that happened. After seeing this film I can honestly say I was disappointed. It's full of cliché-like and predictable jokes. The story is so bad that it's not worth, especially since the story is already bad. But the plot is still good, and that's the best reason I have. There is no plot element to this film. I can only guess that the filmmakers who made this film were thinking they would be finished, and when they finally found the ending the film would get the best score of any of the 3D films released in the year. I thought this film was only good for the money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion this movie is the worst comedy ever made. It was a remake of "Swing" which made some good jokes. I have to admit that I laughed so hard that I thought the whole thing was funny. There is no good laughs in the original "Swan". This remake is not as funny as "Sling". The jokes are annoying, but the funny ones were a little bit funny. Also the acting seems to go one way. There are some good actors, but I wouldn't expect this to be funny.  I really liked the original film because the jokes and the jokes were a lot of fun, but when you finally got all the jokes then this movie becomes laughable. This is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. I give it 2 stars because I would've rated it more. Its acting is bad and the acting is worse. The story is not that interesting. It was not a good film at all. I can not recommend it to anyone. Don't even buy it for money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film director says a few lines, and leaves them to the end of the movie.  In the end, I got nothing, I thought. I tried to like the movie, but it just felt so lame. Some of the moments that were supposed to have ended at the end are never actually shown, and I just never got them. Some moments are too long, and too vague. What's a little movie that starts with "HELP OR CRUSH?" And the ending is not nearly as good as the original.  If you have an interest in the movie because of the fact that the film stars John C. Anderson, who was the voice-writer of this movie, then this is a pretty bad movie. The movie could have been made for its first 10 years, but since it didn't see the light of the year, it seemed much less appealing, because it was so much less interesting than the original for me. I didn't even mind that it was a little silly, since it wasn't that funny. But it wasn`t one of those films that you really get into, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.   If there was one good thing about this movie it was that the characters were very good characters. That's not enough to make it good. The dialogue isn't too flat, and not too annoying, since most of the acting is pretty funny. However, the ending didn't work for me, so it's a pretty lousy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was disappointing to see the new version of "The Little Stranger" that was so good. It wasn't only a terrible film, it was the worst movie I had ever seen. I didn't know whether the movie was a sequel or a sequel. It was so bad, even the trailers were much better than the actual flick. It looked like one story about a boy, a boy who wasn't even like a boy. The story was about how the girl was a girl, so she decided to spend her life in an orphanage, because she couldn't be with her parents, and that was the reason why she went in an asylum, apparently because she wanted to live on the island. But, it wasn't clear how this was a story about her, or whether she had a family, or even whether she wanted a family. When she was rescued by the police and the kids from the orphanage she was sent to an orphan. But the boys in the orphaner residence were just as horrible, and they were in prison for a few days in order to get to the island where she was staying.  If you want to see something bad, you have to get out of the theater and rent a horror movie: Screamers, even horror films. The only reason I didn´t watch the original flick was because I was too afraid of it being in my hands, and I just hadn´s enough room to sit and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen. I am so, so frustrated! I was really scared when I heard the soundtrack and I thought it was a good film. And then I heard something about the plot. This film had absolutely no plot. I cannot even start the movie so bad. I want to know what happened to this movie: The first sentence that comes out the worst is the one in the trailer.  After watching it I felt like I was an idiot who hadn't been to this film at all. It didn't make any sense at all in the beginning, even though I thought the film was okay. It was bad! I'm so unhappy! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some nice moments in this movie. I wish that it had more good moments. I also wish that the actor was able to see how much that was bad about him. I mean, really bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of Stephen Gillen's films; but this one is sadly pathetic. And if you haven't seen 'The Iron Tide' then you've got nothing to do with the movie. I give this movie one-five out of ten. If you like a movie about a dysfunctional family then you may like this movie. The acting is awful but, if you want it to be funny, the acting is okay. The story is weak but has some good scenes. The humor is bad but has a decent punch line. The characters are boring and make no effort to develop their characters. I just find this movie to be incredibly irritating and stupid and, like a low-budget horror flick about a family that just wants to be nothing more than a series of dysfunctional and stupid family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd love to give this movie more than the rating - a 1/3, with no good reason - I mean, I just watched the first 10 minutes. I'm still a bit upset with how low they can take the story of this film and how stupid it is.  I'm also annoyed by the fact that the "camera" has no real movement and I thought it was a bit annoying - even though the acting was good, not all of the stuff that was supposed to be. A lot of the acting is pretty bad - not in the same way that you'd expect from most Korean movies - but there's a lot of stuff in the first half of the film that could have been put together like an opening film for a TV series - which would be just like a bunch of old film snippets. Also, I thought the film was very short - 2 hours - but that doesn't matter much considering this movie has to take place in a very large studio. The fact that it takes place in the middle of a busy subway that may be the most interesting part of the movie makes it seem a lot longer and less interesting than it actually is. I wouldn't even think of watching this film if you were a little kid, or an old person who just needs something to distract them from their life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, at least you might hope that this movie will make you smarter. I am only after trying to make this film (with a good story) a worthwhile movie; it just didn't. There's not a clear, realistic sense to it. This movie was so bad it seemed like it was going to make me smart. It wasn't. It was so depressing that I had to put this on. Maybe it's because I was very unhappy at the end. I'm not even in the same condition that it made me so sad, but I do know that I can survive for a few hours. I won't waste my time either, it is a very dumb movie. I didn't really like it, but it made us feel terrible and I never got even the smallest sense of happiness, despite the fact that it was so awful.  I can't recommend this to anyone. If you're looking for a film to make a positive review about, don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It just...lump...and awful. This was a movie with no idea whatsoever. I'm not a bad person, but my opinion of the movie is based on a lot of assumptions. It is a shame that a movie that was supposed to be a great comedy has been so bad. I want to apologize to those who wasted their time on the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found out and saw the movie for the first time. So I'm writing a negative comment about the film:  I've seen this movie so many times. I really don't like it. It is bad. It should be banned by all people on it.  I wish I could write this negative review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know who you are, nor do I care. I would like to try and see what happened on that day so that I could tell you what the hell this film was. I'd like to see you and the others that were in this movie. The movie is nothing short and has no plot whatsoever and no dialogue, and has absolutely no plot. It's all just a bunch of three people that sit in their seats waiting to see some of them do something horrible. The ending is a little bit predictable and unsympathetic, and the ending is probably the weakest it has been in a while, but I would still try to see it again if I were younger.   There is only one good thing about the movie. That would be the ending. But by then it's too late. I give this movie two out of 10 because it is just an insult to all who made this movie in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie on the late night on HBO, and even then I thought it was trash. And that's exactly where I live, it's the first one I watched on the night.  It seems that this movie was made in the late 1970's for a reason. That it was made as a way to make money from it. I think it's one of the worst things ever to happen to me. I remember what I had done to this movie. It was in the middle of the first season, and I forgot about the movie and decided to watch it again. I was a teenager, and at the time I was starting to do my homework again. Of course I knew that this film would only be used to make me interested in making money, and the movie wouldn't have worked. Still, I couldn't believe that it was that bad. I know that most of the films that had it in my mind were some of the most brilliant, and that they were so bad to see that I gave the impression that it had a very low budget, and a horrible cast and acting that didn't even make it seem like a "real movie".  This movie is so bad that it looks like it was put together, or the person who made it had never done that.  But there's more to this kind of movie than that. I don't know how the director and director got the idea of making it. It doesn't make much sense. The movie starts off looking pretty good. It has a bad ending though. The ending is so stupid and unbelievable that it has the ability to make you want to watch an hour of soap. It just gets bad and gets worse the second time, and it never gets any plot. The cast is just terrible, and this is probably the most horrible movie of all time I've ever seen, because it is all too long. I have never seen a movie that has this many lines in the beginning. But I did see a few of those, even though they didn't matter. The worst aspect of this movie is that the director never really does the scenes. The characters never really shows any emotion, or acting. They just talk. They never break. The film is the opposite of the last movie I saw, which is the movie with a really good director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to start with the very brief and rather predictable premise. We meet a girl named "The Lady", who gets all her girlfriends pregnant. Her best mate turns out to be "The Husband", who turns out in their own way to meet some bad guy named "Big Dick". We meet the wife of the Husband who doesn't know how to handle a divorce, and then she gets all the guys that seem to want to leave. There's no real plot, no real acting, no direction. It's a terrible comedy.  It's not funny, it's not good. It doesn't really have a sense of "comedy" either, but it's just a comedy. So bad that I gave the guy who was in "The Bride" the name of "The Comedy".  I'm sorry for those who thought it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An overrated piece of entertainment. I've watched more than 20 hours of the movie without even seeing it a second time.  I have been a fan of this movie since it was released, but I just found it very bad. The actors were good and the actors' acting was good, but it is just a bad film. It just was annoying and I don't know if anyone would even like it.  The best way I have found to describe this film is to say the movie is bad. I'm not sure about this movie as a horror movie, but if you're a fan to watch it for some reason, this movie should be considered a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a failed attempt at creating a real time-of-play and even a good concept of time-to-play. It starts off with a very shallow storyline. The first scene shows the characters trying to escape from the police, which are very interesting to me, but they do a terrible job of making a break for the game. One of the characters, a very thin woman is locked in a room and her friends try to break the lock with the police officer in a very primitive looking room. The scene goes on, but all of the people involved are very unimpressed. The storyline is only there, and the plot ends up not being effective in terms of being funny, and is even predictable.  The plot gets worse when the movie begins. The cops in the police station get the same thing as a TV show does - which is the police cop breaking the lock and using a flammier with a hose on to fire holes in the wall of the building.  Then, there's a scene where some of the women are locked in the door and a man comes to try to get to them. A pretty decent woman has her boyfriend put out the door in the middle of them and they get caught by a police officer who is very slow.  It could have been a comedy movie about a flam, but really, it was a disappointment. This movie was absolutely terrible to watch - and I don't think I could even begin to take much interest. I'd give it a zero out of 10 for the movie, in my opinion. It just doesn't make much of a difference. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe any other person has ever seen this movie, ever. Not one person.  The best way to describe this movie: A black man in a black leather jacket and the man that is supposed to be acting with black gloves. You can tell from a bad description and a bad script.  I had to watch this movie in the first place because I saw the trailer online, the movie trailer in a bad black movie trailer. I thought it was an interesting movie with some funny and some funny jokes. But it was so bad it didn't make the point any more than that it is a horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is to be any comment of the movie that was not a disaster, this one is one. If you really enjoy a certain movie: please don't waste time on the video. It is awful, so bad it will probably earn you a more dubious review than any other I've given, but one thing is for sure:  If you are looking for a good movie: you can rent the movie.  If your family was dying for this film, try something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Aliens" is a bad horror film from the late 1990's that looks like a cheap action flick. What was once a good horror-film, has now been completely lost. The acting is terrible, the story is totally ridiculous and the plot is simply a waste of time. I have seen several interviews this movie: one was for a "best documentary" on how horrible horror movies go, the other was for "The Worst Horror Film Ever". But, the point is:  "The Alien" has just fallen off the shelf. It needs to be made into a cult, the "The Walking Death" film has made more money than "The Vampire". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this movie you will find this movie a bit weak. They don't really make it that way, that's not to say that it wasn't interesting to watch. Just like the movies of Alesly and Deena were, this movie is just plain boring and not much more fun. My favorite line in the movie, and my favorite line, are the lines where I actually made it for my boyfriend and the movie is too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this movie as soon as it appeared on my internet, and that is when I knew that it was coming to the screen.  It had an odd premise, a bad acting, poor special effects and poor editing, but the cast was good, the camera was OK, and the whole cast was just an average mix of people who had never really lived in New York, especially in the east of the city. I have never seen a good film with a bad plot, bad acting or even a good camera. It doesn't help that the writer was someone who has never lived in NYC, either, and he also wrote a bad script for a good movie: his words were just words, not words.  The acting was bad and there was a couple of funny moments.  There were some nice moments, and some funny moments, but it was just the typical crap.  I wish I was still talking about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with some funny lines, like when the guy talks to a female character and is totally ignored and then walks off. I remember that the first one was a good one and one of the funniest ever in the movie was when the little lady talks to the hero. I also thought that there was some humor in the last scene, but I am still looking for it.  Other than the humor, the movie is too long and no funny jokes about anything in this movie. The plot is boring and there are too many fake things. It is hard to believe that it was a serious film at all, and that they found this one too easy to write.  It also has a very amateur look. The movie takes place in the 1930s in a middle-class country with a lot of people who have never seen it before, so there is nothing to compare the plot with the other films. But that is about where the movie gets really boring. If you don't see it, you will not be able to follow the plot and will have a lot more trouble understanding what's going on.  I can recommend watching the original DVD of the movie, because it is better than the film that has been released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not making any secret of what I think this movie is. I don't think I had the same opinion in my mind before seeing this film. I know I had a very rough time after seeing it, and I have not even fully thought it through. The ending could have been funnier. I have never had a big break-up or any big break. This movie is just a very poorly executed attempt at a comedy. It could have easily been funnily narrated, but then there are two people who could have said a couple of words that could come out of their mouths and say they were in tears. It looks like it is an obvious parody of the comedy genre of "The Sixteen", or the "Honey Goes." I did not see this movie in the same state of mind. I can't say that the film was anything better than an attempted slap-in-the-the--the--film--because I had difficulty coming to accept that, as my favorite, it was about as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of a very bad movie is really that nothing really happens on the story of this movie. It's boring, and I don't see the ending either. The actors are not good enough for a movie to be considered a good film. It has a bunch of old ideas in it (like the religion) and also an entirely original plot. There are even the old title song lyrics - "Jesus was dead. You can hear the song "Jesus Is Dead" by a Christian choir in this movie! Why would somebody waste one of those songs in a movie? The story doesn't really seem original enough and the story is just too convoluted and stupid to make people laugh. I think it's about time that this movie was a lot closer to reality. We have all the "good" films in this world - they are mostly good and well-received. In fact, I don´t really understand how people are "sitting in the theater" in movies. If the movie was made as a result of some bad movie, then they were never a big hit.  It's a pity! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of Star Wars. They should've had some of the plot lines.  There are no plot lines, characters are boring, and the music is terrible. There are some decent elements of the movie, but nothing is the main reason I've seen it. The director made a bad film called "The Phantom Men", a plot line, and a soundtrack was a major factor in the disaster. It should've been a better movie called "Death By Grapes" or something else.  What did the director think it was? He thought it was a remake of Star Trek and made a new one so that people would want to see it. He made this movie just because he thought that he could do a sequel to it.  It's like a new film: you start watching it, and decide to start watching the first one for the same reason, and that is all you think about. You decide how it is going to end. You go into the second film with your best friend to watch it and try it. You start thinking, and if they do the sequel they will have to make sure the first movie is good. If the sequel is terrible they will need to get out a new movie. If they can't get the plot and it will be a disaster.  I do not know if this is a remake, but it did not make me want to finish this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so boring, with the stupid acting and unbelievable story. I would never watched this movie again, but I'm sure it will be replayed in a sequel. It wasn't until after my review of the original film that I found out what it really is. It's not worth seeing the sequel because it is a complete disaster. The story is so bad that even some of the actors are not able to carry the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised at how bad this film was. The story is so bad that it's not worth talking about. I just can't think of any good way to describe it, because the acting and the story is terrible, like most movies. What was there for? What was this? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it before it came out and I didn't like it. The plot was bad. It really is just a bunch of recycled scenes from a series of films. I didn' see anything that wasn't quite right. I did, though, get interested. I'd like to see a sequel.  So I give you my verdict. I think it was bad in the end. It was a lousy plot. And I had some decent action, but none of the dialogue. It just made me look stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film over and over again for the last 10 years and it still has not been updated. I have only watched it once, it's still terrible. The original one was great but this one is very low budget. If you have a family that likes you but also likes popcorn movies, then watch this one. If your kids don't like this one, get them off of the shelf. This movie does not make any sense, it does not have a sense to be funny and it doesn't have a story, it just is an incredibly bad movie. I highly recommend watching this one for kids but don't watch it. It's not worth seeing it to rent it, it should probably not be even a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie on my first visit to Vancouver. I remember thinking how bad it was. As my girlfriend and I were watching it one evening, I couldn't see anything. At that point it's about 40 minutes and I really thought it was about half of one movie.  The plot was good and I didn't get that the movie is actually a bad. Just...the fact that the whole story was so bad is disturbing. Just awful. There were a lot of problems with it and a lot, but if I had been a little younger I might have figured it out a little earlier.  I gave it a low rating, but I'd definitely say this movie wasn't all that bad. There wasn't too many problems, but you just couldn't follow along. The acting is just bad, the acting is bad, and the plot is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't know what the hell this movie is about...it is awful to watch...just like the old ones with only an occasional 'curse' feature. I'd rather see this guy to watch an Indiana Jones movie and the only thing about this film that makes me happier is that none of the girls in it has ever seen this movie before. The most disappointing thing about the movie is that this movie was so long that it didn't end up making it. I don't understand why this came out as a full blown documentary like a film about a real life disaster, but it's pretty disturbing anyway. I was wondering how much money this could have cost when I saw the "real" version of it. The only reason I knew about it was because of the'real' version of this film, and because I saw this movie in a movie shop when it was in my hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are plenty of people out there who have never seen the movie. Maybe some of those will see it because they like the movie, or just because it was a lot of stuff. I would not recommend this movie as a film because it is only about 30 minutes. The plot is boring, and there are not even one real person on the show. The only thing I wish I had done was to find a good movie from the first season of Doctor Who, when I saw it, and gave it a chance to be even that great, which would have been my life's greatest happiness.  I have been trying to find this movie, but even watching it only brings back pain, so I think I should definitely watch the first episode of the TV series instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a horrible excuse for a "Bacheloretonic" film. I am not a professional film reviewer but after seeing this movie, I felt compelled to warn the world of this bad movie. Unfortunately, we have all the "Bachelorhood" movies, with Bacheloretons. In the case of the movie, there are so few Bachelors (more like only 1-2) who have been on "Hollywood" for 20 years.  Bachelo does an okay job, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  If you want to enjoy a bad film, watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I was very disappointed after watching it, and the whole thing could have easily been a series of little bits about the world and not a film. I couldn't understand why someone thought it was a good film, since it was supposed to be a film that was about the history of the world, and it wasn't. It was just about the most depressing film I've ever seen, and I never knew what it was about. I hope this doesn't get shut down like so many other great movies (or just be re-titled to some good movie) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director who makes these movies should be fired. Maybe I read somewhere else it should have a certain amount of suspense and something important like a plot. Or maybe not. But the ending is so unbelievable that it is impossible to believe a guy who is in front of an acting studio is acting in it. It's just a complete waste of time and money. I don't get any better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My own reaction is to comment on the fact that a good movie is always about a good story. That, if a movie is poorly written, then there is no reason to expect it to be good. It should be a movie about something. It ought not to be about a story about a child. It shouldn't have been about a girl. It certainly should not have been a movie with characters who are supposed to be smart. It really should be about some teenagers. It is just one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the version of "Houseboat" that I would have preferred over the sequel. The plot had good ideas and the dialog was good but the overall execution was just poor and it made me bored. I did not care for the plot and, even the actors were good. The acting was bad, the camera was bad and the editing was bad.  There is no suspense, no suspense to the plot, no excitement, no exciting characters, no plot. It's just a pathetic and depressing film that should not have been put on the shelves. It makes no effort to make fun of it and it is not to be taken seriously. The movie should have been one of the worst I have ever seen. I've seen movies that had better quality than this but I would hesitate to say this one is even in that level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely appalled to watch this movie because I've seen it multiple times, and now I'm just a bit further wondering why this one has not already been made. I think they should have started with a disclaimer to warn people of the bad quality of the film. The acting is just bad, the acting is very bad, and the music was bad but actually, it wasn't just bad in the song as it was very poor. I don't know if it was made for FUN or for money but it wasnth/scary. I just know the whole movie is bad, just a lot of money and a lot left unpaid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a film. But, I don't mind it so. It's just not interesting. And, of course, the acting seems to have taken off. The way it's directed is terrible, and the characters themselves don't get developed. Also, there was nothing to do. I was bored after watching it for 5 minutes. But if I saw some of the movie when it was on it was hilarious. If you have nothing to say, enjoy watching the movie in the theater, but if you want to see the actors and try to figure it out, then don't bother. This is just sad, really, because I wanted to see something that had potential. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poorly done film about a poor acting group in a white dress and a pretty boy with a "CURSITE" ring!  There are a few parts which aren't bad, but most of them are just bad.  I don't recommend watching this movie because it is boring, but this is one of the films that could help with some interesting acting. If you get to know the people that were in it, you would have to start watching it, and don't just watch it for the laughs it will give. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first found this movie in the local film club, and it was not an interesting film at all, the story was awful and the acting was awful. But I thought it was interesting and even the ending was cute and the ending of the movie felt too convenient. However, I can only recommend this movie to those who just want to see a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this in a theater so many times. The first was bad. I saw it again last week. It is very difficult to sit through this movie. I was thinking of getting another chance to see it again, but after seeing my first and second time, it is just as bad as the original. The acting was bad, and I felt like I was being controlled by the acting. I have even seen some parts in the movie in the theater, and they were OK, but they did not affect me, and could not hurt me. The plot is not good enough. I do not know if the director is a good actor or if it is a bad script, but this movie is so bad that I cannot really blame the writer. The dialogue was not coherent, and seemed to be rushed. The actors did not really act well. The ending, which I think could have made a movie better, was a weak ending. There is too many of the movie's scenes, and too few good scenes in the rest of the movies. There were some good parts, and some funny scenes. But, there is not enough to say that the whole thing is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a fan of this movie and would never recommend it to anyone. They tried to come across as being funny and funny, which is a big understatement. But they were awful at the same time. I don't like this movie for what it has to be. It's not just a silly teen drama, it's not a comedy, and it doesn't have any funny jokes. I mean, I could watch some comedies with a lot of jokes, but I think that the two jokes were too ridiculous for most people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was supposed to be the sequel to the original, this is not the sequel, it is just an annoying movie. The only thing good was the little bit of action scenes from the other movies that this sequel managed to make. That was about 15% of the movie.  There is absolutely no action in this movie. And it looks stupid, but that is not a bad thing to have. The acting is bad, the writing is bad and the casting is bad. The story is pretty weak, which means you're not going to get any enjoyment out of it. There aren't any good dialog in the movies, the plot is a total b****** and doesn't provide anything, except to give an idea that this is a sequel.  I can't even bring this movie down to say that this movie has some redeeming value, it just doesn't give you anything positive or fun. The two girls in the film are good, the one in the top part of the cast, is the best part of this movie, but it's all bad. If you have any money or good thoughts about the movie, don't waste it, just because you're just bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that it would be so bad, but it was SO bad. I laughed at the fact that they got the name "Tearback" in the title, which is a very derogatory name for the movie. I can't even watch it without getting into tears. The story is about a teenager who has two male classmates named "The Bull" and "The Nuts". This makes me wonder how all these guys would behave with each other? I'm not surprised that they're the only ones who are in this movie and not the gang of guys who run the school, or even the school's teachers and the students.  I'm also surprised that this movie was made as it is, since it isn't just a few kids who are crazy enough to be in the movies and get beaten up (I can't remember how it happened in this). I'm even more surprised that the film was made by a high school girl who couldn't even find a good excuse to take off. She was in a very serious mood as she made some friends fly for their stupid and cruel behavior. I would never really care what happened in the movie, but that is all they are getting to live with is that the guys on their team are crazy, crazy, and horrible. The reason why these guys don't get beaten to death is that they are in a good position to keep on. But they are not very good at keeping control of their actions and making good decisions, which doesn't seem to be part of this movie's theme.   The story doesn't really make sense. The characters' lives were so far removed from theirs and there were no good reasons to keep them alive. I was interested in seeing the guys who were in their group, and they aren't even characters, only strangers.  So the plot and the story may be interesting, but none of the characters are good or even well-characterized, and this movie could easily be forgotten about its existence in the middle of an otherwise good film.  This movie was only moderately entertaining as the first few chapters of a bad Japanese movie I recently watched. They don't even make much of these characters' scenes, but at the beginning of the film there is one line, and then there is nothing. They never really come together in a clear sequence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story, at its most absurd level, is so ludicrous that it has been laughed off by the first few minutes of the film. A typical case of "reality" is that this is the only movie to contain a single plot. In "The House Of Humblemen", the film is essentially a sequence of scenes. As one person stands at the screen, another person is looking on from the left. After an hour and a half, you will finally find yourself in a maze. At least five people stand at the first scene and the film lasts a mere 45 minutes.  A pity, I mean this is only about 6 minutes long. I would not rate it as "great" because it contains too many unnecessary, unnecessary, pointless, unnecessary words. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Sombra" is a really awful movie. I had never seen this movie as a kid, and I didn't understand how this movie could possibly be made. If anyone is even interested in this movie, it's not worth a DVD to watch, even if they think it's interesting.  The movie starts off promisingly light, and is immediately followed by an onslaught of violence. It starts with two characters fighting in an arena and killing each other. One of the characters is an old woman who wants to kill everyone, and her brother is a very powerful fighter.  When the two women who are fighting in the arena and try to kill each other, they are killed off by a demon named "The Serpent" who then tries to steal the demon's soul and take over all their bodies.  However, there are other "real" demons who want to destroy the world with the help of the hero of the story.   At the beginning of the movie, the female hero is a normal lady, but she becomes involved in a battle with a demonic demon named Amaka (an evil demon in human form). She begins using her own magic power to attack all the other characters. Unfortunately, there is also a man named Akira who is dead, apparently in possession of Amakas soul and has fallen into a coma with an eye swollen from his forehead, and also in possession with a demon demon named Akki. She uses her magic powers to take him over, so she can't get any work done in the battle that she has been fighting.  Then there is the main villain who has taken the demons into the stage of her life, because she wants to take the hero from the arena to the Underworld.  Also, the heroine who is in possession (Lilian) is in the process of trying to escape the serpent, which is apparently in control of her body, apparently because it looks like she is being controlled by a mirror or mirror. After losing a lot of her powers, she is able to get a job in a hotel that provides her with a lot more power. There is no explanation why her power seems to work a little better now, as she has a few more powers.  She spends some time in the hotel, which seems to be under "the influence" of the mirror from the mirror. However, it seems to have some magical effects as she sleeps, and she begins making out her magic mirror by throwing it onto some
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was so bad. I had the worst impression of this movie. This was the worst movie I've ever watched and even worse. The main reason I rated it so low was because it was about as realistic as the show could have been. I would give a 10 if this movie was like the show on TV. Unfortunately, that would have been so unrealistic, as much as this movie is set up to be an "funny" show. I gave this movie a 7 because there is nothing to go in for. This movie could have got along better with a better TV show. Also, I didn't get along with the character who voiced the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed and dismayed. I didn't like this movie, and I certainly do not intend to recommend it to anyone. The film is a complete disaster, which has brought me to the end of the best of my life, and leaves me wondering why. I just didn't understand what was going on in this film. I give it two points; First, you'd just to get the message of the film. This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you liked movies with a "great story", movies like this will simply give you nothing. You get so tired afterward, when you finish the movie, it is unbelievable. Second, this movie is just plain bad. The plot is so disappointing and bad that I cannot recall all the details of the story. The cinematography is so bad that it is difficult to sit through. The actors' voices are so bad, that there is no room to hear their opinions. I never laughed. The acting is so poor that it just leaves me to question my mind. This film is about two things, and one of them is a bad story and the other a bad, because the story is not really about a story.  There is only one great thing in the film, and that is the characters. My impression of the characters is pathetic and unbelievable, and it is so frustrating that it takes my breath, because I really didn't care for these characters. The characters are so, so weak that I wish they were better. In fact, the only character that I would like to have in my life would be Paul Thomas and the person that he is in fear of, and the very last character I would want to like to kill. But here, if I have done the research and analysis of the movie in a positive manner, I am very, very tired by this film, because it is bad. And what happens is really not a story, it happens so that what happens in this movie serves no story. So, if you like movies that deliver only one kind of emotion, you will just watch the movie.  I do not know what happened to the film in a negative way, but I can guess. It must have been the bad director of this movie. He never really cared for this film's money, and he seemed to be obsessed with making it to make this movie really bad. I guess he was doing it to get an excuse for an ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was first reading this film I felt like I was going to see it for the first time. It is a poor film with poor cinematography that fails to convey any plot. The characters are totally flat and there are no action sequences. The film is a bit too slow for most fans and no good music makes the film any more enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell the difference between watching this movie and watching "Escape The Asylum".  This movie isn't for the faint fans of the "Eternal City" series. Even the plot was pretty decent. In "City of London", a very big, mysterious, secret underground city that has mysteriously appeared under one of its own (the one that was used in the original "Evalon City") towers, but now apparently has nothing left to hold it. That's the plot. Nothing else.  But let's focus on the end of the movie.  There's a huge plot twist that is nothing to say. This plot is so long and drawn out that it's annoying. Some of the characters, including the cop who has a grubby nose (from the original 'Escape') and the head of the police who are on a mission to get in on the conspiracy. In the middle of a scene, the detective and his partner (and it's head-woms!) get involved with a mysterious woman who's selling "Burgains". I'd say the cop's line is about the end and the scene when he loses a hand? But you'll probably find out that the cop is hiding the hand and then, probably, the girl runs off with her hand on her back...  In the end, it really is pointless to watch. In fact, even I've heard it's name a 10 and it's in the same place again, the same location. If you really want to find out what happened to the head (the cop) and the cop (Burgers?), go to 'Eternal Cities'. But if you just want to see the characters involved in a crime, get 'The Dark World'. It's not even as good as the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited to find this movie, but I was dismayed that it was so bad that it didn't even make it past 100 minutes. If it was made in the middle of the 1980's, this would have been the most disappointing movie ever made. The music is terrible, the story is very thin and the direction is bad. The acting is bad, the acting is awful, and most of all the dialog is bad (the ending song was very sad, as well as the first one which was about how horrible it would feel if you went to the cemetery).  Overall, I would not recommend this movie as a horror flick but a lot more of films that are terrible, or have excellent quality music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my second viewing and I still don't understand how this movie was produced. I'm still not able to see any of it. It is just too thin and dull, even with good performances from each main actor, not to mention the acting. The direction is bad as well and it starts up with cheesy, pretentious dialogs.  It doesn't help that, that most of the actors involved are either a comedian or a porn star, I guess it would have been an interesting movie to watch as a whole. I have seen this twice, and don't feel the same urge anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on video for a few seconds. I thought I'd be able to sit on a chair to see it. I couldn't even see it in my eyes. I was only able to look at the top picture on the video. I didn't really care. It's really just a movie about a fake marriage between a man and his wife. No love for this movie really. If you don't like fake marriage, don't watch this movie. But if you love the movie, don´t rent this movie and then take the trip to the movies that are good. This movie is not even close to good. In my opinion it should be banned by the producers of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film with no action! What was the point of this project? If it was supposed to be a comedy film? Of course, it was. The ending seems to have been set up by a cheap gag-filled plot. This movie was actually really bad. Also, even in the end, it is difficult to find the point at which they are getting on with this guy. I am sure that the film-makers and director knew exactly what they were doing. Unfortunately, the plot, as well as the ending, is not realistic at all. The movie has no real ending. There are too many plot lines that I couldn't tell what the ending is. One of the few plot lines, "This is an adventure," should be followed with, "The ending is a dream." This movie is also bad because the main characters are so bad, such a bad actor that you can't really tell what their intentions are. You are just left to wonder what the hell is going on, so it is easier to forget.  This movie could be so much better if the makers and director were willing to bring a fresh, real ending to a movie. I'm also concerned about the number of lines that the writers and the director use in their final scenes. I understand the purpose of the movie, but I don't think the filmmakers and director ever made it interesting, or even close. This has nothing to do with the content of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a big fan of the TV series, I enjoyed this show and I remember the episode that got me into my big and deep "movie" viewing spree. Unfortunately, this show had no real chemistry and I believe that the writer/director/directors/any one of them did a really poor job in it. What the heck were they thinking? I was surprised that they didn't even bother to mention the name of the person who was supposed to be directing the show. And what was the name? Hmmm, "Brian Glover", I can't figure out the name. So, I have to say, this is the show that got all the best ratings for the TV Series in 1993 when the show was supposed finished. If you're gonna take a "fun" movie and expect to be successful, you'll lose the money you think you can. If your job is to kill, you will fail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely poor film to watch (I think the first 20 minutes are pretty good). The story has several inconsistencies (this is the main reason) and the actors and special effects are quite boring to watch. The film contains the obvious good elements of this film (the wonderful, loving and loving family that lives in a large mansion) and I guess you know what it is, but it's not worth spending more money on it. But if you decide to see the sequel of the original film: this film is bad, especially when compared with "The Darkest Night" (with Richard Bronson). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A "credible thriller" about a small town in the mid of the '90's has to be the worst movie ever made, even worse than the original that was released in the 60's. This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It seems as if it's never been released, and this is just the second edition. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the first installment was good. In the beginning I felt like it was a very serious movie. But it wasn't that way. The plot was weak, the dialog was weak. That's all on the acting and the acting. There's nothing to really show there was anything special about this movie. The movie was one of those that was so bad it made me wonder how someone could possibly have gotten this far and how it would have made my wife angry. I guess the only person who could have got this far was the guy who wanted to be in an interview on that show. I don't think it was ever necessary to watch this movie, and I just don't. I'd like a little of an answer, but if you have nothing to do, just watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really surprised that they didn't bother to change the name of the film. If I can guess it was really a copy of some other "Dark" horror films, I'd be shocked. This film had a decent premise but not too interesting and not particularly scary (if you really cared). I was very disappointed that I gave it two stars, the only thing about it was the name and the first few minutes of the story are totally predictable. The plot was basically just an extension of the old "dark" horror cinema and some gore effects which would have been at the very least of the films made when these movies were made. I did not think I was that surprised at this. It made my blood boil to my eyes when I watched it. I also think that it is a bad film. I would recommend a lot less. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off in the first film, we were presented with the story of the young boy who got his first movie shot on video. Some people don't understand that this was a piece of pure fantasy, and even though you can see the real life of it on TV, it is not actually what it would have been.  In this world, you can't believe the idea of making a film where a kid shoots his parents for no reason, and since they were in the film, it would make no sense in making a movie where they didn't shoot.  The next film we are presented with a scenario where we would then take on a boat on the lake of the Black River, with another boy and a "friend" who are ready to shoot the other boy. And then you will see a sequence of events that is not at all plausible at all. The boy is introduced to the "friend". This is obviously not how you want to approach a situation with a very young boy, it's a way to shock us into believing in the unbelievable story. The scene is just one line between the two friends, they shoot, and then the kid is ready to die, because he's in the boat. It's about a few seconds. After he is on the boat, a gun to his head will fall off, just as the other boys are ready for him to jump in front of the boat to jump off the boat again, so it's not even a realistic scenario.  We are also presented with some random scenes of the kid's friends' friends and a random random little girl. The girl's boyfriend doesn't even get to come around, and he is in a wheelchair. We find the other kid dead and his friends' mom is in the room and the girl's mom is crying, and the scenes show his mom repeatedly trying to get the girl to make it harder for him, and his mother tries to prevent him from killing her. But the ending is just about a quick, pointless fight between the cop, cop, and a bunch of other people. The end is not really believable and the next two films after are all over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand why this film would be considered so good. There are so many bad jokes in the first act that it seems like the writer wanted to write a parody.  If you think these jokes were funny, then you are only kidding yourself. A real laugh is when you watch one of the jokes. It would have been so good if they had made the movie as funny. It has the same attitude, too, that you get a laugh and you start wondering if you should laugh. The dialog in the other scenes is pretty poor. The characters are bad, too. Some are pretty good, others are pretty bad. The music is pretty bad, there is no music in the whole movie. But the jokes are pretty funny. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like this crap I mean I didn't like the first episode because i liked the first one...but the first movie was great anyway... I don´t like this episode anymore. I don`t know why why this guy does not want to write a positive review about his movie. I think he should really make it a movie about how stupid people are making these movies. I really need to say: don´z i mean if you want to go on to the movie and try this movie, you will die in the process. Don´t say that if you are going to see this movie and want to see a funny movie, please don´n just sit, watch it and enjoy it as it was meant to be a horror movie...and don´teacst any funny crap movies...for this movie i didn´t think so much about the jokes, the movie was just stupid. The movie is also boring but at least you can understand the message behind the movie. The characters don´sble really stupid...just watch this movie as just another horror movie, don´ttt try to see it and think about how it could have become such a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see one movie that isn't too long. I was curious to see a lot of people on the internet commenting on this movie. I just got off from an evening at a nightclub in Miami to watch this movie and I can tell you it was bad.  I would suggest those who have not seen it are watching it because it is a really awful film. The acting is bad, the editing is bad and the story is not a good one. In short, if you want to be able of a good movie, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been here since 4 years ago and this is still bad. I feel like this could have been the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm sorry for this movie. The acting wasn't funny at all, this movie was all so bad. It was so bad it looked like it was going to end with something. I wish I had my life and that they could put this over. This movie needs to be taken down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie was an interesting mix of songs. The story was pretty basic and predictable. It was pretty bad with the acting and the dialog, and I was sad for the whole time.  A real disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought that the director and writer had the idea. But the idea doesn't matter. The way to do it is not to try and kill our favorite actors or show them in a fake death scene, but this movie just proves that even if it could happen, there is no room for this. I really liked the film because it was funny, but the acting is not funny, and there is nothing in this movie that can be even mildly appreciated. Even if the actresses do some great acting, it would still not make the film any good. I understand that, but please keep off of it, as the director is obviously an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never really liked this movie and I am the only person to have seen it, so I give my review.  This film is the same as another of a series of movies with a theme of "Gem, aliens, and aliens" - so the idea of "Alien" is in the name, but the director is unable to convey any specific meaning.  They were obviously trying to come off as the main villains of a fantasy world, but at the same time, I can't really see how they could have succeeded. They all seemed very unassuming and there were no real purpose for doing this movie. The plot and actors were unbelievable and they were all unbelievable. The way they were going with these aliens was just ludicrous.  There is not much to go into this film, but if you get bored with it, watch it with your friends or something. The story is very stupid and the characters are terrible, and the director just cannot do a good job with the script.  I can only recommend you watch a movie with a more solid plot and character performances. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am ashamed to say that I liked this movie in the original. I thought that it was a good comedy at the time. When I saw it, I was appalled to find that it had so little substance. The director had done some good work with some of the scenes but that is what ruined me. The acting was very bad for this one movie.  This movie had a major problem because I think that it needs to be a comedy, but it is not one. It needs to have a punch in the nose. It must have some of that humor that it lost for the comedy genre, but not for this movie. It is a disappointment to all of us who don't like the humor that this movie has to offer.  It is an interesting and a boring excuse to waste a few hours on an hour. I don't see this movie for my entire life. It was a shame and a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the movie was somewhat predictable. But what made this movie so poorly liked was the lack of the real life story that could have been the basis for this film. We have seen it in many previous movies and movies and the premise is the same. If you are willing to watch this movie as it relates to the real world then you will be in for a disappointing ending. If this movie is going to be made again then the movie should have been titled "The Black Label." But unfortunately this movie had no such title and there would be no title for this movie. Also I think the casting for this project was very bad, there should have be better ideas to come out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was a disaster. I was surprised at the casting of the "great actor" and how they seemed to have not learned the basics of film making. I'm not going to comment on any of the good performances here, because they're better than all the other actors. What a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen several comments that this movie has ruined "Dirty Little Girl" as though it was a great film, but the one that I found most interesting is the one where the girls just sit in their seats looking at each other, looking at nothing else. I have also seen the very late review of "Sweetest Girl" (I think it was one of the best films of all time).  I know that this is an awful remake of the original. I really do hope that the film doesn't get the same Oscar nominations for "Dive". I hope that Hollywood gets some kind of help from the censors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dukes of the Earth" is just plain bad, I can't even think that "Horseman" would have been able to make a decent film, it has the obvious flaw of being stupid. But even without the obvious silly plots and pointless dialog, "Daughters of the Night" is still a very bad movie that just doesn't work. Even the title is pretty good, it reminds me of the silly "Narcia" that I always used when I used "Criminal Mind" for a joke. What the hell is this thing supposed to be? A film that is actually a movie? Of course it is stupid and does not work! It is just an old film about a bunch of people who had a terrible idea about how to kill a horse. It is hard to believe it to be a movie about a team of "criminals", and even if it was one of the most popular anime of all time, it is just a bad, pointless waste of time. The only saving point was the soundtrack track that I heard from a copy of the movie on DVD, which was very good. The soundtrack is pretty crappy, too. It just annoys me. I can only guess what the hell this movie was made for. The movie is so bad that if you want to get a lot of money, check out the Blu-ray version instead. If you are one of those people who cannot get mad about this, it will just be boring and have no interest to it whatsoever. As I said, if you think about the ending of the film, I would recommend checking it on the video for those "fun" scenes. Even if you were able to get the soundtrack, you would probably be bored and probably bored. As a whole, it does a decent job on one small plot. However, I do think that the soundtrack could be turned up for the "Horses" series which could be a good film for the kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know how a kid could get away from watching this movie... i mean the story is not what it is about. The fact is that the girl's boyfriend is a very weak and stupid guy. The whole movie seems to be a lot of stuff made up of a lot.  The girl starts off by showing the same attitude she gives out the whole time, and she starts off that way. It turns into a very boring movie. I think she might have gone off to an high school, and had just got over there. If you liked this movie then try a good movie: A Dark Song, it's about a good love story. That would be a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie to be quite a poor choice for one that it really wanted to be. What I would like is to see the movie make a comeback and get the cast back to their respective locations to face some serious obstacles and not to let this movie go. The acting is so bad it was annoying and the acting is bad it could be made up with a guy acting like it would in the original script. I don't know what the writer was thinking when writing this, but if you want to make it go, don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to give this movie a few points. You'd think more people would be at least one level of interest than this movie had, which isn't just because I'm used to most bad movies. It is about a few really bad actors (not only some decent ones but even more I would never like to see any actor as a victim), a really bad story line, and a really crappy script. But that's not the end of the story.    My favorite was the one where they are trapped in a mall. I really liked the ending. The mall was actually a little interesting. But, it was the last movie I watched.  The movie was definitely the worst one I have seen from the entire series. The acting was horrible and the direction and script is absolutely terrible.  This movie is still bad for the movie of the movie it's sequel. It was just a few minutes longer than the movie in its original self. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is badly filmed, is slow-moving, and has absolutely no plot whatsoever. It is also a bad film, so don't even rent it unless your dying, because, like most movies, it never starts to build up a sense of suspense, and it never really starts to move on a real plot.  There is no one else in this movie that could make this sort of film worth it for two hours, nor did anyone in this film seem to really care about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first installment I had seen this movie and was intrigued. As I've read a lot of the previous reviews, this movie was very bad, and its performance was really bad for an 8 year old movie.  I can say now that I only saw this movie 4 out of 10 times. I'm guessing that it's still pretty good for someone who has seen all of the TV versions of "Rampers" or "The Goodlands", and has little interest in any one. However, I'm unsure how this movie would have done in the case of this remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible, I think that is what it is. I would not recommend watching it, but I cannot recommend anything better than an awful film.  I think it's awful, don't want to see more films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just stupid. I'm not going to say it was funny, either the people who made it, or the people that made it. I didn't like this movie. I did like this film because I was in the theatre when it came out. It wasn't even funny and I didn little mind. I was really sad about it. It was just awful. It looks like a lot of money was wasted to make this movie and I was sad that I was going to spend so much money on it. There are more films that can have good lines but this movie was not one of them. It is just a movie that people just don't like. Don't buy it. The other problem is that the movie contains so many bad lines. The characters are boring and nothing has the potential to make the film funny or even funny. It's sad that the writer can't get much better. Donors beware of this movie if you want to see an amusing, action film. I wasn't in the mood to go to sleep with this movie, so I stopped watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that I watched this movie twice. I think it was bad because I thought it was better than my expectations. I know it was supposed to be the most hilarious film in the world. I didn't like it. I thought there was a little too much comedy in it and I didn\'t get much. I found myself laughing at the movie and was disappointed when I finally saw it. But since this is so bad, I couldn\'t even watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first viewing of this film was after seeing the DVD version of a movie I found for my kids.  In the DVD, the actress was gorgeous as the heroine who lives in a big city, with a good job for a city park.  She had two boyfriends, one who was a bad boyfriend who had an "extended" beard and looked a couple of years ago like a young man and a woman who had two kids. And what a horrible guy! She had three boyfriends. She looks like a real girl. The boyfriend with an "short hair" was the worst guy I have seen in a really good movie since this one. The other guy was a guy with a "full beard" and looked like he could get away and go on an adventure with her. But this is a classic Hollywood film, no plot and no actors.  The best thing about this movie is the special effects used to make the characters look fake.  This movie is so bad it makes you angry and really hard to watch. I have to end this bad movie ASAP. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie. I mean it has a cute story line, a cute, not-so-comfortinhed heroine who is completely oblivious of her surroundings. And all this is overshadowed by the fact that the movie never actually moves on to the actual plot.  But unfortunately, I was one of the only people who knew what the movie was about. That's the last thing you need to know.  So it's really disappointing to see this movie, the only good thing about the movie is the wonderful cast, and the interesting characters, especially the "giant" guy who is in fact a pedophosome or, as the title indicates, an assassin. But I give you an opportunity to have at least one or two good things on this movie because of the wonderful acting.  If you want to watch this movie for the sake of cheap laughs, don't. It's bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame to a movie: a plot that begins with an interesting premise and nothing much further than the first scene of the movie. I was expecting a movie that was a good one, but this one fails terribly. Some of the jokes are good, some are bad, and the actors aren't even good. Still, the movie could have been made a little less interesting and a lot of the dialog in this movie is stupid and doesn't make much sense.  I would rate this movie as one that should have been thrown out of the category of the lowest rated films in the genre.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was shocked when I learned how bad it was. I have seen several films that have been bad, but this was the worst. In any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that isn't even a good movie. It's boring, with almost no real plot. The ending is predictable, and the characters are all weak. I couldn't even come up with what the movie was about, and it's about 40 min. If you have the guts to finish the movie, please try and watch it, otherwise I don't think you'll get any enjoyment out of it. It is hard to find even one positive review about something bad, because it just sucks! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard any good reviews about this. The acting was bad, the storyline was bad. The dialog was stupid and the actors were simply not believable. The movie was simply a drag-on, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I cannot justify a 4/10.  I am not saying that the film is over-the-breath bad. But I am saying that this movie is a complete disaster. I would suggest watching it once, if you have anything interesting to do. But if you see it, don't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've seen. This movie was about the end of a year, and I would have been satisfied with a movie that could follow the end credits. Unfortunately, this movie failed to follow the ending. I saw this movie on the website and was outraged. I watched it again and I felt like I was watching something that was about to end. I couldn't sit through it and didn't even know what was about. And I'm sure you are wondering why this movie was rated 4.5 out of 10 because it's a complete trash movie. This was a very poor movie. I'm sorry, I'm very disappointed. I was hoping that it was a short film and I was thrilled that it ended. I don't understand why the producers chose to do this, but I just didn't think it was right. A weak, poorly made film is not worth a 10. I know they tried to avoid making this movie, but they did an awful job and made me angry. They should have spent more time making a decent film than wasting a few minutes of time on it. And instead of being able to complete it, they wasted so much time. The other problem is that it fails to take out all the elements of good directing, writing, sound, and writing style. It also fails to follow all the rules of good film directing. I think there's a lot of money left over by this movie that were wasted by a poor director who had nothing to do with a decent, low-budget film. I've never heard anything good about the movie in any interviews. But I thought it was good for a comedy, so I'm hoping it will be well reviewed and if not, I'll watch it again. I feel it is about as bad as this movie could have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got so annoyed that I started on an account: "Why don't they fix this movie?!" Well... I got this one. I don't know what happened to me.  I did, but it looks like I have it.  Anyway, I have never heard this in the first review.  "Why?" I ask. They say, because the actors were supposedly correct. Well... they were not correct.  Well, I don´t like to be angry at actors and actresses who don´st know what is happening. But this is, and it´s terrible.  The story isn´t all that serious. The character actors could not even do their own script. There´s no reason to have the same characters as the same.  How would anyone think that a man was taking this movie seriously? I hope they are correct, because when it is time to make a sequel to the movie, I will make some of the same plot in the sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was so bad that it was absolutely impossible to believe that the actor was actually acting. I can not even count the low budget for the first few episodes. One of the worst things about this movie is that the voice cast is so bad, that the actors are so bad they won't even make the slightest effort to act. I believe that most of the actors on the show really sucked and the actresses who made their roles were better than a mere performer.  I really despise this movie because it is so terrible, even worse than the worst movie I've seen. The acting is bad, the dialog is awful, the camera work was awful, and the sets were terrible too. There is only one good movie in this series and it is absolutely horrible. The plot is weak, and it's not good when you know it's about the end of the story. The movie was good for the beginning, but unfortunately, it wasn't good for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning of the story the characters are very normal and normal, but as the story progresses they become more and more ridiculous. It is obvious that the people living in the community are just waiting to be put to bed and they are afraid to see the police. It becomes obvious to me that these characters would not act properly and have nothing in common with them.  There is a very disturbing scene in the last scene in this movie. It starts out very serious and then suddenly becomes extremely annoying and stupid. I cannot put it down for that bad movie, but I will say that it should be avoided. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't see anything good coming out of this piece. Some good performances, some good cinematography, some interesting characters, and some interesting sets. But it fails to deliver anything that justifies a sequel. I give a bad performance because it is very hard to get what this film is trying to do.  So my thoughts are these, as a former "Director" of the movie, and as a viewer.  The first thing I thought when seeing the film was that it was a terrible script. There was no indication that the movie was actually interesting, and there were no decent actors, either. The other thing I noticed, is that the actors are not good actors. It is just about as terrible a movie as it can get.  I thought that they were trying to create a comedy with a lot of comedic jokes and make it funny. They were getting into their comedy routine, but it wasn't working. If they are going to create comedy, they should have spent at least as much money as they made to make it, since they could have easily done a film of theirs that had a few laughs. This movie failed because they wanted to keep the humor going.  It is absolutely horrible, and I give this movie an F. The rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, you probably have a sense of humor. The movie is an effort to be funny that's not funny. If the movie is supposed to be a comedy, I can't imagine it to be anything more than an attempt to appeal to people.  If this is supposed as a comedy or an "comedy" then why is it so stupid? It's just plain ridiculous that it could possibly be a funny story about a man who is crazy.  I don't even care for that. If you were going to watch this to see if you have a feeling of seriousness, like if you were an actor, then it would be hilarious but probably not funny unless you are a genius. There are a couple of bad scenes throughout the movie. There's not too funny to be scary but it's not so funny when I really get it.  There's a little too long. I think the main reason this movie has so few laughs is because it doesn't really have the same sort of atmosphere as most comedies and movies and this movie just never had the ability to deliver laughs. There were two good scenes in the movie but the movie really didn't do anything with humor. This is really a bad comedy that never has a plot or plot. It's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a pity is this movie, and what a pity the acting was, and the ending. They are all terrible actors and I cannot believe they are supposed to have anything to do. I am sure they will never win anything and if you have any problem with them don't even bother them because they are so unbelievably awful. I think I have seen this movie twice in the first 40 years, and that was about four years ago. I don't know why this is so much hyped. There are no good actors in this movie and just bad actors. I also think that there should be a movie like this one. I'm just sick of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really terrible movie, I've never laughed in a comedy movie like this before, let alone this one. It's an hour long, one minute of video, and I am dying to see it fail. It was absolutely terrible and I'm so embarrassed. If you really want to see the movie in a time, go with your friend to see this movie at the theater, not rent it, but for the next time, I'm sure you'll end up hating yourself in a movie just as horrible as this. I don't know if I was one of the most "involuntary" viewers, but I know that I am. I hope that the "revelation" is not a total disaster, but a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read several comments online about this film. Some have said "that it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. I find it extremely weak, and even worse in the end. I believe this movie is an example of the "Walking Dead". I'm hoping it's better than the original Walking Dead film from 1990. The original Walking Death (also known as the Walking Dead series) is a horror film, but I do like what Walking Dead is doing. It's a story of a group of people trapped in a city on the edge of civilization, or on their way to a new location, and when they attempt to escape, they're killed by zombies. The sequel takes place on the same city, but it's much less exciting and less "sooner" than the first Walking Dead. I've not found a good description about the film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad. The story line was the problem. The characters were boring, and there were no real story to tell. The actors did not act well and none of them were funny or good in their acting. The acting was horrible, and I believe the director who made it must have suffered some of the depression he was suffering when he made it. He made it a very bad movie, in fact, I think it was made worse than many of the films made in the west. This was probably made for a laugh, but the only thing I ever did laugh at was the fact that the movie ended up being a cult-film. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only reason I get from that is because I liked this in the '90's. And I hope this movie doesn't become a cult following the current run of the "Big Bang" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie. If you actually enjoyed it the first time it was good, because you really had to. But now it just sucks so badly, it is boring and predictable, which is the reason why it is not even more popular than one of the "Black Mirror" movies.  My bad impression of this film was the fact that I was so interested to see this film, considering it was my first time. But after seeing it again for the first few hours of film, I started to really hate it. I'm sure most of the people that saw it, like it because it's good, and I hope the movie is at least interesting. But for all I know, it's not as good as the TV show. It lacks an interesting storyline, and there is no good dramatic scenes.  A few of the actors in the film have interesting roles, such as the girl in the kitchen or the person who runs the phone booth, but most of them are just characters. The actors don't get the scenes and plot they are given so that they are free to act in the world, which makes the movie worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd never had a "Carnage" series before, so this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'd like to see some decent action movies in the movies that have some plot. I've been watching these movies for years and didn't get bored. I just want to see this movie to be the worst of the horror genre.  There's nothing in this movie that even remotely makes me laugh, even if I'd been looking for "Curse of the Devil" to get bored, the movie itself was funny, and the acting is stupid. I know there were better movies out there but this one was pretty crappy.  All in all this is a poorly executed "Cursed Action". I was expecting to see something better. I can't say that much has been said about it...  It was absolutely bad... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie fails to be funny. I've watched it three times and it's not funny. And I'm glad I did not watch it when it was actually shown on HBO when they made it. The acting was bad, the characters were not funny, and the dialog was really awful. This movie also had a very stupid, over-the-top director. What I'm talking about is that the producer is in on too much of the blame for the overall ineptitude of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a really bad movie, and I'm not even sure that this director had any interest in making a film that was even remotely enjoyable. However, the fact that the film is so poorly written, filmed, and acted like a bad comedy is only in itself reason enough to be the worst movie ever to be made in existence. The fact that I could have had more interesting jokes in the film than any of the jokes that we heard. Of course, I don't believe that this film was actually terribly funny, but it did remind me of the first time that I was truly interested in this movie. I found the jokes less amusing than the jokes themselves, and as soon as I was bored, the jokes were actually getting old. As soon as the movie had gotten so bad, the film was no longer enjoyable, and eventually I gave up watching it again. The film is no longer funny, even though it's still funny. The only people that are funny are those that write and direct the films. If you want a comedy that is actually funny, you'll definitely have to get a second look, otherwise, the comedy movie just won't be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two things in this movie that made it so horrible I'm not even sure why. There's not even a single plot line or a clue for the plot. If you're a kid, you'll be lost and that's enough for me to be a bad person. There is no real suspense whatsoever, the characters aren't believable or even one-dimensional and there are so many false moments. It is very hard to believe anything that's happening in this plot, although you get the sense of how things are going. There are also some very bad jokes about the people on the set and there is absolutely no way to get anything of value out of this movie. I'd recommend the kids of "Cave of Deceased". I've read about "Cree-de-Lane" and they are always so funny, just because of the acting and bad dialogs. The people who were on the other side weren't in this picture but there is a sense of urgency to this film that has really ruined my life on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't imagine anyone who's got this movie to have a decent, decent finish. The acting and music was absolutely awful, and the plot seems to be about a simple, revenge fantasy. If you have nothing to do with the story, don't waste your time watching this movie. It's not worth your time, you won't enjoy it, but don't let the bad acting keep you from starting to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the original, the premise of the movie was really good, if you can stomach the plot. But here, it is totally predictable and predictable. The story is about the evil king who wants to get all the powers and to get into the power of the world and to become a god. But after he gets into the throne, things go wrong. The whole thing becomes a plot about how the characters are going to get to the point where they can no longer keep making money. And the plot is simply...that boring.  There are so many issues with the characters and the story. We have a long time to talk about that, so don't watch if you are desperate to see this movie for a long period of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this film in the video store on Christmas Eve and I was so disappointed. It really didn't work as a movie, really didn´t work as an action film.  I don´t even really believe it was the original film of its own. I think that a lot of the acting was terrible, and I think the people who made it were just getting the wrong result of what happened in the film. Also, I don't really care what the acting in the story is, and that is where I´m in conflict. But if you think the movie is good, then you´re in for a long time, because they are acting in a way that they are going to make it seem like a "true story". They really don´re acting the opposite way. Also they weren't in the same manner that they made the first one, which is just like "what if people killed the main characters?" That is all in my opinion, and don´ble with me. They should have spent an hour to try and get some of the dialog and performances that they´re going to get here. The dialogue was very bad, and the acting and dialog was very poor. I am so sad, and this movie will never get to be made. They don´s make so many things about a movie that they just make it look like a movie. They make so much effort to create a story that they can´t understand and can´d think about. They just make everything so complicated so that the audience is overwhelmed by things they don´take into the movie. Also a lot, they make a lot about the characters that they want to keep in a relationship. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in the UK and this movie is the worst I've ever seen. I can only recommend people to avoid this movie. I had to sit through some of the movie to make it an hour long and I'm now looking at it again. Its just sad! It looks like it is on purpose, and there are some moments of comedy, but there is no funny scenes to be taken out of context. I find it very sad that you can watch this film and only at one or two points will you realize that it is bad. I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is obviously an insult of people who were able to take it seriously. What they do with this movie is nothing but a simple plot of the old movies. The plot is a little predictable, and nothing about it is interesting. The characters, however, are very annoying. I have never seen a movie that could not stand one second. And even if you can watch it in some of the later '70s films, there's no way you will be able to really appreciate what it is about. It's awful to watch, and the acting is the worst I've seen. There are no clues as to how the plot is supposed to happen.  I'd like to see some of those old movies where people were actually interesting, but not in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think it will get much praise for being the bad movie of the year. Even if you're a diehard fan of the show, it would be impossible to enjoy. I mean, they're bad! So bad that it's hilarious and terrible. But you don't have to like the show to get any enjoyment. The plot is mostly laughable, and some of the acting is OK, but I don`t believe the guy actually cared. It's probably just an excuse to stick in a car with a bunch of weird and stupy characters. A few good things about the show: I was a bit surprised at the ending. But hey, at least I got it. The movie looks well written and there were some interesting plotlines, but there were so many repetitions that you just don't care. I didn't know what the heck this guy was talking about.  The show is just a few episodes of a very unconnected and poor TV show. I can`t say I`re enjoying it, but that's not really a bad thing. It may just be a bit too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Don't get mad at the people in the movie because it's okay. But don't be upset at the movie, because it`s just a bit funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad in every way. The people in the movie were so mean and had little respect to the rest of the actors. If you watch it and then come out with a nasty smile on your face. You might start laughing. This film is also just so bad that it doesn't seem like a comedy. I am sorry, if I was one who didn't laugh.  I'm not a movie expert, but i know this movie doesn't really have any comedy worth of your time. I would recommend this movie as a horror film, because it is so awful. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see another film that doesn't have a comedy in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I'm Sorry" was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story was interesting and the music was good but the acting was awful. The voice talent was bad but the music (for a few weeks) was good. There were no songs, the soundtrack was bad, and the special effects didn't do anything that seemed to have any effect. But I think it had some of the best sound effects in the entire movie. So the movie is only rated 4. I can't find anything wrong about it. I think this movie should probably be a 1. Don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie because it was so badly directed and produced. I mean it's an awful film and I don't like it because it's so bad. But it has been released, it hasn't got any other decent features, it just had to come out. It has to suck when it's released, I hope the writers/directors will get some jobs when they come in town on the set to the next big shoot. I don' think that movie should be banned for a few months before its release so I can find some movies which do the job better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is the most awful thing I've seen so far. I'm going to give my rating. It's a pretty average horror flick, that has the same "so" that usually precedes a movie. What a terrible thing. It starts off nice, but really doesn't take itself seriously. I mean it had a couple good moments, but when it's not funny, it just becomes dull. I just don't think this is a good idea. If you want to get a horror flick with a decent plot, don't go for something like "Death Zone" or something like this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so bored and angry. This film was pretty terrible, it was horrible, and I wanted it to be better. I have never watched this film, ever since I saw it, but it must be like something off of an awful porn flick. The main storyline was predictable, and the plot was a little bit predictable. But my only point of contention is that the director, George Powell, was so stupid to use his talent for this. The only reason I saw this film was that it was the most horrible and offensive sex film I have ever seen. It could have been better. But it was just awful! It could be a classic, if you can control yourself with these stupid jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i found myself watching this film in 2003, on a late night. I thought it was hilarious and I thought the director would be a genius at producing movies. Unfortunately, it turned into the worst film I ever saw. The main story is an outrageous plot that consists of several plot lines that were literally ripped off from the original screenplay. There is one plot line that was pretty good, and there is a whole new plot line based on this one. It's bad, really bad, and if you haven't seen the original script, then you're going to find yourself reading it. But you can see it on the video, and it will be extremely hard to watch. Don't watch this unless you're bored with the original film. Otherwise, if you think you're a fan of "WASHA", watch it for a funny film that has the same comedic value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was pretty good, but it really doesn't work. The plot is stupid, and the acting, which was very good, was overshadowed by the stupid acting and the awful acting. There is nothing decent here and there are some really bad jokes. There are two scenes where the actors have an unnatural look, and they are totally bad. The acting is just plain awful. There were very good performances by Michael Clarke Duncan and Peter Blandy, but both of them are acting in this movie. The ending was alright, but the ending was pretty stupid as well. It's a complete disaster and has to be canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie and wondered how it had to be rated. I figured the film could be rated any number for its own. I then wonder what the writer thought. This is the worst movie ever I have ever seen. This movie is about a couple of characters who supposedly have never encountered each other and who are supposed to meet for the world. The only one who actually meets them are the people who meet the other characters. But let's not kid it. In no way does the characters in the film look attractive. How do the people look? Some who look just like they want to be victims. What the hell do they think about them? I think the actor's make a joke about the movie. How can a bunch of men who do nothing seem appealing and look good to the world have a wife? Well, the people are stupid enough that they can't see the world for a reason. If the characters are nice, I would think they would be interested in their spouses. The acting is bad and some of the voices are annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a great chance for an interesting movie, but it fails to be interesting. The film is really the worst. Most of the "Halloween" movies were entertaining, but the plot is really stupid and the film really sucks. It is an incredibly bad movie. The main characters are not good actors; there is an awful acting and some terrible acting. I give this movie two stars out because of two of the main characters. Even when the acting is good, the film still is not good. The cast is bad, but that's not enough. It really has a bad, lazy storyline, and the characters are boring, but they are fun to watch anyway.   The film starts off with one interesting scene (like in "Death Night") which is a huge mistake.  I'm sorry, I'm not going to watch this film again, but I'm hoping it will eventually get good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I think is that this is a low budget film, because it lacks a meaningful story. What does it lack? It's about a group of people who meet up in the middle of the night, who fight about how they're gonna die, and how they'll live in their bodies. That's it, but that doesn't make for a full hour. A short story about a bunch of teens who meet and fight with each other, who are there on their day of graduation. What's that about? There's no dialogue, and you never really understand what the characters are doing. What is it that makes for a decent film? Why was this supposed to be a film? There are scenes that are just pointless, but those of them are also too brief. It is just there. What really is the point? There is a whole lot of people here who just got a bad video tape of a movie: bad music, bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad writing, and bad casting. This film could have been put out for the kids who don't watch too much, like the ones who made this film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see a movie that has been designed and manipulated to fit the viewer's expectations then this movie is for you. I've read the reviews and my answer is,  What a bad review this film is. It fails to stick to its true intentions.  The story is completely false. The ending, which is set up with a 'head in the dust' type twist ending (like it was supposed to be a real film) seems to be the way it would have been.  I don't see this movie being made to be funny. The whole point is to make it easy to have a "joke" movie. The film is not funny nor entertaining, in my opinion. It is just plain bad.  It should have been in the 70's.   I give this movie two stars because I don was one of the people who watched this movie and laughed while we were watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard of this movie before, but it's been one of my favorites on the Internet.  The acting is terrible. I can't believe the person in the film is acting. I mean she looks like the character from "Die Hard". Just for that alone! I wish the actors were more believable than what they had in "DieHard" and "Dirty Harry" that would still be able to fight the tough man that had a beard on and not have a gun on his side.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10 for not being able to kill anyone. The ending should have been more dramatic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to spend some time just looking at the first reviews on the film, and it just didn't seem fun.  I'm not a fan of this movie and if I'm being very honest I'm the worst person to go to watch this film, but the other reviewers seem to like it. I can't fault them, but they have absolutely zero justification for making the film look good, let's say that.  If you liked "Piper Carrot", you'll enjoy this movie. If you hated "Morky Piggy", don't even waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major failure. I cannot recommend anything that is not for those who cannot see the movie. I can see it online but I cannot believe this film is being shown by a reputable theatre in Australia. I am sure those on board with this film do not have any intention to see it. The story is badly structured, there are weak actors and no good ones to the point of it. I would not recommend this movie unless you have no interest in watching a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone is reading this, be warned that this film is about as good as a 10 to 15 minutes of real life on the screen. If you are one of those who just can't stand this kind of nonsense, then perhaps this film isn't for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  This movie is about a kid who wants to go back to the city and meet his dad, so he does his research under the stairs of a building. It turns out that he has the ability to teleport with his father.  The kid is so scared that he refuses to go out and goes into a bank to get some money to go home. But then he is scared off.  I didn't like it. It made me really angry that I found myself watching it and didn't care about the movie.  What a bad piece of work. I'd recommend skipping it, and just skipping the whole movie. I think they should call it "Doom 2" instead of "Dome 2". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is the worst film i have seen since the 90's. even the best ones, like "Rock & Roll" have their flaws. this one falls flat for a lack of even a decent plot. the soundtrack is about 20 minutes of garbage, it is no longer than 20 minutes before and the dialog is awful. it seems like the film was made for children or teenagers. the main characters are terrible, I'd like to see something better out there. the actor/actress isn't even worth doing this film, and it's also about time, it could have been better before it's in it's infancy. I would definitely take my computer from the movie to the toilet tank, this is like a bunch of junk. I hope the filmmakers make good, but it's too bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie about a little boy who has grown to hate all of the things that are supposed to be in the movie. He does something that gets him into trouble, even though the rest of the show is good.  The rest of his life is basically a disaster. Everything seems to be a bit worse than in the first film, and I think it could be better, but I don't think the actor is being able to make it.  I just can't get over what the problem is. It's a complete mess, it doesn't come together. And I think the producers just weren't able to do anything decent with it. But the movie wasn't bad, it just got way too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story begins, with some surprising twists. One person is called the father of a woman in a house. After a major car accident, the woman is trying to get home. A few days later the wife is dead, dead in a terrible way... and her husband is about to come along with the police. The wife had never told her father about what happened in the house - but his father does. He tries to get the cops to bring the man out. The story goes on for weeks. By that point, I was wondering whether anyone actually understood it - and the ending is even worse.  I'm not going to try to write out this one, but I have done. I've given myself the title "The Car Crash. You'll See What You Need To."  The ending is a one-sided story of the wife's dying and the man's life - and it is actually pretty good. Unfortunately, the movie does not work at all - it is an obvious ripoff of the "Honey" song. There are not enough songs to make up for the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has to be the biggest in bad movie series for years. It looks pretty good as a movie, but it just has absolutely no idea what it's about. The idea of this movie is so preposterous that I cannot even understand it. There are many of the characters that are supposed to be in the film, and they are just so unfunny that I can't even remember them. The story, about this movie, is so poor and boring. I was really hoping for something better. That's all you have to do is to watch it and then wonder how it could have gone. It is simply a waste of your time. The actors, in contrast, are actually good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad for a lot of reasons, and not in an honest way. I don't think there's enough of a plot in the film to be good, and some of the locations and acting have really left some of us confused. But this is a pretty disappointing film with no plot, no character, and no really good acting. I just found it by a YouTube search, which is a mistake for anyone who's not familiar with the storyline, and I'm sure it's even less enjoyable than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is a bad film. a director can't make an original film anymore and I'm sure this is too much of a story for one guy.  it was an interesting film, but its only 1/10. I would have to see it again and hope there is more to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In any movie which is one thing you don't like, and the first half of it is not good. If you watch this movie, please do not watch it, as you will not like it. The two main plot points were an "hairy boy" trying to get revenge on the "hasty" witch, and a witch who was trying to teach him everything he needed to know. There was absolutely no drama whatsoever. In fact, the whole movie was a drag-back gag. I was so bored watching this movie that I only laughed at the end, but the movie is pretty good, although it was made as far as the story goes. I really just wish I hadn't been bothered by this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't really blame a person who made this movie, but I do. This movie is bad! It is not worth a movie. The acting is awful and there is not even any plot! There is absolutely nothing about this movie that can be good. If this movie were to be good, it would be good! But, that is not the case. The movie was not even funny!  I have nothing for this movie. I just watched it and could not even get much out of it. But, I did find it amusing. It was just not funny. It's really sad that this movie has run out. It has been put on a DVD in 2010. It is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of this movie, it looks interesting and maybe even funny. I was a little bit surprised to find it had been released in 1993, and then, when I discovered it on YouTube I was taken aback by its rather unbelievable lack of polish. It is almost impossible to recognize the most obvious of its defects. The story is very poor, and the acting is weak and not strong enough. I think I found it so bad it could be better at some other movies. In any other context it just doesn't hold its own. The only thing that kept me watching it was the laughter for its absurdly low-budget and stupid premise and the fact that the other people who saw it knew nothing about it.  The only redeeming factor I found was the very low-tech jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got so angry at the whole thing that it is so bad, I'm so sick of it. It looks like a parody of 'Dino's The Last Action,' I guess that's why I liked it so much. However, I was wondering what was it about? It was a 'Disco's Last Action' film.  What was this? Well, apparently, it is also a 'Krazy Katzers,' though I can't remember who they were.  But, let me make it even easier to find it on Amazon, so I gave it the name, 'Kung-Fu.' I am not a big movie buff. I didn't even go out to the theater and go out. (Even though I think I have seen more than a dozen of 'Kang-Fu's' over the years.) So, as I was searching Amazon for the 'Kong-Fu' I was looking at this movie as my reference for another movie, and when I saw the movie I was absolutely disinterested. I was very upset about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My impression of "Gentlemen's Creed" is that it had little to say about the "war" that would follow.  It is absolutely pointless.  There are so many ridiculous moments that I can't even bother commenting on it. But I still gave it one chance to make my point.  So here I propose a different, but equally unrealistic interpretation. We'll try to go off on that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was one of the worst movies ever made. I thought it was the second best i've ever seen. It sucked me off. I have seen it for the first time ever and I have to say that i have to see it more than once just to see what was the least interesting. I can tell from what i know from the original that it is stupid, stupid, and stupid! It would take your breath away from your mouth. It starts with an absurd ending with a guy running around with an "Honey" like mask. It is an awful movie that just goes straight out of nowhere and starts making a bunch of jokes at the very end. If i had a kid with a large beard and could really fly, i would recommend this for those who could watch it in 3D and see how you fell in love with the fact that it was just one of their first video rentals. If they want to watch it, don't. This movie is way worse than I think it could be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it. However, the acting in this movie is horrible. I can understand the acting here because the character(I suppose) does some good stuff in the movie. Unfortunately, the scene with the bad guy was the worst I have ever seen. I remember the scene when my friend got home and was shocked to find a man on the subway with his head in the trunk. It would be interesting to see it again. But alas, it's too late for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised, after seeing this movie, that I could be surprised. I was stunned and appalled by this movie. I find that this movie is so stupid that it shows the entire premise of the movie as a joke. And I find the acting to be very low budget. The actors are very unappreciated, with a lack of any interest in acting. Even the actors are so stupid and stupid that you can't believe their acting. The movie also shows us all, from the "crisis" to the "joke" to some minor character! It is sad, that such a low-budget movie never existed. The producers don't bother to change the storyline, or even change the script, the only thing that was interesting about the movie was the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm shocked to see this film on the second try. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. It is probably the worst thing I have ever seen, or ever seen...ever. I don't know if I'd have the stomach to watch it again, but it was so bad that I was glad it would never get any traction. There were no scenes at all. There wasn't even an ending. And when I finally got through to finish watching it I was very disappointed in the ending. This movie's main problem is that the director didn't know what the hell it was. It turns out to be a bunch of cheap horror flicks. The acting is bad, the acting is poor, the direction is bad. I hope you find a good way to watch this, because you'll know it is not a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply terrible, because it fails to deliver any type of entertainment. The acting is not good, the plot is very simplistic, and the special effects in this movie were extremely bad. Also, there are no jokes whatsoever and there are too many fake/fake/fake scenes in the film. The music and the soundtrack are good though but that does not prevent this movie from making you bored. I would avoid this movie if you can't get into the story. The ending is just a very poor excuse for a film about a love story that really needs no story, and I honestly think the director should take some time to get the story out so the audience can actually get into it. Otherwise, don't even spend the time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be an insult to the American people, the most loyal citizens of the country. It shows no respect. It is an insult, and a poor, dull way to kill off the people in the world. This movie is nothing but a garbage piece of crap. This is also a very bad movie that can be categorized as a film. There are few things in this movie that I like, but they are too brief. This film is a waste of money, and it doesn't follow any sense of realism at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like it. But I still think the plot was good. But the ending was too predictable. The music was OK, but the characters were awful. The plot was totally nonsensical, which caused me to hate it, especially when I had a good movie coming out. The cinematography was OK. It wasn't a bad film, but it didn't seem like a good film. I could tell that the acting was terrible, but there wasn't enough room for that. I think this is one of the worst movies of all time. I'd never seen this before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is simply a really bad film. It is absolutely awful and there is no way of being an intelligent person. I've never seen such a low-budget film.  I am a former friend of the "Mad Dog", and so I saw this film on the day after my 30th birthday (a friend was there on that day, but never went), and it seemed to make me sick. The acting is so bad, the characters are so unfunny, the dialog is so poor, and the acting is completely incoherent. I was shocked that a "Mad-Dog" has the same director (Steven Nessler), who made "Madness" (1958), is now directing this trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the chance to rent this one again when I saw it in its original run. I have never seen a bad comedy/comedy/romedy, this movie has some of the worst scenes and worst acting. Its really embarrassing to see what is supposed to be an excellent film, it's hard to understand how it got this far to an 8 or 9. And I don't know if anyone was planning on watching this. It really does not seem like a comedy, I don`t know if it was intended to be a comedy. Its just the kind of a bad joke/romie that's poorly acted/written/written. What is the point? What could have made this movie? The message is not about a specific movie, but about how this country really sucks at everything they have got. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was based off of a movie made in England (with an interesting name) and also a movie in Los Angeles, that I think is quite uninteresting. They were so bad that I could only imagine how it could have made this one of the worst movies of all time, and it was not even good. I guess it's a matter of taste - the film was so terrible that it ruined everyone's taste of anything. It could have gone to a bad reputation, but considering the director had done good work - this would have been a very bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the movie, the actress plays on a "game" with an evil demon and his sidekick. He is trying to get a demon in the game and a human into the game as his opponent. The human has a power that makes him think he will gain an advantage over the demon's magic. This is because the human has his own demonic powers.   He's also supposed to be a very successful man. But it's about as good a movie as you'll get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what this movie is about - I think it's the same as a soap opera that was supposed to be scary, so I guess it's like a horror movie where you watch your father's teeth fall on you and watch your teeth fall onto your brothers.  This movie doesn't even make sense. It should've been a horror film! I've never seen a movie that so bad it has left people screaming in the kitchen. The movie is so bad that it has got everyone involved in it, and it shows no respect to people who really want to see horror movies. The worst part of this movie was that the entire movie is pretty cheesy, but it really should have been better than the last one I saw. If you like horror movies you might even enjoy this movie, but you don't like horror films, and you shouldn't even be interested in a horror flick.  Don't even bother watching this if it's not for a family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be just plain bad. The acting and acting were okay, and the plot was somewhat entertaining, but the director's idea of making a "horror movie" is a complete disaster. The ending was obviously designed, but it wasn't all that great. I'm sure the director probably wanted to make this movie as a "graphic horror film" but since they did that it wasn 'just' a horror film. Some of the characters are even worse than in a horror movie. You never know what is happening in the future.  The direction is not good either, as the writer is clearly out of his favoritism for the book, which I have nothing good to say about. The actors don't get the best roles, and it is really annoying to see the acting that gets it. The dialog isn't good either and really made the movie worse.  I just want to see more of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell what this movie has been programmed. I had to take it to see if it'd make it into a good movie. I couldn't believe it. And I can hardly believe it when I watch it. I mean, I'd like to see something that would make me cry.  There is not one good thing about it. It's so weak, it's so poor, it isn't funny at all, and it's not well-directed. A lot of my friends are saying that it's a stupid movie, but I'm not one of those people. It should have been in one of these teen comedies, like "Barbie & Brie". A lot is left out of it, but if you just want to laugh it, then you'll enjoy it. The acting is so bad that I didn't even laugh. I'm really not sure if I laughed at this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a pretty boring, stupid movie to watch. I didn't care about the story in the movie - and I would not have thought that this would have had anything to do with it. I was expecting a lot more from it. The story is pretty vague and the acting is not good. The movie is so bad that I could never finish watching it. Its not funny and its not funny at all, the acting in the plot is so poor that I cannot even recognize the characters, they all look the same. It would have been interesting to see some real actors like Richard Belzer and Elizabeth Van Kampuc - but not as good as the ones in this movie.  The last thing I would like to note is that I liked the movies in the movies that have much better scenes, and this movie did not have any scenes. That's the only good thing about the movie. If you want to see a movie that is totally useless, don't look at the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really sad to hear it was never broadcast. My impression of this film is that it just went straight to hell. It was completely unsatisfying, with every plot, none of the characters are really that good. The acting wasn't even good, or even that good in the beginning. I thought the film was pretty silly, and I would like to say this movie is like a sitcom, but I'm not saying that because the story itself was funny. It just is not funny in any way. I understand that many of the "comedes" were in a similar style. The story itself is kinda laughable and there is no way to avoid watching it.  I hope this movie does not see the light of the future and we don't see this movie being like the worst film ever made. It may get released in the future. But I would avoid it because this movie has a lot of good parts in it. If you have time, check it out, if you have a spare, don't waste it. This is only about 30 minutes to a film, and it could be better at 35 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie because it was the best horror movie I ever saw at the time. I really didn't like it. It was very predictable and very stupid. But I saw it because it's a movie about people who just want to be scared. And I didn't think I'd like it, because what could be more frightening? How could this be the way it is? Is it really about people that want to keep up a pace with each other? I thought.  It really had a lot of annoying parts. The characters were really not likable, and the actors weren't that good. But if you got a zombie flick, the only thing I was interested in is the new kind of zombies. I didn`t even want to see it after the time it comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, the good news was that I could finally watch "Sick" again...the worst movie ever I've ever seen.  I was actually shocked that I had to see it, and to be honest, I had a few good laughs. I found it to be more pathetic than the typical teen movie. But after being put off, I don't have to say that it was any good. I know that I'm not an adult, but that's what I was expecting. I hope I will find something better to watch out of this thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story is nonsensical, and I've never even heard that anyone knew what happened to all the characters involved. I found the plot a little interesting and the acting was good. But the acting is not even the worst, the dialog is so bad that I just turned off watching the film. The other problem with the film is that the acting appears to be totally inept, the acting can be weak at times, and there is no chemistry between the characters. But considering the talent and chemistry of all of the actors involved and the script, they can easily be good. Some of the dialog wasn't good, but at least it was entertaining to watch. However, it just took me out of the movie.  I cannot recommend this movie because it's not even worth watching. I'm not going to review this as a'real' film, just like watching a movie, but it certainly doesn't make the cutback I usually give myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am watching this movie because I was in the midst of the 'film festival' in LA (the film was made for the film festival). The movie was full of stupid lines that are nowhere to be expected from the original "Ghostbusters" movie. The movie is not about a comedy or even a funny movie, but I suppose there was one funny line for every film there was. There is no humor at all, this movie is simply a 'films' that's nothing like "Ghostbuster" which is about a family with three kids, a bunch of aliens who want to take on their own planet, a movie about a robot that gets killed in a race, and an animal that wants to be like a dog? There was no point, except that the animals were awesome. There was absolutely no point to watch this movie, it was just pointless.  What's a good movie: 3 guys from the other movie on the other site (that was the original) who get killed by a machine that's not actually a ghost, and the three guys on the same screen with a creepy little girl that wants them to kill. (okay, we know what a ghost is). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoy some good romantic comedies, but this movie is about nothing. I find that this is a bad version of "Pretty Woman".  I guess it is more a comedy than romantic. I don't know if it is supposed to be an honest-love film, but it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really have to say, this movie is so bad that it would be funny if I rated it for it. I have to believe that this movie wasn't that good. The plot is too weak to be believable, there is no explanation. There are no character development, there are too many jokes that are useless, there's no real connection to the main character, there the main female leads are completely bad. If you love movies like American Pie, This is the movie that you don't want. If a good movie is made with lots of comedy and not too much serious theme, It shouldn't be too hard to make this one. I've seen many movies made from the "Powers" movies. There is no comedy in them. I had to watch a few of those movies but they are OK, this one is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this movie was made in 1993! And that's not the only bad movie. If you had any idea that it was the same for me, you would have had to be more tolerant. This movie is not to be taken seriously. If I had anything in common with it, I would definitely call it a bunch of junk. It is not funny, nor is it good! It is boring, and it is not good. I really wanted it to go a few minutes longer and have the same effect. My favorite movie in Hollywood this year is "The Three Little Gods." This movie was way too long and is just plain boring and not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never expected this was the best movie I ever saw, not that it's a full of self-indulgent stupidity. The plot goes on far too fast to deliver a payoff, that is the only thing that made me have it. The premise is so weak that it gives up none of the substance of the film. All the major characters are pretty useless and all the female characters in the film are portrayed as over-the-top, unrealistic, and absolutely stupid. The only thing I can describe is the acting in this film. There are so many problems with the story, that it is hard to figure out what's happening, but the main characters have all sorts of problems with each other that all have serious consequences. It's a weak film, and don't expect too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was only a low-budget film to put it into the "category" but it did an excellent job in the end. The bad actors and special effects were poor and the direction was awful but I don't feel like any special effects. The music was interesting but I didn't feel any of the songs and that was very disappointing. But it's better than most of the horror movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a big time for it to get a rating. But it has to be rated. It has to rank 1.5. That's it. It's a disappointment. I cannot justify why someone should even care. I know the actors are OK. But they aren't the same as the ones I liked in the 'Beverages Of Heaven'. I think that would mean they were better. They weren't all terrible actors. Some were fine, just not as good as they were in the original series. And so I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see the original 'Boutes Of Heaven' then get this movie instead of watching it.  The actors have terrible accents. I couldn't even tell if the guy was acting in the same manner as he used to act when he was in the TV series. Some of them could have made the show better, but they did nothing to save this movie.  But it is a pity-the-work that gets rated. If I could afford it to someone I would really try to see it, but if it could be shown as a movie for children. If it would have a low rating because I would not like it to be shown to kids, then I wouldn't see it. I think the 'Ranger' series was so great that it would be able to stand up for itself. If the actor/the writer/director is good, then you're gonna like it. But if they are bad, or not capable, then they aren`t the same when they do their job properly.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about a bunch of old characters that have come back to live and wreak havoc. There's nothing in this film to take in seriously. It's not a good film, in fact.  But its a movie to watch for the fact that all these guys look alike and have the same hair. And some of them are from the same movie as the previous one.   And if you want to laugh at these guys, you should watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when I saw it on DVD. It was very uncomfortable, and when I made the trailer, I thought it was funny. But this film was so bad, that it was one of those "unnatural" films that I'd never heard about. It had absolutely zero appeal. It starts with a fake firecracker blowing through a bottle. That's it, and you're left to wonder how they'd even get it up in the middle of the movie. The acting was awful, the cinematography was bad, the dialog was terrible, and I'd like to see it again, but it wasn't funny at all. The whole movie could be improved by a better story. The best way to fight these things is to get your mind cleared out of the fear of making these films: 1) don't watch this film, or 2) watch it again and laugh. It doesn't matter what you do after seeing it; if you keep laughing, your brain will be distracted from your life and mind. I'd recommend a good laugh, even if you really are just a bit shy, because it's funny. The most annoying scene was when we were eating the cheese. The scene when they cooked it was so fake it made the viewer feel like they were eating it, it wasn''s funny. It really wasn't. They just laughed at the fake fire on the movie's screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very poor film has been released with one and a half at least. The acting is poor, the story is not interesting and the end is predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has no plot or interest whatsoever, just boring trash. I'm going to give you some spoilers in advance.  The acting isn't even close to good, not even the slightest.  But, the plot seems pretty good, if only for the ending. The film is about to be totally predictable, but if you go for some of the characters, then you will see them in their respective ways.  In a way, this film should have been titled "Shades" instead of "Dances", because they are both pretty good. But, in addition to the flaws in the movie, it fails to even make it seem interesting. There are some nice characters, but the actors don't have any real agency. They just look good, but not in a serious way. They aren't worth paying attention to.   Still, if you see it and think it's a great comedy, you will find it's boring, but I suppose you're going to enjoy the movie for a few minutes and then pass it off.  There are only a few decent characters. And they are pretty poor actors. And the main character, even at first, isn't very interesting. If you like it for the characters in the film, you'll probably get bored and move on to other films, so I recommend you look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie when I was 15 and was so disappointed, it didn't make any sense at all. I don't know why this movie has won the Oscar award for a bad film. It just doesn't make sense.  I would prefer to see a different film: A movie about the drug that causes AIDS, where you see some of the people who have AIDS in the movie. But this movie doesn't seem like a true horror.  This movie fails because of all the actors that appear in this movie. Some of the actors are OK, but this movie fails simply because the people with AIDS aren't interesting. I know that actors are not usually allowed to act with the same level of anger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, this movie is really just a horrible plot line of a shallow, predictable story. But it's not just a plot line, it's really bad. A typical story, you know. A cliché plot about a mysterious and somewhat sinister man. When you read the plot, you get the idea. How could they really be together? So, what a pity! It was so bad that I could never put this movie anywhere close to the top 5 for "Shrinking Shadows", though they were close together on their best day.  It wasn't until two weeks later that I was able to enjoy it again. Then I decided to go with my second choice, and was so bored that I'd forgotten my name and my ID card. But that was just the beginning. After all, there's something else I had to do.   "Shriking Shadows" is an insult to everyone who reads the book, the author obviously knows how much he and the other reviewers are enjoying this movie. And that's it. And I hate to say it, the movie is not that good. I hate people who complain about having been cheated.  But I also have to say, that I did enjoy "Shrift", so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing funny, at all. If you want to see an adult film of all the movies you might be a victim. But if you go to it, then that is only a small part of the film. It has all the mums, wives and mothers of the world. But instead of a lot of the dialogs that you might see in the first 10 minutes or so you get bored and the plot doesn't start to have something interesting. It's bad all for the actress. But I won't give you any more information. The film begins on a low note, then goes on a few minutes later, with a whole new set of dialog. That's all for you. If your interest in the film is for pure entertainment then go to this, but otherwise I would recommend this movie as an average schlock. You might also want to watch the movie as a 'adult film' but not as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think there should be a different kind of horror that's not a horror but is more like a horror movie, and not like a zombie movie. It's pretty bad for all the time, for that reason, as a horror director, I'm not that interested in this one, but I'll give the benefit of what it did have at least I liked it as a comedy, and I liked the idea of a zombie apocalypse but don't like it as entertainment; so don't expect much from this film. Also I like horror films, I like some of my genre, but when I watch a movie in which it's very hard to find something funny or even scary, even if it is good, my interest is overwhelmed by it. That's why I watched this horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was an interesting idea at the beginning. But it failed to gel in the real world. The whole thing was so contrived. A young boy, whom I had seen in the last two days, was thrown off. I can guess why they would have done this, but I really don't. It's a sick joke. I thought that they would at least have brought one of his relatives back to help him with the new movie. But, alas, they didn't. I had to sit on one chair and just look at his face to see if he had any idea what a gag it was.  So, I don't really care about what this movie was about, but it was one of those films I wouldn't watch, even if I thought it was a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete mess! The people who saw this movie were laughing their asses off. It's one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a long time. I was laughing hysterically during it. I mean, it was so bad that I really felt like punching the people who laughed and had a good time laughing. And, the movie doesn't even have some of the most interesting plotlines. This movie needs to be removed from the shelves for the sake of comedy. I give this movie an over-rated 7/10. I don't think it's possible to be funnier than I find in one of my all-star jokes. It seems like the only person who can laugh like you can laugh at is the one who is playing the main roles. If there were to be any improvement, they could make a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An awful film: it's a mix of old film stars, new talent actors, a new, seemingly original plot, and a new cast to the same old film. In addition to the terrible acting, the worst dialog in history, the only good parts are a series of scenes which take place in a bizarre hotel room. In the hotel, some of the characters, in the hotel room, appear to be having dementia, and the other actors appear to act in a very silly manner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the person who was so upset I had to take my wife out of the movie theater. I don't have any more complaints. The cast and crew were not good actors. This movie was badly scripted. It could have been made a much worse movie, even worse then The One Tree Hill, with its gorgeous cast of actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a fan of the old days when it was so obvious how to watch this film, but I don't expect it to be as funny. Even with this film I didn't really have a sense of what the movie is. In the beginning I was very skeptical about this film because of the lack of character and the story and, as a viewer, you don't know how to make sense of it. You would like to have a better story for it.  But if you are too hard on a movie like this, then don't watch it, because it's just one of the worst things I have seen in years. I am not sure if this film was a movie: the movie was designed by a different person and this is not a true horror film. I can't really believe it, and if I were to write it, I would be a harsher word to the people that like it. But if I'm a good movie, I wouldn't expect something bad, and they would enjoy it, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot count how much they tried to show me and the way that they tried. One thing that should be pointed out is that this movie is not an actual movie. The story is the same but the movie doesn't even show the people's reactions. It is one of the weakest movies I have ever seen. I would never recommend it to anyone. I just want to be able to see a real film that is just a bad attempt at realism. I will never like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was really going to like this movie. I thought. I was disappointed. This movie's only redeeming feature is a decent story line. I don't believe that a story line exists out of nothing. If so, how does it make any sense whatsoever? It also fails to deliver a decent storyline.  I give my condolences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on very early on and wasn't even bothered. However, it was so bad I had to think twice if I would even look at it. And, so I did. I'm not sure I have seen one decent movie of late 1993. It is such a bad. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Its awful! It is simply awful. I cannot recommend it because of the fact that it has been rated so low (4 out of 10), but there are two people to watch it and I highly doubt the rating of this film will hurt the mood of anyone who has the slightest interest. It was just bad! I don't even think it's a movie worth seeing but don't like it to be in any way. The acting was terrible and there are no redeemings. The plot is pretty bad and there is absolutely no motivation to the movie. I'd advise against even watching it. The best way to see it would be if it were for the other reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a result of the current state of the media and film industry, it is hard to believe that this movie is being sold as a true story about a true war between Vietnam and the North. In fact, the story's story does not actually tell us much about the true story of the Vietnam war.  A number of other important issues have been brought to light in this movie, but if you can't get into the story of that war, it's probably a very bad movie.  The story's storyline is very bad at any level, and the script is really bad. And I do not know what happened on the day the movie was shown, and there are no real clues. And although I am sure the film will appeal to some people who have not followed this story, it really just a bad film and doesn't give the viewer a true sense of the true nature of the war. You really need to be thinking about how the story could have been handled better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just another cheap and lame horror movie, the plot is not good and the cast is very weak. What a wasted year. I wish to ask myself why it has not been released. I don't want to watch this film and it is not my first choice. I just want to end the year and go home with some more movies to put in my DVD bin. I didn't even like the movie, it wasn't funny and I didn�t understand the plot and what was happening in this movie. I know the story and the plot was alright and what the story is about didn� this is a piece of crap.  I don�t like this movie, and I don´t even like movies. I think it will probably be the worst movie ever made. I hope it becomes a sequel of a horror movie soon. The whole time I had been watching this movie I felt like my teeth were falling apart. I did what I�ll have to do with my life, and it didn�s more for me. I was tired from it and couldn't stand up to watch another horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really cannot find anyone who had any enjoyment about this one. I have to say that this is not a film to be taken seriously. I can't really figure out what a person was watching it. I cannot fathom that someone actually wanted to see this. If you have a really long time. watch it, I would recommend to skip it and get into a good movie: 'Dances at the Edge'. A few things: 1. A big, obvious, glaring weakness. This is a film that wants to be an average, even low-brow, film: it needs a larger audience.  2. The storyline is completely nonsensical.  3. The characters are very poorly developed. They are not able to be believable and they are not good characters. 4. The soundtrack is not good. It sounds like a car stereo.  5. The acting is very poor, there is no good acting and it's not even close-dirted. The worst is a poor actor who gets into a really bad movie.  6. The film is so bad it should be banned for those who actually want to see it.  7. No plot. No real action. No actors. No good story. No ending. Just awful. I was one of the first people who heard about this film on TV and I could not sit on and watch it. It's not like you want to watch a bad film because you want a lot of good movies: it's really like a low-budget film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has more than what I'd expect. The plot is boring, the acting is terrible, and the acting doesn't make much sense. But there is one redeeming thing that has managed to salvage this picture. That is the actor portraying the character (I assume the actor is good, and that's how we're supposed to see the film). The actor, who has seen the acting career that was this picture, thinks he can tell us something about how bad the film is because of the actor's experience in movies. That's not exactly a lie, the actor was in a good movie, but that was just as bad as this movie. And the actors don't help matters.  I can't say anything positive about it, but I'm not interested in its ratings. The film just leaves you bored and bored, and doesn't give you much to feel like watching it, which is why I have given it two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie on video at Disney. I liked the movie, but I found this movie to be just horrible. The acting wasn't good, and the dialog was awful. The storyline was pretty cheesy and I found that it lacked something, either acting or story. The ending didn't make sense. The fact that a man and a woman died and she was pregnant to this man (who was an alcoholic) was very odd.  The acting was so bad, there wasn't even a time in the story where something seemed reasonable. This movie is stupid, a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good part about this movie was a pretty good little scene when we first got to know it. But once that was gone then what could go wrong? The movie starts to drag out the story of the plot, and we don't get all of the suspense before it's time. In addition to that, it also suffers from a very weak special effects which I found quite painful. When you're getting into the movie, be prepared to look for the next scene or some of the camera effects which just weren't good at all.  The acting was not too good, the dialog was not good. And there wasn't a memorable character, but there were no one. All in all,  This movie is not good for a movie of all the horror genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought the director would have some talent. What was he able to do? He just couldn't seem to create a plot and we can't even figure out who is sending him. I found it very sad that he made this film. I'd not understand why a film would be such a disappointment to anyone. And that's really all of my feelings on it. The acting seems to be the same as last year's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just isn't a good way to waste your time... This movie really took the credibility that I had. In short, I didn't like it, and I was very disappointed by it. I was so embarrassed to watch it, that I didnít think about it. It was just too lame and bad. There wasnít too good for a bad film and I donít recommend it to anyone. I also thought that a special effect, the way the character's story is portrayed, could have made the movie better. If that was a bad version of the film, then there isn't really any room for it.  The actor, who is good, did an OK job, but just didn't enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw the title "The Return of Mr. Wengster", I was surprised. I didn't expect the first movie I had ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is the obvious, it's predictable, the first half of the movie is pretty good. The first half is good, but the second half is just terrible. That's what I expect from a sequel. I can't imagine what the makers have done to make this sequel any better, they've tried to make it a good film. However, I'd suggest they try to go one step further and to get the dialog and dialog right. They tried to have the film together for almost no dialogue, but that's not possible, not unless the characters can think it, and I think the film itself is a complete disaster, for all actors.  If you enjoyed the first "Hang" movies, please do not watch this one. It's not even funny. It just takes the viewer back to being an outsider. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. The entire acting for this movie was stupid and disappointing. I would like to see it again so I didn't even bother watching it, but don't know what to say. I just find the acting to be very, very bad. The acting is very bad as well and the acting is even worse. I want to see something that actually has a chance of making good of the movie and not just a bad one. I do recommend the movie for those who can appreciate a little bit of the concept behind this movie. I also wish they made the DVD, it really was an interesting movie, but unfortunately I felt like it was just a "wannish" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an avid fantasy cinema, even though I'm in my 20's, my girlfriend is the only person I really like.  The movie starts on a train, and the next stop is the train station where the main character (from the first movie) resides.  Soon, you will find your own thoughts. There are only one interesting thing to note - a car will be available to each passenger.  Then, of course, all this becomes a plot line - but you soon find the plot is very boring, especially for an entertaining movie.  And finally, the movie is very violent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a poor film with nothing to say about the subject, but it had a few interesting elements. For example, the story focuses on an old man's daughter, who's also a major celebrity (She is the daughter of a real estate mogul who would like to get the movie in the lottery and make up with him - but her father is the boss of a nearby restaurant).  After getting into the plot, there's nothing of substance whatsoever. The ending contains a horrible ending that is simply absurd. There's nothing at all, but there are a few lines that are interesting.  This movie has so many ridiculous situations and lines that they just never get past the beginning. And I wouldn't like to go into a long, but I will for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not as much a horror movie as I thought it would have been, but it didn't deliver much on the horror front. A very disappointing effort from the director and actors alike. The script is terrible, and the direction is extremely bad. This is probably the worst horror film ever made, and as a "horror film", it deserves the lowest rating in history of any horror cinema to have made it to the 10 stars.  I am not sure how this is supposed to have worked. I don't think you can take credit for what the movie has done or for what is to come. Some of you may be thinking "Yeah, but this movie was really a horror film" but if the movie had any redeeming quality, it would be "the best horror movie of all time". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad movie - I saw this movie for about five minutes and then was completely sick of it. The ending could be explained with the ending of the movie being pretty vague. There are no real suspense and the movie was really bad to see. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I really wish it would get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watched this movie, I felt as if the director had taken the idea and tried to make it. So, I left the theater feeling that it was a complete waste of money. I don't think I could have spent a few dollars to see the film. I know that I'm not one of the "real" actors. This film is so bad. You cannot laugh, like I did in the original. I'm still getting used to my family laughing and trying to laugh in movies. I hope it never turns up again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very upset after watching this movie. The acting, acting, and direction were awful. I mean, my wife laughed and laughed. I watched this in silence because I was unhappy that I was stuck with it. This movie is not funny, it is a bore - it's a pity that such a waste of money has become such a hit. It has nothing to give anyone else a good review about the movie: 2 stars - a young actor and a young, stupid actor; the two play the opposite roles - one is hilarious and the other is pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about half the length of a normal film. This is a short and it's about five minutes longer than a film would have been. What really bothers me, though, was that it felt like a rip-off of something called "Leverse". It didn't help that one scene was especially long and so bad it wasn't that interesting. It just got so boring and the movie seemed to drag on for too long. I could easily tell the movie would have ended when it finally got to the third scene.  My other comment on the movie is that this film was the very worst film I've ever seen. I mean, if you have seen many movies like "Unreal", "The Great Grief of Time", or even "Dangal". It's not the best movie I've seen and I certainly don't recommend it to anyone.  But the only thing that makes it worse, in my opinion, is the fact that there is no real plot of this film. There's not even a plot or a plot, it just is a bad film. It doesn't matter how well you can appreciate it because you're not supposed to.   It's all pretty boring, though. I'd give it a zero out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I just went to the movie and just got to go, I did my own opinion, but I guess I was expecting it to be an interesting film. The movie starts with an incredibly boring scene in which every single character is in the middle of a scene. I was left wondering what the hell happened to those people... oh, the people! I don't even care how, that is what it is. So, you might like this movie because you want to be bored, but don't.  Oh, and there's nothing to do... it's just a bunch of people getting beaten by the wind... don't let your life go down to the minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be somewhat amusing. I've found most of my friends in the comments below and I agree with most of the comments. But those who are in this movie, unfortunately don't see much humour. It seems they're too serious about it. Maybe they are, but they didn't get it out when they made a little joke. I'm not sure if they got it straight because the actors are a lot more serious than the acting has gotten. And the script is too stupid.  The whole movie is just one big joke. The script is awful, but there are no funny lines in it. There are even a few lines which do not make sense from the script. The plot is very vague and boring and there are many scenes in the movie which do have a theme. But I did agree that at least the actors can do funny jokes. I just can't believe that such a joke-sized comedy had been made since I was in it, but don't blame me for the humor in this show.  Some of the jokes are about the ridiculous women who go in the lake and have to get off because there is no one who is willing to help them. I also found the jokes about a man who is having a bad hair day and has to leave the water all day and go shopping. There was something else I was surprised at in the comedy. I was expecting there would be more jokes. But there were some jokes that did not take any real interest to me and I think the movie's writers thought that they could get away without any more jokes, since most of them were so funny. I did, in fact, think that they are trying to build the joke around the stupidity of the movie. They want to use it as a comedy and get some amusement out of this movie. But that's not the case, since they want to get some laughs and at least some of their comedy gets the job of the main plot. I thought the humor was too ridiculous and just seemed silly. And I had to be really sad at how I had no idea what the movie was about. This movie just doesn't have any real comedy in it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie was a bad film.  I found it strange that this movie didn't have any other good lines. A couple of good lines were given, but that wasn't what it was supposed to be. If you were a fan of the TV show, you would have never found this movie to be good.  It is too bad to be honest. I thought this film was supposed be a comedy, but the ending left me laughing so hard that I wanted to vomit.  The first three minutes of the movie were okay, but there was no tension whatsoever.  When I did this movie I thought it was the worst movie ever made in a long time. I was surprised that it was only released a year later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can hardly believe it was published in the early 1930s. I can't even remember the name of the writer, the name I remember having the first chance to read the story. And I can remember the story being told from a very young point. I'm not even sure why it made this bad film, but I can tell that it was made by a bunch of guys who had just recently left their job, and were living in New York City and didn't quite like it. They were very young, and they wanted a job that would give them more job hours and opportunities. Of course, these guys did not get quite paid for their efforts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film about an dead prostitute who turns out to be a serial killer and kills others. The story is so lame that it makes me wonder if anyone actually believed in the premise. The ending is so bad it is unbelievable, and there's so little plot that it doesn't matter how many people get killed in it. The special effects were good enough for a laugh, but the story leaves you with nothing to latch onto. Even if you liked this one, you'd probably think that there was some sort of magic magic, like magic potions or the occult. If you are a movie buffs and have some free time to kill, why don't you do it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in full anticipation of my daughter's debut. I was wrong. It wasn't like watching a movie: it sucked me in. The acting was awful, the plot was disappointing, the storyline was bad, and the special effects looked bad. I know that my daughter will be loved to have the "Pilificer" girl, who has a history of making a movie with this awful, but this was an insult to everyone's tastes. I'm not one of these girls who will buy the DVD and watch it to their kid's delight. They'll be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen several movies of this that have been so bad that I've had to really try and try and avoid. The plot is so stupid and there are too many jokes. The special effects really don't make up for a film of this kind. My favorite movie of the show was the second episode of the previous series which is a comedy of sorts. That was fun to watch. But this movie is so bad and bad. It's not funny, but it is so slow that it's hard to enjoy. I recommend the first episode of this show, as it was my favorite show from the show, but I cannot recommend this movie. It is no longer funny to watch and no reason for anyone to watch this movie because there's no reason to. Also, if you liked this show to the previous episodes, you will not appreciate how bad it is now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is possibly the worst film ever made for a big screen! This film is only slightly entertaining and no special effects. If you want to see a classic movie of a car accident, go to "Dumbler" or "Houseboat Graveyard". Those movies are better than this garbage, and I hope it's not too bad for the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to hear how many reviewers would be offended with the film for their "not much depth" on a few minor aspects. The acting was also worse than I expected - most of the actors had no real acting skills.  A really bad, poorly acted, slow-moving, boring film of unknown origin with bad jokes to its "story", even worse than some of the Hollywood comedies.  I really liked those Woody Allen comedies and these guys (who are known for their good acting, not theirs).  I don't know if I missed too many jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. I laughed when I watched it.  I could have never believed the movie was so horrible. The girl on the screen wasn't good. I guess she was a bit annoying. You really want to sit around with your hands on your lap for awhile. This movie was really bad.  It's just a few things that are annoying. I've seen many more of these kinds of movies. That's how I get from the people who complain.   Also I would have never seen this movie again. It's probably the worst film I have ever seen. I gave it a zero rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film as a "one time movie" and I'm surprised to learn that it actually is not. It's way too long and I had to sit through it to avoid any more misery. It really isn't good to sit a couple of hours and watch this stuff. It could be a thriller, but it's way way too slow. The film was so bad I actually forgot what I wanted to see. This movie was supposed to be the horror film version of "The Crow". I wanted a horror flick to have more gore to the scene, but I couldn't get to that. I didn't want to watch it, I gave up, and skipped it off the first night of its existence. I'll try it again if I want to finish it, but don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an idea I've heard before. But it seems to be something to say, but I doubt it. The characters are just not believable.  You may find this movie to be entertaining, but this movie is really a disaster. I'd really like to see someone do something similar to this movie in a horror movie. If you would like to take a look at this film and see if you can figure out how it relates to a horror film, then take my advice. Do not see this movie. You will probably be able to figure it out. It's just a crappy, over-the-front-narrow, overpriced, overrated and awful movie. The only thing I can recommend is a movie with the original ending and a very good remake of the movie, "Cabinet". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie a little late in its availability, and the movie has nothing to do with the book; the book is simply a collection of ideas that the film tries to pack off. But unfortunately, it's not a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had me in it as soon as I started watching it and I'm sad to say that it won't make it into the end. I don't recommend watching this movie. It's not too appealing to the point that it's bad at the beginning or that it isn't amusing or funny, but it's pretty awful in its way. There's no comedy in this film. If you want something that isn't bad and has an interesting story, this isn't for you. It has a very bad look. The main character was a weak character and the characters that were introduced in the first few minutes of the movie could be decent but not that good. It also had some really bad dialog in a couple of scenes and the soundtrack was pretty good at first but after about 10 minutes into the movie, the sound track on their record really was pretty bad. The sound track is not good, either. I'd recommend avoiding this movie as soon it comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film a female prostitute is going to get some sex; then she is in a room with a guy she met previously. The man starts asking her to sleep with him and she gets mad. He is in fact one of those men who go in to their rooms to have sex with women and then the women goes to a bank to get money to pay back the guy. She's in debt to him and then she leaves the room. After that she is so unhappy and desperate to get the money back that she gives chase to the guy and tries to go after him to see him.  The guy and the woman's life is in complete chaos with it. He starts trying to run away and she keeps saying he's not a bad guy.  But he keeps using her for money and keeps getting money and the police is trying to catch him. It seems to be a lot of wasted money.  Finally, the prostitute tries to get a hotel clerk to help her because she thinks she will need a safe place to sleep. She asks for a safe room because she cannot sleep there. The hotel clerk asks her if she wants to sleep in a safe hotel; she refuses to accept a safe location because she doesn't have the money and doesn't know how to get it. Finally, she gets a little tip and goes to the hotel, gets a hotel key and goes in. The next day she gets herself involved with a bunch of guys who do seem to be interested in taking her money, then she decides to stay in the hotel. But instead of keeping her in the same hotel, she finds a new hotel with a nice boy who is nice and really is into sex. So that starts the love between the two. The police arrest her and she is held back by her hotel clerk.  Now the girl is really getting into it with one of the men. The boy asks her to stay with him. She doesn't take the offer and when she's been asleep in the room it turns into an assault with him chasing after her. He really does break his nose with a big fist and she has to struggle to keep his arms from getting wrapped up and her skin is torn and blood is leaking. It starts out like a very dirty break-in with a lot and ended like an ugly fight.  It starts back and forth with no real connection between the women. He gets the police involved and then he runs her over with a pistol. When the police get involved, the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was released in the summer of 2008, after the US Army was involved in the bombing of the Iraqi embassy in Washington. The movie was never broadcast. Although, it has been cited in some of the media (including by Oprah.) This movie's bad ending was simply unbelievable - when the Iraqi soldiers came from the front gate, they were attacked by a helicopter with heavy fire on the helicopter that was circling above their location. The Iraqi's screams were probably drowned by their own blood.  When the plane was hijacked, the US was shown cheering with the Iraqi troops on the screen. Even their leader, Colonel Moore, appeared to be in tears.   The video release is about the same as when this movie was made. There is no video to show where the attack occurred and that is probably why it is impossible to remember. We need to remember what happened, not just the fact of the attack.  If you have any doubts about the Iraq war, don't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad in the first 10 minutes I thought I was going to see something horrible. I can't even remember my reaction when it first came out.  I'm not really into the film but I really should be able to comment on the acting and some of the direction I think could have been so good. It's too long. The plot is awful.  Other point of all, I don't like to see too much of the "prodgers" on TV. It is really just a series of commercials that could have made some interesting films.  The only good thing about the movie was the fact that there were some good actors in the movie. The "producers" were good with the "film" but it is just hard to watch them. I just don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made on the basis of some people claiming that the movie is about racism and other people claiming the movie was about the white man who is so crazy that he wants to go to America. This movie is simply bad. If you can think of a movie that is so bad, don't watch it because it's about racist people who want to go straight to their lives and not stop their lives (i mean, it's not about racism or hate, people hate and people don't want to kill).  The ending and acting are simply bad, the film itself is just bad, and it's really dangerous to be on the Internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this movie when I was on a vacation vacation, and my girlfriend (who is one of the best actors in the entire movie!) thought it was a movie.  I can't even imagine it. It just looked like a rip-ass. I think the director/writer(Robert Blum) screwed up so bad that I was angry at some of his lines in the film. I never heard that Blum actually works with his own movies, but he was talking about this in a positive review about an extremely bad movie. In an effort to remedy that I decided to watch some of the movie, and soon I discovered a few of them.  The original, "Big Bozza's Caravan, is pretty good, but the plot lines are bad, and the acting is so bad it's hard to watch. This is also the only movie in the series that I can say doesn't have a decent ending. I really, honestly, could tell the difference between the ending and the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been looking for this movie for over a year now, and it is bad. It is boring, but the funny moments (like the fake snowmen!) seem to have been forgotten. This movie is full of awful dialog that is not actually funny, and the main actors in this movie seem to be doing a very poor job in portraying the characters. I really do hope that the producers and the writers will take some of these characters to the next level. I just hope the filmmakers will try to make the plot interesting enough to make a decent film. If they can do that, they might be able to make this movie interesting again. This is not as good a movie as the other ones that have made it, which is why I didn't pay any attention to it when it first came out. The plot is too basic and doesn't make much sense. There are some good moments, but most of them are very stupid. The people in the movie look good, but none of them really act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of good things in this movie. You get a lot more info on the history of the time and how the men who have been at this point for a long time. But it's about the way that the "people" are acting. This is an obvious sign of an attempt to make a movie that is just the least interesting out there. If you're a serious fan of a good movie like THE DEVEL'S DEXTER is a pretty good movie and some funny dialog. But this movie is pretty bad.  There are just no decent actors in this one. Not even the old ones from the days, like John Gates and Dan Gordon and Jack White.  But the best actors of the movie are totally uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think i really didn't like this movie, but it actually was good at some moments. However it seems it will be an illogical movie, the dialogue is bad, there is no real dialog and there is too much violence, i honestly think that it will never make any difference. I just don't know if this is a film for people like me who just watch one movie and think nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has an awful acting talent of a couple actors who are supposed to be supporting the movie. Unfortunately, these guys are acting out on every single scene of the movie and the ending is pretty silly.  It is a sad day for these guys who are in the movie for it's comedic value. The acting is so bad and there are no funny jokes and the whole thing is just annoying. It doesn't help that they have a big car and a good hairstyle. This movie is just plain bad and not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "DANNY OIL" is what it has been this week. We have to look at all the reviews to see which ones it has left out. I found it on Vulture, the other side of the channel and, although they are one of the better channels, they cannot cover both the good stuff and the bad stuff. It's like you can never follow the news or know what time the shows are. And, if you do, you should never start watching this show because there are only three shows left to watch in the entire world that do this:  DANNY OKAY, HERE'S IT!  Darnell, who plays the head of a bank with a big, fat, white head, was an extremely bad director. We were literally at the end of his show when he was talking about his plan to build an office building to put a statue of his statue around the bank to keep his place cool. I couldn't even guess who he was going to build the statue of.  And, even worse, he went on and on with every little joke he could think about. There was nothing left. He showed nothing hope for the American economy or democracy, it was just the guy trying to "win" in life.  The show is so bad that it's hard to watch. You don't even want to watch it, which is a pity, because if you did, it would be great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You would think that I had stumbled onto this film through a Youtube link, but I was not. This movie wasn't even a "film" by the name of Aryan Miller or any other well known film director, just a bunch of films, some of which were in fact filmed by the same Aryan's co-founder. The only thing that made this movie worthwhile was that it wasn't actually about a real movie. It's just an excuse for a quick one-and-only-for-a-couple-of-two-days-away film. I've seen this film on several occasions, but it never gets better or better. I also just found out that the original cast members were still able to fight in the film. You can never find out any details of their story.  There's also no real reason to stick with this movie in the top ranks. If you know someone who has seen this movie, do the only one you can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't understand why this movie was made. As a person who knows the difference between the best and worst movies ever made, I was surprised by the number of people who liked it. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It doesn't matter which direction it goes in, but it sure isn't the best movie ever made. I do think this is more than just an abomination, it's so bad it has the ability to be laughed off. I think I had the first laugh when I watched it because I was embarrassed. I have never laughed before, but the first time I laughed, I laughed. It has to be remembered as a complete disaster. What it is about is is the story being told. I don't know if the director is a good actor, but if he is a bad actor, he is an actor. I was very surprised by how difficult it was to watch and to try to find a decent ending. I couldn't find any ending. The ending was totally pointless and just left me feeling like it. In all, I just wanted to get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought it because I really liked "Sharks" and I did really love that movie. What happened here wasn't too exciting, but it was still pretty entertaining, and this movie had too many ridiculous moments. I think I'd really like it if the writers could write some jokes about one of the characters, but they could barely muster a decent line, and the humor doesn't really work.  I have never found this movie to be funny, and I've never seen this film again. Even worse than that, the actors were completely uninteresting and there was absolutely no good performances, especially when they had the chance to act better. It's not the worst movie in history, but I'd give the "Shark's" performance a rating as low as 2.  This film had one thing going for it, and that is the script, which was not only boring, but also very shallow and disappointing. I really couldn't find it in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a good movie. I really liked that it had all the good actors, all the girls (the ladies), and good chemistry. But this movie failed because the movie was so bad that it just had the sex scenes to be interesting. It was so low budget that it made the sex scene in this film look stupid.  I also think that it is a good idea to have a female character that looks like she's just a person. That she's a woman and that she's not a good person. The sex scene never could be funny or funny, just plain dumb. It wasn't funny until I saw it for the first time. I think that this movie is more like the movie 'Ladies of the Earth'.  I know the name of the actor in this movie. You could find pictures of the actors in the movie on your computers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. The acting is poor and the direction is bad. The story is not interesting and the story isn't original. The movie has bad dialog and terrible music. The ending is not worth to a movie. The film has been rated, but it hasn't been rated as a 9. The director and a producer should have put this thing together with the second movie they made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember one of the first movies I ever saw. They were in some form "funny" but when I look at it now I realise that it's not funny, it's downright awful. I'm not saying that it was a comedy, I'm saying that there were no jokes in it, nor did the script itself have any punch. I've seen my mother crying in the theatre when I was expecting this movie to be a hilarious piece of work -and it isn't. It just got to me that this is nothing at all, it completely lacks any humour. What a pity. I didn't see any funny character in the movie - the only ones who tried to act were all annoying. The actors, even the few who tried and were funny, are utterly awful. The movie doesn't help if you have to sit through the whole movie so that you can laugh, and I think it's in fact less funny than if you're sitting in the cinema. There are many films that have not even got a decent ending or have a good ending, but this just isn't one of them. The plot is weak and there is no real plot - just a series of flashbacks that are completely uninteresting - and in the end it just doesn't really matter that there's nothing to the story. In fact, there wasn't really a story to the movie, it wasn't even about a story - just some kid who wanted to be able to fly helicopters or whatever - and the movie was completely nonsensical. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three main problems with this film: 1. The story is simply too short. The fact that it's an 80 minutes longer than "The Great Movie", even goes out to 70 minutes or something longer than that. And the most ridiculous thing about this film was that the characters seemed to care too much about being in their own lives, and had "self-destructive" problems with each other. This is probably the worst film ever made in Hollywood. There are even worse movies like "Moville's Revenge" for example, but the reason they were made, is because it was so predictable and predictable.  2. The acting was pretty good. The actors were all really annoying, and it's probably the only one of the movies in my home I haven't seen before. 3. There were some nice moments. However, this film is an awful piece of film. It's really depressing and feels like it was made for someone with little brain and no interest in making a film. And it's a shame that I'm not even able to see this film because it only has the one trailer, which is a copy of the original, so it's bad to see the original.  The DVD is no longer than a two or three seconds longer than the original DVD, and is still worth purchasing for two or four bucks, if you're still interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that the director and the producers really messed up on this movie.  I found the movie to be very slow-moving, and I just didn't care about it to start. I found a lot of flaws with it, and the way the movie is structured made it hard to follow, and so much bad. I felt sorry for the actor who appeared in the film - although she is good, and maybe the film is good.  The film was very bad. The story is the worst one I've ever seen. The way the story is structured and structured is totally nonsensical. The plot is so shallow and weak. I'm sorry for myself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that so many people saw this movie. If I were to watch this movie, I would be ashamed to watch it again. I was so ashamed of the fact that this movie is so bad that my girlfriend had to rent the copy because there are only two of them left. I had to get the DVD and it only paid me a few hours of rent. I can't even get to my boyfriend in Boston to see it again because it is so terrible.  My girlfriend is a writer. And she was so upset with the movie, she decided to keep watching it to get it off the shelf and get the movie DVD as soon as possible. That's how it goes, and she has to pay to go for the DVD! That is a sad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, I really hate this movie! It was just a few weeks before this movie was released and I was so embarrassed I had to walk away from it. I was really embarrassed, it was awful. I don't know why this movie has not gotten released and why was it released. It's not like any film that's ever been made so it's just awful! I think this is one of the worst movies of the decade. I just wish I had just one person to ask about the problem and I donno one with an IQ. I didn't know what I could do to save it from this bad movie. I mean, it's a terrible movie, I can't think for a positive review about it. This movie is just bad, especially for being so bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the reviews in a good movie review and I said:  This movie was supposed to be funny and not about being a serious film. I was surprised by how the plot was not funny. There was one scene in the middle of the movie when it came time to choose a location and it said something like this:  "I would like to go to Canada, Canada, Ontario, Canada..."  It is a comedy! It is not a comedy about a movie: It is about a soap opera. It's not a film with a nice guy playing an important role and the people in it all look awful.  It's about a guy that wears a suit with a ridiculous "noodle" wig, talks to a girl and has sex with everyone.  My guess is that this guy could have worked out a better movie than a film: a film that is supposed to appeal to an older audience and then it becomes a soap film about a sad soap opera that isn't even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people on the Internet have commented on the fact that it has no supporting characters and no one really interacts with the other characters. That is, I assume, what was intended. But, apparently, this is not a movie. The point I had hoped was that it was the same in the other "Babal", which I think the original was, so I did some research on it, hoping that it would have the same script. I found the script to be pretty terrible. I was afraid to see the actors, especially, as the characters. I don't have any knowledge about acting, but this is pretty bad.  The acting in the first half of the movie is extremely bad. I had to spend a few hours of my time going through this in my nightmares, which were probably the only reason I had in the whole movie. I finally decided to give it a decent rating based on the good things in it, but it's still bad. If you are hoping for a good movie about the "Babal", I recommend the one with the best acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can feel the same way people complain about this movie. The film is boring. The story was pretty good, but what makes this movie hard to watch is the lack of anything resembling a plot. I don't think this movie was meant to be funny, as I understand what it was supposed to be, but it seems to lack the kind of comedic or comedy I've seen from some of the other films I've shown. I feel like the whole thing could have been cut up into a little comedy when it could have gotten better. If there wasn't a whole lot of darkness in the film, I would say it was just a poorly made film with poor taste. This is one of many bad movies that should be turned in to a live action movie, and I think there is no way to expect a lot of enjoyment from it. It's just disappointing to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an inoffensive, and I am sure you are going to think that's the case, and it is. But it wasn't very good. The film is very simplistic, and fails to follow the rules of the best American film of the year, and is a complete failure of any interest for a viewer. If you like seeing girls in a bad film, then stick around for the rest of this movie, and you may actually appreciate it. If it's worth something for your money, then there is nothing to do except watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. The story is pretty simple - an evil alien wants to destroy Earth, and the hero is a man who can shoot and destroy that in the most easily imaginable way. However, the ending is utterly awful. You really don't want to see the final scenes of this movie, and you're better off skipping it and not trying.  The acting is very disappointing and some of the dialog is really bad, but I give the actor credit for some of their good work. The actors really donno show what they're capable of doing. And what about the character? The villain was really awful, but what about him? I don't know. It could be interesting, but no one can be evil or good in the world, so that it leaves little to have a life outside of the world to follow.  If you have nothing else going on, watch this movie to understand the premise and try to see what the movie is really about. Otherwise, its really about being a drama - the bad movie is a poorly acted film - I give no credit to the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie. It is so bad that it should not even be considered a good film, not even by the best producers of the world. I'd think it would be more realistic to call it a documentary. The acting is atrocious, and I'm not even sure if this movie was ever produced. The cinematography is bad and the writing doesn't make sense. The voice and songwriting are okay, but it's not quite good. I think the best of these people are people like Jim Blaine or Eddie DeBrisse or John Corbett or Michael Jackson. In contrast to the best film people of the worlds.  The worst of these is Michael Jackson, although he has seen more movies than the average actor.  If you want a documentary, I recommend the best movies:  1. "The Cry Song" by A. L. Wines.  2. "Swingers" by David Woodling.  3. "Dangerous Love" by Charles Martin Carter.  4. "Naughty Girls" by Dennis Martin.  5. "House of Smalyn" by Michael O'Brien.  6. "Down, Baby" by Joe L. Moore.  7. "Linda Starr" by Jack Black.  8. "Little Creatures" by James Dean and William Cooper.  9. "Hobbe" by Jim Kowar and Charles Woodling Jr. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So many of the critics in this review and I just couldn't even use my head as I was stuck in the movie. It was too long and drawn out and simply incoherent. The story is a very simple and predictable one. If you think this is a comedy or horror or horror movie then you would be wrong. If it is a horror movie or a horror comedy, it's too long. It's not even a decent film. It is like a piece of japanese music. It also does not have any redeeming qualities as a horror film, a comedy, or even a horror. It just fails to move forward. I was expecting that it would be an action film, but unfortunately it is just a piece on the Internet that has some disturbing elements. It needs to be split up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I checked out my copy of the movie on Amazon, because of what the title suggested, I thought the movie was pretty good. But, it's not!  What's the point? It's a story, about a young lady who wants to make a life-long journey in the city to seek her fortune, but ultimately ends up losing her fortune and having nothing to do with it.  So, in the title there are elements of morality about the movie. In the title, the woman's motivations are explored, but she is never actually given the opportunity to do what she wants to do. And it's clear that she is not the only one with a sense of self-satisfaction or "having to go through with others". She doesn't appear in the story, and at least she appears in the end of the film as a sort of ghostly character in a crowd, but it seems to be the "true" truth that she wants the things she wants. The whole "real" reason why she doesn't get to do anything for her friends is because she was never going to have any other kind of interest or "realistic" life. But what happens to the rest of the people in the film? The rest of them seem like a lot of the same boring characters. They are all very unfunny and boring, and they don't act very much to the characters. The men and women seem to act more in concert than together, which may have been the result of the fact that, at the time, they were "young and old", or even younger and much less likely to behave in the manner that young people will act. They don't realize the significance of things, and the scenes seem like they are making up a story to distract the viewer from actual characters. Also, despite the fact the girls don't look at all like their "boss" characters, the characterizations appear to be a bunch of characters. There are two characters, each with a distinctively different set of character traits, and no one seems to get along for the whole movie, which just seems to have been created just to be boring people.  And what's the most depressing thing? Well, I guess that's probably the worst part of the whole "movie". The title is pretty accurate, but the movie is just another horrible excuse for the writer and the characters of it. The actors, mostly good but no chemistry, do a poor job in expressing themselves to the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many problems with this movie that they do not go into specifics. The first problem is that they start off too fast. This movie's first half hour is not engaging to begin with. In fact, it just starts off too loud and fast.  You could just sit and watch it. You could almost watch it if the movie was in fact slower than a movie. The second problem is the fact that they don't want to go on a plot about a family who has four kids. There are too many things about this movie to know. If it's a family fight that comes from a conflict, you probably wouldn't necessarily be in there. You probably wouldnn't necessarily want to see your husband (and children) at home because he'd be in their house. That's what the book would have said. There is also the fact they didn't even try to go deep enough into the story.  A really bad movie, and a lot of it is just annoying. This film is no way for anyone to sit back and enjoy the movie. Avoid the fact this movie is not a good movie and don't watch it now.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was simply horrible... There was just one scene which wasn't even good. My point of view is that it is just another excuse for the lack of a decent ending. It is a horrible movie because not only is it a bad story and a lack of story and an overall crappy storyline, but the scenes with the main actors seem to have some decent moments... At the end, we're left with a feeling of "What the hell was that even?"... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of my first movies I saw this, as it was advertised. I was expecting it to be a horror movie, but when I saw it I thought it was nothing more than an average horror film. The only thing it was was was scary was the fact that the only person involved in it was a psycho-killer. The film also had the worst soundtrack I've heard since the "Bibs" video game. I didn't really have to know what the movie was about, as I heard people using it as a joke to get "funny" and to get laughs. I watched it again and it was bad as ever, and I gave it as an "as bad as" movie.   If you have a cheap movie, don't watch it, or watch something that will cause your brain to throb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been through two movies in this year, this one being the latest of them. This movie is not good, it is not fun. I did like the way it was animated, though that might be my personal view. There was also an odd scene at the end, the whole idea is that you are to be in your own way. That is very odd. I hope they get a little more work out of this thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in the late 80's with this movie, the "Candy" movie. It has a plot that's not interesting to anyone. I think it's an incredibly stupid movie.  There's an obvious lack of chemistry between the two main characters. The main character, Rayna and the woman, are both stupid and so predictable that I could count to see them in their first line. Rayna isn't funny or interesting and either of them is a bad actor.  The acting, I have to say, is weak, just about what you'd expect to see. It is probably a very silly film, but I feel it was made to fill in the space for a stupid comedy.  I'm watching this today, just for the fact that I've seen it twice and have the feeling of being cheated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had many fun moments in movies such as this one, but they are so poor as to render them lifeless and unsatisfly unsatisfying, especially for a viewer unfamiliar with any kind of movie: no dialogue, no plot, no atmosphere, no character development, no characters, no direction, no respect. I also felt like it was an anti-war movie.    In fact, it had a plot that had the sole purpose of establishing a fictional version of the "wars. There were no references to current history, or to the history of the war in Iraq. It's clear that what the viewer was intended to do was to portray the war as it actually was, namely a military effort by the Iraqi army. But the movie ended up as boring, because it was lacking a real story and direction. I'm also dismayed that this movie never got to the point it wanted to, because my husband was involved in it, and we were both extremely disappointed in this movie. We tried to kill the movie, but were not sure how it would work. The film just seemed to be in a second tier.  Overall, I think that it needs to be used as a vehicle to generate interest in a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty stupid. In some scenes it is hilarious and some are totally boring. But what the hell is that supposed to be. The ending is absolutely awful. The plot is completely lame. The acting is horrible, the editing is terrible, the soundtrack is terrible. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you're bored. Otherwise it might be good to find some good ones to watch. But don't do it. I probably saw this movie in the store one time, but not anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a little bit depressed from the last two years of this movie, but finally I get it. This movie is really poor, and I think it is the most awful horror movie ever to come out, ever. There is no story line, no direction, no interesting characters, and no real plot. This is really the worst horror movie I've ever seen, even when I read some of the good books. I would avoid watching this movie for the sole reason of having fun and laughter in a movie that is so bad it's like a horrible movie, and that is what you want, you don't need it, but you might want to see some of those books. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I had seen this movie before. I've seen this in one of my reviews. It is just a shame on the film it is. In the film, the main character is a "scramonter", who travels to a city called "The City of Truth", in a city that is actually called "City of Truth".  This city is actually where a person named "Albert" (the main protagonist of the film) lives. He and a partner named "Roxy" (who has her own "scramp") and meet Albert. This film starts off with a plot.  So Albert sends Roxy to the city, with a truck, and the movie begins with Albert's girlfriend having trouble with Roxy and his "saddling". Albert and Roxy meet on the way to Albert's house, and it appears to Albert to be an odd man. He has nothing to do with women, he tells Roxy. Roxy is in his hometown and Albert's wife visits to him to discuss a problem with her husband.  This movie starts off and starts off like an average horror movie. If I could rate this movie as a bad film it would fall from this.   1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My second impression of this film was the acting and acting. I can't say I liked this film and I didn't like it. I was surprised that I even rated it as one, which is an odd distinction. I don't know what it's about, but I'd never expect anything good. This is the only bad thing about this movie. There's just two parts. The one that you can't dislike is the second. The two parts that you won't like is the other movie. The lead, Ewesha O'Brien, is absolutely despicable, but his acting was fine, not bad, and her hair is cute. The worst part of this movie is the ending. It's awful. There are few good things about this film, but if you have anything else, it's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find the exact name of this film:  I was reading about this on an online site and decided to check out it. It is very bad for two reasons.  1. it's not funny. 2. there's no funny gags. 3. it has an over-the-top plot line that goes on for days.   My only suggestion: don't rent this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is completely lacking and the action is poor. A bad choice. The lead actors are not as good as the other ones in the movie and the whole premise of the plot is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'd ever tried to watch one of these movies, I'd have laughed. I laughed so hard I was so scared I'd lose my life. I never laughed so much in movies.  Well this movie is about a woman who gets kidnapped by some creepy aliens, but also gets kidnapped in a pool with one of the bad guys who rapes her while he holds her prisoner.  Then the women gets caught in the pool and then dies.  That's about all there is. But there is a twist. He is an alien and he's got a big mustache. And then he rapes her, then he loses his mustache, then she has to watch him rape her, and she falls for a lot of money.  I have to say this movie fails as a story, it fails as entertainment, it's just a complete waste of time. I can't believe anyone would have seen it, even if it were in a video store. I just didn't like the movie because of the fact that it got all the funny jokes in it.   It would have been funny, at least it has some good jokes. But I think if I had liked it more I would have liked the movies it had in the video store, because they didn't have the same kind of bad jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a better film. Unfortunately, I did not find the comedy to be a funny film. There were many little moments I felt it was a bad fit for me, and I felt that the film did not have a clear beginning and ending.  It was a real drag at the start and after that I felt the movie dragged into the middle by its ending. I didn't like that I had to see it again. It also reminded me of the original film, The Great Adventures of Laredo. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had one positive thing going for it - that it was fun and funny!  But it wasn't funny, and there was just one awful gag in it. But it had one good point - it's not about the silly antics, like making the horse do funny things with its own head. Instead, this movie relies on it's silly, stupid and unnecessary characters to get us all lost and depressed, all while making you want to kill them all in a pitiful attempt to make us laugh. In the end, it's just another bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three things wrong here: the director has the same old clothes for the women, and the men are in the same clothes too. Also, the women are never actually in the outfits. But hey, there are some nice outfits (and good ones to try to have fun).  But what about the women? In a world that can do so much better than this, there is one problem.  It's no good for you either, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Great Sleep" is an even worse version of the original 'The Great Scream'. It's a simple and uninteresting premise. Also, there's an over-simplified story line that's very uncomfortable and unimportant for the film itself.  There's also no explanation what happens in the film. I tried my best not to comment on the story line and just give you my opinion. I just want to get some kind of an idea of how it's going.  "Great Scream" is only bad for those who want a sequel to a sequel. If you watch 'The Scream' and just want something to take off from the main sequence of 'The Greatest Scream' you can do worse than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was one of the worst horror movies ever. This is so bad it makes you feel like a little kid again. I can't imagine this movie will get any better than this. I also think the cinematography is bad. I mean this was bad! I'm not sure about what's the right point to be, but what the fuck was a horror movie anyway? This is like a horror series from the 60's, except this is in a really flat, flat, boring way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first few scenes of the film are pretty good. There are two shots at the beginning and the middle of the movie where the camera is a little too wide. The rest of it is so bad it's just an average film! You don't know what a "real movie" is if it is one of two stars doing a scene that would normally happen. If you get bored just like I did, you might start to get sick from the first scene.  I didn't even catch this film before getting sick. Even if I got sick from watching this movie, the characters were interesting to watch. It's like watching an old movie that says the story is about a guy having a big secret.  The movie starts off with the very slow camera motion. There were some scenes that really showed some of the humor that has been used in movies. But the film couldn't make itself funny and the humor just wasn't funny.   Also, the film starts off too fast and the plot gets too complicated and the characters seem to jump from one scene to the next. They all just seemed to be having an adventure. However, there are scenes that were good. The characters seemed to behave the way the characters would behave. That's not to be a good movie! It's just a "funny movie" that was designed to give people nothing more than one big laugh when they laughed.  But after watching this, I can't find it in a positive review. I know I tried watching this film but just one of the worst films I have ever seen. There must be some kind of technical or artistic problem with the movie that would take someone off from acting. The main thing that this film has, though, is that it's all about the "one guy dying".   This movie was rated a 2 out of 10, which is pretty low for a "film" about a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film in theaters, at the mall, and never knew what it was and what it meant. But what it does is... it's a movie about a teenager who is raped, by the family members who he lives with. It was supposed to be a comedy, and in the middle of it I couldn't figure out what it really was, the story is so flat, there isn't any plot, and there's a whole load of awful jokes that make me laugh instead of laughing. And I just got a laugh at the ending. Even if I hadn't been disturbed by it I would be a bit more disturbed. I can't even remember my entire review on this movie...  The other factor is that the director is named the "Director of this movie." Even if he did this, why would the media say he was directing this movie? I really hate these "celebrity" directors. They're making it up by using the name of the director to make it look good... the best way to get rid of these bad guys is to take a different name of their name.  If you are hoping for a film that is entertaining, don't. It won't be! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you go to see this film, I don't believe your emotions of disappointment when it plays out like a bad Bollywood horror film. It plays out as the predictable elements of the movie play themselves. The plot is pretty predictable. The acting is not that good. The characters are not the "great" characters the filmmakers are looking for, but they are all so flat and unsympathetic that there are no emotion to be had when they're in peril. I'd suggest a B-movie: this movie could be made worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a good thing about a movie, movies that are entertaining, but don't do much with the formula.  But this one isn't one of the best i've seen.  This movie's pretty bad, even when it's funny. It has one of those "funny" voiceovers, like one that I remember.  I'm a huge fan of old movies, movies with a pretty low budget, and these aren't cheap, but they're funny.  If I didn't like a film, why would I even watch it? If you just saw the first 15 minutes of this film and didn't get bored, then go watch this movie: a very bad movie for just about $5. I recommend skipping it and watching the other movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made for a young British person living in England - what a country with a British man living in a village could do with a "disco" version of a popular show...  I'm sorry to say, but there are no comments about this film... I have the feeling of a person who never heard about this movie, even though he'd heard about the film...  If I had to watch this, I'd have to watch it in the middle of the night in the movie theater... The film was just OK, with some amusing shots of a few people on horse out in the desert... but it's just too bad to watch. It just wasn't there for the British people who live in England... It should have been a documentary about a movie about a film, but unfortunately, it just happened to be a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was badly put together...  the main storyline is not well executed at all, and the other 3 parts of the plot look bad, but there are enough good bits that make this worth a look at. the dialog is not good for this movie at all... and some of the other actors aren't too good. the acting is pretty poor.  but the good part of this movie is that they managed to get the old Michael Wooderson in to act it all on one level. it is really hard to believe the same actor did all 3 parts. the story is about a guy that wants to become a newbie actor who gets caught up in the "drugs" (a lot of "drug" jokes). the guy that tries to get away from the drug trafficking that keeps his head on a spinning wheel, but when he tries to escape from a heroin house, he is unable to do that, and his friends do all the necessary things to keep his head steady so that he can escape from the scene of his self-destruction. so he goes to the scene, tries to buy drugs from the heroin house owner, and ends up getting a gun and running it right on the wall... but that's not the end of it. The end does not have a happy ending. the next scene is a bit odd and they actually have some pretty good moments when we are seeing Michael Woodler. The guy who is in possession of the drug he's using is asking about the drug drug dealers, and asks how he should go about this.  it's kinda like one of the movies you would watch during a car crash where you look in to get a car to crash into a wall and drive off the front of the vehicle just to get rid of the people who are in it. the guy in the heroin shop seems to be in total control of the scene he is in and when the cops finally pull up Michael Woodra on a stretcher so that it can go off the wall to get off the drug dealer in, they're both in the process of dying. It's about the guy who's about to die for a second time, but at some points in the movie, he goes on the scene to see the drug dealers with the dealer who tries to kill him and then we see him and the dealer killing Michael Woodiller. That's the ending. But the real ending is the end....and that is not the ending you find in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that has no real ending. The main plot is about the people dying in their apartments. After the credits roll, the people who have died get buried in sand, while the people alive continue to live.  But if the director wants to continue with the story, he should have made a sequel. The story and the actors are just a waste of money. If there was anything to write about the plot, it should have been the best story ever written. If you read it, you would find yourself bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First thing that comes out of this movie is that no one is shown having sex with the other characters in this movie. No one was shown having sexual sex with those other characters. There were no scenes of a woman with a boyfriend, and the movie starts out without any mention about that. Some scenes seemed to be suggestive of a couple sex life, but that was a long, long, and hard time to digest.  I mean it was an hour, and only two scenes were shown at some point.  So, you can say the sex scenes in this film were interesting, but not as good as the ones in "The Overnia", the movie that was one of the best movies ever made, because of the same script (which was good to watch but was not nearly the same), and that is due to the lack of sex scenes and no mention of the fact that people do not always act together.  The acting was extremely bad, and that was only slightly funny. A guy named 'Chad' (who is also the lead) was supposed to be a pretty cute guy, but he was totally ridiculous in both his acting and his portrayal of characters. He was just stupid, and he wasn't in a good mood at all.  Even the music was bad, although it was OK for an action movie, but it made the movie look bad at times. I'm not sure about the name, but the guy named "Futurama" is supposed to act in this picture, so it could have been used as a gag or some kind of shock for this movie's "realistic" feel. I don't know why the name was used, but I think the character who plays 'Cha' is supposed as a cute guy. He is supposed be a character who has to be very masculine, but as in the movie he was never all over the place in his acting.  Overall, I think this movie just shows the worst version of American culture, and this is nothing less funny than an anti-war movie. There are just too many stupid things that got me off the first time through this movie, and I never made it past the first 5 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing other than boring and poor. What can you say without an explanation? It is completely and totally pointless. I would not even mention this movie in a movie review. It really should be used as a plot premise to go along with the rest of the film to give it some credibility and some decent acting. Unfortunately it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So far the "Naughty Girl" has been around for a while and I haven't seen it again. However, it isn't a bad film to go down through its many bad scenes. And, there's a good thing about it.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It just keeps going! And it is SO BORONLY! This is a film that is a bad to watch, even for a few minutes. What I'm saying, the director and the other actors are in way too good for the job they are performing. This is just a bad excuse for a movie, it's a poor film and it's not the first time I saw it, even in a time of it. Also, the title comes from the name of a movie. It doesn't do any good to have the title "Nasty Girl" in a film.   If you are looking for a film with a good story and good acting, this is a disaster. If you just want to waste money, see this movie instead of watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is an obvious joke. i mean its really not funny, but the ending is pretty stupid, and it looks bad and it's really hard to follow. i know it's a movie, but it's also really bad. it looks like something someone made to be a spoof of a film which was made to ridicule its own director and director. it's bad, but there are some good moments and it has some nice comedy moments. i just wish this had just been a little longer. the way it ends is stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically the "Killer Bride" of "Queen of Spades" style. However, the story is terrible and the acting is bad.  The plot is so contrived that it is impossible to see who the actors are in the scene. This movie also takes itself seriously about the death of "Black Widow" so that is an appropriate reference for a "film" to be about a character's death.  It is the only film I've ever seen to be released with this kind of attitude. It's basically a joke about an evil character in a film about a death that is not interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was a bad sequel to the first installment of this series? You know how it ends? A few years later and it looks like a sequel. The original version of this story is still a good and amusing, but it becomes much less funny when it gets into the dark and dark corners of the internet in the past few years. The sequel gets worse as the characters, character development, and dialogue are nowhere near the level of the first series. I cannot even believe the guy who made this movie is still that crazy in the middle of the show.  The original title is about a guy who gets himself to a mysterious bar that he doesn't recognize because he has his girlfriend (an older woman who is in love with him) to show him how to become "super-spit" so he can get a car stolen for him. In his search for a way to get the car, he gets into his sister's (a lesbian) who is a waitress (a former soldier) and decides to go in with her, but she is also attracted to him. They go out and get married. The bar guy is having a good time, but his girlfriend is freaking crazy about it and starts acting crazy. He gets attacked by the guy and he's dead and is covered in blood. He has a little bit of a mind, but he's probably still a lot of energy and he doesn''t want to be dead. He's not even killed in his first attempt to go straight to prison, which leads to him killing the guy. In the aftermath, he kills his dad in the parking lot, but then he kills the guy, which starts him with his partner, the jokingly named "Terrific" (because he's like a freak!). This leads to a lot more craziness. I don't know who was the guy in the park who killed the waitress (the guy's partner) and who was in the next scene? I really had to think about that. But, to be honest, I was hoping that the guy would be at some point in the sequel. It seemed to be the best thing they could have done.  I can't even believe this guy. If you want to watch it, try it with the original title, even. Then, look at it again, and tell me why this movie stinks so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really interested to see how this was. It was so bad, I thought the movie was so awful. I thought it should be interesting. I did so with the intention of finding it on Amazon. Then I bought it and never looked at it again. I gave up! It was about as good as all other movies in this category. Then it started raining. I bought another movie: "Hollywood" (I bought it for $8) because I was bored.   This movie contains 3 or 4 or so films featuring an assortment of totally bad actors.  I'm a huge fan of "Cannon," and I believe it is an incredibly stupid movie. I just hate that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A story where the lead actress is an evil, murderous sex-cauty monster. I was a young horror fanatic when I heard the film in its preview. I couldn't sit still and watch it. My own mind was on the opposite side. I didn't have time to read the script or read the plot, nor did I have time for a time to take out my DVD! My husband has more information to provide me on this subject, so I have decided to leave it on my shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was simply a bad, over-the-top-rated film, but it could have been made better. If you have any interest in the subject of this film, you would obviously get some interest in this movie. If not, just go watch this bad movie, and get on your horse and forget about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In any way this is a very shallow film to begin with. In fact I thought it was a rather bland, but that's probably because the actors and the script are bad! There are two key elements at the outset that I don't particularly like.  One of them is the idea of the town, that it had a very big mansion in the basement; there was some very good footage of the building - the main characters are the people who built it - but they don't even have a plot!  The second one I didn't liked was the way the film is structured, namely the film starts with the main character - the young guy - getting drunk from a local girl who had fallen into the bathhouse - he then proceeds to his home to get drunk again, and then gets involved in an orgy session.  It seems that most of the time we were treated as the drunk guy, but we don't really get that impression, at all.  The film also contains several things I would have to say are absolutely bad for the movie. It starts to build a storyline - but you're also never left with a complete picture of this town - instead, you get more of the story.  There is no real ending, and the film ends by the end of the day, so it's hard to follow the next day.  How could a film have an ending with a story that is so boring? This one just won't go anywhere.  I think the town of New Vegas is a good concept, but it's also an extremely bad movie, which I wouldn't have taken into serious consideration if I weren't sure there were at least half a million dollars worth of other things it has to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just a poor excuse for a silly little comedy. The main reason for me to watch it was because the acting were good. But even in one of the scenes I felt that the plot was an excuse for the movie to get released and to not have a funny person on it. I felt there were probably more holes in this movie than all the holes in the movie. I guess it's been in the making for about 10 years. This movie doesn't work for the same reason that was the last one, the one of mine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my worst horror movie ever. It was too long and too boring for me and my sister. I really liked the first few minutes of the movie, but now it's so badly edited that it hasn't any suspense. What's the point of the story? The plot is so terrible that there's no suspense, and when it was over I was wondering if it would make it any better. I feel that the movie is so bad it would be an insult to every horror fans out there. In short, I'm sick of this movie and would never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie of the series that I actually liked was for example "Housewife", which was the first movie for a few years. The next movie, "Housemother", is not that good and is almost a rip off of a bad sequel from the first one. The acting is laughable and the dialog is not even funny. One of the most disappointing films ever made. I was expecting something much better from "Housewoman", and I didn't give it the benefit of trying to be funny. It just got lost in me, and it didn't help that it's actually funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie before I actually saw it. I really liked it for the good acting of the main character, the music was decent and they should have made a sequel to the original movie. But this movie just ruined my love of watching it. The acting on it was awful, the story was not that interesting or that the characters were all pretty silly and the main characters were not interesting or were the right kind of person.  This movie was not even a decent movie, there are no good reasons for watching it because it's so bad and I don't know where to start again.  I'm looking for a movie that would be like "Curse of the Dark" where they would have a decent plot, but when this movie is on I can't see a decent story. It really sucked the money out of my ears, and I think it should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about the greatest insult of my life ever received. The first 20 minutes were a short story about the man in the movie, then a full on sequel and so on. The end is very boring, and it starts off as a story but then it ends up acting like a piece of trash and there is little suspense about the story. The ending feels like it was done yesterday and the best movie ever made.  The soundtrack is bad. I can only listen to it in a car without headphones, even the music. I don't think it will cause you to die, but there is a few nice moments that you can't stop from experiencing.   Overall, I give this movie a 1 out of 10, it's a pretty stupid movie that is the least good of the three so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why people here don't watch this movie. I would never recommend this movie unless you have something more to do.  If you're watching it for the "best-of-the-worst" of the movie...the sequel. If you are watching this movie for the movie "The Matrix", or "Iron Man". It's a long movie, and I don\'t recommend this unless you're a "Matrix" fan. The plot is laughable, and the ending is not even interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast seems to have been inspired by their own "crazy" movies.  There are no real plotlines, no real dialogue, not one true person from the lead is ever revealed to us. This movie is the closest thing to an urban legend that has just been dropped into a pile of real garbage for no reason. The cast is totally irrelevant.  This is about as good a trash movie as any of the movies that are about that era.  Some of the older films that have come out in the late 1980s were very interesting, the ones that didn't have so much as one actual person on their team, even some that made it interesting. The ones that had real actors were much better.  The plot is very bad, there's too many obvious similarities with the plot of "Cain and Abel" as a result of its own inspiration, but they have been good.  "Crown" is just the opposite of the ones on the DVD shelf. There is no story or story, the characters are very boring, and the people aren't even capable of making good choices, which are the same kind of movies they make so great.  They seem to be using other influences to the book to make their films seem more interesting. That's the only way to justify a film based on the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is the worst sequel to the original that they had. This is a typical piece of trash that we found in the video store on video store. The music in the song is too hard to listen to and I doubt that it was used in this movie. I think the video release was made after the video was on video release and a lot of the films had more than a 1% effort. I didn't get the most out of the songs but the ones that are there are okay. I did watch one song that was bad because I saw the ending song in the movie. The ending song was so bad that I didn"t even think about stopping the video. The movie ended after the second song was played on video. There is no hope for those that don"t like this movie to even go to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been a fan of this movie. I think it could have been better. I have even managed to watch the "The People Who Go Around", and I find that it was a very good movie. But this movie, apparently, doesn't have a decent ending. They got into a car with someone in California, they're not like the people who are in the movie. They were in the car for a long time, but then they found out that it wasn't a movie anymore. If you see a movie that is bad, and you want to watch it again, don't watch the movie, don of course, just the movie is a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so upset. I was hoping the movie was actually funny, and I wasn't just thinking it was. I couldn't believe it was that stupid. I am a little bit of an older adult, and although I didn't watch this film, it still sounded really stupid. It was also so bad that I didn`t understand the plot. There were certain situations I was surprised to hear such a thing could occur. I don`t think a single line could have been made. A simple conversation could make a movie that could happen. This is not a comedy. It really is an insult. There are no jokes. It is absolutely horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film ever I have ever seen in my life. It's like one movie to have a sequel or three to be compared with this one. It is not worth seeing this movie again since it's only gonna be one film because it's one that I'll miss more than any of the other movies I've watched.  I guess I'll be seeing this film a few days later just as one movie, and I don't think I'll have a positive review about it. I don,  I don. The best way to describe it is that it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had better than a couple of movies. One that stands out is a bunch of people who do nothing but lie about their lives, lie, cheat, and lie to their families.  The movie doesn't have any real plot, and I'm not one who can find out what the hell it is. I'd suggest watching the movie if you're watching a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was laughable, the plot was bad, and the characters were so weak that you couldn't even care if you actually liked them. Also, I felt that the script was not very original at all. The actors were good, but they were totally unrealistic in their acting and dialog. I don't know what they were thinking at the beginning, but I thought it had a very shallow sense of being realistic. I mean, I've seen the TV series I mentioned, so the feeling of reality is conveyed when you watch this movie, but that doesn't really make sense. I think that it was mostly a matter of lack of money for the actors. I would like to see the actors at the end of the movie and ask for all their money back. If they want a job, I don`t need them. This movie was made by a guy who is in his early 30`s, and he was probably in his 30. A couple of his parts in the TV show were pretty good, as the lead, but his talent is not up to the level that he could have gotten from the TV shows. I didn't understand why they would take the money out of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A long story, with the movie ending at the end of the first 10 minutes. The last 20 minutes are a really bad attempt at a horror film.  It just doesn't work. The story is pretty stupid, but there is some tension.  The plot and the characters are OK. They just have a hard time trying to find a decent point of view. There were a couple of interesting supporting characters. Unfortunately, there is just one supporting actor. There is a lot of annoying dialog and a lot too much gore.   I'm sorry. This movie is so bad. It is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My poor review:  This movie should not have been made. A horror film which could only have been easily made if there was something positive about it. I can't even believe that it was made in Canada - I didn't even like it. It was terrible, I was very unhappy. I don't know how a movie is supposed to make, it is just a bunch of teenagers taking a bunch to bed. How can one make out such a terrible film? Just a sad piece of work made on purpose. I want to think, I'm the one who is interested in something else, like horror, but this movie makes me angry, and just because I want something else - like horror movies with a good ending - it makes me scared. And I'm not even willing to admit that the director was willing to finish it, it just shows his lack of interest in the genre he created. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not even a movie; it's a gross joke on a really bad movie that would never make any sense to anyone. There were some good bits in it. But most of the jokes and the scenes were completely absurd and it seems to go straight to the end. Also, I have been having a hard time watching it because I was just reading the comments left by others about it on IMDb.  I would have to give it a 4 out of 10 for a film: 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you are looking for a bad film: watch this movie and see how it is. I wish that it wasn't so bad. I have never cared for a movie to be that bad. It's just bad. The acting is so bad, and the editing is so poor that it can be easily forgotten. It just doesn't matter who the acting is or the story is or even the plot. It should just be a really terrible film that will make people sad. I do recommend to see the original version of this movie, though even that didn't help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch this movie with my brother because he said it was terrible. The only thing I liked was the acting. The acting was laughable and stupid and the story seemed so thin. When it comes to the end there is a huge amount of tension. The last scene should have been the final scene. When you start it is not a shock because you are just watching these people fight. If you liked it then it is a shame really. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand this was some kind of an accident. I can see that the producers tried to make it look real and that is probably why they are all smiling. They don't really care about realism. I mean, they put a bunch of people in the room, and a woman asks if they would do a good movie. So then she asks them if they could get close to him and then she pulls out his neck and starts laughing at him. The movie ended up with this guy, but he never got to finish and you can't say for certain that it wasn't.  So, if you want to laugh, just a little bit. If you want a serious, serious piece of drama, then it's too serious. The other problems with this movie are obvious. The story is weak and it's not even funny. There is nothing to write about in this movie. You are left to guess what happened. You don't get to know the plot. The director is OK for this, but you will need a better story.  The ending is very disappointing and the movie itself was probably a very bad effort.  But if you're tired of watching movies like this, don't bother. There are some excellent movies, but if you like to be entertained, you should start with something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor excuse for a good movie. A plot in a way that could be considered a true story of a young girl who just got her life on the road (and was left there), but was turned into a cliché romance. A few small moments, perhaps more than two seconds, in the film showed that it's a true cliché. In a way, it was like a real life story but the camera moved about, just for the sake of making the film interesting to the viewer. What's more important to the story is the characters' relationship with the other two people.  But the main reason for it was really not to be a story but a comedy/love story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to see an American film that has this one single shot of Michael Caine. This is a complete insult to my country. Michael Cain is a guy who has had a decent career. He has done many good work, but that is not an indication to how he would act in a movie.  The last thing is that Michael Cerveen is going to be the acting hero and you know he is not really an actor.  I can't recommend this film, even though the actors are good and their acting is good. The acting is laughable, there is absolutely no drama. This movie is nothing but an insult to a country that is known for its acting talent but isn't known for it's acting talent.  This movie has a very shallow story line and no tension. Also, the ending is very weak and feels fake, and the fact that it has a pretty good ending just doesn't make it worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a huge horror fan of horror movies. In my first review I found this movie very odd. It is full of cheap jokes and a lack of suspense. The main story is not the one I cared about. I don't think it's funny, but that is what you are getting at. I think a movie should be used to teach people about something or make it funny, which would be a much more entertaining story. I'm not going to get into a "I like horror movies" discussion on this, but there are some interesting things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only recommend one movie: this one is awful, if you like to drink out of your blood, like a whole night, don't buy it. And, if they would like to make some money off a movie, they might make a good movie.  but even if you have to sit out a few hours before watching the movie, you probably won't regret it, but there are only about 100 minutes of this, so don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When a story is told in a movie it is not supposed to be a full story, not even as a part of a plot. If this is a straight-forward film then it's very odd to watch it, as a story simply takes place without anything having occurred, no story is ever established, no character is in fact, and what happens in the story is never considered as the true story.  When this movie is told it is obviously the case that they are telling a story, and if they are there in a story then this is also a story. However it is also the case in an ordinary film that the story happens without the characters having a reaction, or a life in their own way, or that it doesn't happen in a way that is entirely predictable. In this case it was not one of the film's best. In fact it had the largest amount of problems of any of the films I've seen in this year. I have the most sympathy for the producers of this movie, for I understand there is a need for me to be understanding this kind of thing, but the movie failed to grasp this very basic and obvious. It had absolutely no real life. There were no relationship between the characters. There was nothing to tell. The whole film felt like it was about a piece of soap. There wasn't even a story with a happy ending.    There is an attempt at satire by a film: a "smiley girl" films who is very often funny, but it is this film that failed to make any sense whatsoever. It is a film that is full of words, though I don't know how to describe it, but one has to be able to accept it in order to get an overall sense of it. It's very bad, and I don and believe it could have been better made a year ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the preview for this movie at a video store in Los Angeles. I was going to rent it, but I got disgusted by it when I heard the director's name on the screen. But I did buy the movie anyway, because it was in a video shop and I thought I could have fun. But when I rent it I knew it would not be the movie for my family.  This film was even worse than the movie that was in fact made. The acting was bad, the direction was bad and the story was so bad. It's a big, dumb mistake, I mean really, I'm a parent so I could never have children, but if I had to I'd make this movie I would NEVER watch this. There is absolutely nothing to go on here, nothing to watch, and it's not even a film, it's like watching a bad piece of a horror movie that's about as stupid as it could be. A lot of my wife, and family members did not even like it. I can tell that I'd never watch it.  I gave this movie a 1 rating because it wasn't a bad film, but it had to be rated to avoid the fact that it was a big mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to find the reviews that rated this "Pimps Movie" at a "2" (with the same rating as "The Incredible Spiderman"). I was the only one who rated this at 2. It seems to be a case of pure Hollywood stupidity. I have to admit that I have watched this movie twice and the first time I was so angry I was crying at the computer's screen and thinking that it was simply ridiculous and that I was a fool for being so depressed. I mean "that's not even a good movie" and "that they got the ending that is even an interesting and funny. I just watched them in a row so they'd laugh at each other and that's exactly what I had done.   In my opinion this movie is completely stupid and it's totally pointless. I recommend not to see it unless your brain is seriously disturbed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in love with this show and the girl is always happy and the acting and special effects is bad. She is just the same, too mean and vain. She doesn't act in a "safe place", like an actor would act, and she is never happy and she doesn't do nice things. Her body language is stupid. Her hair is stupid and her facial expressions are dumb.  If you are bored to see a stupid film then check out "Naked". This is just an awful, stupid, one-dimensional show and it never becomes funny, and not even really funny.  The movie is not funny for the most part and the show is not good. They must have had some special effects, like when the girl gets raped, and if they did that they would be stupid. But the show has a couple of stupid stunts. When the girl falls on her father, the guy says she needs to die and the guy is sad about it. And when the guys walk into the building and kiss, and the boy is sad because they are trying to get her father to come back, the girl responds to this and says she is sad for the guy's dad. If the guys kiss, she says she's sad. But if they keep falling onto her father there, she's crying. If she falls on the guy, the guys will just turn him in a fight club. There are many things they can do in the show but they just do nothing. But they do make an effort at making the show look funny but don't.   This show is really not funny and I hope the show will get better. It seems that they are just starting to create a comedy show but there is just one scene where they made it look good.  I've watched all of these videos at least once or twice but I cannot recall one funny bit I found so funny. When it becomes boring about halfway through the show they just show the "bad girl" scene in a totally stupid way. I can't believe the show was only for some of the girls who are actually a normal person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to think a negative movie is better than a bad romantic comedy movie. There is no romance. Only one story is the whole story. But the first story (about the time that the characters were in their marriage) is pretty funny. That would be a comedy if the actors didn't act so badly. But they act so well that the story itself seems as weak as a soap opera.  I thought this movie is OK but it's not even OK. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that it had some pretty funny scenes. If you want to see something that has a chance of being funny, it's in here. Don't get this movie unless you're a "funny" person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the story is extremely weak and there is only one good scene (the "Criminal Psycho") that shows the human element that this film failed to deliver. The other half of the film is a fairly unstructured documentary. The two films together are so bad they have a common theme and are so weak that they just don't even make any sense.  But, I don't really give this film much credit for not making any sense in the first half. In fact, I think this film is too depressing. It is a horrible and cruel thing to watch, but it would be nice if it would just show the human side of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two major problems with this film - and both are totally unrelated to the plot, the fact that it's just a movie - and the fact the movie is actually about two men's hearts, so you can't really focus on the main story - but don't let yourself become complacent with it either. The first problem is the fact they are two men who want to be best friends - and that their love is going to be one-year old, and that they just want to break up - not to break it and live with each other. In fact, it's their friendship that is causing everything to break. But that's where you find the film really, and its worst parts. They're two guys who are both very selfish and overly self-righteous - but neither is a good friend. In addition, they are both selfish and too mean. And they do everything the way they want - but it never happens. The fact that they have a "friend" and not a relationship - and because they're both selfish - they are also both very mean and mean.   When the two of them break up, the movie becomes a plot device, and the way is the way to make the film a boring borezade. It's a weak, though - there are many excellent films like that, but they usually have a decent plot - not one that has three plotlines. I'm not a fan of movies that have no plotlines, but it does hurt to see a movie that doesn't even have any plot. The ending is a pretty weak ending - but not a bad ending either. It doesn't really matter whether the movie was good or not, and it doesn't matter if it's a good film or not. This is just a poorly made film. There are so many problems with it, that I don't understand why it's being recommended to people who are interested in making this movie - I don"t think this film is about two guys having an affair with each of them.  The movie ends in an ending that is way worse than a story that could even be made to sound a bit corny - as such a plot is too long, it doesn"t seem like any plot and there is too many plot threads - even when the two guys are both in an altercation, there isn"t enough time to go to finish this film. The movie could be improved by having some story arcs, and getting rid of the end - something
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened in this movie is simply bad. The movie centers on the story of a "slasher", a man who is in a drugstore and is having problems with his girlfriend, who turns him into a "killer".  The only reason the movie works is that there is a "hero", the slasher, a "champion" or a "warrior", in the movie. In fact, the movie was pretty dull. If you think any slasher hero has been made, you'll never have been bored.   There's a point in the story where the "slash" turns up, and the slash kills everyone on the floor. The next scene is a scene where the slashing hero is wearing a black wig. His face is pale, and his body hair is dark, with a sort of blood-like appearance. He is very skinny, with no body fat, and he has huge muscles, and one of his muscles has been ripped open on his neck.  Once again, there is nothing left to do, and there is no way the "hero" in the next scene will kill anybody.  There is a small, but fairly good scene where a slasher is attacking the other slasher. He does not care for him, and tries to push him out of the way, but he keeps going. The Slasher takes his last gasp, killing him. The slasher then starts attacking the guy again, so the other Slasher can't kill him. He then goes on his last rampage, killing everyone on his way.  Of course, the slaser in the room is a woman. The film is so lacking in detail that it is impossible to tell who she is, or whether she is a girl or a man. I was very disappointed with the film for being so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a film to be taken seriously.  The plot of this film is so poor that the only thing that makes it entertaining is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought it was going to be funny at first, but unfortunately there were three scenes in the first 20 minutes. I didn't even really know how to pronounce this movie, just to be able to figure out the words. This movie just sucks off all three of the great actors: David Deacon, John Hurt, Michael Caine, and Alan Bates. I'm not surprised I didn such a bad review, and I'm glad to give it such a low score because I think it's important that this movie isn't simply an embarrassing piece of trash.   There are a few other interesting parts, and some pretty good lines, but most of them seem like they were written on a nap. The music is terrible, and the acting is bad. What can I say? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You might just like a movie: a movie that takes for the name of a movie about a story about a man who murders another man and then kills one of his family members.  But in this version, you really get sucked up in the story... the story is a plot of some people, and the people want to see what happens with the others.  What is that supposed to be?  The plot is, in effect, a horror movie. The reason the people who want to watch it see the movie is because the "people" are evil, and so they want to kill them. I would recommend a more appropriate movie for a horror sequel.  I would also recommend a movie which features a good plot, and features a hero, like Daniel Craig's Superman. It just doesn't have the same kind of "killer" tone that this one has, which makes the movie a complete crap movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie looks a lot like a piece of drama in the first 30 minutes and the rest of the movie looks like an unstructured story. What could be done, is an idea about the existence of a man and how he reacts to life, and the people in the world that he cares about. There are no realistic dialogue, the dialog is just plain boring, and this movie doesn't even have a good theme song. I am sure some people would prefer a more serious movie about how the world works and the nature of life, but unfortunately for most of these people I think this movie is far too shallow and lacks any real ability to tell anything about how life is or to exist, which is very evident in this movie.  A lot of work would be done for this crappy movie if there was a way to make it better. It doesn't look like an interesting film since it doesn't actually show how terrible and sad life really is and it is too bad to be a movie with no real ending and a lot of unnecessary scenes.  If you can't get through the beginning before giving it a good rating it is best in the middle of the third wave of crap movies made. I was hoping to have seen the film before this one and I was going to find the other one on video. I give this movie a 1/10 since it's way too long. I don't think that a "fun" movie like this is suitable for anyone. I wouldn't recommend it to people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not even slightly funny.  I mean, it wasn't funny enough, but they had to be so, it was so predictable. It's really awful, but I'm still watching it and hoping that the movie will bring a chuckle out of me and help me get away from it.  My one word that stands out is the direction of the movies. There is nothing funny. The plot is very bad, but nothing funny except the stupid, stupid way it is presented.  If you like one of the classic "joke" films from the 80s, watch this one because its supposed to be funny. This one has a lot of plot jokes that really are just so out of place, the way the characters are acting and how the other actors are speaking. They aren't funny, just a little bit dull, and there is really not enough material here for me to even laugh.  Overall, I would not recommend this movie because it really didn't do much good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an overrated sequel to a bad film. I was really surprised that they didn't bother making it better. They didn't take advantage of the technology used in the series. In fact, it didn't look that much better than the first film. The story is pretty thin and there are a lot of stupid bits that get you into an early act of rage. I'm sure that some people might enjoy it but most of the dialog is stupid. The ending is predictable and completely pointless and leaves you looking for an end which has never before been seen in the movie.  I'm a big fan of this series, but there are no points where you actually make the decisions that are interesting. It's got to the point where you just want to be bored. I'd avoid it, but don't want to go in for the movie just for the laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be an odd joke. I didn't like the characters, and the whole plot line is just plain stupid. I mean the movie was not funny nor funny, and it was not a funny film, but it was just too long. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the fact that it is the only movie of my life that I found that was stupid. The worst acting in my life was a "dressing up" flick that I thought was funny and hilarious. The best acting was in my youth. The film was just so bad, the only two words I can say are that I saw the characters and the story were interesting. I would never like this movie again. There are worse movies, and there are worse characters, but they are funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been searching this movie for quite a long time and have come across several people who tried to review it. They are not too hard to believe, it's not a good movie, and the writing and acting are bad. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the original cast of the original series. The actors and the actors aren't too good, the dialog, the acting and the direction are not good. The main theme of this film is just an ordinary soap opera, it is not like any other soap opera that I have ever seen.  You have to think it's about the same kind of soap opera.  This film is not a very good film, but I do find it amusing when I watch it. This is not worth a 10, I give it about a 7. This film isn't good for people who like action films like Mad Max or Die Hard or even like Bond movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main thing about the movie was a lack of decent scriptwriting and decent filming. The acting has very little appeal to the viewer. The scenes were also rather poor. I remember this movie was at least somewhat amusing, especially the scene where they built a tunnel to escape from the cold and gas. There were also some awful, completely pointless, movie titles. I also felt the director was overly self-destructive. There is no proper story or story line and the plot was poor. There was even a plot that was very long but ended up taking only 2 minutes to go. The music was poor and most of the time I listened to it I just laughed. The soundtrack was also bad and lacked decent melody and rhythm at times. The movie could have been better than what it was, and I wish it could have had some decent songs and songwriters. There should have been a few better directors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like music, please, beware of this movie. This movie is full of stupid, cheap musical songs and the "music video" is so bad it's hilarious. I was hoping for a "The Music Video" but unfortunately it wasn't. I wish I could have had more music in this film. Some of the songs are good but the song selection just sucks. I'm sure the director is OK, but it is so stupid it hurts your ears. I hope the movie takes the lives of the characters away and never watches them again. I've seen it twice and they are just pathetic. I recommend watching this as a way to ruin a movie for a low price movie: 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad, bad. It starts with a female protagonist who's boss and her sister gets killed and then finds out that her sister was the last one to go, but she has to go home to get her job done. Then she starts being the boss of the office in the movie. (She's the boss! A girl with a big belly and a very big nose!) It's like watching a bad video that has a lot of the same plot and ending but doesn't start with an interesting plot. It has a pretty ridiculous voice cast, even the guy in the video is better than the guy that played the last scene (although I have seen some video that have more interesting plot.)  Oh, and the acting is a very dull, very short scene that could have been good if they made a movie about an animal movie, or even if they just re-mated some of the scenes. The acting is the same as it was in the TV show. It could be a movie or just a re-treatement of some bad movie from the 1950s. I don't really care. But what I do care about is that this is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just wasted my time watching this movie. The ending is stupidly unbelievable and doesn't even make it into a real movie. This film is absolutely bad for any children of the age of 7. I can't even finish watching this. I just hope they can at least make some money off of it. I want to go away from this and my mind was so bad that I nearly fainted the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was about a lot of nonsense. I did enjoy some of the jokes. But the acting was so awful that it could be scary at times. And the ending was stupid. You would be very bored watching this. I didn't bother to watch it because I knew it wasn't a good movie. But it was a very frustrating movie to watch in a video store.  If you want to see a film about a good, old movie: Go to Muppet, the movie where we get the first real life appearance of Chimp Louie.  But if you want a stupid movie: Watch the movie: "Rango Stocking", where a young girl (an over 20 year old girl) begins to make the "Bunnyberry" movie when she's 15. It's a piece of crap that never ends up. It contains some pretty good ideas and dialog that would make the movie much better. But if they were the jokes in the movie, that's not an indication that this is a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie for about an hour and found it pretty entertaining. But as soon as I started watching it I found that the movie was just plain bad, in a bad way. I mean, it's got all the same actors as the earlier ones. But, in retrospect, they're actually pretty good, and the dialogue is stupid, and there were some interesting ideas, like this one where the whole idea is that the people who live in the real world would want to live in a giant dome. But I don't know what the hell that would be like. What they could do with the giant dome? Maybe the people would fly over the sky and have them fly away. But that's all in a good movie, and if you want to kill somebody, there's a lot to like about that movie, but it's pretty crappy, and even worse when you kill people in the way they die in the movie.  There are a few minor funny lines in the story but none of them are funny at all. The plot is really dumb and un-interesting. And I've found the original story had more potential than this one. It would have been better if the story had been told in a movie that actually didn't contain many plot twists, and had some plot twists. It's also kind of a self-contained story with no real plot. The movie is very boring and has no real ending. And that's the last thing I think about it.  The end is about a couple of characters killing off each other character, apparently in a moment of victory. But it's hard to believe. The whole movie is full of long, drawn-out sentences that just don't have a clear ending. The ending is about three minutes long and there's nothing to end there.  What makes the movie so bad is the fact that the ending is the only thing that makes it interesting. You never really find a way in which the character's demise is followed by victory. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the movie that everyone in the world is going to hate when they see this thing. I have been on it since I saw it in school. I hate the movie. I really did want to be a good girl. I was never happy with this movie. In a school, I got into this movie and watched it to get into my studies and got bored in school and my life left me. I finally had it.  I hate this movie! What can I say to say that this movie is a horrible movie.  This movie should not be used to give teenagers their self respect. This is not about a good movie, a good film, a great film etc etc etc. I don't understand how people think the director is coming here and saying that a movie is made up for them. I feel like I'm being attacked by myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have to tell you, but I do feel sorry for it. If you are looking for a movie that looks like the "Cinderella" movie, you'll find a movie much worse than the other "Cain and Jeff" movie. I won't give you any sympathy.  The movie begins with a scene showing a girl taking a bath as she sees her friend, that person to go in and ask to see a doctor. That doctor is actually a bad doctor. After taking the bath, the girl asks about where the doctor wants to go next, and the movie is basically about where that doctor wants the girl to go. In the first scene the girl is a little bit angry, and then she sees the doctor, who is a bad Doctor.  Then the girl tries to take the bath again, but they both end up killing the other person. The girl gets the bath and gets in a car with him, who takes the bath back. But she never really thinks she'll be able to have sex with the other guy, and since then she's very sad.   So the next scene shows the girl, and some of the characters in this movie are just so stupid and stupid.  I'm going to be very honest about my feelings about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has the dubious name of "Bondy" - I can't remember how that happened - I am not a member of the British Film School. I'm a major "Barry" fan, but as an American, the name doesn't help me. I mean it's not very funny to refer to a British movie as "Bitter". It's pretty awful.  Bitter - I guess that's not even possible to call it. And it's even worse with the stupidly awful ending.   The story is... well, I guess it is what you normally call "unwilling", but "un-real", I'm not very strong on that description. But in the end I think it is so absurd it's impossible to sit in a chair. Just as a line character gets ready to speak about how it's "unreal", he or she wakes up from his seat and slumps into the bathroom - well, that's the ending. The characters are completely incoherent, and the direction and plot is so bad it looks like it's actually from the writers.  The acting is not good. It's either awful or very, like I was watching a movie with an air-pressure cleaner spraying out of the room at a bad little movie at a hotel in California. Just about everything about it looks bad, but I can forgive the producers for trying to make a comedy out of this in a bad sense. It could have been much better if they didn't waste money on the original script, but that's what I'm doing.  One thing I was surprised by is that the ending is almost unbelievably stupid.  I mean there's really nothing else that matters. The reason why the ending - and I guess the reason that it would seem so stupid - is because it's a very long ending. It doesn't give a strong sense for the characters. The main character goes about the hotel and gets into a fight with some very stupid dude. He keeps on looking at the same spot for some 30 minutes, looking and listening for the chance to escape. The ending, and I assume it's what he does with the ending, is a kind of lame ending - I'm guessing he does everything for five minutes to finish his job.  It starts off fine, but then all hell's got the killer at the hotel. It should never be long enough for you to get bored. Just the end is too long and it's absolutely pointless.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was simply bad, with the very small cast, and the director was obsessed with the camera work.  Some of the shots were interesting and it's a pity to even hear about this movie. This should be made for a sitcom for some reason.  There were many times when it was funny and other times when the lines were too hard to follow. The soundtrack was bad and I didn't care for this movie with the same lame, dull music track.  Even the cinematography was bad. I've seen some pictures and have seen others. I found the ending pretty hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really awful. In the first scene, the camera is all shaky and the camera shakes and shakes.  It seems like it was put together by someone who wanted to build a decent movie for a Hollywood flick. It's hard to believe that it's being made for the first time. And it's not really a funny movie.  But it does have an interesting concept. What is supposed to be a funny film isn't really funny.  If you're tired of the silly, pointless scenes of "Cars" and "House Of Cards", then this movie will give you an idea. But if you don't have time for a short movie, then you'll be bored by this film. It wasn't fun to watch. It just makes you want to break it apart and throw it into the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My big regret was that this movie wasn't released. I really enjoyed the "Hobes" and I really think that they were amazing at what they were to film. But this movie seemed to be lost in the studio. I felt that it was just a waste of time. I didn't know what the main goal of this movie was going to be, what the idea was going on. It was about a "Hobo" who comes to a remote city to find a place to stay. It seemed that he was to find the nearest city to a place he lives in and to do what he sees as needed to help him get there, and then he has to leave his home and get a ticket to go somewhere else while he continues his journey. I was really annoyed with how he ended up with an entire city on the side of the road, and I don't think it's too much to say that the movie had a story about being there, even though it was interesting to see it. It just got lost in all too much. I don, and have been angry on this film for being so bad. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. It could be interesting to take a look at it, but I'd never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is atrocious and the script is so bad it hurts my eyes. And the director was so desperate to make a decent, even somewhat entertaining documentary that they decided to use actors from their own movies. In that case the actor who made the movie was, like, the most interesting person of all time - David Rummel. However, he was a despicable actor who apparently had no idea that he wasn't a character. The lead, also the most important person in the movie, was Jack Parmeaux, the actor/producer. In fact, despite his acting skills he had a sort of an acting persona that didn't go well in a real life setting - a guy who was sort of self-destructive, who had trouble with his own sanity. It wasn't until after he was dumped by an abusive ex-girlfriend that he finally gave up his acting career.  He seemed to be in some kind of drug induced depression and was in serious trouble with what he was doing in a drug induced situation. And it's hard to relate to Jack Parol because he's never really acted in a movie. He was, in fact, a very good actor but he really had no real talent. In addition, even when he's not in drug induced, he has a long list of problems that he's really had and he just got bored. In other words, no one should ever expect him to be anything of a comedian. In short, the actors are treated like they're not in the movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first few minutes of the movie, I was having an incredibly bad vibe watching it. I couldn't even think of any other movie, that is the kind of bad. I'm not really sure how people with any other taste in movies could watch this movie. The story line is nonsensical and the story is stupid. There was a point in the story where it appeared that he was going to go on and eat and drink and get drunk to help his wife and children. This is the same kind of alcohol you can't get into. He's not supposed to have alcohol problems because he's got a job or have a wife. He should have an excuse for his behavior and he should have a job that would help his family. The movie just wasn't interesting. I tried to keep watching it but ended up feeling like watching some bad movie that could never possibly have been good. This movie does not have the potential to be successful.   I could see no more. This one could be good in other hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My parents both made me this film when I was 6. They tried to teach me to love the kids, but instead I became a little girl. So I'm not sure what the hell this film is about. I guess it has a couple of girls involved in it, but i think that's not all the same. And I'm guessing there's more than one girl involved in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand a movie that has this much, but one with this much should be an entertainment. The music was OK, but I just got bored with it and got bored. The acting was OK but that's the worst part about the whole movie. The storyline was boring, and although I am sure it was pretty interesting, I couldn't enjoy it. If you are looking for a good movie, watch it.  I'd recommend watching this movie if you are bored, but just think that the music is terrible and the acting is bad. If anything is to be done, watch a good TV show, even if it's an adventure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't believe this film to be an original and thus can not say that it was better than the original. I'd like to have some credit, maybe for some of the good things in the original script, or for some good things I've seen it that have better. I was also sad to see it not being released. I don´s even more dismayed because this film was so bad, even more sad because it was such an unfinished movie. What was worse than that, the music wasn´t that good. It was just awful! If this movie had been a sequel to the original, I´ll have to say my next comment about this film is a lie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Mister" was the first movie I ever saw, and I have to give it the worst rating. I know I'm not going to be making any comparisons to this movie, but I just watched it and I could hardly find anything about the plot. The whole plot is very, and very pointless.  The plot is really there for a minute, but a few times the film actually becomes convoluted. The film does lack the ability to have more stories in it. The story is so slow that it's hard to get into the story, and you never find a satisfying ending. I have the feeling that the script is so thin that it doesn't give me anything to enjoy. It just says things, and don't give you the sense that you're going through an emotionally uncomfortable movie.  I found "Bully" so early to watch because I thought it was good. Unfortunately, "MISTER" doesn't quite match up to "Buffy". I think it's more of an art film than an entertainment film, and just about a year ago I really liked it. But it just about kills my interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first film of "In Cold Blood" from 1989 but this film is not a good one. It's pretty bad on several levels. The first time I saw this film I was thinking, Oh, it's an interesting film. I didn't realize that it was an "unfilm", the "In this Place" has some of the same acting styles. I thought that a lot of the time you had to sit and wait for things to get ready to "feel" (the film itself is pretty slow, so I'm not a believer, but I think there's a reason to think that the film has a slower pace) and even then I would assume that the scenes were quite good, and most of the actors were pretty good. But I don't believe that most of them are good or even good actors, as this film lacks the proper structure and pacing.  All in all, it could have been better if the cast and the characters had more interest in what they're saying and making a movie, and not just watching this for a "unmovie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm embarrassed. This is just the worst ever I have ever seen. The most disappointing feature in the history of American film, at least of any other movie I've seen. I thought it might be a documentary about a history of the American civil and slave system. But it just plays on the same premise for the whole of it. I'm surprised that they're even considering a sequel.  It's not good. I know the story of the other movie. But even if you really enjoy the story, it didn't do any real work.   The only good thing about this movie is that the director is actually an interesting actor and he seems to really like this movie. He plays a racist slave and tries to hide his racism, but it doesn't matter that he has done well on this film. He seems to enjoy being in this movie because he's got more money to smoke cigars and have so many nice meals. He's got the life of a former slave, but not the life he could live with more money.  The movie is just a bunch of long shots. The movie was supposed to be a horror movie, and not a horror film. It was supposed like it would be like the B-movie Screamers, which is very good.  In addition, the director seems to not care very much about making any kind of horror movies. He wants to keep his own skin roughy-tough, and he's even willing to use it to create a cinematic sequel. He has said he won't even try to use horror to make a horror story. I have to agree with him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be very bad. The only good parts were in the end-credits. The main thing was the 'crisis' that started the movie. When it ended I was really impressed. The characters seemed to all lack any nuance. The acting was really bad. I have to admit that I really liked the 'Crisis' storyline. That was pretty cute, though the actors really did suck.  There are no decent characters, and no real suspense. The ending is so bad it was impossible to find out how it happened, and the acting is so poor. I give this one a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very poor movie that never made me watch it. It is absolutely stupid and the plot and dialog are bad. I wish I could have seen it to the point where it got me to care more. I don't know where I was when I first discovered this film in the store. I am ashamed to have wasted so much time watching it. I'm sure it has some interesting moments, but this movie really could not be worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be about a little boy who gets his mother drunk out of an early morning party and comes to his father's home. What happened then wasn't obvious. I think the director was completely off the track, and I'm glad I didn't know more. I'm having to spend a couple of days watching the film. If I can get it to one of them, I will try to be a hero. I won't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been listening to this movie, I have only just watched it to its ending and the ending doesn't make any sense at all. How could they have worked it out? I understand that it has to be a comedy, but it really wasn't that funny. It was really awful, but there is nothing to show that the end actually made sense. There was nothing to make a sense. I had just watched this whole movie because it looked interesting, I figured it would be a decent comedy. The ending was a lot longer than usual. The beginning and the end were a lot of noise, just a noise that sounds like a broken tape. It's one of those movies that don't do any good for the first five minutes, but then there's no real reason to expect it to go anywhere else. The camera was just OK, but no direction was put into a proper motion. I'm going to give it a 1, but that's not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how I'd have rated this, because I'd never heard of it. But it has one good feature in it... that would be the acting. The only good feature it has is a woman's vagina. And of course she's completely ridiculous. She's so dumb it would be hard to believe she's all in this. It could have been interesting had the other characters, so she had a different role, and that maybe it wasn't so silly. But what else? The soundtrack is terrible... I think the music director made the soundtrack a lot worse than just playing CDs. Some of the tracks are so bad I didn't even have to listen them, but I thought they could be interesting. What happened in this movie? Well, we all know the first version of this is called "The Black Mirror", and it is an anti-climatic and possibly scary movie. That's what it is! And there's still a bunch of sex scenes that were quite good. I didn�t believe the girls involved were sexually oriented, and I think it was really the girls who were trying to avoid the sex scene. Maybe this is what happens to girls who want to avoid getting into an abortion situation. I've had sex on the Internet, and it always ends with someone getting pregnant, but that doesn't make it less scary. I can guess it was meant for a young teenager with a sense of responsibility. I don�t know how it was supposed to be turned into a horror movie, but the writing was really too much of a horror. It was too scary and depressing, with such awful performances, horrible dialogs, awful gore, and just general stupidity. But all that aside, if you want to see a bad horror movie: you�ll get it, and there isn't anything else. A very different version of the original "Black Mirror" movie, "The Mirror" is a bit better. But not better. It has more originality than the original. The original Black Mirror is still a very good movie, if not for the gasey-applied writing. The director of this movie is an unknown person. You wouldn't believe a person who makes a bad film in a foreign country. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I liked the movies of the 60s, and I was sad after seeing this one. Even though it was good at times, this movie is bad at the time. This movie is really bad. I am upset that it's so bad. There are no real plot lines, no real story, no no real characters, and no real dialog. It all seems like the writers of this movie just wanted to go out and say something, and then just say a negative sentence about another bad movie. This is bad. You will never enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie's acting is so bad, the story is so awful, the plot is so unbelievable it's ridiculous. The film starts off good, but eventually, the ending starts off as an anticapitalated, self-indocted, lamely put-down. The director was apparently on this whole thing for so long and the direction seemed to be completely unsympathetic towards the whole point of the film. Of course, this is the way it was written in the beginning, but that was only half the case. There was no dialogue and no dialog. The music had no musical significance. There were no songs to "sing" and the songs were so badly performed they seemed to have just been forgotten. The best musical score ever recorded, "Cochle," had no music to be heard at all. The scene where Tom is standing and singing (and so the audience can feel the emotions from their shock at the ending) was totally embarrassing. They should have made a new song, or something else to sing about that was more apt. This is so far from the worst movie I have ever seen. The story is just flat and lifeless, it is unbelievable that it has taken so long to finish.  I'm going to re-read the film's end credits, watch the last parts, and the director's remorse for its bad acting and poor direction. If this is a movie about a sad old man, and if he was actually sad, that's more depressing than anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when I saw "House of Paws". And my first thought was how poor the actors in that film were. They seemed like a cross between "House Of Paws" and "House With Dogs" which would be the same actors. And at some point you have to admire their acting skills, like the actors who were in "House", but there are no real scenes to speak of in that movie. I'm a big fan of the characters in "Batman Forever", but I can't say the same about the actors of "House. With Dogs". I don't care about the acting and I just don't want to watch that movie again. I hope people will come up with a better idea than "House with Dogs" or some better way of dealing with bad films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was awful! The story lines were so bad and the acting was so poor that I would not want to waste my time watching it. I think I've seen this more than 10 times and only one movie I had watched.  It was very hard to follow and I had difficulty understanding the characters and the actors. It wasn't as good as the other movies I've been seeing. If they are to have a career in the military then they should really start acting like it. This movie made me sick and disgusted with myself. I had to go to sleep and sleep. I don't really have faith in the acting. I just don't understand why people would send this out to play in public.  I really don't want to read any other comments. But I thought watching this made me want to have more good movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd prefer to compare this movie to a bad porn movie: It wasn't good enough and the writing was bad. But, it was only OK so there was some funny parts. And I don't care, but the ending is pretty stupid. It had some funny lines and some pretty stupid lines but they didn't last long. I'd give this a 2 out 1 if it had a little bit of talent but not much. It is a sad shame that I could not even enjoy the ending and not be able to enjoy anything. But I'll tell you, even so it didn't make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had some good ideas, but the story and acting were just rubbish. I tried to laugh and nod in the end, but that never worked. There were no funny moments whatsoever. There are so many plot lines and unbelievable plots that you just can't tell what is happening. You can tell if one scene was funny or not. A lot of the scenes are not entertaining at all.  I can't say I was surprised because I thought so much about this film. And I'm sure I had some time to kill it. It wasn't even entertaining enough to make me laugh. I really cannot understand why the makers and the studio insist on making it. What happened after all was it? This film is simply a huge waste of time. I don't think this movie is going to be taken seriously. I recommend seeing this film for the hell of it, and for a very short time, but don't buy the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was so bad and so poorly done that even the producer of the movie has said that they had "no idea" that it was a parody of the "Bridging Of The Faith". It turns out to be so stupid and so bad that they hired some random actor to voice the characters. This is not a good comedy, because there's no real suspense or even irony to the comedy in this movie. The film is so bad the cast has no real talent, and the direction is just terrible, even the special effects are poor. If you're an avid baseball fan, this movie should be for you if you're looking for a sports team to root for. Otherwise, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I said, it was very disappointing, but still I can't believe that I would even have liked this movie, considering how many I had. I was expecting a comedy, but I was not, and I did not understand the premise. A very lame script, that only makes the movie worse than a toilet roll. I can easily see why somebody would want to watch this movie. The first scene is obviously a little too long, but the acting is awful, the storyline is absolutely stupid, and there is absolutely nothing to care about it. It is very disappointing to see the way this film was released. I had to leave to finish my movie because I have nothing to do with it. I don't recommend this movie because it is bad for a whole, but even so I was very skeptical about it, at least it was better than the movie I used to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is the same one that was made by "Dance Films" in the 80's! That has to be the most awful movie I have ever seen!! The director and his friends made it out of their own heads, so they are all good, but not even close to making it. And the girls are a disaster as well as the acting. It's a big old "swamp", but the girls didn't really want to make it a great film so they tried.  There was some decent casting in the cast, especially the "Bunny" girl, but she wasn't there for much of the film.  But the rest of the cast is awful!!! What makes me angry is that these people think they are acting with the other people who were in the movie, and that they are trying to act better than the actors. The funny guy was played by a guy who thought he was acting with a "Bunch of Bunnies" actor.  In the end, we all need to be serious about the fact that "DANCE" movies make this type of movies as an entertainment, not for a few good moments of entertainment. It also makes us angry!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing this movie had good was the characters, and of course the acting.  So, there are only 2 actors. I'm not even a great actor, but I've seen plenty of terrible films, so, the actor who can do a good job with acting doesn't matter to me.  The rest is a little funny, like an attempt to recreate the end of "Crisis".    I'm still at the airport and the movie continues. Still, I was amazed that they actually got the money for this movie. It was like a "The Walking Dead" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie so many times and nothing can get me to believe in it. It wasn't really funny at all. I think it would be an interesting idea to see some animal animals fight with each other, but this movie is not funny.  I think the main reason the movie has failed is the fact that it's not really funny. I mean it's pretty dumb. This is a movie that is so bad that it would make a good comedy. I know a lot of people who have seen it and would like to see it, but even if you knew it is a stupid movie, the acting and the humor aren't worth it. The story and storyline are so bad. The fact that the people who make the film were actually people with money and that they were able to get away from the problems in the real world just to live a life they love? That is the saddest thing. The only thing that makes me laugh is how you can watch this movie and the funny nature of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not even a film, just a simple collection of songs. I found it difficult to believe that I could actually care to rent it. I rent one after seeing the opening, and didn't rent another one, after the movie. The film doesn't make much sense, and I can honestly say that it seemed pretty pretentious considering it made for a small movie with a lot of plot. If you want to watch a movie of a cheesy music video, a movie that is mostly incomprehensible, or something that has no plot or meaning whatsoever, don't rent this movie. Otherwise, a pretty low film to be found for a cheap movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my first "funny movie" EVER, I'm a guy who has seen and enjoyed this movie many times. So I'm not going to spoil it for you here. This movie is pretty stupid and bad. The characters are awful, the dialogue is awful, and the entire script isn't that good. I don't know how you can count a good actor or even a good script. And finally, the movie starts with the ending which is pretty un-intrusive, very little more than a paragraph. After seeing it, I was annoyed with the characters. After watching the end I was a little embarrassed, but not enough to care. I was sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very pleased to hear this movie, although it was far less entertaining than I expected.  There is little mystery as to why the plot is so poor. The lead actor is a very unconcerned, uncaring character, and who can barely speak to the viewer.  Even the actor is very bad. He is very thin and can barely look close to a real person. I've seen him in his first movie in 1986, and was surprised that it wasn't his first film. His acting skills were somewhat in line with those of the older actors who were much better than him, such as the women in his film who were in serious situations and very well acted.  However, the lead actor and supporting actors don't stand up. He was very good as a supporting character, but he's no great actor.  The script is too slow, and doesn't allow the characters to show off their acting chops, which could have made some of their scenes much more exciting.  This movie should have at least one person out, not a few. They could have done a better job with a less than good movie.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, but it was at least fun to get out of the theater and go home.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because it was interesting to me, but it was really bad. I don't know why, but I would definitely have to re-enlist any time I'd like to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the reviews, so many times have I seen this movie. I was surprised to see such a lot of people in this movie (the movie was not very good as it was) and as for, the movie is supposed to be a comedy. The movie starts out with a lot as there is, but after about 2/3 of the movie, it falls apart. There are some pretty clear and pretty obvious jokes and a number of plot holes that don't help you much. The ending is also not up to much. If you like this movie, I don't recommend it because the movie isn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was just a disappointment to my ears. I would like to see more.   The film was so bad I can't tell what it is about. I don't know how it could have worked. It's just one bad-looking film and I want to see another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a pretty good movie for some goofy stuff. However, it was very disappointing. The acting is bad, too. The premise of the movie is about a family's reunion that involves some magic tricks to make some magic beans, so you are supposed to be able to believe the family's magic is a real thing. In the original, you had to be very observant about magic, which would make you more curious. You could also be skeptical of magic, but that's not an unreasonable way. In this movie, you have to do your part, even if you can't believe it. You also have to believe that the magic beans are real, and not something you can make yourself, and you have no reason to believe. The idea of a magic bean is kind of ridiculous, but it's not really about the movie itself. The movie is a complete disaster and fails to impress. I just want to be reminded that this movie is not for the serious comedy crowd. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first time I saw this movie, I was put in an instant panic. The story seems to have been put together by some people who were desperate to cash in on it for their own movie. There's a whole bunch of people who seem to want the show to be about something else. The only thing I can say about this is that the director seems to like it as an excuse to make it popular or have it be available to other people. I'm sure I don't have to mention exactly who is responsible for this movie. The name of the director is a mystery and, unfortunately, I can't guess that it has anything to do with the story.   I guess I can explain a few things that I have to say. There are obviously several people who want this movie to be an entertainment, but at the same time, I don´t understand why they want it to be popular. This is like the "Cancellant" type of movie, or some of the movies released in the past decade. It seems to be all about the people who are desperate to make money. I mean, who are these people? It's the "Himps" type, and I don�t know. I'd be very surprised if it was one of the people in charge of this movie or if it were the person who made it. It just seems to happen and it is extremely disappointing, with no good acting, good writing and no good premise.  I don want this show to come out, because I really liked the first one of its five, which was this show. This show is so bad that it should be immediately canceled and it could be easily made to become a series.  The story is about a man who goes on an adventure to find a mysterious island that has some very valuable treasures hidden inside of it. This island is actually a rather large island in the middle of the ocean and they call it Paradise. This adventure is supposed to take place in the desert, which is where a large quantity of sand and minerals are found at Paradise.  There are rumors about it being inhabited by an ancient alien race who want to settle on this island. As they gather for this adventure, they want to get on a colony with the locals and fight them over. The main character, known as "Alphinon," who appears to be a little bit of a teenager, seems to want to be the leader of this tribe and starts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really can't believe how these actors had been put in such a short, no budget, no sets. The actors in the movie could have used some work. This movie could be better than just a few pages of plot. This is just a bad version of a bad, poorly crafted, boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In any other kind of movie I'd be interested to try something similar to a film: a horror movie, but with the twist of a plot and a plot which gets you caught up and down in time. In one part you get a real taste of horror, or maybe a zombie movie. You get to see the movie as a whole, and then realize that it's really not scary. If you want horror and gore, that's what you'll get. You will get bored, and probably give up on the movie. If the plot doesn't go out of your mouth, you'll just sit in the movie and watch, hoping it will never stop. If this movie were to be released as a "B+" comedy, I'd still be interested, but this movie isn't worth that.  It wasn't that good on DVD, but it did its job quite well, and the plot was decent. What happened was that it wasn't the right direction for a movie, and there wasn't even a good script, but rather it just kept getting out of hand. If a story is just about a movie about a horror film, you may have to listen to a movie which looks as a horror, but is it an overrated piece of junk. I can't recommend this film. I would not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the concept that they brought out for their film but this film just fails to deliver what it promised. I mean if they want to be "comedy" they have to deliver a comedy which falls of it's own lack of comedy and most importantly fails to capture a laugh. This film starts out with a very short introduction to this show then goes on a very boring "adventure" with an ending which is supposed to be very funny but the story itself is pretty dull.  I hope they can improve it as a sequel to "SUNTREATAL". They couldn't do that as a comedy but the comedy of this film fails to be funny and at times fails to even give the audience something to laugh at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i did see it on the box and was dismayed, I was disappointed, but it wasn't too bad. However, it wasnno better than just a disappointment. And this is what a movie is supposed to be. Just about half of the way through the film. The story is so poor that it's better to watch the film to be a laugh and take a little bit of the excitement than it was. The dialogue is so bad, the cinematography is so laughable, the acting is so lousy that I'm sorry for those who liked it. The plot is not even what it could have been, as I've always read some of the best films, but the acting was so poor and the dialog was so terrible that it just makes you sick and the movie itself could be very effective. What makes it so bad? It's just plain boring and just has no real value. There are so few decent parts, and even some of them had to be cut and rearranged to make it go. And although it is good for a horror film, it just has such a bad taste that it hurts me that it doesn't make up for such a low rating. If I'm honest, this has got nothing to do with the movie, but I don't know. I know it's supposed to have something else, but don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad video to see. We have to be warned. In this video, you will find it laughable and even gross, and the way the acting is handled is laughable, especially the way they shoot it. In the future the actors will do better.  The acting is bad, but it is good to see a movie that doesn't contain any humor, but still has a few good laughs. But, the acting makes it laughable. The music is pretty stupid as well. The whole film could have been made for a laugh and not actually an accident.   The overall rating for this movie was 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did appreciate it for the times they had some good funny lines, but these guys were just a few. In my opinion, they just don't matter. I am the one person who was truly inspired by the movie, the other person who I thought got the best lines were the two girls who were supposed to be playing. One good line that was good was a couple of lines from the guy who said that the girl was going to "get off." That's not a good movie. And as it turns out, a lot of the actors do the same. I'm not really sure if it was that person or what with the people who had an attitude for the whole movie. The ending is just awful. I cannot recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit, I really liked this movie. But, it was just an OK movie, but it was completely bad in terms of acting. The acting was not in fact "great" and the "greatest" was "CUTCHE" (the first film in the series). Of course, it wasn't "great", since the actors' acting was somewhat lacking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still trying to get this film out of my mind. I have seen no footage. This is the one film I've ever been so sickened of since my father (I mean my dad) was killed in a drug induced crime. No blood, no life, and no time in time.    This movie is not worth what it says on the paper. The best way to tell this film is to look at the movie to see if it has any relevance to life. I did one day see it and I thought the entire film was very, very strange, and not even remotely believable. It had an odd atmosphere. My wife says it is an effort to make this movie seem like an action film with a really big cast. It's just the movie, and the actors have nothing to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's been a few good things this movie has done so far - an interesting story - it's not one about a murder, just about the first time the movie was about a whole bunch of stuff. The fact that the actors have such terrible acting and that the director and the director didn't care about making it look good at all was just a huge waste of time.   What I've watched of it and is this.  It was supposed to be a sequel to the original, but at the time I didn't know if they were making movies about the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie with no real plot. A plot that goes on far too long and then falls down. I think this is not a comedy at all, if you just watched "the first few minutes" of this movie it is obviously a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, that's my introduction to this movie. "Munchies", a hit, but it doesn't have any suspense. "Songs That Never Heard You", a movie with little humor. "Smoky Christmas Eve", a funny but boring Christmas film that made it one of my all time nightmares. "The Pawn Shop Girl", a film that didn't make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm having problems with this film. There are the main characters, and the story has so little to go on, so what do I do? Watch. Do not buy. Avoid. Don't even watch this movie. The plot is so stupid it's not funny. What happened to my dad? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing I found in this film was a couple of good scenes. However, this movie does nothing but annoys and annoys. The plot is so weak that it barely works and makes no sense. The voice actor is also very irritating and irritating and I wish I could have gotten an idea that he actually wants to be a good actor. The movie also has some good moments, although not enough.  I really wonder how this movie made it to work. It is truly, as I said, horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really know what the movie was. But I have seen some of the reviews and they are pretty funny. I thought it was pretty bad, though. I donno know why this movie was never made. And I guess that the producers would never even like to see it, because it's such a bad sequel. I guess it was supposed to make the world a better place by making a sequel. And it's really that bad.  The plot is pretty bad. The story is weak and there's no idea what's happening. There's no clue on what the hell is going on. The whole thing is just a plotless and incoherent mess. I think the reason why this was never really released is because it never got the right director (who was responsible for it, i guess). The movie was only released after it was released in a trailer, so it had to be re-maked in the actual way. And if you can see the movie now, it's not much to compare to other movies.  There are too many of the same shots that look like they are the same, but I guess the reason for this was because it was like a really crappy sequel that is kinda fun to watch. It's one movie where they were afraid to release it. I really hope it doesn't come out again and this would be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was quite poorly put together. The actors were OK, and the plot was mostly good. The story was disappointing and the ending was bad. If you were looking for a film to be just okay, that's a bad choice! This movie is not for the kids. It's not even for adults! You can't even watch it with someone who is a little bit older than a teenager. I don't know how it was that anyone was watching this movie. It was pretty long and not worth watching. I wish it could have been a series of one or two movies for adults like the series of "Holes" or "The American Dream". I'm not sure if there was any way to get this movie out and make it a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first half of this movie I didn't really get it. It wasn't really a true horror movie as much as it was a mumble-muralist-ish parody.  I thought the first part was good. The rest was the same as the first of the film. I just wanted to be sad and angry. I didnno really enjoy this movie and I think it should be turned into a movie that actually has something interesting to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard the name before and figured that I had read this movie at a theater. I saw it on my computer and was taken aback by the terrible acting and the awful camera work. The story line was so bad that it was just pointless. I tried to finish it but found myself falling in love with the ending. It was bad because it failed to give me the answer to what it was supposed to be about "death." I tried hard to think about what it had been about "Death" but it didn't help me understand that there was no actual death. The ending, although interesting, seemed to be the ending of a little child's mind. It just seemed pointless, and disappointing, and very unloved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I started watching this film, I was quite annoyed. I've never seen the original "Honey" film before, and I have to say that I didn't like it in the sequel. I was expecting something better than this horrible sequel. Well, I wasn't disappointed. It was awful and just sad and depressing, but it was only the first movie that I really got interested in. I don't even want to waste my time on it, but I do like other aspects of the movie. The film was terrible, and it took me years of my life to even read it. When I was sitting in the theater during a live-ish performance of "Honeshade", I couldn't stop watching it, and even after I finished it my mind was just as empty as it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you plan to rent this movie, the good news is that it's only about 7 minutes long. The beginning is a predictable plot and plot. There's no suspense whatsoever, and the story takes an unapparently predictable direction.  This movie doesn't make any kind of connection between the people in the film, because they're too passive and almost boring. It is just an interesting study of an extreme, extreme-rightwing extremist who has never cared for the people of the world and whom you want to meet.  I hope that you never rent this thing, as I have heard that it does a good job at the local library, but I highly recommend you avoid it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is bad, the scenes are bad, and the plot is bad. What I think makes this a bad film is that it has a lot of "wacky" personalities in a small town (I'm not going to explain that one) where the towns are all so small that they don't take seriously of the townsfolk. The characters are so badly cast they would never act well. This film is a mess. The film's plot is weak, the acting is terrible, the story doesn't make much sense. The direction of the film is bad and this makes the film a bad example of the "vitamin supplements" crowd and not really a film. The acting doesn't really help the film's credibility either and the characters aren't that good or that well-crafted either. This should never have been an original film and is the sort of a "wah, is that?" film for just about $10. A film like this with a budget and talent to cast can be good and interesting, but I don't think it could have been. This is really a comedy at the worst of all time and has nothing to offer a film that is entertaining or even decent. It should never again be a film unless there's a killer killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie with an almost unnoticeable amount of brain-controlled thrills. But I'm not a stalker! I didn't know if this movie would have any effect on the people that are watching it. I watched it with the help of the internet, and I found the movie to be the same in one part of it, and the rest was so stupid. I also have to admit that there are some funny jokes, like this one:  What the hell happened in the bathroom? And if you're a movie fan, you might not want to watch the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the least funny movies ever made in the whole world. The plot is unbelievable. It is very hard to believe a man in the woods in the middle of nowhere would have any feelings about life. I was amazed that the guy on the cover was a man with a knife. The actors were not even good. I have never seen a movie this awful, and I can't even recommend it. It seems like it was an idea for the filmmakers who wanted to create a comedic film, but when they had no idea what they were making they had a hard time making it. There are so many horrible parts, like an old house in a forest with nothing to do except to fire the dogs. There was absolutely no logic in any of the plot. The camera is terrible. The acting is so bad that it was almost impossible to listen to. I think it was also designed to appeal to those who want to laugh and cry, but it is a bad comedy that's bad in every way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i was watching this movie after my second viewing. I found the main premise was that this movie is not a realistic film. I did not like it and was so disappointed that it could only be made to go to second. I really didn't like it much. It's a bad one that could only stick on second. The main reason I am upset is because the story is so stupid and unrealistic. I do not like movies that have to have one ending, they do not follow the true end. That's a big mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this movie for about an hour and it never seemed to end. I had to leave it on for a few hours, but it was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not even a huge fan of Mr. Leaver and his films and I don't think I'd even have seen it in his best day job. I was shocked that I couldn't watch the entire movie. I tried for the best viewing ever available to the American movie industry but it couldn't muster any interest for the first 2 hours or so. It was simply pointless and there were nothing, not even plot. I didn't like it! I knew it would be terrible for anyone to watch! The acting was just stupid and the film just made no one want to see it. I don`t think that this movie was the worst it is, but I have seen some other terrible movies over the years, so I'm willing to guess it. This movie is not even the worst I've seen. The next one is about the first movie I ever saw, but this is the worst. It is about a man who rapes people in a secluded forest. I think he's guilty of rape! I'll never get bored again... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really a joke of the first decade of the century. I was surprised when I got the last part and got to the end credits of the movie. There is no clue what this movie is about, which is bad for a true horror movie. I would recommend avoiding watching this unless you're a horror lover. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this movie in the late 1980s and thought it was so awful that it was only good to be laughed at. I've seen so many movies that weren't even funny, or actually funny, and I have to say I think that if you look at these movies, you will most likely laugh.  This movie's just like watching a bad joke. It's just so sad! I've laughed when I thought this movie was going to get filmed, and only at the end was I was surprised to see it was being filmed. I'm sure I won't enjoy this movie much. This film isn't even a joke, it's just completely awful. There are some funny moments of a movie, and you can definitely enjoy them, but overall, I found this movie to be a very bad comedy. The worst I've ever seen is 'Cinderella.' That movie is about a stupid old lady that has to marry another stupid old man and tell the guy that there is an opportunity to be paid off for a huge payday loan. Well, that's about it, but it didn't seem to be so bad after seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason this movie is terrible is that it is a poorly conceived piece of fiction, and that it gives a horrible feeling when it is used as a story.  There are many interesting aspects of the story, but the ending is far too vague to make this story real. For example, the ending has all the characters (all the people involved in this) killed and it is all too vague. The storyline does not provide an adequate ending to the story which I would expect to see a more effective story. And the overall movie really doesn't have a plot to work from a story standpoint, because most of the characters in this story are not "characters". This is not a movie about a human being, it is an movie about an animal, and an animal that lives in another world. It doesn't really matter if you love this story, or if you hate it because it isn't well made. If you just want to find the truth about the story itself, you'll lose interest.  The other problem with this movie was that it was a little too long and didn't end up quite properly. There are a few of the "plot" elements that were good, but there are too few of them.  Overall, I think that this is an awful movie. It was just so bad, that it should never have been made. And although I liked it, it didn't provide any sort of good ending.  It's just a shame to have this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of the people who got into this movie because it was one hell of a lot of "wannabe" crap. It's really just a bunch of people who decided to film the proceedings, and a bunch or people who actually liked it. The worst of it is the way it's structured. A character who is one of a bunch, and another who is the other character. There are no character development, no direction, no character growth, and no clue that what is supposed to be happening in the story. I would recommend anyone to avoid this movie, but unfortunately, it doesn't work, and doesn't really deserve it. But if you like a horror movie, you might like this. I think it's also a great disappointment, but if you love the horror genre, it'll make you jump off the deep end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film just wasn't even funny. As in any previous review, this film had me wondering why a "fictional" film would have such an awful plot. I knew the plot was horrible for an American film. Then the plot itself was predictable, and I knew it was not the film I expected. The plot was not funny, nor did the characters (particularly the twins) seem interesting. The lead character is, unfortunately, a horrible actor. I did not care for the character he was given, because I thought that he was the funniest actor he could get. If I had cared for the movie, I would have never watched the movie.  I am a bit surprised that they didn't rush to the nearest theatre to see the film's sales. The only good aspect of the film was a surprisingly good movie trailer.  Overall, it was just a weak film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm not a movie fan of it, but it looks as if it is a copy of the "Kung the Lang" movies. I mean, it is too long. I had to read the subtitles, which were pretty much lacking. I've seen some pictures online and they are OK, but I was hoping the video would have some sort of ending. But, instead, the story seemed to be there in the beginning, and there was no indication of a story. It got a little bit of a rise when the actors and the camera crew decided to make it more realistic with the camera lens angle...then the movie had a few false endings. And the ending, though not bad, is pretty hard to watch! It is pretty slow. I recommend no more to listen to it, because it is pretty bad. I am sure the person who actually wrote this movie is a dork. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only way this movie really works is because it gives you a lot of nothing in terms of plot and character development. In other words, you get nothing to do in terms with character development and dramatic development. The plot is just pointless, and no real plot happens in this movie. It turns out to be just an interesting plot for a bunch of idiots, the movie isn't really a lot for the first 20 minutes. In the last half of the film, I decided to be able to have my ears open and listen for the dialog. But if you are not open to that, I wouldn't recommend you to view this movie, and even if you did, I would never want to watch it. There are also a few moments where the movie starts to seem somewhat funny, but you're never able to make it out. It's also very bad in the last third of the movie, when the gang has to make a major raid on some poor people who want to steal some money. This movie is full of stupid things, and I had to be careful about what I could see in my eyes. I'm not sure if the producers intended to make this movie a funny film, or if it was really intended to be a comedy, or just the sort of "fun" film which doesn't really mean a lot. What a shame!   4 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand what this movie is supposed to be about. It starts off pretty good with the wonderful cast. The rest of the movie is a big disappointment. And the lead actor is no good. In fact, none of the leads is good. You just have to sit and wait to watch it. It's just so sad to see all of the people involved.  It must be sad to those who have the courage to say that the film is funny or funny. Or the people who have courage to sit in a movie theater and watch it, and then try to find some humor in it. I don.t understand how all these people were supposed to play. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is in many ways like "Twin Quay," the only good movie to have in a teen movie made by a British television producer, with the implication that this movie is about a teen who fails to get his life back. In a story line that is supposed to be straight but somehow gets weirdly convoluted, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Instead I recommend watching "Twon Quay" to avoid the "Tweray," which would be more funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's the wrong question:? What's a bad question? If you're the "crazy person" that the "chosenos" have gotten you in the first couple of episodes, you are going to be a part of the movie.  There are a few of you that I believe will have a more interesting and interesting movie coming out over the next few weeks. The main problem with this movie is the fact that the plot doesn't really match the rest of the story, the script is very flat, predictable, and boring, which is annoying.  The only reason that i got interested in this movie was because the "cheez' guy" is one of the two people that has brought it to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of films. I thought this film had at least one good part. But the rest just plain sucked. The story is fairly interesting, though some of the dialog is so bad, it was very annoying. I'm not sure what the premise was. The characters were not all that good, and the dialog was not good. The acting was poor, too. The special effects were bad as well as the camera was bad.  Other than the special effects and a few good special effects (I liked the waterfalls), it really is just plain bad. The film was pretty dull, even worse than this one.   But what about? I like the fact that, like all of the other films that are based on the original books, the book has been adapted to be a movie.  There is nothing else that stands out as good as this one for a movie based on a book. A simple remake of the book is only at best a bad film. I give this film two stars out of 10 and one bad movie. I'd give the film a 1 out of 5, but even though this is pretty awful, the ending is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have liked a better version of the original story, the one with the better actors. But this one doesn't have a great storyline, I just find it difficult to watch. And I think that this movie could've been made much better if it had a different storyline and plot.  The story is about an alcoholic who, after leaving a rehab unit, decides to get drunk again and then go to a bar and get to drink.   The movie starts with his ex-girlfriend (who is an acquaintance) leaving and he tries to make some connections with the bar owner, who is not very nice. He is drunk and leaves the bar with his friend, who seems to be like the "great" guy of the scene. The bar owner doesn't recognize him, but he doesn't want to let him out for revenge, and then he decides to go to see what's happening at the bar.  After the movie, the ex-friend gives him a $50 drink and he goes to his friend who gets the same for him and then they buy him a car. Unfortunately, he is arrested and sent to jail on a false suspicion and has a string of charges and court cases.  Eventually, the movie ends with a car accident and the ex's ex goes to prison for a while and eventually gets off. But, I think it is a bad film. My expectations are that the main character is a "normal" person, a typical alcoholic, and the film focuses on the fact that he is drunk, so it isn't really surprising to see a drunk driving to prison.  This movie really should be made out of pure cynicism, just so it is about a person drinking his way to feel that he should be dead, just to "play the movie" without any drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are quite a few decent moments, and most of the characters are OK but the plot is just not interesting to me. I was very disappointed.  This movie is not a comedy film, but it is a pathetic waste of time. I don't like these types of movies. I'd give this movie a rating of 1, if I could have it for free. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film in school, and I have nothing positive to say about it, it wasn't good and didn't seem to be funny. There are certain elements I cannot stand out because they are actually funny, but I'm not a humorless person, and if you can't stand out funny, then there's nothing to do with it.  It was really disappointing. I thought it would have been a funny film, but it wasn´s like they showed us some movies before they started making it. I really don´t think it would be a comedy. I don´s not one of the best comedy comedies I have ever seen, but there are things you can find funny in. I'm sure it won´t help to go on for more laughs.  There wasn´t one person that could be the funniest person ever, and it wasnít just one person. I tried to laugh, but all of them were so boring, and the whole thing of the movie had me annoyed at the start.  But I will have to try more comedies. The thing is, if you´re a horror movie, you don´n expect a movie to be good, but if you're an action movie, there are plenty of moments that would have you laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have never heard of such films before. You cannot tell me this is a true story... and there's no explanation of what actually happens to the kids. And all the kids look totally crazy... I don't know how they're supposed to act. They were supposed to be a bunch of adults. How come? It turns out like they're all teenagers. I think it's supposed to have a pretty dramatic ending. The film really loses that little bit of its credibility for acting. I didn't want to see the boys being murdered, but this one wasn't close enough. If you're interested in getting this crap, you'll definitely find yourself an experience. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film contains a terrible cast of actors and a bad storyline. I found myself laughing at the ending. A few words that could be used to get me on board with the cast, this film is not good and should not be directed. The story is bad enough, but the acting is awful as well. The casting isn't good either, as we have found that with a few good moments it works, but it's hard to get into the mood. If you don't want to see these actors, you should look at this one. You should give it the worst rating for the film:  If you are going to watch this film, don't. Don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film for one reason and then I thought I'd get sick. But the others did not. A bad story of a plot, that's about half the reason for this film to have been worth. There are no suspense, no tension, no even one single plot. The acting is bad as always. And the music was OK. But even worse when I found out that it was a remake of the 1963 version of "The Great Train", a film which was equally terrible but has more twists. The film is pretty stupid, so don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie when it came out.  Well it was terrible. The first few minutes had me wondering what was going to happen next. The story isn't interesting and I had to sit for another hour and see how it could possibly go.  This movie is a piece of work and should never have been made. I'm sorry to have bought it so I gave my money away for it and didn't waste any time on watching it.  There are some good bits in it, but if you want to see something good you need a little patience. There are so many inconsistencies in the story that I couldn't follow it. There is no redeeming factor here. And no real way to make up for it. A bad movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie once on a cable channel and I was shocked. The most ridiculous scene was a bunch of three men in a cage. Two of them are standing on the cage and the third one is the one that has been sitting in the cage. Then one of those three men is in jail. I laughed and I thought that was funny but I was just sitting in a cell so it wasn't much of a joke. I also think the acting is awful and the script is pretty bad. The plot is about an escape from a jail jail cell and you are in jail and you try to escape and it is your last chance to escape. The ending is about you being killed and you dying but most of the movies end that way. This one is about a bunch, three men, two of them in jail, and it seems as though the third guy is in prison. When you get into jail your life is over and you have a couple of hours where you are thinking about your life and it has been five or so hours since your escape from jail. If you end your life that way it is a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I didn't understand why there was not any good actors in this movie. I think it could be worse than the original movie because I felt like I was left out of the movie! This movie was so bad! I did a small part in it. I did an impressionist performance. The acting was bad as well as the directing was bad. I just think that this movie is so bad that I wish it could get banned. It was so predictable that I had the urge to tear the movie apart and never finish it. The music was terrible. I found the film was so weak that I didn´t know when it was supposed to finish. It really sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was quite pleased to see my favourite movie back again - The Sirens of Death. It was so bad. I never enjoyed this film because it lacked a real plot. It wasn't really a horror film - it was just a series of old stories written from a book that was never really taken seriously. My guess is that this was the'real' way of doing horror. It should have been made as a video-game for Playstation or something - not a movie. What made me think this was a sequel to The Sanguane? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is awful, and the story isn't anything good. A few things worked, but the acting is the lowest rated I've ever heard. The story has no real meaning, and what are they going with the ending?  This movie is awful. Don't waste your time watching it, it is not going anywhere. If you liked "Flesh and Bones", or "The Cellphane Saga" or even "The Stinger", don't waste it for the sake of cheap thrills. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this movie in a good movie: A nice looking girl (L) is a virgin, while an outsider (B) is having a relationship with her. The plot is fairly good and the actors are OK, but the ending is stupid and it's hard to follow. The story is about a love triangle with one girl, the girl with B. The other girl, L, wants to be the best girl, while the outsider, B, wants her to be boring, so she is desperate to keep the girl from having more fun. She becomes bored with the idea and starts trying to see the other girl again.  She wants to try to break B's mind so that he can see her more attractive. He can't get her, but she tries. And she ends up having sex with him and B's parents (and B and B), which leads to them divorcing their relationship. The "fictional" ending isn't there. And there's no other good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Great Highway" is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. It's the least funny I've ever seen from this movie, and this is perhaps the worst I have seen. This is one thing that can't even be rated with a 8 out of 10, but there is one in a bad sequel, and the sequel is not funny. It is also not even funny, because it is completely unbelievable. There is no idea how many shots this movie has gotten. I know the person who made this is the worst guy I've seen, and I won't give him the best rating, but I don't give this movie any rating. This movie is really just a bunch of guys laughing at each other. They're not funny enough.  The cast is terrible, and some of the actors are good, but only in their roles. There are too many bad actors. I'm not going to watch this, but if you want a great movie, you should not watch it. It really should have been released in 2011. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was supposed to be, the idea of a story about a female character getting kidnapped by a king who is obsessed with her. The movie starts in a time where we have not heard the first part of this story, and the girl is going to spend time in his castle to find his wife. He goes on a time-sharing movie called "The Nightmare".  It starts in an ominous room (in the film) where our protagonist, (we're about an ordinary woman, and her husband is king. She is an ordinary, and he goes on his best days looking for her), a woman who looks like her late grandmother is dead and the old king wants to marry her back. And she's not a very nice person.  It is very hard to watch in the first minutes, and then I'm reminded that our story is about a time when there were only two people alive who knew who had been sleeping in that area, and that the king wants them to fight. He's using those two characters to get them to a war with one of his enemies. In this point he uses his royal powers to kidnap a girl who is supposed to have a good relationship with our protagonist and makes a bet that she will follow him into a war. But that relationship ends up being totally worthless for the hero.  So the scene where she goes down in the cellar and meets the king is a very bad scene.  The hero is very weak, and she is really supposed to do the right thing. As she comes down, he is very good and very good with a woman in the castle and he's supposed to give her a nice time for him. The trouble is that she is there alone, so his offer of staying in her castle is completely wasted. She spends the rest of the war talking to the soldiers and then leaving his castle. In the next scene she is forced to fight her father.  But I believe, at first, that the woman is in fact a lady, and in the film she is very plain and very not very good.  As she enters the castle, he's so weak that he can't even care about anyone but himself, and even so, he doesn't do anything to try to win her back, and you have this horrible scene where our hero is forced against her father and beats him. It was supposed that she had been married to her father, but I'm not sure how that happened.  Of course the time is very boring
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As we all know the story arc is one of many so many as is the movie itself - a love triangle that goes wrong, ending with no happy ending.  The film is supposed to be funny, but has just got no humor whatsoever.   One funny scene is the end of the movie when he is in his bed with a woman that doesn't look happy, but is a little bit amusing with the fact that the woman is looking to have sex with him.  Some things do not work well here, like the "I think my wife wants to have her husband out and me is in my office" scene, but it's obvious. The only thing that comes out of it is the "Moo" scene. And it is sad when you realize you are just a little sad about it.  This is really sad when it comes to the end. I really don't like to go through the ending to find out.  I really do feel like they have got the joke about the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been listening to this movie, ever since I saw it on TV the first time and it was pretty bad. I was really upset.  I was hoping that I would get a good review from a good movie but unfortunately, it was just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been so angry at a bad film, not for a movie with a cast of celebrities.  There is some interesting moments, but I found it hard to watch. It's mainly about the acting and acting and not much about the plot, which could have been done in a movie: I thought the main character was simply a villain. The director did a good job of creating an atmosphere of anger, which is all too typical of the genre. The plot is very weak, and the ending left me wishing for a positive review about the movie: instead I think they are asking us to cheer this bad film. It was only moderately good, but we are all wrong.   It's a bad genre, I'd have to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a "one-time film", this is a bad film. No story is told, no dialogs, no action, no anything except a handful of flashbacks of the hero's life. You can't even call it a film! How did these people think they were going to be able to make it entertaining? And I found that they got their inspiration from the classic "Carnack", where the hero was just killing people!  If you haven't seen this film, don't rent it, rent it from a video store, rent them a film, rent something else. Avoid this bad movie, and don't bother it with your kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a few criticisms.  There's not a good movie. In a world where all movies are a little cheesy, this might be a good one. In this one it's not good at all. It's got a lot of stupid lines, the characters were really just not good, the story is pretty bad and a lot worse than the movies we have seen.  Some of the movies I've seen don't have a good ending either and it's always annoying when the ending is good. I hope this movie is never made.  I also find the ending terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for some movie: "The Killing of the Princess" starring Ray Charles, and he was very pretty. The movie was quite long, it's not in the movies. That's where my movie's name was spelled out. The killing of the princess is an unbelievable event. In the movie, the queen is killed, the king is killed. But after they are dead, the movie goes on. But that's not the end of the movie. The story is one thing, which is not being the same with "The Castle of Dr. Death", where you know what happened. It's all about a lot of noise, and a lot that's boring and not about anything. It reminds me of "The Big House". But those two movies are different, and that's ok. What's going to happen now? What if it's a horror movie?  I'm not really interested in this movie, but I don't think it's going anywhere. It is just one bad movie, no other way to describe it. I recommend a different movie, so my advice for anyone out there interested in a horror film:  This movie isn't funny, and it certainly isn't a good movie. It wasn't any better than "House of Black). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, it's terrible story-line. It's boring and I can't find out what happened in it. The main character is the one who is supposed to have a lot of respect, not that she had any respect for the guy before. That's all for her.  Second, the only person that is even remotely interesting in this film is a girl who has been raised by a woman who she is afraid of.  Third, there's nothing to be scared of. And there's a huge glaringly stupid ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film's director, and fellow producers from all other studios, are not even aware of the fact that this film was the biggest bank bank robbery ever made.  The director tries to use a very specific word in the title of the film:'money'.  It is obvious that the director is doing the same thing that he did in "The Money House". The film also shows the man who stole the money in the previous installment.  It also shows him as a very rude, inconsiderate, and stupid man. It also seems as though the director was trying to portray him as having some kind of "respect".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not have laughed at the lack of a "big, fat, fat boy", or even "big fat boy!" if there were other way to do this. I can't see anything in this movie that has not made me laugh with the slightest effort. My children and I all of us had more than just a few laughs at the way that the people who want to be a big fat boy can put off on what the writer's wish. You want a big, fat fat boy? The first movie starts off with two big fat boys in a pool, and we are watching them swim, and the scene comes to a close in time. When this movie ended, the writer, Michael Richardson, said the movie would be a movie about "big big fat men, who didn't understand how to swim, who were only interested in swimming". He said that fat men were only fat in the movie. There are no fat men in this one. The second movie is about big fat males who act like big fat guys. The third movie is the sequel of a good movie, "Big Fat Men", and we're once again subjected to the same fat men.  When the film ended, Richardson told him that he was sorry about the film, which I agree with the writer. The writer was probably guilty of the lack making me laugh at the writers' wish. This was a total disappointment. The movie is also very short, although it is a good looking movie, and doesn't make the effort to finish a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is what movies are made in Hollywood these days. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie looks pretty good but it is so bad it is not that appealing to any age. I don't know if I saw this before it came out, I have seen it in video stores, DVD rentals and even used it as a stand-up for a local show. In my opinion this is terrible! I am glad I didn't see it on the air but it did not seem to have any effect on me in any way whatsoever. It has been around since the early 1980s, but this is not one that I will ever see. You'd think that all that is happening is the title! It makes for a really bad movie for any viewer. Don't look at it if you want to see more of this film or have a friend with a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, all the women were all evil monsters and had a sad and sad sex life. The plot of the movie is pretty simple and nothing special happened at all. The actors are average, stupid and pretty dull, so it is hard to get anything out of it. But the special thing was a pretty good gag. It was pretty obvious that some of the actors didn't know how to act properly.  The movie is only about 90 minutes long and not worth the time to waste. All the women are so stupid and don't act in any way well. They don't think of anything except sex and that's about it.  It would be better if the actors used more talent to make the scenes funny but unfortunately we only got a few minutes of special time in the movie and it didn't make any difference. It is really just a waste of time. This is the only thing I can recommend for some fans of the book but I am a bit sick of these movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't enjoy this movie, but I did care to see it. I just thought that the movie had no substance to anything, and it didn't make me watch it.   The plot, however, seemed to contain several hidden meanings that would be interesting to me. The story wasn't terribly interesting or suspenseful, and the special effects could be interesting, if they actually existed. There were too many questions about the ending, and I was too much concerned about the message that the people inside the theatre were telling the world. I didn't feel like there was a lot to say in the end. At the same time, I was impressed with the cinematography of the film.  The acting wasn't good. The ending wasn't either interesting or exciting enough. I was disappointed by the special effect when it turned off. I wasn't able to look at the special feature on DVD, so this movie isn't available for a home video copy, either.  I don't expect a high rating for this bad movie, considering it was one of my favourite movies ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to know what the reviewers are looking for. Maybe they want to make a movie based on "Munch's Sausendary" but this is about as good as the movie "Babes of Babes". I'm sure "Babbes of Rabes" was an interesting project and the premise was interesting but it wasn't a thriller. In fact, it was just a pretty bad movie and nothing is quite good about it.  The movie starts off with a cute moment, about the way the character was running his business and when he was leaving with his new "girlfriend". He asks her, "When are you going to work?" to him, but he's a real idiot and she doesn't answer. They end up working together again, which is not a bad thing, although the only thing that is so bad is the fact that the actress is not in a position to be a good actor.  Anyway, that's about it, as she runs off in a car with her new girlfriend and they have a car in front of them. She runs it up to a hotel, and when they leave, the hotel security is on the way to their hotel and she's left in the room. But it turns out that he has a couple of women in the hotel in the car with him, the same kind of car that he's driving and has to drive them back to their place. She's still playing by her own rules and we can hear from their hotel security that the woman has a bad temper. She gets in the driver's seat and leaves the car, but it turns a problem when the guy starts driving and the car starts screaming out loud and the women who's been in the bathroom screaming her off.  I can't believe anyone would even have to take the chance of trying to remake this movie because it didn't have anything to say for it to be an interesting movie. The characters are boring and the acting wasn't really good. They just have nothing to do but be a pair of people that act in a bunch of hotel rooms.  Maybe a better version could be made. I'm not sure that the movie has anything good about the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when it was on Netflix last week, and I have nothing positive to say about it, but... it's just so bad! I thought this movie was about a little story of "Ace" (the daughter) and her father and his mysterious mysterious stepdaughter(that's always been kinda sad in the past) and how a father-daughter relationship develops. This movie had a lot of really bad jokes, and most of the plot lines were pretty stupid and not funny, and the ending seemed to take straight as you had to start asking yourself questions about who was the father and who was a girl. The acting was poor, too, and some of the acting was pretty stupid, and there were really a lot more jokes, but if you don't have any ideas about the plot, or what was going on, I'd recommend you skip watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the movie is that a group of American soldiers, men and women, are in the middle of a training camp when they are attacked by the Japanese soldiers and killed by them. The Japanese soldier is dead, the women and man die in the process of leaving the camp.  The idea of a man dying in a training drill seems like a reasonable explanation to us, except in a modern, politically-stereotypical manner, a story of these events is not even presented, and we're left wondering how exactly it was a training mission, why were Japanese soldiers trying to kill American soldiers in their training camps? The movie starts off by presenting two women wearing sunglasses in a tent camp, who are killed in a firefight while their camp is attacked by some members of a foreign soldiers.  This does nothing to justify the events, but in the past few minutes they are apparently alive and well alive, presumably alive because they can see and hear the Japanese soldier before attacking their camp. This is a pretty lousy movie. And the ending is quite boring, and there is not enough evidence to suggest that any of the soldiers in this movie were killed, and even worse, the ending was quite unsatisfactory.  But the best part of the film was about the ending. The final scene, at the end of the night, is the Japanese army soldier who died in a drill with his family, in his own home, with a Japanese women and two American women wearing camouflage clothing and in their respective roles.  They were apparently taking revenge.  He is clearly in pain, with his wife and mother trying to comfort him, and clearly he's in a position to fight. However, it is impossible to see how he was dying and yet still living for a moment.  If anything, this was a story about how the Japanese are making an effort to become allies with America, because it's the only way they can be allies. The people that were supposed to be enemies just killed their opponents. The rest of the actors and the crew seemed to think this would be a cool story, or even better, a sort of comedic story, so the ending actually works in a depressing way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was supposed to be a comedy. I had hoped the "Papozzanator" was something like a "Buddy Law" movie where a group of guys who can't use weapons and can't leave their apartments because their arms are becoming a weapon. I thought they were acting in a funny manner, but it turns out that they weren't in a "funny" manner. The characters were terrible and the dialog were awful. I can't say how many times I laughed at the scene when the movie started that made me laugh. I would definitely recommend this movie for a couple of cheap laugh, but not as a comedy, and not a comedy of a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible movie.  The premise was pretty good, and I laughed out at the very stupid line about the old man, the old woman and the old dog. But it's hard to blame those people.  This movie would have made a great movie if it didn't have so many ridiculous dialogs. I mean, come on, the actress can't be expected to be in a good comedy, but it sure was annoying. And there's a couple of lousy dialogs involving all the characters. The director tried to take it down a notch, and he also tries to get the best actors to work with him. The other two guys who are in the film are pretty good. But the other two just didn't take. The acting is terrible, not the least part of comedy in this movie but the most stupid part.  There's no real comedy in it, but you should really avoid it if you like movies with characters that are supposed to be funny.  It should be rated low for children's films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a fan of a bad series, watch it. It's pretty, but it's a terrible, self-destructive, self contained, and self-imposed series. It contains only two decent ideas, and even one of them is pretty amusing. The worst part of this is the way the filmmakers seem to be trying to make a funny film out of it. The two jokes they throw in are ridiculous, but I can't see how they're meant to be funny, or whether they're actually funny or not, but what is that? The funny thing about the first one is that the joke was very self-aware. If you look at the first two jokes, they aren't funny at all. The second joke is about an actual movie character (that's a joke that is a little funny, but not funny), and the third joke is a literal movie character. If they were interested in making funny movies, then they should have gotten something better than a sequel to a comedy series.   Don't waste your time watching this, unless you really want to see more stories from the very mediocre series. Avoid! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is pretty weak, the acting is weak, and the story is weak. The film is very unsatisfying, and I cannot say anything positive about this movie, I have to warn anyone who sees it to avoid it, unless you actually enjoy movies. It is not as good as 'The Matrix' which I can guarantee is. The dialogue is pretty bad, and there are no good scenes. I will never go to watch this movie again, and my rating of this movie is a 1. It would be better in the 90's, so a 3 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really surprised that they didn't even want to talk to the director (who made this piece about a film about an elderly woman's dream, and the film was so bad that the plot was never explained). They just ignored him, and he made some of the film's best jokes.  In the end, I think that there is no need for a sequel. It would have been hilarious to see the characters of the original film at least try to avoid falling into their old habits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one is easily the worst film I have ever seen. It starts with this unbelievably stupid scene involving a bunch of teenagers and then ends with the story being completely nonsensical. The story is, of course, pretty good. It has some good laughs and one or two good moments. But the story is completely incoherent and the direction is awful to watch. The acting is the same as in the previous movie: bad, predictable, and boring. There is absolutely no humor here! The characters are very dull and the dialogues aren't funny at all. And of course it has a completely terrible ending.  It's only worth noting that it was rated "WOW" by IMDb!!! Who the hell is rating a bad film? I guess IMDb only rated this in a low grade. But I guess there are some fans that like it, anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My big regret was not watching this film. I'm a sucker for such a lousy piece of junk. I can even imagine it's got a few laughs, but it has such a bad story. I just can't figure out how this film can have any meaning. It's just a slap in the face for the people who don't want to see it. The characters are terrible and the directing is a total mess. I would've stopped watching it in a second.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie that I watched was quite boring. There were two girls (Marisa Shekard and Kaye Walker) that were supposed to be in the same story line. As a result, it was a disappointment when it ended. The idea of "Worst Girls" is not very funny. I was very frustrated, but it is still a fun movie. There is a little too many flashbacks of the people involved in the "Wastes World", and the way the story ends. There are also too many twists in the story. The scene where Faye Walker meets Marisa in the hospital and takes her mother's clothes and gives it to Marisa's father (also a neighbor!) is stupid. I laughed out loud and the whole idea was very weak. My favorite part of this movie was that the story and characters were way too unbelievable. This movie does not qualify as the "worst" documentary ever made. There might have been a better film in this category. However, I would never look for any of the other shows that have this name. It is just a bad documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty bad. I'm really sick of all of these guys who do this kind of crap. But I've always thought the guy who did this made it for the same reasons. I thought the other guy doing it was interesting in some way, in that he seemed to be a genuine believer in the world of science. If that's not the case, then I don't understand why. But, it's better than just being a complete idiot and wasting time and money.  But when I saw the way in the plot this was so bad I actually started crying. I was sad to see such awful garbage. And the way the characters act in the movie really shows how worthless they are. If you like watching the movie, don't put any money in it. I don.t. It's not a real movie. It is just an effort to give the impression of a movie, nothing more.  The only thing is that it's not funny at all. It has just got a big ugly mouth to hold up a pretense. I think there's an opportunity to make a better movie, but I think it's way too serious and so far from being funny. I really want to see it again, but not for a long time. I only hope that it becomes a lot better than it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's just a huge waste of time, I mean I'm only 6 years old. It is simply pointless to see this. I don't even bother with anything else in this movie, it just seemed like a waste of money. If I were a man or a woman who had taken my life in seriously and then wanted to learn how to behave like this so I could behave like a man, I would never have seen this movie. It seems to just be a bunch of people acting off as if they were really in "No Way Out" mode. I was also bothered by the fact that the actress was so annoying that her voice sounded like a dog's heart. I hate it, she is a little bitch. I mean really I didn't know what she was about, but I had to read the reviews. So I was going to watch it and was very disappointed. I didn be able to make much sense of this movie...the ending could have been a little longer than one hour, so that I could finish it off in that time. But if I was an adult and watching it, I'd think it would have a really interesting plot. I know that in the future, this is a really good movie for kids but it just wasn't as funny as this movie is now. But in the end it just doesn't work. I guess a good movie can be short, but that's not usually true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I've never seen a film that had such an over-riding sense of absurdity, and even if I were to watch it again, I wouldn't really want to. This is so bad that I almost wonder why the director decided to make it. I don't know what it is about this movie, but I can guess. The plot is so weak that it can't be easily understood by even the most avid viewers. There's so much nonsense that you wonder how anyone could even think that someone would actually end this way.   I've seen this movie before, and I don\'t understand how it could have worked. The main thing is that the acting is so poor that it's just terrible that it doesn't work. Also, there aren't enough jokes. The acting is bad. I have to say that the actor who has done this is so stupid that he could not even get his acting right.  If you have any interest in this film, don't do it. It's just an hour of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie a few weeks after it came out. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is absolutely awful! The movie is so bad that it is impossible to listen to the dialog. I read the movie in a very short time, and I was hoping to watch it again, but I couldn't. I wasn't a movie lover; I was just a simple person who would read one more movie. But I did go to a local movie theater and listen to one of their actors. Unfortunately, this movie is terrible. It doesn't make any sense at all.  The movie starts with a scene where a guy walks into an old building to a restaurant in the city that's a secret. There's a very long story line. And, no matter how hard the actor is, they don't get a decent ending. This movie was badly made, and it doesn't hold a candle to the horror movies of the past, such as "Die Beyond". This movie is even worse than the old "Die-Bison" movies, which had plenty of gore. The movie was made only to be "fun" and not for "the old horror fans". It is just a bad sequel.   But there is some good stuff in the movie. I liked the first scene where there was a guy who died in an alley and had his hair stuck in a bunch of needles and a bunch, so he looked like he had no legs.  This movie might be worth a good laugh to have, but unfortunately it wasn't good for me to watch.  I would avoid it if I was a good movie lover. I didn't see anything at all, and most of the dialogue in the film is stupid. I find it pointless, and some scenes just seem silly. You might actually find yourself laughing, and that would be better for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, what could have been expected? What could have happened with the film?  There are many things to say about this movie, but in the end, it made me so depressed. This movie was bad on every possible level.  There is nothing in this film that is worth seeing, that's why I started my negative review. The film was so bad in every sense that it was so poorly made. The music was bad, the editing was bad and the acting was bad.  The point of my review is that I don't recommend this movie unless you really love horror flicks or g-punk music in general. I don\'t recommend this to a person that wants to see a movie like this. If you want a horror movie then go and buy the sequel for yourself. This isn't even a good film, it's just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watched this film in France (in late 2008), I was dismayed to find that it was so bad that it needed to be shown in France.  The first problem I noticed is that most of the scenes were very bad and the movie was not well shot and edited.  In addition to the bad acting, the story was pretty bad.  But in the end, it was not a bad film at all, it seemed to be about a film about a very boring movie about a boring movie. That was enough to make the whole film about boring.  It has a plot that is a waste of time and does not really address any point of interest. It also contains some pretty stupid scenes. And the fact that it is so bad in France is very obvious.  If you get interested about watching this film, don't bother. It's not a good movie. It is so much worse than a lot of French films made about mediocre movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very disappointing, I am sorry to say this so many times, and I really don't think people like this film. It is very bad, there is no tension, and no suspense.  Also, I wish the actors didn't take this role in the real life. They acted very poorly, it seemed to be an attempt to make a film that is like "Wings of Stuttering." They didn't want to lose something of their career.  In short, I think this movie is a piece of trash, and it won't make any funny jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was amazed after I found out that this movie was so bad that it actually had some decent acting in it. It should have been banned for it and made for the other shows. It could have easily been banned without much fuss. The acting was very bland and predictable, and nothing about the plot was believable. The fact that there were so many false endings is even worse! The one redeeming part was the acting, but even that could be expected. A bunch of idiots and idiots from New Line Theater were in character, but no one is good.  The only thing it did well was some decent humor. I hope that the makers of this movie will never make another version of this kind of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You never get used to such things, because when you do it, you actually get used.  In the end it's a little too contrived, there are too many plot twists and plot twists, the acting is too predictable and there's not much suspense. In addition, it's boring. I usually like to look at shows that are good and get in there. If you want something that has a good storyline, you have to watch and wait. You just don't need to.  I guess I'll have to wait to see more of this. This movie is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am at the point of listening to this movie as I have ever heard it. I thought I was watching the first one to see, and I still do.  I know I'm not a movie buff, but I thought this was awful. There is no clue to the movie as to how it is being brought to the screen, not even a clue to its existence and origins. I'm embarrassed to see the name of a movie called 'I'm going to be Homeless!' I can't believe it was a real film. It is pathetic that this movie made the name a movie! It sounds like a soap movie made in a high school and had a director who was inexperienced with film making. The 'I' that is supposed to be the film has been ruined for me. If you like to watch a bad-movie, don't listen to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can watch a movie: watch it with your friend. It's so bad, it's really hard to watch it. I give one quick warning: the movie is so bad that it doesn't have any redeeming quality. You can't laugh or even cry at the movie. It has an obvious plot and no real storyline to justify the movie, and the ending is just so sad. Some people say that the movie was so funny, but that's about all they've ever seen. They're probably like me.   I'm so sad that I wasted my time watching this bad movie. I've seen some good movies, but I don't want those.  If anyone wants to get some extra enjoyment out of this movie, don't buy it. Just don't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really despise these guys. When I watched this movie I had to agree with every point and there are no point to say that it was a good movie.  The ending is really lame and the dialog is really bad. It's really the worst thing ever I've seen. It seemed like it was written and filmed by a person who had a very low standard for acting. It could have been funnier, but don't mind me.  Overall, I couldn't recommend this movie for anyone. I really think a movie like this isn't as a film. It is more like a bad version of a movie: there are too many holes, not enough dialog, and the plot seems to be on the verge of collapse. There is no good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, but this movie isn't funny! It looks a bit mean and pretentious, but I guess it wasn't necessarily that great. I guess I'm guessing that the director was simply taking their inspiration from a bunch of films. Maybe that's why they were trying to mimic the classic comedies of the '60's and '70's. The funny ones weren't funny because they were based off of '70s comedies, the ones who made comedies like "Burt" and "Pimp" weren't making funny, so it was impossible to mimic them. And this is a lot of old wobbish humour. I just want to see something that makes the viewer laugh, because it has a couple of ridiculous moments. It's just not funny, and the way the story plays out looks like it was done in the '70' when they were making movies. It doesn't really seem like a work of fiction, but that's what we were looking for after all.   The best thing about this movie was the acting, but it was sad when the movie was done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand the concept. "The Office" is supposed to be a funny film, but this movie didn't really care that much. In my opinion, it's really a very dull and not well acted. The scenes are very bad, and the characters are not funny, either. In a way, this movie is worse than just one of many films.   If you're looking for a laugh, I recommend you avoid "The House of Cards" (because, while it may be an amusing movie, it doesn't quite qualify as a family film). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was one of many mis-perceived or over-appraised movies. It was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and it's not so bad because it was only a movie; it was a piece of garbage. I remember seeing the movie and laughing at the end when the movie came out, even though I'm sure it was an interesting movie to watch. I was disappointed in how badly it was produced, in spite of a pretty good plot, acting, and pretty good story line. I expected it to be good but it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a copy of the original "Shots", which is about a man in a movie who turns into an animal with no purpose, though he is not a monster or a monster.  When the movie starts, you get the movie title, the setting, the acting, the pacing and the acting are bad. Everything about the plot is just awful. The female lead in the movie has nothing in common with a female leading character, and even when you are just watching the movie, the movie is annoying and utterly unnecessary. I'm sure that you are a good person, but you should only go out of your skin. This movie was so bad that the producers were so embarrassed by it that they had to change the plot to a new one.  The plot was obviously recycled from the original, but we did get the same plot in "Shot".  It's also impossible to avoid watching the scene where one of the characters is shooting an animal, and one is screaming after the animal is shot. I didn't want to watch this movie. It was absolutely awful. I don't know what happened after the first time, but I'm not sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I got back to my room late yesterday I just couldn't find anything to add about this movie. I had seen it for the first time a couple hours ago but just didn't like it. I didn't get all the way into this movie since it was very disappointing. There was some cute scenes. There wasn't even an ending. I know I'm being cheated. And I don't understand why it's so bad to not only be spoiled. There is so much work on this movie that it just had to go in one end and that would be the ending. The worst part of this movie was that the whole time I couldn't figure out that it was going to end. I saw the end of the movie and I had my fingers crossed one way or another. After it was over I didnno where to go. I wasn't expecting to see a very good movie. A little girl was in a room with a very nice dad. The boy just didnno want to leave. I found out in the book and the book said this was about a little girl that she and a friend, called, had a baby. It was about an hour or so of screen time and I figured out the end. But this movie could have been a better movie. The movie could get better. There could have made more money for it. It doesn't matter what the writer put in there. There should have been some real money to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie an 8 because it is so bad that I didn't want to watch it. The actors are so bad they can't hold a script together and the story is so shallow that I can't believe it's being made, not even though this is a pretty decent film. The acting is so poor the acting is bad and the soundtrack is pretty awful. The cinematography is also poor. Overall the movie is bad, but the characters are good and I think the director/writer should have listened to them. The point is to use them as your main source. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to see this movie for the first time and was shocked to find it was a horror flick. That is the first bad thing I found. The acting was terrible, the story was pretty poor, and the music was so bad, that I felt like a "piece of gum". Even worse than the previous two movies I watched, but it didn't hurt anyones self.  I think this movie is a gross waste of time, and I am a sad person. This movie is not to be recommended to people, or anyone who does not like horror movies. I was shocked, and ashamed. I gave this movie 4/1 out of 10 stars out of the 10 I've rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie and was appalled and very annoyed by it. The script is pretty predictable and the acting is painfully awful. I do recommend this movie for anyone who has ever had sex with a man. Avoid if you ever have to have sex with anyone and/or just want to masturbate. I know my partner is a man, but this movie just shows him to be so boring! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have really hated the director of this film - his style is just so bad it's not even worth commenting on - the movie doesn't even come close to the first installment of the comic book which was a pretty good, but it's got worse and worse. I really want to give this guy the last chance of dying. The scene at the beginning is very stupid - I think it has to be used on television for a reason. The ending is very unbelievable - the whole movie has a very fake ending. This movie just doesn't have any relevance at all - it's just an awful piece of video-crap. I don't understand why this guy keeps on making these kinds of movies and the end is the only reason to stop his films - he's doing it so much better in films. The video was so bad I couldn't even sit and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the movie because it was interesting, and I saw a positive review for it. But when I saw the DVD I was a little bit scared at the idea that this movie would be a huge flop. It turns out to be so bad. My rating is 2 out of 10. I'm sorry, if you think there was any good movie in this film, you are probably a sucker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a major fan of "King of the Jungle" series I can't begin to tell why this isn't a film. I'm a big fan of the series and my favorite character is the king. The first few seasons of the movie were OK, the third one was OK, but this one was just OK. I want to be honest and say this is not "King", the king had his own palace and was having the "Kingdom" all to himself. If you disagree with the king you have to realize that these characters are all making the same kind of money; not making enough money for each piece of the island.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first paragraph I would have recommended the movie to be the movie "Wampers in the World" and the "The World Warrior". I think they could have done better at the first scene that they made in the beginning of the movie.  I was watching this movie and was really annoyed by how much they were in the first. I felt like watching a lot of this movie because of the fact that it wasn't really a "great" movie, but it wasnso close to being a bad one! In fact it wasncom was very bad! What a great idea to see a movie like this! I mean I was really impressed that they got all the characters killed, but that didn't make up for the fact the film was so stupid it didn't really work.  The story is pretty stupid, I'd say. The story of the Wampers (who is a huge dork, and he was a former soldier) trying to get revenge on the members of the "World Warrior" crew. But in the end the characters just don't get anywhere.  If you have the idea of a story, don't watch this movie, don your life and don't listen to it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen. I am so upset, I am not even sure what to say about this movie. I have had fun watching it before, because it was a pretty decent film, but it was just plain awful after it was over. I feel like the acting was really bad, and there is nothing decent at all. The music was awful as well, too.  I am going to miss all my Christmas parties, and even worse, my entire family is sick and tired from it. I really just want to put this movie behind it and get something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one took me back in the 70's, but I've been here in the late 1970's. Still, this is the best thing I've ever seen in a bad film - a total trash-shaking horror. I remember the scene when they used a helicopter to fly over the movie, with the first five shots, but none of the next eight shots. The director and the cinematographers were so bad, so bad that they were making a mockery of the art of film-making! If you read the book or the movie in a good movie: Don't watch this crap! The acting was bad - I'm pretty sure that's all the people in this movie. It would be a good action movie if it were used in a real movie, but this is just another cheap action movie that can't be put into a genuine film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director's intention of taking a 'workable' film, or something more like a 'light flick' rather than the'mimbo,' (the way it is in the book), is completely misplaced. The story is pretty dull and a bit of it is quite cheesy. Also, the acting is not good but there are times where the actors seem to have got a real job in their scenes. I was really not that thrilled to see the old 'Bourget' movie. Still, the movie needs to be shown, then forgotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie for probably 2 days. I hate it to watch.  I don't think it's funny, but it's absolutely awful. The acting was very bad, the dialogue is poor, the acting is stupid and the storyline is boring. If you watch this movie, don't even watch the trailers. Go back in the future for another good movie: http://www.adland.net/movie-buffers/jadeville.mpls-crareous/jamesgottu/jem99.html-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have come to see this film once in a long time and I think that I will never see another movie this bad. I think this is the worst film I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to a child. I have heard that this film was made in the 80's or 90's and some people say that it was made during the 80s. The only thing about it is that it shows no blood, no blood effects, and no blood actors. I like to be surprised as I watched it in a friend's bedroom. It had the worst acting. The acting is that bad because it's really a bad script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I was aware of this film was when it was aired on channel 1. I thought the first time this film had been made. I knew what was going to happen, but there was no way to have anything to comment. I had been sitting on an awful late afternoon in the theatre and I had gotten tired by this. I didn't want to think any more. The first thing I remembered was that it was only a few minutes before the video tape was aired. When I saw the video before it aired, I was shocked. I felt like I was watching something that had nothing to do with me. If they were just trying to create a negative movie, this is a horrible waste of time. I'm sick of it. I know there is an interesting thing about this movie, but you would have to really pay attention. It's just really stupid. The story is completely incoherent, the characters are absolutely awful, and the way the story is structured is not only sloppy, but it fails to add anything to the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bobber" (or any other version of the book) is a really bad movie. The story is unbelievable and not all that realistic.  "Neces" (which is also a book about a family that seems to have been completely re-imagined) is also an abrid little movie. Even the end is fairly lighthearted, although I was surprised that this movie did not make any money at the box office.  Overall, this movie should have been an example of how bad film makers would think. They were making the movie to avoid getting a bad reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be a sequel to the original. So I thought that would be pretty cool if the movies did it justice. But the ending is so bad that it made me laugh. It was really bad. I have a feeling that this is just the kind of film that someone would use it to try to find a reason for not wanting to do the other sequels. But it should be remembered for it's obvious flaws. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Incredible Hulk" is a movie that is boring and bad. And while some movies have more entertaining scenes, this one looks like it was put together by a bunch of people who had never done any work on the internet. This is a disappointment. This movie is not funny at all, and the cast is so bad that it is amusing, but it's not interesting. But it also fails miserably as a movie of two guys that can barely communicate with each other. What could have made this movie a funny film? That's a guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie was so bad, because it really lacked an actual story. The plot was terrible, and I found that I couldn't really follow the plot. But the best part of the movie was the character. And what the hell did they do? What the hell do they do?! If you're an idiot, and this is the most stupid, stupid, and stupid movie I've ever seen, you really should watch it, and even if you did like it, please don't watch it. You can see some parts of the story, and you'll probably find some of them at the beginning. But after the end of the film, you'll be so bored that you'll never look at it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bully" is a film which features the worst Hollywood movies ever. The story centers around a group of losers who all try to get their jobs, as they are the last ones left to get an abortion, and then become the leader of the group and are in search of a good job. The movie is so bad that I really wanted it to make money, but I could not find any. I wish it had been another film about a group working on a job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot get over the fact that this movie is so bad that I was only able to finish the movie, because the actors couldn't put in the characters in the plot. They had a really good script, which I thought was pretty good, but this movie ruined me. It is all bad, and I'm still hoping to finish this movie.  I also found it to be very confusing. Some parts of the plot are funny, but I have to admit that there were some parts that are stupid. I guess the people who write this stuff have some special talent, but they shouldn't have done such a bad job. I have read the book, but that's not going to help either the actors or the audiences. I just cannot find the words that I heard, because I wasn't able to listen to them, and some of them sounded weird. The best part about the movie was the movie being about a movie, not a movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you enjoy the classics of the 80's such as The French Touch and the Spanish Touch, you should avoid this movie. The basic plot is about a family who travels to the city, and a man who has a girl that is taken off the street by a car. After going to a drug store, the man loses a huge amount of money in a gambling spree. His daughter and son find that the woman they meet is an old lady that has taken an overdose to her family in her house. She is then forced to perform the acts of prostitution, and the rest of the family lose their money.   This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in the 80 years of my life. It has a weak and unimpressive story, the acting is bad, and there are many parts that don't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this before, on the late night when the movie was showing on HBO. It was a total disappointment. The acting was so bad that it was hard to listen. It sucked away from the story.  The plot was okay, but the ending was awful and unbelievable.  I do not recommend this movie because it is bad. I think there were better movies available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a film to be taken lightly. There's no real film this. In fact, there's quite a lot of music that makes up for the stupid and completely meaningless storyline. The main character is, a high-school teacher in a small city, a very obvious idiot. He's a total loser and has a partner who seems to be more interesting. In this movie, he finds out a new lady who has just won the lottery. As soon as he stops at his house and starts making his first offer to get her attention, he falls for a cheap hotel to go into and rent it. After finding out that he couldn't rent this hotel, he then goes to his girlfriend's house and has them give him a good hotel deal. Then he gets drunk and sleeps in the house for a few days. Then a bunch of guys that meet for their first drink meet to get drunk, as usual. Then they go to the hotel, as I recall, with the woman having her boyfriend (his sister) asleep in the room and he goes to sleep. After getting drunk, he gets into an argument with his girlfriend and her friend. They get in fights with each other person and then he gets a little more money. When he finally does get a discount from the hotel he goes back to his place and then comes back to town, with a little help from the inn manager. It turns out that his sister was killed in a car accident and his girlfriend has all kinds of cancer in her brain. After they go through the movie, the guy is a total bitch and the next day he leaves his sister's girlfriend in the bathroom to get an extra room. The next day his sister comes in the hotel and he tries to force the woman to stay there and take him. Of course, his girlfriend is really cool and he's really sweet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't good. Its really obvious that there was no other people involved in this movie. Just the actors in this film just didn't have the ability to act on any aspect of this film. In addition I'm the first one to admit that there's a few bits of a script which could have been totally better. I mean the script is bad, I mean really bad. The ending could have really been quite a lot better, but its kinda pointless. The dialog, the acting was bad, and the story were bad. But all in all, there's just no redeeming factor to this movie except for the fact that it was very poorly filmed. The whole point of this movie is that it tries to get into an emotionally charged drama that is nothing short of horrible.  If you want to see some other film about how tough and hard the police are in this war, you'll find yourself very bored watching this movie instead of actually watching it. This is not a good film. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    How this film does in relation to other Hollywood movies is probably not obvious. It is obviously not as serious as most of the other movies made in the 1980's. There are some parts of the story that seem to resemble the classic adventure films. But it's not a copy of the films made during the '50's but simply an amalgam of the '60's and '70's. What this movie fails to do is make any sense of history whatsoever. The story and setting is so out of whack that it could be taken in the context of a contemporary world to a believable setting. It's just so flat and stupid that I cannot see how anyone could take it seriously.  I'm not sure if the actor who played the role of Peter Parker is a member of a large Hollywood organization or simply a guy who happens to be one of the actors in a major movie. I doubt any of them had any idea that he had played a long career as a man in a fictional movie. This could be one or two writers that have been influenced by a man named David Miller. I don't think I will ever find out what that is in the story of the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has one of the worst acting of all time and even worse acting. The acting is terrible at best, and the characters are stupid, and stupid.  I was expecting at least a great actor like Michael Ironside. I was extremely disappointed when I watched it. The main character, the person who is the protagonist, is so stupid that you can't understand the characters, and they all get so stupid they all look stupid instead. The special effects were decent though. The fact that Michael Ironcide is a cop and is so slow was not important, but I'm sure the actor, Sean Penn, isn't the one to blame for that. I didn't like watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was the best movie for a long time, but it wasn't that great. A few of the parts worked better than the rest, but most of them were bad. The story was good, but the actors were terrible.  I guess the movie director tried to add a touch of irony. I don't think he got into some of his best stuff. I think it could have been a pretty good film. But there is too many parts and too many special effects. The only thing I liked about the movie is the ending. The ending could have some of the best in movies. But overall, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie, I thought it was an attempt to make a film about an African village with a heavy African presence. I was extremely disappointed. As I watched the movie, there was a tremendous amount of racism in this movie. Even with the wonderful casting of a white actor, the movie didn't make any sense, the dialog was bad, the acting was bad and the storyline felt pointless. And finally, I was surprised that the music was only 3 minutes long. I expected an excellent African song song to be sung in the movie but I didn't get it. The song was titled "Zombie People". I was a bit frustrated and disappointed because I could only have one more song.  Overall, the message is pretty un-subtle, the writing is bad, and the actors have not even the talent to carry this material. And I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get into a zombie-comedy but to watch it, it's just an unpleasant waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited to see this movie at first, and was surprised that it was about a movie that I actually liked. But unfortunately, the movie had the worst dialog. The plot is very confusing, the acting was horrible, and I had a feeling that it could be so bad to be one that wasn't entertaining at all. In addition, I felt like there was some really bad acting in the movie. I think the script was very bad, but I'd rather be interested in seeing if it could have some interesting scenes, like this one, or if it was a thriller, but it's just awful, and didn't do anything to the film's theme of suspense, and thus was much less interesting than a movie.  I don't recommend this movie. Avoid if you don't know it and want to see it. It's not worth seeing in its first run, but the last one I tried it was way more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie extremely annoying and not worth the time to waste. I can't believe the money put in for it. Maybe the studio was trying to show the girls who were already friends that they were in a fight with each other in this movie and just want to be friends with eachother, and there's no mention of the fight with a friend. This is the biggest disappointment of my life. If you're looking for a girl to be a person who is a little less of a feminist, then this film might be good. If someone is just plain sad then it's an absolute waste of time. You get a little better with the girls in the movie, but for me that just wasn't enough. I just didn't care for this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie. There are no decent stories to it, I have never seen the one I did when I was growing up.  I feel the worst of the films I have ever seen, it is the movie that could be a "great" movie. The plot is very stupid, there are no real story, it's boring and not funny to anyone. This movie is not for anyone that would want a good plot.  This movie was made by a man who had never played a movie before and had no idea how to make a movie. He thought he was making a movie for the sake of a few laughs.   He was very good in his first film "Killer", and even though I wasn't in the same situation, I was still interested in this movie as a movie with a plot. This film was just an overproduced movie that failed badly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In some ways, this is the same with all of the Twilight Zone movies, but it's worse in the real world. There were a few elements to make up the plot, and that's about all there. As I said, the story is bad and the dialog is annoying as the dialog was very poor and hard to understand. The story is very poor, there are too many twists in the story and there is a large amount of unnecessary dialog. I recommend a better movie, if you want to waste time, but at least have some decent plot and a decent movie. I don't recommend this movie to anybody. I know there are a few good movies, so it doesn't get me down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had my hopes of a good movie, it's too short, it doesn't have a decent ending. I'm a huge fan of the old and great series, but this is the absolute worst one I've seen. I don't know if it's meant for children, but it probably isn't. The direction is so bad, it is so far from being realistic. If you liked it, you probably got bored and never saw the rest of the series. The ending is simply boring, but the whole plot is not interesting enough to even be a part of the film. I think that the directors have done a lot of work in their other series but this does not reflect well on them. If i were a child, I wouldn't want this to be my second watch. I also prefer to watch movies that have good endings and good acting. This is just the opposite of the end of "Lord of the Living Dead" (also a good film, the series was great). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, the sequel to the previous movie, had no real plot or plot to tell stories. The only story I knew before this movie was that the movie is about a girl with the abilities of an angel. This movie didn't really have a plot or a story to tell. I thought I could have seen a movie that had real plot before. I was about to watch the last one.  I was very dismayated.   I can't answer why, but the movie had nothing to do with the Angel. The angel is the one with the powers of heaven. This is what the world should have been, an angel who's chosen to help people, not a god. But you don't necessarily understand the Angel's true intentions until you've seen the movie.  The movie never gets out of its early days. It never gets to finish its first act. The movie is mainly concerned about the people who want Angel to help. The story is a "chosen" thing, and Angel is just about a follower. That the story is about two people who are having problems and are having trouble. The film is about an angel that is about the hero's relationship with a follower who has problems. This doesn't really happen that way. It is just a few people who go back to a place called "Alphan."   There are so many things about the movie that I didn't even know that they had to make the movie out. The acting is bad as well as the story, and the script isn't interesting. It just repeats some of the same clichio throughout the movie, and there is no real ending. I can only give the film credit for its acting. The actors don't really communicate that much. I just wish the other parts of the movie were better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason this movie is so bad is the fact that it's so stupid and contrived so many flaws that it doesn't even work at all. I'd really like to see a different movie, but I really wanted to like this one too much. The director (who is really good at what he does) has a weird talent for making cheesy, nonsensical, unlogical films. The ending doesn't go anywhere near as interesting as it would have been expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this show. I thought there was something wrong in the first movie. It's not too late, the shows they are pulling the same style and the characters were so stupid. I think that the story was terrible, I thought it was absolutely ridiculous. Also I felt like the series was way too long. It was pretty boring to have a long time. The girls were all pretty dull, and the acting was also bad. There was not enough funny jokes. I liked the idea of the movie, but if the girls were in the same condition as the girls, then they really need a guy that can do funny things.  I just felt like it sucked for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie we got a bunch of women walking around in the waterfalls (they look like they're going to waterfalls!). So I'm not a believer of this film, or that it's a good movie. However it's really not a good film. In fact it's not at all a good documentary about female life, it's got no documentary style about it (as a documentary film is, documentaries are pretty much documentaries.) it's also just a really bad film. The only good thing about this film is that there are two good things - and that these are, the women who are in the middle of this movie, the ones who are taking it, and the one who is eating the waterfall.   But at the end of this documentary, we are just to see what happens. I really wish it could have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad I thought it was so good and funny that it might not be so bad. I thought that I had just been watching it for the sake of laughter. I did not know what that film was about, which is the understatement of a first time I had with watching a film that I didn't want to watch. I got a laugh out of this movie just as soon as I started to watch it. It's not funny, it's sad, it has no real comedy, and it was really embarrassing to see a couple of women doing their own movie. This movie didn't really have a lot to offer for comedy, but rather than being plain and stupid, the movie would be funny to watch if it wasn't so pathetic.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that I've seen something else so bad that I expected it to be funnier. I'll see the sequel to the movie, but that's not my only thing to say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this film and was bored really hard. The scenes were completely nonsensical. I was also really bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie at my house for the past two weeks and it is awful. I'm a huge fan of movies and there are many good ones. I don't know why anyone would expect a movie to be good. This is simply the worst I have ever seen. I will avoid watching this movie if I ever get to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I'm a fan of this movie. I've never seen the movie. The movie has an odd premise, with a bunch of guys having sex with each other, a movie so poor in terms of quality that it's almost pointless. I was hoping that the movie would have a good story and a good ending. Unfortunately, it just goes right off the rails. There are no good characters, no good actors.  But at the end the story was interesting, and I didn't even enjoy the ending. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I'm glad I didn a negative rating of this stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't even good for those who have seen the "real" version of this movie from Disney, but it's worse than the one they bought when they saw the original version.  "Naughty Girl" is simply a continuation of the Disney musical that was released in 1989.  The original song is sung and performed by a song that isn't sung at all by the singer.   The song that appears in "Nevil Girl" isn't in a song by a singer who knows the lyrics. It is sung in a fake-band version in a nightclub as a part of a comedy act, and then presented as a musical gag with no lyrics and no musical accompaniment.  No song is played in the film in any of the three versions.  It seems like a comedy sitcom, but that's just one part of the musical gag that plays out of a soap opera. I found this song at the mall, so I didn't even catch it when I was there. I have a feeling of embarrassment watching it.  I really don't think this is a good movie, but this does nothing to detract from Disney's version of "Cuckoo" as an average show.  What is supposed to be an amusing song? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Unfriendly Neighbors" is a very mediocre sequel to "The Legend of Elleko," the first sequel to a film whose predecessor is a lot funnier. But, you have to pay a little more attention to the movie. Not to mention the fact that this movie is so bad that it only lasts one minute.  After the first 15 minutes, you will get bored with this movie but you can find much better (or better) out of "Cluppy's Quest" and "House of Pain". So, if you want to pass the 20 minutes in and spend more time watching this movie, try these alternatives instead. They both offer a very unsatisfactory ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was nothing but a series of old film tropes that has been reworked for no reason. It is the first movie I've seen in this decade that fails to qualify as a film. This movie seems to be a self-centered, self-entition of a film, and it fails to give us a positive review about anything. This film just tries to act like an adventure movie, but there's no suspense. And there's not a lot of good dialog either. All of the film's dialogue is so bad that they'd be good if we were the only ones who laughed. The director is definitely on the dutiest of things, and the only time I will get into it, will be when the movie plays for the first time. I hope that there's a second one, because the original one was much better than this. The sequel is supposed to have been better than the original, but I've always known this one as poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The American Nightmare" is a big mistake from the American version and a poor copy of a very well-produced film from Warner Bros. (who is still going to make it). In this version the entire movie is only three or four minutes longer than in the original version of the movie. This is the worst film ever made for kids of all the movies I've seen in my life. I can't even remember my own name! What are they doing? A bunch of old guys, with little care for acting in a movie? I can tell you that, but you wouldn't know the name of the guys.  I think it's because Warner Bros's version has no real characters or specialties that can lend to the viewer in a story. The story is pretty unbelievable and is just not interesting. It does help that we have a great soundtrack, but it's just not a good movie.  "American Nightmare" was very bad, even for the name. I found this movie online and I had to give it the rating it deserved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So bad that I can barely think of the person who made this, and I find that this is the same movie as "The Little Raccoon". I could barely think that this film was not more bad than "Gunga" and "The Dark Beyond". I think that the film has two or three (possibly more) flaws. The first problem is that this movie has absolutely no good lines; the characters are boring and there are no real, believable characters; they are so stupid that no one can even feel like they are alive, and most of the plot is nonsensical. The second problem is the sex scenes.  This film is so bad that it is hard to find humor or emotion to this film; I would like to go back to "The Wild Things". The main reason this movie was so bad was that it wasn't well acted.  There are no funny lines for the characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie for a few hours of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is extremely boring, with no direction, plot or theme whatsoever. It takes several scenes to reveal why the movie was put on hold when it was released. The idea that we should be able to see it again isn't that big of a leap. The story itself is rather unbelievable and the acting is poor.  It is also pretty difficult to understand the motivations behind these murders, but I didn't find the murders themselves that difficult. If it's been 30 years since this film was released why are we still seeing it today. I also wish to stress on how poor it is. I was able to watch this movie only once in the UK, so I won't be able for a second time.  I just found it hilarious in retrospect, but if you want to see a film that is not even good, then you'll have to find a copy of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad in the way that it is very difficult to watch. Some things are funny, but I don't know what the director intended, and the acting is so lacking that it's obvious that it was put together mainly by people who didn't know how to watch it and made a copy of the movie. The direction is so poor that it just falls apart like a bad horror movie. I can't even say I was surprised at the ending, because it is what it has been always done, the way they wanted to show it is just as bad as this movie and there is not even a strong ending to the story. Some people have reported that the next movies will be much better. There are a lot of bad movies out there. I would not recommend this one, even if it had a good story, because I would have liked to see one of them, the ones that were interesting and fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to give this movie a rating. It is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I gave this movie 2 stars because it was not so bad but the acting was bad. The actors did not look good at all and I wanted my mind free from this movie so I never took it seriously. I want a new movie. This film has all the same bad actors in this movie as the actors in the '90's "Pawnumber". I can't say this movie is good or even good in any other way. The movie was not good for its story. The director/writers should be removed from this project and this project should never get out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad attempt at making a 'film about life in America' fails to capture what its viewers might expect. For example, the movie is so hard to understand why the city has to be so different from everywhere else in the country. The characters are portrayed as people who live in separate locations, but the central city location never gets beyond 'cringe' territory; the 'city' is so small, and most of the characters never interact with the people around them, like 'the people'. For example the'men' would never meet the men in 'the city' (but the women do). A weak script fails to keep track of its protagonist's story, and the story is so lacking in 'important' details that you get the impression that the film is 'all over-written', or that the characters are just'really acting'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry that I got my copy of this, because I knew it was going to be bad. The movie was pretty terrible, the acting and the acting were really bad, the plot and the script was so bad. I think this movie had the potential to be a decent horror flick, but unfortunately, there are so many movies like this in the '90s that this one isn't even good. The most important thing about this movie is that it wasn't a "horror" movie, it was an un-made movie that was made by a bunch of guys who were working for a movie company who were trying to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot believe this movie was made in such a primitive manner, it really should have been one of the worst things I've seen so far. Its a huge mistake. A few minutes into the film and it is impossible to follow the characters without some of the funniest parts of the movie ever! I hope this has been put up for another review. I don't know if the production had the same style as films made in the US. Even the cast and special effects were quite bad for the movie. I hope it can be put up to a good movie in the future. The only thing that was good was the ending that followed the first movie. But I hope you don't expect too much. I recommend a different movie: "Kino's Revenge". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of time, but I don't know what people say about it. It does some good things. A nice, funny story about the characters. But it is also not the funniest film of all time. I had to watch this with one earring that made me gag, I guess my ears hurt so I couldn't feel anything. It was like one of those horror movies where you could probably guess what the character had in the scene and had no idea that it was actually the character.  I don 't believe this movie had any redeeming features, and the director is one of the worst things I've seen. It had some good moments, but there's not enough room for anything else. The movie was simply an effort to get me interested in some bad film for me to rent again. I know there are people out there that like it and others like it, but this film just wasn't a movie to me. This might be a movie for an old person, but most people don't even read it, because they cannot stomach such films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film which tries to be scary and not scary at all really, while doing so very poorly. The reason I'm not interested in this movie is because it lacks a solid concept behind it and actually breaks through. It is so bad that it's almost unbearable to watch it. The story is weak, and the director is just plain pathetic, even though it is entertaining. A movie with some interesting ideas but a bad plot makes me want to run to the wall for a really long time and throw away this movie.  I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a film to be released in 1999. But I couldn't believe it to be. I know I have seen other films from this movie, but they do not hold a candle. It is a horrible and awful film. The film is a long slow film with no plot or suspense. The story is so weak that I can't even tell if there is a story. The direction is so bad that it has to be cut and pasted in order to finish the movie. A great idea was that the actors were not to make the actors uncomfortable at the end of their shoot, but at the moment, I thought it was obvious that they were uncomfortable, with very poor acting. The ending seems to have been put together in a minute. A lot of actors could do better. They just didn't get to the end. The idea seemed to me to be there and then I think that this movie is a complete mess, with a very weak plot and poor acting, too bad for the actors. I don't know if they got to the last scene because the characters were in the last scenes and did the final scene. The acting is not good and the characters are really terrible. The music is bad as well, with an awful sound track that makes me wonder if it's the soundtrack of a bad film, or if it was the sound of a song from a bad song, from a video game. Also I was surprised that nobody remembered to perform the song, that is, the song that ends up on the final sequence. I guess there must have been some good movie in the DVD of this movie. If there were some other good scenes in it, they would be included. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker that's sad, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This has been done so many times, and it never has been corrected. There is only one good scene in this movie... the guy with the old man, the kid, and the other kid, who are all pretty good, but it has got a different twist. There's one shot where the kid is crying with an overdeveloped voice. I'm really hoping that this will end with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can honestly say that this movie is really, and worst movie I've ever seen. I never laughed at any of the movies I watched, but they were actually entertaining. In fact, I didn't laugh the movies when I watched these. I found the movies in question too slow and very unentrusted looking. Some people like me who actually like this film probably have seen this in one of its many films. The ending leaves a very bad taste. I don't want to watch this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is not as funny as I thought it would be. A few minutes into the movie and I immediately realized that I had to watch it again. The plot is not funny nor funny at all. The character actors don't like each other, even the actors. They just seem to be making their own jokes. There's nothing funny here! I just watched this movie on my way back to the hotel. There was no comedy to be found. If you really care about the story and don't care about this movie, why isn't it rated? If you want to laugh, this movie really isn't a funny movie. You don't want to watch a movie like this when you don't have any fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just as bad as the "Walking Dead" movies. The people that go in for this show should be ashamed of themselves for wasting money to make this show. They can only be remembered by people who like these "horror" shows. This movie isn't like the other "WALKING DEAD" movies, but that doesn't matter. In other words, these guys don't know how to make a horror movie. I don't care who you are, you're gonna be sad at the end of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of bad things were thrown at the movie. There was nothing good to be heard, the acting was so bad that I laughed my head off. There were no suspense, and I guess that this movie was meant to be a horror flick.  The end. But it was still entertaining and it had a great amount of scares. Unfortunately, the ending was too corny. I would have liked to see the movie as a comedy, but the final scene was just so bad, that I didn't even want to get it. It was an excuse to waste time.  Other than the ending, I'd recommend this movie if you want to see a horror movie, but I think it could do for a few months and even after a year, you might find yourself a little bit bored. I don't know why you were wanting to see this movie, maybe the people who liked it were scared by it, and even less than scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this one about a week or so ago, and I thought I was going to like it. But it was way too bland. The story, I admit, was good, but the ending was pretty dull. I don't think it was ever truly interesting, nor that anyone should find this movie particularly interesting. I think it's simply not worth watching, even if you're willing to be curious. It was bad to be a teenager. The premise was too vague and unsatisfying, and it made me feel like I was being cheated. I'm not saying that the ending is stupid, just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the movie was pretty dull and depressing. The plot is not interesting, the acting is so bad that it hurts. The acting is also a bit weak and it is hard to find the acting that would work.  This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. My rating is not good but 4.0. I have not read the book, so don't go out of your budget and spend a few hours watching this unless you are serious fans of the books.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but I'll warn you of the possibility of being robbed on your money if you go out to spend money on it. If you want to see a good movie, go see the movie "Wicked" and see it in France. If the story is not a story, this movie is just too hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've heard my advice.  For whatever reason this movie isn't good, but this was never an indication of a movie.  The acting was so bad that I'd never even have to go out to see it. I don't like movies like this for my friends and me because there is only so many of them.  I would have never watched this movie. There is something very, very bad about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in high school. I'm a student. I know people will ask me if I liked it. I just like it to look like a movie.  This film is bad. No story, no story. It starts off at the wrong place. I can tell you that the first scene is a kid taking a bath. This is not a real bathhouse; it's a porn movie. And when the girls are in the shower, it doesn't make me think of a real place. This film starts off pretty funny at the start, but then it becomes annoying and it just becomes bad.  But the main point of this film is that the girls in the bathhouse are attractive to the guy. It's about the girls being sexually attractive to guys.  The girl is the one who talks with them and is clearly talking to them. I didn't even like this film, but I would never like to watch this movie. I don't think there is any story, but there is a girl in the bathroom and she is talking to the girl in front of the bath house and he is talking about her.  I don' t know why, because he didn't mention the bath lady, but what he did say was interesting.  One of the guys in the movie is the same as me and he wears the same black outfit as me. He is in the middle of his section and he's never interested in what the bath woman said. He comes in and is just talking with the girls. He doesn't do anything himself, but they are talking to each other. He's about to take their hands and put on their backs, and I guess what he does when they do is put the women in the toilet.  And I'm not sure he does anything except what the women do.  He is naked, but his hands are on her breasts and he has no underwear. He takes his hands out of his waist and he keeps touching her breasts.  There's no story in the film. It comes off as soon as the movie starts. The women are talking about him and what happened with him. The girl in white is talking with him and I think she's talking to him, but her voice is on in the next scene and she doesn't talk to him. I get the feeling that she is getting into the bath room with the men. I guess the girl is in a bathtub and I'm thinking that she goes there with him
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the meantime, this movie seemed to be more interesting and more interesting than the first one. As the sequel, however, the plot had been a lot more interesting. But this movie is way too dull to enjoy. It seemed that the movie was going to drag a lot of people into its thick sluts. I was surprised by the interesting storyline.  I had forgotten the name of the person who actually killed her sister, the one whose name is spelled 'Sophie', apparently, since she has been dead. I also remember that the entire family from "The Little People" was wiped out by the big bad who kidnapped their children (like 'Diline'), as a result of an elaborate plot. I'm not sure if that is how it was in the other movie. It's also hard to find the people who are so annoying, as it turns out that there is a lot to be boring! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really a mish of times. A lot of the film seems to be directed by somebody who knows nothing about the actors. You can really see why they got their jobs as extras; it's a pretty poor effort. Even after the first hour, and the director got his job, I still don't really care what they do. Maybe there are some actors in their roles that have talent. But the actors are just bad actors. In fact, the acting is so bad that I wish they didn't exist. But one of the few good scenes comes off to a very low note when one of them (a very pretty good actor and a really good guy) comes back with a bunch of fake emotions and is actually sad.  There is also a bad scene in the film which involves a very creepy (and extremely disturbing) girl. I'm not sure whether it was her or her dad, but it was absolutely hideous. The next thing you see are an old lady and the guy in the other scene is going to make love to her; it looks like he's trying to get her into a car with a gas hose, which is also an important piece of art. That is not sex. No sex.  The most disappointing part is when it is clear that he is trying to rape one of his daughters (whose face seems to have been ripped off from a chair!) and he shoots an unfortunate kid. You might actually prefer to see the scene where the kid tries to put his hands in the girl's mouth and she has to defend herself, though.  Of course, we don't have to see that scene. After the scene of her being knocked down by a gas can and having to pull her off a chair (this is the most obvious scene), we are treated to the next scene, when one old lady is being raped and the man goes into a bedroom and tries to rape her again.  It is also hard to see a child that seems to suffer because he is too embarrassed about it. A really sad scene comes off, but not too depressing. He should have been embarrassed to himself.  What a bad film:  Overall, I'd be inclined to recommend "The Girl Who Fell is Still Around". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading for an other review on how bad it was, and decided to watch it.  It was so bad! It was about as bad as i remembered "The Incredible Adventures of Superman" was. The jokes were very bad!  In one scene, he had a "BOW" that looked like a boney, and I thought it would be the same thing as the gun that we used in "The Monster Unleashed". It was also the movie's version of a "Watchers Dog" gag, but I couldn't tell that the movie was a gag.  I guess I'm just going to guess that a movie has been made so badly, it is just that bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm sure, this film is only a few minutes longer than one hour. The acting and the dialog are OK at best, but the sound-track is pretty bad. It looks like a lot of work put in to making a movie in the 1970's, where there are few dialogs, even fewer characters. In the case of the young Jack Oliver, he was supposed to be a strong character, and even appeared to be the star of this film. In fact, this movie seems to focus on what it says in the beginning.  But after this long he is the only character that I can recognize of his.  He has to be so weak because his character was supposed strong. He has no character, no real person to whom we can relate to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read this review before ever, the only thing about this movie that is more entertaining than the other is that one man, the leader of the village, played by Ray Van Dyeges, and the rest of the actors in the film is stupid. I find the entire thing a very cheap piece of junk. Ray Van dyeges must have done it on purpose, as he's clearly had nothing else to do in his life.  The acting is just horrible. It just keeps repeating and you have to laugh, or just just watch the film again. If you can watch it, you'll just waste time.  It seems to get worse as the film progresses, but I still enjoy the movie as it becomes more absurd and ridiculous.  I can't see much more time. I know it is a bad picture, and I'd probably hate it if it was available, but for the sake of the story it must be a problem.  There is no reason for this movie to exist, and if I were a person who had an interest in it I would give it the last few minutes to watch. I cannot see a movie that keeps you busy for a long time. There are no reasons for a movie to be so over-the-top. It must be an ongoing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't comment on this movie without mentioning that this is the first movie I've ever seen that was actually so bad. The writing, the editing, the soundtrack, the acting, the direction, and the cinematography were just so bad that it could be a one-hunk movie. It is so bad, in fact, that I don't think anyone would actually enjoy this. It was the worst movie I have ever watched. I was bored watching it, and I just wish I could just stop watching it. It really doesn't come anywhere close to good. I think it's a shame that none of the people involved in it had the talent to make the movie look good, let alone make it interesting or interesting to have any interest for it whatsoever. It had absolutely no good dialogue, bad acting, bad cinematography, and bad acting. The movie is full of awful jokes. I just could not see more jokes. Some of them are funny, but the ones that weren't funny were so funny that I couldn't even finish watching them. The worst thing about this movie is that this has been done again and again. If you are looking for a good movie about a kid that doesn't make much money, I would recommend checking out this movie because it might be worth its investment. Unfortunately, it's pretty bad, and it's so bad I couldn' avoid seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first thought this was an obvious remake of the "Fantasy" franchise.  This movie was so bad that I was extremely disappointed with it. It was about a boring plot with the obligatory gratifying ending. It's a bit predictable. The movie starts out slow and then goes slow and fast. The ending was only 4.5 minutes long. The cinematography was bad at best. The acting was bad and there was no real drama. I felt so sad after watching this movie that I'd recommend this movie to people who are not interested in it.  I am not in a large club to recommend this bad movie. It wasn't as bad as the previous movies but it was a lot worse than the first one I saw. If you like the "Candy Clark" movies, you may get a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, like most of the ones on this list, is simply a "vulture movie". Its a bad film, and the director says it is meant to be a satire of "mixed life". This isn't a satire, it's just bad. I am not a "parody", but I'm a big "critic". But when you say you are a "critique", you aren't funny.  So what if they don't like a film that isn't funny?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. The film was absolutely the worst I've ever seen, it was really unpleasant to watch. Even if you do not like the characters, the cinematography was poor. I did like the film, it had a good cast but they were the worst actors I've seen in a long time. But I could still see it for an hour or so. I'm not saying that the films are bad, but they're just a bad film with no ability to convey much, and even if you enjoy one of the films, you could see them for a few seconds. I think this is a case of a "B" film, but just a few of us saw them. But beware! It's bad, and I'll never see anything else again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one of the three greatest missteps in the history of film writing is the film with the film of Richard Dyer, directed by Sir James Barry, who makes no one even remotely interested. I found this movie to be so bad that I actually laughed in a theater watching it. This movie was so bad it is so stupid it breaks the plot so bad, so badly it is not funny to watch it, and in some cases it is very amusing to watch (I've never laughed in theater, so I am surprised to find myself laughing). The director is a man of very, very poor taste, but he tries to be funny while directing it and this makes it even worse. The film was supposed to be a musical film, and he has apparently gotten bored for it. The music was about musical music, so poor, but when it was done this was very bad, and the story was a bit long. But it is bad for a musical, and bad for an art film. He really should try to get a musical license. It could help him to better handle his craft as a story writer.   I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars for its very unimpressive script and some good, but ultimately there are very few laughs. I give it 3 out of ten. It's a shame the director and screenwriter aren't even trying to try and get this movie together to get some kind of redemption. I do think the film should be at least one out of nine, at least. I really don't know if they'll be able to get it together and at least salvage the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The House Of Smiler" was so bad, I never even thought it was supposed to have a sequel.  The movie takes place around the same time when we were at the airport in California. The movie is also about a house in a small, remote community with several old women and a drug dealer. That drug dealer's wife dies in a drug overdose, so she and the rest of the women's friends stay with her.  She's not even in the house with her husband, so the whole house is just a house for her and her drug dealer to watch. When the drug dealer and the women who are at the house call the house and asks "who do you want?" the women says, "oh, we need a new house." That's all there is. The women then make a desperate, call to the police for help.  There is no discernible sense of a purpose, there is no clue that what the house is doing, there are no clues what its occupants are thinking about. There is also no dialogue, the people are very vague, the story and setting are just completely awful, and the whole thing starts to fall apart when the movie starts.  I guess this is where a "house of shame" movie is really just a bunch of guys looking for drugs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie of the year, that I have seen. The dialogue is poorly acted, the acting is weak, and there's nothing else that I've found more than stupid. I think it should really be used to be an interactive film, not a piece of junk. The cinematography is OK, but it's not a good one. The music is OK but there's too much noise in the songs. The soundtrack is OK too, but the sound effect is bad. There's just a few words that need a little bit of editing. I'd have to assume the writer/director is a guy who has never really worked in movies, or he really has a talent for making films that are mediocre. If he has seen this movie, please send me a negative comment about this bad film:  You're supposed to be laughing for the whole movie. I guess you were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure most people saw this movie as a piece of "cult" filmmaking or a "self-indulgent" project in the 1990's. There's nothing in this film to be taken seriously. It's like it's an afterschool class skool with no real education; a bunch of teenagers who aren't old enough to go on university. In case of "the Cult" or "Self-Focusing", I don't see a real film to compare it with. They're not to be watched for entertainment purposes; this is just a very shallow piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think there is a problem with this movie. It is really awful and the acting of the actors is so poor it is not funny. I do not know what the plot is, but I believe it has some meaning to this plot. In addition, it is hard to follow the plot. The story is fairly interesting and the plot was well written, but the characters are not funny at all. I think there was an attempt at making some sort of a sequel or sequel to this movie and this movie didn't get that done.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this supposed to be? Some have speculated it to be a psychological thriller about the murder that happened in 1973. This is certainly not a true horror but a rather uninteresting story. The movie is only mildly funny though this is where the jokes are most evident. What is the point of this film? A "novel" with a disturbing plot, a few of my comments are:  I suppose it's for children and the girls are simply not expected to relate. The plot is about a family of "woo" women who has to deal with a murderer (who was never even identified as a child?). There are some pretty funny jokes involving the murders that take place at the beginning and at the end of the film. The other problem was the fact that the killer's father had died in a house with no mention of his daughter and was involved in the murders. I suppose he had been in an accident and there are many pictures in the film that have been put in circulation of pictures of these scenes.  I would have preferred a different movie with a different storyline. It's not funny, but there is no suspense whatsoever, which is the key to the film's true purpose. The lack of suspense did not aid in making this film more interesting, it just serves to remind the viewer that the story is not being developed with anything else. The film is simply lacking a story and a story is the main reason why this is a poorly written movie. The main plot is merely a continuation of the main storyline and the film doesn't go anywhere with this story.  The last comment I have is that the movie contains a lot of images of the killer and the murder and his "revenge", though that does not really do much to lend the film any interest. The scenes in the house were quite moving, but that's only because the murderer is in an isolated place and is at a distance from anyone else, which keeps the viewer from getting involved with the story and letting the viewer figure out the details of the killings. The ending is about the murderer and the girl who he had taken advantage of by a previous murder so he could go on with his "gang".  There are no suspense to the end and no suspense for this film.  In the end I thought the movie was rather pointless, at least I can say that. There were only three of them. There are at least three "good" things about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot even think how this movie was made! It is so stupid, it's absolutely awful, it looks like an actor making a film without money, or any money to pay for it. It also seems to lack the taste of a horror film like "Silence Me" (which has good actors). The acting has been terrible, the story is so bad, and the story itself is simply awful! I don't even want to get into the plot itself, because that would make it very boring! My point of these points is that the actors in this film had to go through serious amounts of money to get these roles. The actors should have been in the same position as they are in the films they are making. Some of them didn't have to go, like this movie made, and a lot of the actors were doing their own stunts. The movie is definitely a piece of trash, a piece which I hope never gets released, but at the same time, I was extremely disappointed in the fact that it was released, because I thought it could have been much better. What a bad film!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't funny enough to be funny. It's funny when the narrator does some funny things. But you've seen all of "Ghosts of the Valley". You've seen "Crisis". You have seen "King Richard's Rock".  This film is a bad adaptation of "King James's Rock", an old Disney-commissionary film about a group of men who kill each other's family members and then go back to the same town where the film was filmed in the 1960s. I think that film has been based on "Candy Creme" or "The Princess of Hazzia", or some other movie. This film lacks some of the best acting of the "King's Rock" movies. And there's still some of "Ceneception", "Doubtful Days" and "The Good Life". The only reason this film is good, and even entertaining, is that the story is so absurd that it can't be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had been in my hometown a few years later, I would never have thought about the ridiculous crap this movie was. The acting was bad, the storyline was stupid, the dialog wasn't funny and the voice was terrible. The special effects were also bad as the camera effects looked bad, and the scenery was also awful! The special effect was simply terrible and the effects were poor. The ending was especially stupid - the ending is about the most stupid and stupid ending a movie can get. There is no good ending to this film and the plot should probably never have been finished at the time of this movie. The end is so bad it doesn't seem funny. The movie should never have had a decent ending and the director would have known better than to make a movie like this. The soundtrack is bad as well, since it doesn\'t come up at the end and at the beginning of the film and even at the start, the music was annoying. The director should have stopped making music. The best part about this movie is the music track, and that is only good for the fact that the narrator is pretty funny and not terrible in any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand this movie has some decent moments. I get the idea for a while, but they have some of the worst scenes I've seen from this movie. The dialog is pretty good, but it can get somewhat boring. The story is not too good. This movie is really stupid for trying to have a moral message of the story. The movie doesn't even contain the plot of the movie. I don't know what the message is.  The movie was supposed to be a comedy movie, but I felt the entire movie felt a bad parody of a movie, just plain crazy. I give this movie a negative rating of 5 out of 10 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a lot of bad dialog in its first 3 minutes. This is the best bad movie I've seen in awhile, so that's not one to watch. In the second minute I get stuck in a dialog with an idiot named Lumberdy, then finally get stuck into a dialogue with another idiot named Stellars. Stellar and Lumberd are the two worst actors I've ever seen. Lumberdon is about as good as a porn actor, and Stellargy is about half the same, but that's about all there is. And the end credits are a bit disappointing as a way to ending a comedy film.  This is obviously bad for anyone, but it makes it very, very annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts in an amusing way with an innocent-looking and seemingly harmless movie. It also features the most bizarre plot ever to be. We get the movie started with a little girl sitting in front of the camera. When the girl is running through the film, it takes an awful toll on the viewer. The ending seems to have an intentionally creepy and depressing tone. It's a movie about a young girl who wants to get home and doesn't know what sort of movie she's getting into. The movie starts with a plot that could have been made for a horror movie. The girl in front at the front is supposed to be so innocent and adorable that she'll be treated like a child. In fact, it's not clear how a movie like this could get past this. We end up watching a man masturbating his penis out. The film gets a pretty bad reputation in a couple of years. I remember seeing this in a video at my local video store when it first appeared. I think I'm still a bit too early to see this in the video stores, but at the very least, I didn't expect it to last long. It was stupid and stupid. The entire story was just too stupid. I don't think anyone could have imagined a movie to go out like this. The best way to get this movie over is not the ending. A well-made movie: 1/2/3 (unintended), and it gets a decent amount of praise and praise. The actors didn't have any real talent in this movie. I guess they really want this movie to be good. The writer is really just trying to make a story out of a bad film, and that's not what it needs to be anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always been a fan of Disney cartoons, but this has been a disappointment. I feel like I could watch this movie just to be sick. I hope this is the end of the film so I can finish my movie. It was just so bad I don't want to see this movie. What a wasted of $1000. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the film which was made by the same person who made the original "Wings" movie. In another video, a car explodes in a car accident and everyone is killed or a car is stolen or damaged. Nobody's happy when a car crashes into a million people. It's so bad, there are no redeeming features. But at least there are some surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen many reviews and so many bad comments. But I thought I might just have fallen in for some pretty bad movies. I'm not sure if there are many bad movies but I just saw them. So the first thing I thought. This is probably my fault, I should say, I'd watch a few.  The film was pretty good. I liked the little voice work but there were too many flashbacks to get it across. Also, the acting was weak but okay at times. There was a little twist on the story but the one I liked was the one where the whole movie appeared to be set up, like the ending. There's just not enough time to get through the film, just the few minutes they are available for.  I think it just could not be another of these "The Hangmen", it needs to be done by a bunch of people, preferably one person, just to get the plot through. There has to be one person who gets it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good elements of this film. The music in the film is a little odd. And there is some good effects, but the acting and camera work is poor. But, I think that the film had some good moments. And, as with a lot of films, there is something that ruins it. It has been around for years, and I find it hard to find any good parts. This film has nothing going for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the movie when it first came out on the cable channel back in 1993, as I did it with the other movies of that time, and I did not even want to see this one when it came out. I was very disappointed with this movie, although I did have some good fun and found the story interesting. This film was bad in that you had to sit thru a very tedious and long film just to watch it. Unfortunately, it wasn't very funny at all. It had the worst acting of any film I've ever seen.  There were some pretty funny moments, but I'm sure the people involved were extremely bad actors, and the film didn't help its popularity at all when it got re-runs.  I hope it had some better version of the movie because it didn't have any humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film takes place on a world conference, and it plays like a roller coaster with bad characters. It begins with a plot about a group of bad men who are forced to try to kill each other. Then, some magic occurs to get a bunch of people who decide to hide in their closers. It starts raining down a storm of ice cream. It follows one, then another, and everyone goes up in circles around them and dies. The plot never moves forward, but the characters die so quickly that you cannot really tell who's up and down. The film has a very bad camera work. The acting is bad, too, and the script doesn't make much sense.  The movie is not so bad that it is a disappointment to anyone, but I give this film a 3 out of 10 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure what was wrong with this movie to be in such a low budget. There were so many jokes in the script that I almost didn't even understand what they were saying. I think that maybe one of the actors is saying that a bad man says a bad word and gets killed. I'm sure there is some sort of magic going on in the whole thing, but I don't think I'll be able to understand it until I get the DVD. This movie is an abomination. The only thing I'll say, that it was interesting to see some of the characters involved in the plot. I doncha think there are two people involved in it, but their role was so small that it didn't really matter. I just hope that the other actors are paid to a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with a really low and predictable premise.  After that, the film follows the standard sitcom script of a typical sitcom -- I'm not one of these sitcom writers, but, who can I buy this script?  It is about a teen's boyfriend (She is a teenager, which is very unusual) and his best friend, Jessica (who is a young teenager). They are about a relationship that is slowly disintegrated and that has resulted in a lot of sexual tension, but it is never shown that the male characters are responsible for their behavior. It seems the director didn't care that he would be involved in a sex scene (I guess he was embarrassed with his characters' behavior in this movie).  He does have some good moments, but they are forced to be confined within the context of the storyline.  Also, he is very bad with the casting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard the story of this movie, the plot is very poor, the acting is not strong, and I feel there is no true enjoyment at the end. If you read the comments on the film and find something bad about the acting, then you would be very bored. But if you just go through the entire film without watching it, you would find out that it's not a bad film, it's a bad, but enjoyable film that you just have to stop watching.   If you are a fan of Stephen Lee's films, you'll find the story a dull and uninteresting, but if you aren't, then the movie is just a pathetic piece of crap.  This movie isn't an accurate portrayal of the film, and it should never have been given the chance to be made a documentary, it should have been made to make a TV series. It is the same kind of story you read when you are just bored.  I can't say any positive about this movie. It just doesn't make up for Stephen's reputation as a great actor. The acting is bad, the dialog is just stupid, and the story is so bad. Don't watch it if you like movies about a lot, but just don't watch this if you don't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sitting on the toilet at home and wondering how it could have been. I guess it's something to do with the fact that I'm a part of the 'boutique' fan, but I don't really think I'll get into this one.  I've always said it's not to go to movies with this kind of film, but this is a bad, very bad movie. It should probably have been banned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no good reason to be any of the great films, but this one is far from the best of the original films. It just plain boring, and not even remotely funny. This is one of the weakest of the series.  The whole series is really disappointing and just plain horrible, the only thing I can see is that there was something about the sequel that made me think that this film had the same effect on me as the original. If you can honestly believe that this is a good film, you should probably go to the end and hope that it's the worst one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with some interest and decided to watch it again after some days of a negative reaction. It wasn't just bad, it was really awful. I was so embarrassed by the way the story progressed that I actually sat out and left the movie.  It didn't really hurt my interest any to see the movie, but for anyone who likes a film of this kind that has nothing to do with any of the real life of the movie it's bad. It's just not worth seeing in a movie. It has some really interesting scenes, but don't expect anything from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are going to spend $200 on a movie: Get a really good movie: I've wasted all of my life watching this crap. Don't waste your time watching this movie. Watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand what the director has to do. He has to act like a very bad movie director. He also should have got a bit of money to hire actors to play them better. A few comments:  One thing:  Well, this movie is about making movies, not about making nice movies. Even as a kid, it is hard to suspend your disbelief about how the movie is. I don't even understand how a movie is supposed to be a work of art, but the director obviously doesn't have a clue how to make a film like that. The main actors are very bad, especially the girls. And the direction is bad. This movie has to come from a movie that's about making a bad picture.   One more point is that there is no point in making a movie about a movie. The best way to make movies is to be something, not a movie, about making fun movies.  The point of this movie was to do exactly one simple story about a bunch of guys who have become vampires. It isn't even that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just started to see some clips from the preview. I thought the movie had some good acting when it first came out. I mean it's about half an hour, and the plot is not really all that good. I think that maybe this movie was not the worst thing a movie has ever seen. But it wasn't funny. It was just boring. I have to say that the movie does not work. It does not make any sense at all. It makes no sense of being a family, and it makes no money, it makes absolutely no money. I really don't care for this movie.  I want to say it wasn 'the worst movie ever...' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really curious why these guys thought this could be funny. I'm curious as to why they thought this was funny. They should have spent their money on a better movie. I have never seen anything funny so bad, and it has been for years now. I don't know what kind of funny to call it, but it is so stupid that it could not possibly be funny, and I'm not sure that it is. What did the other writer do? A "funny" comedy? They are obviously trying to make the characters funny, but they didn't give us a decent character and character that actually delivers. The "fun" is a complete lack of character development, and they get into an endless cycle of laughter. I cannot believe this could even be good. I just don't think this movie has a good title or can even make any kind of good.  I think that it was a huge mistake to try to make this comedy out into a film that was funny, for they didn, in a funny way, and that is not in the film. The film is only about what they were trying to do, and has no decent storyline, though it does have a lot of comedy in it. I guess they have to make it funny, or else it would just be an awful joke. I think it's not even funny, though the jokes and the characterizations are amusing enough. I do not think they could make any of these jokes funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never thought I'd seen such a bad film since this movie. I usually like this type of film because the film is generally a nice look at the beautiful scenery in LA and LA has always been good. I found the film to be quite hard to watch, the direction at times could be somewhat predictable but it just didn't stick. The actors are not in the middle of the film, it's too contrived and predictable. There's no point of it, it wasn't interesting.  It's just a simple, unsymmitted, predictable piece of work that could not be better.  What makes the film worse than anything is the fact that you'd have no reason to be interested in this one. The acting was OK, the cinematography was OK and the cinematography was OK but it had to be much worse than that.  I'd give this film one star out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film as a complete waste of time. I had no idea this film was supposed to have been made in such a long time. This film is way below average even for his rating. The story is laughable, and I would prefer for it to have some kind of plot. There are little plot lines that are interesting, but most of the scenes are just "one note and they may take your breath away". I wouldn have to assume that this film is the worst film I've seen from the past decade. This is a horror film that could be made from a horror movie and not a horror in the true sense. I give it one stars over a 7, but if it has to be made as a horror, it's at least 2. This movie should probably have been the second title to the horror film "Blackout" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell what to say about this movie. It's just that stupid. It should be called the sequel of 'The Hangman,' but I doubt it was that. The first two episodes of 'Red vs. Blue' were very good in my opinion. But this one is so bad, it really hurts the series.  The characters are stupid, and the acting is bad, but the action scenes aren't good either. That's why you get 'Red' and 'Blue' which are both excellent. The story in 'Red', was a classic thriller story, but 'Red Vs. Blue,' is just an excuse to throw it in as a comedy and there isn't a clue to that.    This movie must be one of the worst Hollywood movies ever made! I know a lot of people disagree with it. I'm not a movie buff, but I have some friends who believe it is the worst film ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is just ONE plot line. One scene follows the movie and another one follows the TV show.  It is like watching a movie that has no plot line, no character, no theme, no emotion, no story... no plot to be the show... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has been put under scrutiny and I cannot believe the people at the studios did it. It is an extremely bad film and I would recommend skipping it unless you can see it.  The film has a very obvious attempt at a romance plot and the writing is so bad I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually believe it. There is absolutely no love in this film whatsoever. The main character is a little bland and there is very little plot development, but the other people that we see appear, they are all completely flat, and there are none of the dramatic scenes you would expect.  Also, the actor in the film is very bad, and he shows very weak and he is even portrayed as some of the stupidest characters. Some of the dialogue in the movie is also pretty bad, but it all makes this film seem more serious than it really is.  I am ashamed to say that I believe the guy who wrote the script was very talented and probably knew better. I suspect he did the right thing. The film is a complete failure on a level of it not being serious enough to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am one person who was very skeptical of the whole movie. I have to admit, it was a little better than other movies. But, in a movie, everything is done that you can't understand the characters in the movie. They were totally boring to watch, without anything that was supposed to be funny. The whole movie just seemed to drag out the entire film. I found myself wondering if I was going to sit for this, because it could be so very boring and very hard to follow what the characters are saying in their conversations. I also didn't like the movie to see it.  My only point of interest, was the ending. As I said, it had some really funny moments that made it worth to see the movie on some occasions. But in the end, it just had too much trouble with too many unnecessary jokes that could ruin it. You may remember this movie, because I said it was just one of about a few of the movies I have seen. It was a bit predictable. But it really wasn't funny. There is no reason to believe this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a bad choice. If you really care about this movie, then you can have your own thoughts and not watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of bad, boring, and ultimately unpolished. But if you like gore, gore and blood and nudity and bloody fighting, you'll definitely find yourself there. The gore is so bad that I thought it would be an interesting title for a horror film. Not so glad about the bloody sex scene and the nudity scene. There were also too slow and too heavy for a realistic film, and I did not enjoy the sex scene. I did enjoy the nude scene, which was more realistic than the rest.  As for the main story, there's nothing to do. It's not a film, but it's just a film. The story and the characters were so weak and boring. They were so annoying to watch. I was angry and depressed to see how hard it is to find a decent title in this awful series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife thought it was going to be a "funny comedy" and she loved it. Sadly, it is not. As you will soon find, it's not about an underdog kid who turns out to be some sort of badass with powers. It is about a rich kid who is an odd, even though she doesn't really understand what she's doing. She tries to convince the people she meets that she's a genius and he tries to get her a job to be the head of a top university that he knows nothing about, and it ends in his death.  The story isn't really that funny, it just ends up having a really bad effect on me.  I'm not a comedian but I really don't care what sort of comedy I watch, I just hate it. It just isn't funny or funny to me. It's just one of those "filler" things that a movie tries to make fun of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many questions in this movie. The first question I ask when watching is why. Why did they make the movie? The second question I question is why would they make this movie? Third question is whether this movie is true or if it's made for money? The movie starts off with a flashback from the late 1800's that has never existed. It is obviously a fantasy that has nothing to do with reality but is extremely violent and very disturbing.  What is the point? We have a problem with this movie!  This movie is just a very bad movie. It fails as a fantasy about being a person's fantasy. It's bad as a film and a piece of art. It doesn't provide any useful insight into what really happened to the victims. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts out badly, the ending is a little too slow. I guess there's a bunch of people in this room who would have said they weren't really fans of this movie. If you can see the movie again, don't. If one of you is dumb enough, don your own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original "House of Blood" series has a very unusual pedigree in that the main cast is the original story-driven characters, and the original television series has the main characters' "screener" counterparts. Some years later, the cast of the original "Seven Blood" was used to be the "House Blood" cast, and even that doesn't count as a casting change. This is a terrible sequel to what was originally titled a very good television series.  There is absolutely no clue what the original series' cast is about. I think it would be easy to be able to look at the cast as such characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot fath some words of this movie, it is absolutely despicable. This movie is so sad, so horrible, so boring, so short, nothing happens and the movie is not only a poor piece of work, but also so terribly long and boring. I only wanted to see more of the movie, which had a couple of good ideas, but most of the time, this movie fails miserably and the only things in the movie that I had liked were the dialog, the characters, and the ending. In other words, it should have been put together to be like the sequel of "The Iron Mask" or any other movie, because there are plenty of people who think that the movies are just too many of the same movies being recycled into the mainstream. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Frozen In Africa" is about a group of three female teenagers (Bassetti, Jorgensen, and Tessa Fermoran) that set up a tent with a bunch of bunnies. They don't get along as a trio but do try to form an agreement, with the help of a girl named Anita.  The film is fairly light on the sex talk between the teenagers. It would be a cool film to watch, if we could see a movie about the group of teenage girls who are in trouble, and get along and communicate with each other. But, there is nothing to see in this movie, it's all just sex talk, and nothing gets off.  I'd recommend this for a young person who is looking to break them down a little, but if you are looking to see a romantic comedy, do not see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've wasted so much time watching this garbage, it is very disappointing, I can't recommend it to anyone who has not had a good movie. This film would make an effort to make it even better than some of the low budget films. But unfortunately this movie fails to make a good film with little plot, no ending, little character development, no humor, no suspense and no funny dialog. The plot is about a "cage killer" and an old detective who spends most of the film hanging on the corpse of a female corpse that he kills. In fact, I could not even tell when he had a beard. The main theme is that you can't tell who he is, which is really weak. I hope someone makes a movie better than this one, since it was in my best college English class.  There are only about 10 stars on the film, and one stars is probably Peter Sifo.  If you think your friends will enjoy this movie, don't go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Frozen" (it's always been a bad film) gets another sequel (not even a sequel) to keep that sad record. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd watch this for a few minutes, but I decided it wasn't worth it. When I saw this, I realized that it was about as bad as "The Thing" that it is being today. I don't know why the title and it's name were so important to me. But the point is, it was just the worst film I've seen in ages.  I was hoping it'd be a bad film because they hadn't figured out the way to use it as a satire.  This film is about as long as the "The Secret of Peoria" by Steven Seinfeld. Not even a good movie about the movie, but one that makes you think your brain hurts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking at a movie for the week and ended up watching something. I thought it was interesting. I didn't know what was in it, but there wasn't any one I liked. I was so embarrassed and angry that I only watched it and didn't actually sit in the theater. I think that it's so awful that I'd never watched this movie. It just doesn't do anything good and I think its really awful. Its so bad that I'm embarrassed watching it and there was no joy whatsoever. I'd like to find out how to write a negative negative review: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible. I've seen this film on Youtube and I wasn't sure how I would have ended. I guess it would have been quite bad, but that sort of depends on the movie. I didn't know what would be bad, because I never watched it in person and I always assumed the people who did watch it might be interested. The director is a complete joke. The dialogue is too bad to listen to and the editing is too poor to be funny, but it still works as a gag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought the whole film had a pretty good ending, and it wasn't even as good as in the end. I did enjoy the end of the film, and the fact that it's an odd choice between these two moments. But the worst part was how much it took away from the main story, as well as the way the acting was structured. I was quite frustrated that the movie could take so much energy from the characters. If you have seen this film, you'll see the same disappointment as I did. And this is really just a disappointment, I can see why they didn't like this film.  The main reason for this disappointment is because this movie relies on pretty low-budget filmmaking. The actors and the production are simply not well matched. They all looked good for most of the movie, but not for the ending. Even the ending felt bad for me, as it seemed to be totally contrived. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As one reviewer, I give the following review, but this is not good.  I am a film-critic, so I understand my thoughts. I am also a film reviewer, but not in a film school. If I thought the script was bad, I would be very upset. I feel like I was trying to be a movie reviewer.  There are many problems here, which I cannot list out, but I'll list one.  The main problem with the story is that the actors are bad at a major movie: they're all so bad. I understand that the talent is very good to act, but most of them do not act in a way that is able to produce the movie.  And the special effects are bad.  As a writer, I understand the difference between acting and writing. This movie is not a movie: it's a TV movie, and a TV script is not to produce a movie. The actor does his job, and she must use the same level of effort he used in a script to get the movie to the point where they are serious actors, which is a sign that it needs a serious script to a serious movie. But I must say, it takes all the effort of making a script for the actors to succeed, not for the screenwriter to succeed. I would have liked a movie that was a lot more serious, more serious. I think the movie needs to be much longer, so there would have been more impact when it was in the middle. There is an attempt to be funny, and to take more seriously the film in a major, serious film, but that's not what it was designed to be.  If you liked something else, don't watch it. Don't listen to the other film reviews: it looks like a horror movie. (This review on Wikipedia)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ever have anything else to do with "Tango", do it. Do NOT watch it.  If they tried to make it watchable, and I'm a real movie buffs, you will never watch this. It's a piece of crap and a bad film. It has a decent concept, but the acting is laughable and the ending doesn't make you care either. A lot of bad films come out, but it doesn't seem like a great film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was an absolute bore and the acting was poor. The music is OK, but not a lot of work and a terrible soundtrack and the dialogue and acting is weak. But at least there was some decent material to watch. Also the ending was a bit silly. But it is still OK if you're an adult or a fan of the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is terrible. The story is so far from the book, and it is so bad that it is hard to follow. The main point is the fact that the book depicts the death of the protagonist. The movie doesn't do any real work. The hero of the book is the hero of many books, the main villain in the book was a former hero, and so were all of the characters in this movie.  The book is so badly written, and the acting is so terrible that it made me wish to kill this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first 15 minutes, there are two or three men in the film, and then there are several people standing around the black hole trying to get some kind of clue. A man is stabbed, and you don't know how to get out of this. Then something comes out of the blackhole, and it takes you to the surface, and the two people you didn't even know were standing with you. Then you are on the surface and you are alone. Then the next thing you do, is that you leave the black and the ground with a few small children who seem to be asleep, and leave a man for what they are going to do.  Then you find a couple of big guys, who you can tell were in the middle of trying to find a way to get onto the black Hole, but that isn't clear. They are so big and slow that you are very uneasy about this situation and so you don not trust them.  When you find them, they are a big group of people who want to fight in their own country, because they don't like the American people and they want to get on your turf. If you are interested in a true story about how you fight, and what it does in a war situation, then you'll have to watch this very badly.    It doesn't matter how good it is, because it is about the worst movie I've seen so far, and I've read and heard more than 20 different reviews about it. I was expecting it to be an interesting movie, but I'm afraid it is not at all. The characters are not even very good, and some of the film is terrible, but you would just watch it for the sake of making money and getting a discount. The movie is full of pointless dialog, and bad acting. The good news is that the story is very weak, and no good story is put forth.  The ending is so lame, and so bad, that you might find yourself wondering if there's anything left to watch. Then there are three people with a gun who will attempt to go back to the black holes after they've gotten bored of all kinds of ideas, and they don´t like doing a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just OK. That's not a positive review at all - I think the people in this movie made it, but I guess it could be better. But it has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever and there's no plot whatsoever. I also can't understand the reason why they decided to use a fake name for the name of the lead character, the main female character, and the movie was supposed to have a decent storyline.   I don't think the writer knew about how to do this movie, but it looks like he has done it anyway. I think it looks extremely bad for such a great actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few things that make me think that this was a bad film. Its supposed to be a funny film. The premise is that the whole thing is to be funny, but the plot is so badly presented that I can't understand how to interpret it. There are too many problems, bad acting, and poor acting. I'm still curious about this film though I think it's worth to see. I guess I'll just have to watch it and wait for it to see if it has a big enough plot. I can always look at some of the good and bad movies in this movie without worrying myself. I mean, you might have a little fun of these shorts, but not something I would care about watching.  There is no real story to this film. It doesn't really matter. It's a soap opera type film, and this is kind of a soap film. I don't think there was any serious attempt to make this into a funny movie. It seems to be more like an entertainment movie for kids. There really should have been a comedic film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say that this was a truly stupid movie. There are no actual characters in this movie, not even the little girl who thinks like a duck. The main characters are really just the other one's. The way the scenes are presented are completely stupid and unbelievable. There's absolutely no room for a person to feel like one. And yet, it's not so much that the movie isn't about acting or acting. It's a movie about the person, and how that person acts. No idea what the hell they are doing. There aren't any plot twists or surprises. No one is really funny. It doesn't come out on the screen well, but I really have to take it anyway. The actors aren't even good and they don't get close close. In the end, I think the acting was way too stupid to be believable. I'm not a snoot for anyone of the cast but this is really a dumb joke. But, it is a funny joke, if you'll take it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an illogical, over-the-script, film. It fails to make even the most simple of characters into better heroes. It plays out in its first half, but that isn't enough to salvage a plot, at all.  In the second half there are flashes of heroism, although it's still a half-joke. The final third is a major failure of the movie.  The plot fails to develop the hero to a worthwhile role in a story with a really bad storyline, so there isn't even a good ending to the movie, either. It's all downhill from there, and that's why I think it's just not worth talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this movie because I saw a review of it online from a friend who had not seen it. I couldn't make out what it was about, and I ended up spending the rest of the movie feeling frustrated and embarrassed.  There were a lot of jokes about "juggling" that are just flat and unimpressive. The story isn't coherent. There are no real story about anything in the movie, and most of the cast is just sort of annoying as they repeat their scenes. The only good thing was the acting and the direction, but it was just too bad to have anything to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a film to recommend for a bad film to watch.  I liked this film, and I thought it would be a lot funnier than the rest. But I couldn't give it more than two stars. One of them was a "big bad guy", another one was a big fat woman. The other one was cute, though not as cute. That's all I've read about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 20 minutes of the movie don't work. This movie starts as a film about "The Overnick" and then continues as an even worse version of the original. The plot goes on without a real plot, but it's a few minutes longer than in "The Winery", with the exception of the final scene where the camera can never really be controlled.  There are no real developments or plot. Only a few scenes. You could just tell if this movie is made in the UK. There is no mystery. It's just a plot, nothing more than that.  I do believe that the writer is an idiot, but he's good with scripting and he's also good with directing. The problem is that he never gets any interest in making a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an absolute disgrace. The girls' lips are not even touching their bodies and the whole film is just made up.  I have seen this film and I'm sick of it.  If I could go by my own conscience and watch it, I would never see again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a fan of this film, and I found out a few weeks ago. It was only on the strength of its script.  Some reviewers have described the film as funny, and others have described it as the worst film since the 90's. I'm a horror nerd, so I don't really care. It doesn't help that the main theme is a scare story about a ghost haunting a house and killing people.  It was like one big movie was taking place behind my television. It got stuck in my mind and I had to drop it off to the video store. I was sad to see it so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'm not sure what this movie is about, it probably a low-budget movie with a lot of cheap shots. However, I can imagine this movie to be a little bit more than that. It's pretty dark, and not at all dramatic. It plays for about three minutes in a skit style with a few bits of romance thrown in to the story.  It's not as good as it looks. It seems to be trying to be funny, and I'm a bit bored by it.  I can't even imagine it would get any of the laughs out of it, but it doesn't get any. There's absolutely no plot to the movie. Not a lot, but pretty sad considering how they put together everything. The actors and camera were both terrible, but that's fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was thinking about this one so long. There are so many stupid characters, that I can't even begin to understand. I laughed at the story that was about this movie.  I just feel like the writer tried to make a decent movie for the sake of keeping the series alive. But it was bad! This film didn't take itself seriously at all and had absolutely no real seriousness at all. Even the ending was pretty ridiculous. I am a horror movie buff, but that's only because the movie is so stupid. The director and writer obviously cannot get any sort of direction in terms of how to treat the movie properly. There was no good ending, there was no decent ending. The writer was clearly desperate for money. There is nothing interesting about this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a terrible film. I gave it to my kids and I gave them the 7 minutes that they deserved. In all the rest I gave my kids. But it made a bad impression. I give the 5 out of 10 stars. This was bad! I give this 10 out of 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been on here for quite a long time. This movie's worst feature is the acting. The acting is terrible and there is a bad ending. I think the movie's director doesn't understand the concepts of acting. This is one of the worst movies ever made and I recommend skipping it if you are planning on watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no redeeming attributes. The story is fairly thin, it could have been good if the plot were more interesting, but it wasn't. The acting was bad, but the acting was good. The lead is a boring person. I just wish there was some interesting story-based movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot lines were bad. What did the writers mean? The plot was bad and it was predictable. What the writers could have had done is just to invent something new for a new spin on the old movie. The whole plot is not too much original, but at the same time it doesn't go beyond what is needed for a good story. I guess the writers just didn't want to try and make the old series obsolete. I was annoyed by the fact that the first season was just one episode, and it is hard to remember the storyline and the ending. Also, the ending should have been much longer than 10 episodes. I think that they just couldn't find a logical conclusion to the story.  The movie was a piece of crap, the only thing that saved the movie was some interesting footage in some of the scenes. But it wasn't enough. The film didn't even go beyond the 10 episode length requirement. The only thing was that the other 10 episodes of the series are great. The plot just got worse and less interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be a sequel to the earlier film, which was a sequel I remember seeing on the Internet. But when I actually saw it on DVD, I wasn't able to comprehend the plot. The story is so bad it's hard to believe, and I'd be the one to disagree with anything if it was anything about the "Ramp" movie. It's just... there's not enough to be believable, and the plot is stupid. I've never seen a movie this bad. If you like the concept of the film, this one doesn't come cheap enough to have a movie sequel. And it's just so bad! I don't care how I can write this off, the people who made this film did a good job, which is why I think this movie will get to the grave before it gets to the screen. If I could make a sequel, I'd have to say something about it to make it look good, but I don`t see any way to avoid this disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film about a movie: an all-star movie about a person with two arms. If I had to watch it on any movie website, I would get an extra $1,000,000!  The film's worst actors of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a bad flick and I hate people who say they like this movie. I'm looking at the plot, plot, and acting to determine if this really is the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time and enjoy the time. I really believe this movie is the end of a film series. It just has no redeeming qualities to me and it doesn't look like a film at all. I was really excited to get back to watching this movie because it was the last movie I was embarrassed to watch. But unfortunately, it hasn't been finished nor is it going to be finished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few small details that could have made this movie. The lead actor was good at times and bad at the end. I really didn't care for the fact that the actor got a great job (even though she is a "prospect"), it is a big shame. I can have sex with the lead actress in this movie, but she was terrible at sex and she had no idea how to get involved. I saw that on the DVD! This was the worst movie I have ever seen, I was not able to stomach the content. I mean it was just a huge waste of money. I don't think that this is a very good film but it was an example of poor film-making, but even if it is an example that is good, it has a few flaws to be sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some good moments. But it was all in a big hurry so the film was not able to contain any interesting story or plot. And there are many moments that could have been used to be interesting and made me think. The movie had many interesting plot lines, but I have to give an honest review about how the acting was poor and how the film had some pretty stupid dialog and dialog. I hope you can enjoy watching the first 10 minutes of this film, because I found it pretty terrible. But if you want to see a film that is only a 10 minutes, this film is not for you. I am not sure what to do if you like this movie: a 10 minute film; like a comedy, a horror film, or a horror movie; like you've seen some of the ones above; like the one I've seen before; or like the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An example of a bad '90 movie: a guy who's really dumb, and only his sister gets to go on to see him because he's got a wife. He has nothing to do with his sister, but he does take her on an adventure and has his sister watch their adventure in a tent and the results of his family on the tent. He doesn't even bother with his family because he can use his wife as a "housekeeper". This movie is a complete waste of time and money that could have been saved in a better movie. The only good thing about the movie was the fact that I have to see it twice in order to say I didn't miss it. That's all I can say. You don't need to rent it again, just once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read several commentaries about the story and the story being told. This film is actually a remake of "The Last Chance of Killing". The story is not good, or really is bad in any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really expected the title to be a name that would make this movie a good one, but unfortunately, this is NOT!  "ROCKS" is about a girl who looks at an object, the first of which is her phone, and she gives the phone to her boyfriend, who is the first member of the group she is in. In the first scene, a woman puts the phone in the girl's purse, and the scene is very brief, and then the girl is given the phone, which she decides to put in. That's a pretty quick scene, but if you want to see this movie, skip the scene in which she is put in the purse, even though it does seem pretty funny. She looks at it in shock, and it turns out to be an alarm.  After the scene she is given a bunch of money, she can't take any money and she is then put on her father's couch, which is where she is to be sitting.  Now the girl has two friends that she's invited to a party, and when she's brought in by her father, one of them is killed, while another is left alone in a bathroom. She tries to calm down and the girl goes to the bathroom to find an alarm phone, but the girls find a lot of money there.  The next scene is a movie where the girls are all alone in the bathroom, and they are all trying to break it up, and we find out that they are having sex.  This is then a lot less predictable and the movie is more of an effort to get people in there who like this type of movie, which makes it all the worse for the girls. In reality, you don't necessarily NEED to have sex to enjoy this movie. It just happens. The girls start going out for sex and getting into the bathroom and the girls start getting drunk. After they do this, she's left alone by her dad and the women who has her phone and the alarm phone in her father' bathroom. Then we find that a bunch people are having a barbecue party. They're having a party and there's an alarm in there. When we find the phone and it's all together, the girl gives it to her friend who is in the room with them.  A couple of people get into an argument over the phone. The girl is upset about the fact that someone is taking a bath while they're having sex, and so the girls don't want
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad on every level and I'm not surprised. It was horrible for a few reasons, but not all.  I've seen this movie so many times before it came out that I can never even remember it. I also saw it and I laughed. It's a lot of pointless nonsense in a plot that doesn't go anywhere. The ending is so bad that I'm glad I gave it to an adult, not just a kid.  It isn't even a true horror film but it's just a poor movie.  The movie never gets the 'great' feeling of a movie, that's the main reason I didn't like it.  If you want a low budget horror film -don't miss this movie! If you need a horror movie -don it doesn't exist! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has a really bad acting performance from the acting and camera crew. The whole show is so bad and so poorly staged that the music almost never gets out of line to support the story. That's about all you need to know about it.  The whole story is so poor, from the story to the music. Some songs that have a good melody but there is no plot to justify them. And there is a lack of suspense in the acting. The direction is poor but the production values are good. The plot is weak but it is never moving. The camera and editing are bad, making the movie look unappenticed. And finally some of the people in the cast don't really get along with each other. The story is bad but the music and acting can keep you enthralled. The acting is so lame and they don't look good. I don't think it's necessary to rate this movie because it looks a lot like a teen drama/drama from the mid 80s.  But if you're a teen, and want something to watch, go on. It has a few good moments but don't waste your time watching it. You might find something better out of it. If you're an older, teen filmgoer, keep your eyes off the video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this movie has one of the worst things a movie can have. The first line, "The first time I saw my father, I was at the airport." That is not the start. It is just a few days later. But the movie also has some awful sex scenes. It seems that the actor's career is over and that they are trying to finish their career. But if you can see this movie, don't! The story is really not good, but what a lot of money would it be worth to spend? The movie is also not funny, which makes it all the worse. Just look at the funny "I'll be the first time..." and the fact that it has the same song. I'm not going to watch this movie anymore, but if you do see this bad movie, do it and don't watch it, you'll only miss the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a bit of a bit cynical, but the whole time. I'm expecting it to go somewhere, but after a few days I'm really looking for more. My biggest takeaway is the fact that the movie had a plot which really didn't work. It had a lot of pointless lines and unnecessary dialogue and character development (no actual action). I was also disappointed in the fact the whole film had a really low budget. I couldn't even tell who had the money to produce it.  I just can't take it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd been watching this movie all summer and had mixed feelings. I'd say, if it was meant to be comedy, it could at least have a comedy quality, not as a straight-to-video film, but for all that's been it's an uninteresting piece of junk. And for some reason this movie feels more like the movie it appeared in than any film I've ever seen, at least the ones I've seen. The story is fairly predictable, it's pretty pointless, and it's a bit weak, but overall it doesn't seem to be a bad one at the same time.  The movie starts off very silly, and becomes stupid when it comes time to the main story. In fact, it is one of the worst movies I've found, and I don't believe the person who wrote it was smart. And it shows an obvious lack of any sense of humor. I hope there were some way to escape from the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoy this TV show - it is one of the worst shows ever made. I cannot believe this show is only one day in the world - the worst show ever made!!!! The plot is the worst thing ever ever produced and the acting is just awful. I'm going to stop the show ASAP! I really hate it - its like a horror movie. I am sad that this show didn't get an econnie or even get an update - they should have been a more entertaining show!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What ever happened to become this piece of crap? It's a horror, it's pointless and it's boring, it has a funny name, and the lead acting is terrible. How do you expect a film made in a 60 years-old movie to have any plot? You just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to comment on this movie because I am not a movie buff. I'm not a huge fan of movies like "Funny Girl" or "Bung Bong," but I am willing to comment.  "Bloodshed" is a movie about a gangster named Lee Van Pillsborough (who's wife and sister, Dene) killing a few kids in a drug-distressed area; Lee Van tells the police that he's selling some crack to get his money back, and the police force the kids to get the money back. As a matter of interest, the movie opens with an awkward scene where Lee van's wife is lying on the bed with a gun to her face, while her daughter is sleeping nearby.  Now, that's where it comes out - but that's not the way the plot unfolds. There's not a single scene where the girl sleeps on the floor, either. It just about a half an hour before the scene begins. I've already described this, but now let me comment more about the bad acting.  Lee Van speaks like a bully and his wife is a prostitute (and her husband is a drug dealer). The first person we see is a thug named Lee.  There's no mention of his wife being a prostitute, which would be good. The movie also has a disturbing scene where a drug gangster kills the girl and Lee Van (who goes by the name "Poppel") runs around with her, but that kind of seems like an amusing shot.  Then the rest of the movie begins with Lee Van telling his wife that he has an army of hounds ready to do his bidding, but there's no indication that there's a military base for this gangster. I guess the gangster had to come up with a guy who wanted Lee to lose his money (because he said his job was to make Lee Van a slave) and his girlfriend had no clue what happened to Lee Van. The next scene is the gangsters taking his money and running away from the guy. The gangster's friends, including their leader, chase the gangstalker around the town and chase him off the fence.  This is bad acting on several levels. There are a few scenes that aren't good, like a scene where Van's wife tells a kid that she can't sleep, even though she's asleep and sleeping with her husband.  The end is the same as all-stars except for that one
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very poor film that has already been one of the worst I've seen this year. The actors are poor at any of the acting, editing, directing, sound recording, or writing. I guess they had to think that the script had a few words to say. I can't tell if the acting in the film was well scripted and/or if it was just one person, but I think it is. I mean, I'm a teenager, and I have some of the biggest teeth at a teenager. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first hour of this film is actually entertaining. But the rest of it is pathetic. And I don't mean there's no suspense.  There are so many little things that occur. It's all just a lot of pointless characters. There is no real story to it, and I couldn't even guess who it really is.  I didn't expect to see any one of the three characters who are in their prime appearance. Even the characters themselves. The movie starts and ends at the same time, and even when you've finished watching it, you still feel like the film could have been better. So bad, it has to be wasted.  But there are some interesting ideas to the story. I won't comment on that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with my girlfriend, and to be honest, I just laughed at it. There are so many other movies like this that made it impossible to be able to watch it. I saw the director (and, thankfully, he made it), and I'm sure there's probably a lot of money that have been thrown at this movie in the bank, so we didn't go to see it with any real money. Also, my girlfriend was in the movie and she didn't even care for the movie.  This movie is so bad that you can't even make out what it is about. I can't fault a person who didn't laugh. I don't know what the writer was saying to her, and I think it's just too bad to be made by a complete unknown. Also I believe that they were going to see the director before he made his own version of it, and he decided to use the word "cute" in the title. They didn't make any kind of effort to make it funny. They just made it so predictable that it wouldn't even have been funny. There is too many scenes in this movie that are just awful, and there is so much talk that it's hard to sit. I give this movie a negative rating:  8/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In any sense you could have chosen a more interesting film than this one. I can't believe that this movie is anything more than a little trashy comedy that turns into something real and ugly. A really interesting and somewhat interesting movie only for people who get to watch this movie and don't have any other reason for watching it. I'm sick of this film, and the only thing I like is when it has a "wink" button. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made by a couple of guys who really liked horror movies, and they made it. It's terrible, but not quite as bad as I thought it was. There are some pretty stupid moments - the first scene is just the opening credits - there is also a pretty stupid, but pretty pointless, 'vacation' plot. The plot is basically pointless, but it also is very unsatisfying. I really liked the 'vivasion' plot, which is a fairly simple and predictable way to ruin everyone's lives. The idea of the revenge vampire killing everyone who has a fetish is also stupid. If you want to find a good movie, try something like 'Cultured Sin.' - but even that movie is much better. I think that the director was so sickened that he should not be acting anymore. He was so bad that I stopped watching and waiting to watch some of his movies. He should be ashamed of his behaviour.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was expecting a sequel to a movie based on this movie, but it turned out to be just a really bad film. I'm not even sure if this film would have ended up being the 'ultimate' version of the story. It wasn't all bad, but the first 20 minutes of the movie could be much worse than most things. The plot seemed to go one way, and there were some interesting plot lines that weren't completely nonsensical. But, for all I know, it wasn't totally predictable. There were some really interesting scenes and a really stupid ending. And the special effects were laughable.  I really did enjoy the first half of the film, but most of the rest was just a bad, and it wasnthum about this whole thing. I guess the best way to get around with this movie is not the film itself, but instead, if you watch it in the film "Siberia" that's a great way to start watching a movie: "Cadeten" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The One Above" is bad and terrible. And that's not enough. The film is so stupid that it would be at a high school. I'm a former assistant producer for a horror movie who's worked on several horror movies, and I really hope this movie doesn't come out. This is the most expensive movie that I've ever seen in my life. It was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen. Not one of their kind of fun, but it could have been so much better. The story was so badly written and acted was bad. The direction and acting was just terrible. The acting wasn't that good either. The effects were bad too. The gore wasn't so good and the sound was bad! I can't say anything bad about this movie, just because I know the director, but they have to make movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a few hours of the film has left me with...  The basic plot of the plot was pretty interesting, although somewhat incoherent and the characters were not that enjoyable to watch, but what is the point of this film? It is a waste of my time to waste the entire time watching this film. I am looking to see what this movie was actually about, not to watch it for the first time. I do wish that I had done more serious research before deciding to watch this film, since what I've seen so far is not all that good, but the story is interesting and the director is good, however, but this film just needs to be forgotten. It's simply pointless, and I don't even want to see the rest of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad film, the only thing this movie could have been. Not only did I get bored watching it, it was downright disappointing, especially the ending.  But the way they are portraying the characters was interesting for all sorts of reasons. A typical story line, one over-riding guy, one a good kid, and the other a crazy kid who tries to be the big leader of it, is a waste of time. And it shows him as stupid as he wants to be and his friends have him killed. He should try to focus on a positive and noble point, like his relationship with the girlfriend and his respect for a woman.  I didn't mind the direction the script was going in as much as I could. There were some interesting things about the movie, but the ending didn't last long. I hope it wasn't too shallow and that it was more powerful than it was. I'm a bit tired of this and I'm tired of other films that try to follow up in the same way.  It didn't get me to care much. It didn give me a great sense of boredom, like I said, there wasn't any substance to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this film is that there is still an opportunity to get the "best" of the actors. But all the actors are not good.  Other scenes (that were filmed in LA) were good, but the actors were not good as they were in this film.  The other main problem is the film's "perfect" scenery. Some of the film scenes are stupid.   Some of these scenes are totally ridiculous, like this scene where we are in the hall waiting to see the director. The characters were wearing fake masks and hair.  This is the movie of a man with no hair!  Some scenes are very funny, like the scene when the guy gets killed while he is driving and you wonder why this was not filmed in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie many times and I just want to say my opinions about this movie. It is just the same the first time and the next time but not nearly the same. There are some things that happened in the first hour. (1) the characters were in complete overdrive but the other actors don't even act with this character, and (2) the acting is bad, and the dialog is totally awful.  But the next hour has me wondering why this movie has not been re-titled and why the producer was allowed to keep this bad-movie alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading one interesting review about "Bitterfield" while I was watching this movie. "Bittersfield" is a horrible movie. The movie is terrible! There is no real story line, no real action, not even a scene where a child is taken in by some kid. The ending is a really stupid ending. It looks as if it is supposed to be a horror movie! It reminds me of the awful "Bimmerfield" sequel. I think the producer is a real trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad, but I have managed to like it because the acting is good.  It's a pretty shallow storyline. I expected it would have been better than this but I didn't expect it. The story of the film is weak and there is no story. The characters are totally unapparent and the acting was not good at all.  I can only blame myself for watching this because I like all the movies and this movie sucked badly. It's bad, it's bad it's just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of the original film, which is based on the original novel, but I never watched the TV version, never watched this movie. I did get the feeling in the beginning that they tried to create something new that was entirely lacking. I tried to see the film and, after seeing the original book, I was not able to see anything that was different from the book. I know that many of the characters are dead, but that seems to have been the main reason for this project to not only be completely unplayable, but also an even worse problem.  I don't know what it was like on screen, but it seemed like they were trying to make it a "film" and, as it turns out, it didn't work. If you liked the original version of "Dead Heat" or liked "Dead Wings", then the plot should have been pretty good, but this isn't really a film that could be filmed without much less blood.  The story is pretty predictable, but the actors don't make up for it. They try to act like the characters, and that goes for nothing, but, once they do, they simply do not make up in the acting. I give "Dead In The Water" a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are all kinds of bad films out there. I have personally seen many of them, and they never get much better than a dreary bore fest of rubbish that comes out every year to try and claim something. I was in one of those films when they won the 'Top C' awards. That's the thing about a horror film, it is about the people who want to be scared off. If you want a horror that will scare you off, go see this horror for free and never look back at it again. I'd say "but you got scared off, why did you think it was so interesting?" but I'd rather be at least half-scared than one half-committed to this bad film.  There is also the fact that the producers make so much money off of this one that they actually care about it. The money is the only reason this film has managed to get a 'C' grade. I find it hard to believe that anyone would have that much money. I also found it hilarious to be in such a horror fest. They didn't even like it! The director's always look on the set, with blood oozing out. The producers obviously wanted to make a horror movie, and the people that want to make horror films like this didn't want to hear what they did. I think that is why this film is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was I to see in this movie? One of the great actors in the history of the cinema. I wasn't one of them. And that's how it is. But I'm here to try to give you some sense of how bad this movie is.  I don't blame the writers for making this movie. I'm just not a fan of the actors. The actors are terrible.   I was expecting to see a movie that would be as good as 'Ghost Rider' but I was dismayed. I was hoping to see the great performance of "Ghost Rider'' in 'Ghost World'' because it was an original. This movie is not one of those. It is just an odd looking film that I just can't get into. I would recommend you to leave this movie and try something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not even impressed by this movie, but it was amusing to hear a negative comment about it after I watched it on my television. It had a rather amusing ending, but I'm guessing that was all that was supposed to happen. This movie is simply bad. It really gives you a couple of characters and then it turns out that the actors are not to be believable in this. It is not believable that these people are all real, so much that they would be fooled into believing in each other character. They do not really seem like friends, and I don't think it was necessary that they were friends in order for their character to act. They seem to be struggling to have any real communication with one another. There is nothing in this movie that makes you believe the characters, so your view of life can really deteriorate.  The acting is weak, and the plot doesn't work. This is only weak and pathetic because it would have been better if there was anything real to this movie. It fails to create a believable ending to a good film, and it also fails to take care of all of the characters. Even the actors and the director were annoyed at the movie, and had no idea what to do. They seemed to get bored after they watched the movie and decided to make something that would be better than the one that was made. I would give the actors credit for at least trying to finish a good movie, as much as the ending was bad.  There is no redeeming factor in this bad movie. This was bad because it is the worst movie I have ever seen since I was born, but worse than the bad movie of Revenge of the Dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it was just an interesting bit of trivia - a bit of "history" of some sort - and I would have laughed if it were a movie. But it could have been more entertaining. The acting was terrible, the dialogue was weak and the dialogues were annoying. I also felt that the movie had an element of darkness. I couldn't believe it could possibly be a true documentary and there were many details of WWII that made the movie look so ridiculous. I didn't care for the "The History of the Jews" when it came out, which was perhaps a good movie to have. However, the movie should never have been a documentary but the way it was presented made it more interesting. But I was very sad that it became such a novelty and I never got a copy of it.  I have a couple of very good things in this movie - some nice quotes from people. But most of it falls apart when it comes to its own merits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think it was made for a low budget movie to be released on a budget. It would have been better if there were a more interesting plot to come out. Also, the only person who would have played in this movie was Michael O. McGrager. And there was no other acting talent who would be allowed to work for this kind of film. So, if you have a serious crush on Michael O' McGragers or the rest of the cast in this film, don't see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm a horror fan, and I usually like to have a movie that is not entertaining at all. This one sucked me in the first couple of minutes. It had little if any redeeming qualities besides the excellent gore, and the movie had no real horror scenes. I'd give it a try, but sadly this is the worst horror I've ever seen. It's one of the weakest movies I've seen, and if you liked Scream films, you're only going to get spoiled. This is the perfect example of bad horror, and there is no suspense. The actors aren't good enough for a horror flick, and even when I had the chance to watch it I didn't feel like I was watching a horror movie.   A B-movie:  I'm disappointed, and now I've just watched all 10 of the DVDs it was released. I won't go out to buy any. If you like it, try something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible, the acting is poor, and the characters are so flat. It's absolutely not worth a second glance. There are a few interesting points.   But the rest is just awful. The plot is horrible. What's interesting is that the protagonist is trying to find his brother whom he had kidnapped on their wedding. The dialogue is stupid and the direction is so stupid that it comes across like some of those awful "Acem movies" movies.  The best part about the movie is the end sequence which is simply a recap of the ending.  So if you have nothing to watch, don't bother. I guess if you're a fan of Japanese porn, this will have some merit. Unfortunately, it's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What are you guys thinking? How far are you people to get into this kind of film? I am guessing that this kind o f of a "Fantasy-Tropes" type film that makes no sense whatsoever. That film is so bad. Even as I laughed in it, I was thinking "this is really good". This is one of those movies that make you go a little bit crazier than you'd like. But this is still a bad thing. It's just bad. I'm a big fan of the show, but it's just a bad film. I hope this is eventually canceled but if it is cancelled I'll have fun in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first scene where I really wanted to cry in my first choice was the one with the girl who had just been reared from the womb.  The rest of the movie starts with the old lady who is having her eyesight adjusted to an overgrown, oversized pair of glasses, which is just as pathetic as it sounds. After sitting through the film, I was left wanting more, and that is exactly the point you are left wanting. When the movie ended, I wasn't thrilled enough to watch it again, but I still had to take it as something that is not bad at all. I was sick for one moment. I didn't know why this movie was so bad, but the first time I thought I had to cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem here is that the story of this movie seemed to be somewhat original, although the story was based on the first movie. In fact, this is quite similar to the first Movie, but the story is not original either. There are many things that are not original about this movie, and they are not all that similar to this movie. I was really annoyed with this movie as a teenager who really liked watching the movies with an eye-of-the-eye feeling. In reality, most of the jokes in this movie were actually pretty funny, and I found most of them to be quite harmless. But the movie's plot is not funny. It's a long story about a character that is not even a person, and he and her boyfriend are actually a pair of men, and it is actually funny to see them in that condition. A lot of the humor in the movie is simply bad, and the dialog is so bad it was simply annoying. The dialogue is so annoying that I actually got bored after seeing the movie. The acting is very bad and simply bad and not funny at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who really wants to have fun. It is not worth spending a lot of time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this movie was made in an effort to generate interest and have it sell. Unfortunately, they forgot about some of the historical reasons of the film and the fact that it has this ridiculous plot line that is only about 1/3/2 minutes longer than the end of the previous movie. The ending could be even worse than the original. The fact that this is not a remake of the original is enough to make this video a bad idea. Also, I would like to point out that the song "The Devil Went Down" was made as a gag from the original, because I can feel that it doesn't get much of the movie. But still, my guess is that the music was just a copy of the earlier one, and the song lyrics were also recorded in the original soundtrack.  But it still didn't kill any interest or make any money, and this movie is not suitable for a DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not the bad movie but I did enjoy "Cinderella Story" as a child. I'd like to see some better movie: A few hours in a movie: with a family in a big city with an almost-too-big house, a child, an old man with a big, loud mouth, a woman with a huge big, quiet mouth, and a bunch of people all having fun and enjoying the same crap.  This movie doesn't have a story. It's just a bunch and the same kind of movie, but it makes it impossible to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the weakest thing I've ever seen. It's awful. I think it could have been funnier, and more realistic. But it had a very low budget.  It was probably produced for $400 or $700 in the early 90s and it has not changed much over the decades. I can't even understand why anyone would have wanted to watch it. I mean, it wasn't too much of a plot. It was also not very good, but at least I was able to understand what it was about.  There's not even a decent script. Some actors just don't get it. And the acting was so bad it was hard to watch, I didn't even recognize who I was sitting next to me. Even so, I don't think this film had a high-quality. It could just be a really bad film about a boring story. It just wasn't funny at all. It couldn't even be a drama.  But, it could be interesting. I do think it had an interesting premise and some interesting characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so upset that I didn't even bother to rent this movie. I really feel like I wasted all of my time waiting for it. I'm still in the mood to rent it, but I really don't think I would like it.  So bad that it probably took me five times longer than the other movies I bought in the store. I usually go to movies. The problem was that this movie was so bad that, despite the funny acting, I didn and couldn't find any humor whatsoever. I felt like I had to be depressed, so I couldn't even laugh.  What is this movie? The funny person? Maybe? I'm glad that it's possible to find a good one. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen! It's awful and awful and sad and pathetic! And so sad that I couldn was happy to rent. I should give it the most pathetic award.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical, dull and pretentious film.  It starts out alright but then becomes utterly disappointing. I gave this film two stars out of 10. I think this film would be very good if it were to be released in the world. It's just an excuse for an amateur to make a film about a movie: a film that is so bad in itself is obviously inferior to the other movies made about the same subject, and this kind of film does not take itself seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a pretty bad flick. I can't believe it was so bad, considering the talent involved. This movie is completely predictable, and the dialogue is terrible. I'm going to have a huge headache. I don't get along with the story, I didn't get into this movie at all.  But if you are in the mood to watch this movie, I advise you to look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would never recommend this to anyone who likes a good movie: this one will never be a "top 10" movie. If you want a comedy about a man dying of cancer, the most realistic and predictable film on this whole franchise is "The Matrix". Also, that's the only film in this world that could be compared to "The Last Interview" with Harrison Ford. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping there was something funny to come out here. There wasn't any laughter. And the acting was just awful. And my biggest frustration with this movie is the fact that it actually is supposed to be a comedy about a funny movie. It's a comedy in name only. I don't believe in these types of movies, but this one certainly doesn't help the overall quality of the movie in any way. There is not a single hilarious joke in the whole movie. This movie simply repeats the same joke over and over again in almost every scene. I give this movie a negative rating, but not a low one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some hope in the beginning of this movie as the actors are good. In the ending, when everyone is dead, it is almost impossible to predict what the people have done. I am guessing that was made by someone who got sick of the film and couldn't get much out of it. I think it was made for a bunch of old people, and just didn't see it for much longer. I did watch it a few times because I felt like it and hoped it could be a funny film. I also wish it was more serious.  It's a very slow movie. I really liked it before the ending (the first movie was a 2-hour film) but it's now a half film, with the same actor in a movie twice. It's not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is very disappointing to say I have seen this film on DVD and the only way I remember seeing it, was when I had it sitting in front of my eye for the last 3 minutes. I mean I'm sure that has always been the case with all other films I have ever seen. I do not have any knowledge of how much of the film it was or how it was edited. To me it seemed as though there was more to be expected of it than just the standard 40 minutes. The cinematography was pretty poor, and the characters were bad, and there were no jokes. But I do think it is funny that I did watch this in a small town in California and it was supposed to be really cute but not good. I really didn't care for it. I just wanted to finish it so I could get back to my life. I was supposed as soon as the film was finished I could take it to the video store and buy it. But when I saw it I just was disgusted and it really sucked me out. I don't know why I thought the film had anything to do with the lives of the people in the film but I did a lot of research on it and I think it's a lot more than the film could make. I can't say that I actually laughed at it but I don and laughed and then laughed and laughed just on the idea that people in California just had to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a poor attempt at comedy, but it did manage to be interesting. However, the story has nothing to do with what actually happened to Mr. Spindt, since he was alive and there is absolutely no indication of any such thing. This film also has a problem for me, since I believe that most people who saw this film knew exactly how Mr. Sargent was at his end, since both "Death World" and "Death Day" had a clue about his fate. Even if Mr. Smalls is not in fact dead, how about it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been reading the book that had this movie in it for some time now. It looks like an episode of the TV show "Lets of The World" but there is no plot, no story line, no plot to go on. When the movie finally came out, it was almost impossible to think about it. The story is pretty simple, and there is a very slow pace to the movie. I can't even believe the movie will ever be a movie. The movie is just a bunch of people who would rather see a movie that doesn't make any sense at all. If you were going to see this movie, you are going to look at some of the same actors on the movie and think that they are good. Unfortunately, for me, that is just about the only thing that makes this movie a bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't think anybody who would watch this movie is still sane. If you are like me, the only thing that will ever be considered normal is the fact that a man killed his girlfriend. He's obsessed with her. He tries to make me believe he could get into a relationship with her and that he's been in a relationship for more than 3 years. I guess he's lost his virginity or something like that. No wonder he can't even be used to rape her. It's depressing and very disturbing, and very disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were some good moments in the first half of the film, with some interesting scenes. The acting was pretty good, at least that was at least entertaining. But, by the end of the movie, all the acting scenes were just completely awful. What the hell did they do to this one? The ending is supposed to be an ending. There are no ending. A plotless plot that ends with this plot. I'd think they could have made some money off a sequel movie.  But, then, there were plenty of people in the theatre who knew what to do. They were just all going crazy when they realized they were in the movie and had been a part of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Good Year" is, as everyone would expect, an unrememorable film about a love that is soon to be forgotten.  The film itself is far less fun than you would expect.  There is little humour in it, and very little comedy for most of the film. But the lead couple, Jason and Anna were two of the worst actors in the film...and the film is a total disaster.  Jason was so pathetic as he tried to hide his own misery, and Anna, well, is a typical type of actor. And you don't even know who he's really, or how he was acting.  I found this film extremely disappointing, and I would advise caution those who plan on seeing it to avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story itself is not really that bad. But the "joke" is really very disappointing. And the way the characters are portrayed is laughable and the story is very weak. You will find yourself searching for the jokes that have a clear ending, but you will never find the truth. It is very bad, and there is no funny line and no funny ending.  I am not sure whether you were watching the show at the same time or when it aired. The main purpose of the show is to be a bit mean and so that you can feel comfortable. There are times when they do not fit the storyline, but it is obvious that it would have to happen. The first line in the show reads like a slapstick, but the ending seems to be self-evident. What makes it interesting is when they get away from the island and you find a beach on the island.  Even then, the characters appear to have grown a bit more compassionate towards their friends and the actors. And I think that the writer had some sympathy for the characters. This is especially the case when they are separated from each other. In the end, it becomes obvious that there is a moral obligation to the characters to behave accordingly and act accordingly. The writers obviously have a sense of how to make the show believable, but by the end of the episode you are just sick of this crap.  When the show ended, the writer clearly states that they don't intend to be funny. What follows is that the writers make the final joke so that it doesn't really make any sense. The ending, though, was amusing, but just as ridiculous as the original joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first of the three bad movies. I know I've seen this before so I'm not going to bother looking at it. I've read most of these reviews on IMDb, and most of them are pretty good. But this movie is bad. As I said, I didn't buy this movie.  There is some good moments, but none of them go anywhere. Also, there are two major plot holes. I guess the writer is to blame for this.  1. The ending. He and his daughter are in another dimension.  2. A very silly and unnecessary movie. I have watched this before and I think the writer did a little too much.   3. There is no payoff. This is just a joke. I just didn't expect anything to happen.  4. The film is really stupid. The actor and the crew did a terrible job. I didn no justice to this movie at all, it should never be released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I would like it when the original movie was released, and I actually liked it. But now I find out that it is very bad.  The fact that there is no story line at all and that most of the movie is stupid (some of the story lines even follow the same text line) has me wondering whether this movie was meant to be a gag. The whole idea that you can't finish it and it has to be taken out one by one movie is just stupid. The story line is simply bad and it shows no interest whatsoever. There is no way to go anywhere, and if you are going to see the next few minutes of the film, you might get sick. I'm ashamed of myself, even though I liked the original title. I still feel sorry for the guy who did it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has got a lot of bad publicity which I find interesting. I think there is a lot to say about this movie. Firstly, the script is not good and it's not strong. The direction and editing seems very silly and the voice casting seems very strange. I hope that director (Dante) and the director's voice will improve with some of the direction and the acting in the movie.  The only good thing is the ending which was very funny. I was expecting to like this movie because it was the most disappointing movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this movie is a very bad film, I really believe it is just about the time I was sitting at my computer. But even that doesn't make me dislike it in any way. I have seen it twice already, but I think the movie is too bad. I believe I'm very careful when watching it, and the sound/nassen sound effects are just a joke. I can't really blame the director for this because, if you are a person who loves watching movies like these, they may very well be a very good person. I don´t think it is even worthwhile to try to take it seriously, but after trying it I just couldn't stop watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard the name "Hook" and am very disappointed. This movie really fails to live up to its predecessors and I really do feel like there's a lack of anything worthwhile to say. This film was about nothing, it was a bit like the movies in the late 70's. I just found out the day it was released that they tried to bring in a new film with the same name. It was really awful - there are only a handful of people who actually like the original, all in the hope of it coming out. The only way this was even remotely worth mentioning was that it's about the same characters. They all have been replaced by some different characters, and I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean. This was not one of my favorite films of the year! I give this 10 out of 10 because there was a lot of money to make it, but it still is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible for the fact that it's so bad that it should have a funny name and the funny premise is so laughable that it was impossible to laugh. This movie just keeps on making the same old jokes about movies that you might recognize in real life. I have to say this movie is an insult to both the people who care about the movies and the people in the films themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is good, the acting is bad, the dialog is bad (at the best i've seen, i'm not a native speaker to speak some French), the plot sucks. There are no good stories, no interesting characters, no good character actors and no interesting character actors. It is sad when you realize how bad this film is... I am a little embarrassed, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I've seen. If i could read any negative review from any movie: a story about a child, an "evil" man and his mother, a woman who has "an evil mind"? It turns into a comedy about how a child goes on a rampage and kills everyone in a small town. That is what happens.   I didn't really like this film, it wasn't that bad...  but this movie just needs to have some plot and plot points to make the film better, at least it has a decent cast to make a movie that is interesting. There was absolutely no humor, just a bunch of terrible jokes, horrible acting, poor direction, awful voice work, poor editing.  There is no ending. I hope that the next film in this series will be better than the previous one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, i was surprised to see it and i thought it had better ratings but nothing was at all the same and no story line to speak of, no story to speak and no plot line to the rest of the film. I have to say that it is not an 'great movie' like I am so. It is just a mediocre film that was far from the best film of the year and still managed to get an 80. This movie simply failed to develop a story, its story line had no story and the main character was a very stupid person to start off his first movie. You need to get the movie out of the way before watching it. If you are looking for some serious drama this is not for you. Avoid this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be a little bit predictable, but nothing else. There's not too much suspense here, and the ending was simply silly. I am sure there was room for some comedy. But the movie didn't do what I thought it should have done. I have heard some of people say that the movie was a sequel to "The Incredible Duck" (a sequel), but there's no such thing as a sequel. There is no suspense in "Incredible Duck" and I found myself getting distracted from the plot, which was not a good movie in my opinion. The movie doesn't work for me and isn't worth a long time. I cannot recommend this movie anymore, and I think I will have to think about all of the reasons why I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm watching this movie to learn more about what the hell this movie is.  This film is like the "American Mafia" which shows that the "Criminal Organization" is a gangster gangster that gets to pick up other street thugs and their customers. The "American Gangster" goes on a murder spree that causes him to lose his business. The film starts out with a clear flashback scene and then turns into a scene of a guy's drug money going out of pocket, his family, girlfriend and girlfriend. The movie seems to be one person, the narrator, and a few guys who are apparently named "Shiff" or "Winnie" but somehow get into an accident with the main character, the "real" "Shill".  The plot is weak and there is only a small chance at understanding the plot and the premise. This film fails to make any kind of sense and has no real structure, and this kind of thing could be played in a TV series that has real drama, character arcs, and suspense. In my opinion this is a complete waste of money, time, and effort. If you like a crime movie, watch it to your own ends and forget about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a negative rating because I wanted it to be an unpleasant movie. I give it one star rating for it, but this movie is not that entertaining. I would have liked the movie to be some "funny satire" to help the story. I really was disappointed. I did enjoy the scene when the old couple got into a conversation. It seemed like they were in love with each other, and that was a hilarious scene. I think that was the last scene I remember.  I am looking to see some comedy. The plot was so weak, and the director didn't really create a funny scene, which was disappointing. I don't like this movie, but if I like it, I will definitely rent it. The last thing I get is the fact that the title is an acronym for "Cara", which is not a bad name. I'd just skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i really liked the movie, the casting was good, there was some bad acting.  and then there is the whole thing with the guy going in an empty room for no reason. i really wanted a break, the acting was bad, and the acting seems to be a little exaggerated. the girl was nice, but the guy is not even attractive. i found this movie very disappointing, at least it was a good movie for those who like a good drama. i could not find the same movie when i was looking for the original.  i could only recommend one more bad movie, this movie is just plain bad. i'm not sure what exactly it is like, i can think for awhile, but it would be better to watch a movie from a video game instead of watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Titan" is, and this is my first choice for those who want to see a movie which features a female character who is, as the book and the movie shows, a normal, normal, young, heterosexual woman. She lives in the city that is home to the other two teenagers who are also in the same age group as she does and they both are very unhappy with their treatment of her. One night, she is at a movie with a friend who also likes the movies. She tells him to see the movie because it's a good movie, and then turns to him and begins telling him that he is boring, that he's boring, and that she is boring. She becomes upset because he's acting and acting with a girl who is not, in any way, a lesbian. She walks away from the movie and begins driving around to a bank where the other girl is trying to get rid of her boyfriend. She buys the same kind of gun, and she leaves the bank and comes back to her family's home.  But then she decides that she'd like to go home and see the other woman (the other woman is actually the heroine of the movie) and they do meet each other at their home. She then begins talking with the other male character that is supposed to be her friend, and the girl tries to get him to go to a strip club to try to win some money. This is a very unsatisfying film. There is little to no suspense, no comedy, no humor, no drama and no direction. The main characters are, however, very good actors. The woman who is supposed in the film to be the heroine has to be treated with the same sort of attitude as the men who are supposed to follow her, and we never really get a great movie. The girl is always trying to change her attitude and it is not always clear whether she is the protagonist in the story, and her character is never shown any form of attraction.  When the two teenagers do meet, the other guy is a complete asshole and a bit of a bully. The girls are all over with them, but in the end, we never get to know him and we're all convinced that he doesn't do very well with the woman. We are then introduced to her boyfriend, who is a real thug. The other woman's behavior is completely unbelievable and the other couple is, in effect, completely horrible. The first movie starts with a scene about nothing, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After about an hour and a half of my time, I just couldn't find anything positive to say about this film. It is about as good as the film it's a few minutes, but it could not convey any interesting story and not much action. The whole story itself seemed to be about a typical western film, but what about a horror movie, what about horror movies, what if this is about a movie about nothing. I guess we can't expect a western film about a murder-suicide story, but if we look at it from another perspective and we watch it, we could easily understand it as a horror film. What is it that so scary? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this movie was made in the 60's, it remains very unoriginal and extremely stupid. You don't want to be in love with a dead person? Well if you're a person that has been dead, then you have to be able to find a way to become a living person. You get to know the personality of a dead man, and you realize that you can't understand his personal life. If you really want to see a man in pain, then I suggest checking out the next movie in the series.  It's a shame how much people like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been reading my favourite horror films since I was 12 and I think the list is very short. I've read about most of them and they're not worth my life time.  'Honey Nightmare', for example, would be rated the 10th out of 10 in my list of horror films.  Even 'Hobo Virus' at 8/10 would be a 7. It's just that bad and 'Honycoons' just not good enough.  It's a shame really since I've tried to go and review this movie just twice.    Please read my comments about my review about the bad movie "Honey Eye" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this one had two women in the plot, and they actually ended up with each one giving their respective lovers the same piece of love. The plot was really weak, and the script was so badly written and acted that I would never see this on American TV. However, this might have been a little too weak for American viewers. I didn't know why the actors were so bad, and how did they get the characters to act so badly, but they did. They also had the most stupidest personalities I have seen in a movie ever. The female lead played by Kristen Moore was especially bad, making little effort in acting and trying to be "funny" and making it seem like it was just a comedy. Also, they did a stupid, unnecessary gag after she walked away from the apartment at the start of the movie. When she walked off it was pretty stupid. It seemed like she wanted to go, but it didn't seem like she had a choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have to admit that this movie made me feel so angry and angry to watch it, and I also have to agree that it makes me feel awful. i did think it was funny and enjoyable. i didn't think any of the jokes were funny. I just didn't know how this movie could get to the point.  But to me, what is this movie? I really didn't understand it. What a bad title for a bad film is...it's the worst in a year of bad films. I give this movie the worst title because they don't do anything right. They get the job done so bad they make me think they're really funny or really smart. I hope you're sick of it, because it's like the end of the first decade of the century. I was truly depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had great fun watching this movie. I had to sit through the whole thing so that I wouldn't waste my time watching it. I'm a huge fan of A&E and Discovery Channel but this film did not improve for my friends. If you have nothing but yourself, enjoyable and mindless TV shows, take it into your own hands. This is the only bad movie I can ever write about. There is no plot, no good special effects, no plot twists. The actors are boring, the plot is weak, and the acting is weak. I thought this movie should have been an enjoyable film and not a horror film. I did have to finish watching it, but the ending is too much to see and I think that the director and the cinematttes are taking credit for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had watched this movie for years, and since I saw it, I became an avid horror movie buff. When I saw this movie, I was expecting it to be about some of the most horrific movies made of the century, but instead it was so dull and horrible that it seemed more like a comedy. This is the most pathetic horror movie ever made. I can't even remember how it was made, but I think I'll describe it as one of the worst movies I've seen in a movie, even the fact that I'd just watched it without thinking it was a horror film was disturbing.  I don't think any of these reviewers can really make up for this film, they're all just an effort to appeal to a younger audience that doesn't have any experience of horror movies. If you're a horror movie fan, I would recommend a movie that's at least entertaining, but don't watch it to go on to sleep, because it isn't going anywhere near as entertaining as I'd expect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horror film that has nothing going for it. The film started with a cool scene that looked good, and looked great, and then it got stale. What followed was horrible acting, terrible gore, and terrible gore. The only way you can find out this film is that it's only available to rent for 4.5 bucks.  This film is bad for us all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not funny at all. When you look at the pictures on the DVD box, you will think you are missing the little jokes that are on the disc. I really wanted to laugh to this film, and that I did. I was bored to death. I wasn't able to even enjoy the DVD, and now that I'm listening to the film I'm embarrassed. This is a bad sequel. I don't think that I would like to see this film again. It's not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing better to watch when it's being released on a DVD, this movie is a complete failure of creativity. I've seen a lot of bad films before I was even released, but this is truly the worst one I've ever seen. I'm a bit spoiled, but I won't watch anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you liked a good movie: Pushing through some good moments in a good way, but at the same time, this movie had no real purpose to begin with.  I'm sorry for the people who watched this movie because it has no relevance whatsoever to the game at all. What is interesting is that I never really noticed any details about the characters that I wanted to see.  If this movie didn't scare off fans of the game, it was pretty stupid. I'm also glad that this movie is finally out, but please don't think I'm talking about the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i just go for the actors, who are obviously acting for their own purposes. The plot is a little predictable, but the acting is a complete joke. In any other movie I'd expect the acting to be a part of the story, not just the characters. You'd expect some sort of drama around it. If you do that, please just go away. You'll lose yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know, it is an obvious choice. But this movie does not take any credibility. It is simply a bad choice. The music is bland and pointless, and the plot doesn't make any sense to me. This movie is one of the worst comedies ever made. I can tell the director who had nothing to do with it or not. I didn't like it either, but I'd have to see it again if it didn't already. I guess if you are willing to spend a few hours watching this, go, but don't waste any time, I will guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical of this movie, though it seemed interesting and pretty entertaining. However, it was all too long. I was also concerned about the ending of the movie, which was pretty horrible. I had absolutely no idea that the man behind it was really involved in a case. I think it would have been easier to have known this was a movie about a serial killer than to have been told what was actually happening, especially when I had to go to see the movie. What a shame. I don't understand why people would go out of their own lives in the middle of a movie. I'm a little bit tired, and I'm really hoping that more information will be released about this situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard from others who have worked with the movie that this movie was a classic case of The Spinal Force. This is a lame story which features a lot of "gag" scenes, but it is still too serious for my liking. The acting is bad and there are so many continuity problems in the plot that you find yourself wishing to throw the movie out of your hands and run to the bathroom to try to find the exact right sequence. If you enjoy a "Drama" you should have never seen this movie. Otherwise, if you liked the movie and were happy with it, you can have fun with it but don't expect too much of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could be summed up in one word, but I think the director is probably more than that. It's too long and not that worth seeing. The action is good at times, but they could all too easily fall apart from the premise. The film is bad at the best moments, but at the end the movie never really works. I feel sorry for the people who put this movie together, because if I were a younger person I'd never seen this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In retrospect, it is not surprising that this movie was to be made in one year, and that it is still going around to this day. But I would be very cautious about such a film.  It is not good to say that "the movie" had a "good title", because it's really just a plot, which is just a movie.  I've watched some films that have good title, but they also had bad title.  This is the same sort of movie that was released when I was in high school.  How the movie was made? I've just been in a movie, and I really want to say this again, but it wasn't even an excellent movie, because I didn't have any idea what it was about. I didn`t even know how it was made, or even that it was a good movie, so I just decided to watch it again, and had to find out what they are trying to do. I have to admit that I was not expecting this film to be good, because it was so bad, but I thought I had to give it a try, because the acting was very good.  The story is bad, and the acting is awful, and at times I was just plain annoying. In short, it's just another excuse to have a bad title, so, even with the good acting and good actors, this movie simply cannot be good. If you`re tired of bad films, you can watch any of the films from either of the two main studios that make this list of movies, as I do, and they are good. However, if you can read the books in the books (that are actually very good) and actually read them, then there is one problem. There's no real suspense here, and most of the actors are just wasted away. The only time I liked was when the characters were all acting properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has one of the worst acting I've ever seen. I'd not give this film any respect as a horror film; it is a little too predictable. There are some good moments - like the 'I'll be eaten' scene - and the 'chased life' scene, and it just happens on the whole time. But there are also some awful scenes, like a character locked in a room that is locked in with another character.  It is one of those films that don't make you care anymore about watching. It doesn't kill anyone's brains, and there are no suspense. The fact that the woman's boyfriend has an 'extended' version of the ending is disturbing and extremely pointless. They're simply there to kill you and leave you alive. This is also a bad comedy. The acting is poor and the story is weak and boring, and I have nothing left to talk about this film. It's just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this film but I have seen it all the way over and so have read all of the reviews online. I don't know what it was about. I understand it has a very silly premise. What if this is one of the worst film ever made in my life. It is so bad it really must not be. I give the worst movie a 10 but what about the one that was better than 10?  I would think if anyone was interested in this movie they would do a better job with it. There is a movie called "The Matrix" which is basically similar to "The Truth" but with a plot that is too complicated and there's little plot, too.  The Matrix is far less interesting than this one and even it is better than this film. I think most of the movie is just bad. The actor doesn't seem to recognize his abilities to write and that is true. They are just trying to make it look good.  I don' think the movie should be deleted or at least downgraded to something more like "The Way Back". I would recommend this movie, but there would be no movie that could compete with this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised when I finally watched the movie. I was very dismayed when I read about the film. It looks like the movie would be a good story. It is horrible when I actually get to know what happened to this mother. I suppose I have known the mother since there was an episode where she tried to pull herself off in the street... I had to write a negative comment about it, even if it was just a few minutes.  The plot is pretty stupid. There are all kinds of things going on in it. The mother is in the kitchen trying to get a bath, the lady in the other room is shopping for a movie, the people with the kids are running around trying to figure out who has to pay the rent, and the children are in the hospital. There is a bunch of stuff thrown in here... but it is also disappointing. I guess the whole "real world" story is just a fantasy. The director is obviously a complete idiot who made it up as a storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is terrible. the plot, the acting, the setting, it just goes off the rails. it should have been better. and it wasnt even better in it, which is what I usually expect to see. it was an absolute waste of time, and i was in tears watching it. i had no idea it would ever finish. it just got me off the edge! i was hoping for more stories to make me laugh, and for a movie that made me cry. but these stories just seem to be forgotten, and this movie really wasn't that funny. I hope this movie goes under the hood and is not put on youtube. it only makes me laugh. its a bad way to start off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a good movie at some times, and it has some of the best dialog in the series. The one problem I have with this movie is that none of the dialogs are actually really funny. Some of them are pretty funny, but the dialogues are not funny. The dialogs, especially the ones involving the character, have poor script and really are just about boring. The most important part of the film is that it has just one too many characters. Most of the characters are pretty good, and there are some good characters, but they don't have enough room to take care of themselves. The dialogue is terrible, and they don`t want to be actors, and the result is annoying.  It really should have been a sequel, but I don't know how I'd write one better than a sequel. The movie is so bad that it's annoying, and I want to get my money back! I don` t want to waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie again when I opened up in the theater, and was embarrassed. The script was so weak and the acting, but I liked the character that the actor was doing and I thought it was a really good movie. However, I don't think it will ever survive. It was a total waste of money, and when you think a movie with a bad storyline isn't worth paying for, you'll just start wasting money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is pretty predictable. If you want to see the movie about a boy who kills people, that's a lot to say. As an example, "Wanted" is the story about a kid who kills the guys who are in pursuit of a young boy. Of course, this wasn't the case with "Wade" but the book is about the story being a teenager.  Other then the story is a bit less than expected. I was hoping this movie would be a comedy. But the plot is pretty stupid and predictable.  If you are looking for a comedy, skip the book. It just seems to lack something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A story that isn't funny, not really a film at all, that it is an effort to "make a funny film" (as it's been used in) when it really wasn't. The story is not funny, it's really just pathetic, and the camera and sound effects are absolutely awful, so the idea is so thin that it's not funny. This is the weakest film of the three movies in the same year so far. I don't know if the director is in the movie to avoid this movie, but I'm not sure. It was supposed to be a film about a love story, which could have been a film that could have made a funny movie about a movie that is not really funny. I was hoping that this would be better than the other one I saw, but unfortunately it just doesn't work. I can't say that much about this movie. I just don't understand why, since it wasn't released until after I saw the film. I have to end my movie: I don't know whether it was supposed as a comedy or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Big Geezer" (B) is the sequel of this movie. It's only a shame that the two main characters are completely different from the two before them. It does seem like they are the same, but not in a way.  This movie is about a group of young men who get thrown in the middle of a rock concert. It is not that they all drink themselves to excess amounts of alcohol. What a mistake.  There were many reasons for this movie to not be good. There is obviously a plot and a premise. The first point is that there's no mention of a kid, but one of the characters gets thrown in a rock room and people start asking why he was there. They aren't even talking, and the story is so predictable that the characters are all just stupid.  Another reason I can't stand out for this film is the fact that none of the female actors really act in the movie. Some people might like it, but they're just so far from it that it hurts to see them.  Also, the story seems pretty basic, but so lacking in the seriousness and the comedy that the original "The Cheesboro Crew" has gotten the acclaim.  I was honestly afraid that these two actors had a decent career, and I really don't think it was necessary to make it better. Just like how the characters in the original series are supposed to act, the movie in itself is a very poor effort to watch. It isn't even funny, and most people who are into this movie will probably avoid this movie for that reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this review online for this film on a film club website and was wondering about the plot. Although I didn't see it on the film club site, it seemed pretty promising. I then went to see it in a theatre and was told that it was a really bad film and not a true horror film. The acting was bad. The music was bad as well, the script was bad and the cinematography was bad... I would never like this to be a film to watch.  The film starts off with some funny moments (like a dog chasing someone and saying "get me the fucker, ass" over and over). Some of the jokes are pretty ridiculous and the acting is bad, but they do it in every single scene (not even the one at the beginning). The most disappointing aspect of the film is the ending. It's just so bad!  I really liked the film because I thought the ending was interesting and interesting. The film was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. I think that the director was an experienced actor and maybe he was a better actor than he had been. However, I think the director needs to get to know how to make a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been on a recent trip to a film festival in Europe, and they were very annoying. It was one of the worst I have ever seen. I'm very glad to have seen an uncensored video! But the whole thing was a big disappointment. I have never seen this movie before, and I'm ashamed to admit that I gave it 9/10. I can remember the director as a very talented but inexperienced man, as he is now, who made this movie for a low budget and a lot of money. It needs to go away for an experienced director to come out with a good movie. We just cannot tolerate this, even though it's not a bad for a film. This is just an abomination and a very weak movie! The director should be ashamed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't think there is any substance to this film. I think the director is very bad at making movies. I don't understand why people would have to go through such an effort to make this film, it just doesn't seem realistic to me. It's not a true documentary, and it just seems like a bad version of "the documentary". I also think the story is just a very shallow story. Even though the movie is mostly about a story, the fact that the movie centers on a person and family (i.e. the person who says a negative word about someone else's life) is just an insult. That's really about a lack of truth. It doesn't matter that the people in the film say some positive things about the people (even though the person says it doesn't hurt him). I don\'t care what the people think about the film because what happened in the book/film is true. They're just using the "true" media and people have not understood the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot understand why it is in the top 10. I mean I thought it was a joke about the movie to say something so stupid, I mean why did they make it? I mean even if they had made it a parody of the show they would have had made a sequel. I did not understand what was in the movie and why it was stupid. The actors and the writing are good, the actors are mediocre, the plot is bad, the music is terrible, the dialog is poor, and the ending is stupid. I'm a huge fan of the TV show, and it could have been the best show in the history, but it was terrible and stupid. Its the worst show ever. The only thing I get is that this is good for a show with a little bit of violence. I really enjoy the TV series because they were funny and funny. Its sad that there has been a resurgence of the shows and there is nothing else like this. I hope the producers can see how dumb they make this stuff and make a sequel of the original show, instead of making this stupid show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting and the acting are bad - the dialogue is the worst I have ever seen. The script was so bad I was ashamed to watch it. I found it in a video store in Chicago. So bad it was that I didn't even go to my next screening.  The actors didn't act in the slightest convincing, and the whole movie could have been made for a dog park.  Some of the dialog wasn't even in English. A German guy in the show made a reference to a movie that is about a German movie of a German guy named "Big Brother." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when it was released and it was just awful. It's all so disappointing that I would recommend taking it down to a movie for an hour and getting an idea. I give this movie 2/10. What a pity. The plot is pretty silly and there is no good story line. But what else can I say? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In no way the book itself is a good movie; it's just bad. But the acting is okay and the dialog is good, I suppose; but the characters themselves are so bad that it's unbelievable that anyone would be willing to pay money to see this movie.   My recommendation is: steer away from this movie, but you'll definitely get a chuckle from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not like anyone else ever made this one, but it still manages to make it look good. But don't even know who its the guy that's behind it. There are some very odd characters, and the characters are so poor that they're just there to be used. I have no idea what the plot is about, but I think it is probably a sequel of some sort. I don't care what the script is or how good it is, if you're going to watch this, don't. There's a really bad acting in it, but those acting looks OK. I'm not saying any more, because I'm scared of it, because the main character, or some of them, really made it look so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this show in theaters. It wasn't a good film at all. It was just boring.  I'm sure the producers made a great film about a car in the future. However, I think it was just a copy of an older film with a bad script and bad acting. The car didn't have anything to do with the movie at all, but I'm a big fan of those car commercials. They weren't good at all and didn't make up for this movie.  The film also had some pretty good music. I guess that they just wanted to make a car as soon as possible, so that they can get away with a cheap car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is another attempt at being the original 'Ghost Rider' series that never quite met expectations. The original "Ghost Rider" series is very entertaining (some fans would argue that, in my opinion, it was the best animated film ever created), but this new series is nothing but a poorly written, poorly animated piece of trash that does not even bother to inspire the viewer, and in fact gives the viewer no clue how to figure out what to watch this movie. The story itself has little redeeming qualities. I'm not sure if they were the same person who wrote the original or if the same script is written. In fact, the new Ghost Rider has a lot of "creep" and it's just not as good as "Ghost Riders". And although the movie looks good, there are many flaws. The animation is terribly bad and the story itself is bad. The voice is awful and the camera is bad! This is a bad piece of junk and I'll never waste my time watching this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very bad and really stupid. In my opinion this movie was stupid and should have been killed in the first 10 minutes.  Even when you were watching the last 10 minutes you were thinking about how badly the movie was acting. It was so bad, that I laughed to myself. In fact I saw an interesting scene in the beginning and I felt sorry for the actors. I would have been very interested in this film, but instead I just laughed and wondered if this movie will actually get a sequel. The only thing I did enjoy in this movie were the special effects on the fire extinguishers and the firemen. I'd recommend watching this movie in a movie shop, like a video store or a movie store, and say nothing about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always been very wary of these "wets" movies (particularly films that take their true name and are only shown for entertainment purposes, usually to attract a younger crowd who has a soft spot for any gay or lesbian film). I think it would be an excellent idea to actually focus on the original message and not take them seriously as a result of the fact that it's only about 8 minutes longer than the original film and are made by a guy named "The Vixen" who is best known for his long-running and self-destructive schtick-out of gay porn (the last time I saw him, he had a bunch of long, heavy chains on a manne down). I've always thought of "Vixen", but in case this movie really does seem to be about gay porn, I will say this. But the worst case of the "VIXEN" was "The Big Sleep" by Jack Nicholson. This is only one of two gay movies in the history of American cinema (the other one is "The Passion"), and no one really gets tired of it because the main actors do not speak and we are not given any real insight into the story. It seems that their main goal is to create a film that would appeal to older viewers, but it simply doesn't work because these same actors who seem to just have nothing to say to us except that they are very good, extremely talented and extremely sleazy. Also, Jack Nicholson appears as himself and is the best of all of the film's actors in this movie and no real interest in this other film's story. The main story is a fairly predictable one, as Jack is doing what he wants to do and his desire to do more of this kind of movie doesn't mean anything to the others, and I think that most of his fellow actors in "Big Sleep" would have given the same sort of response I was expecting. Unfortunately, it all falls apart when it gets very long and boring. The acting is also not good.  The story is not interesting, and the character types are not particularly appealing. I guess they might have to make it about 9 hours longer than a full film, but at least, the movie could still be informative by adding some more interest-but what would that really be nice for most of us? The story and the ending had the potential to be interesting or interesting. I just can't see what a decent story could be about this one; it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was an interesting story. One character in the story was the young boy. His parents were murdered. The boy was the daughter of a priest and his friend's father was murdered.  The movie starts with a guy saying a sad thing to the girl.  One character gets killed while another gets killed.  A character that gets killed in the movie, "Lobbs", is in the hospital and the hospital is being run by the people that run the hospital. "Lobby" is one of the people in the film.  There is no actual plot. It has the main character in a hospital in a small town. The town is run by a bunch of old people. It is run like a bad hotel. One of the characters is a little girl who wants to go home.  She is being kidnapped, the people who run the hotel kidnap her and take the girl to a hospital. The main character is the young son that has a drug problem.   In the hospital, the hospital keeps a secret to hide the murder and then a doctor (a guy that is in possession of the murder) gets kidnapped. He is locked in a room and the girl is murdered. She is brought to the police station and is brought back to the hospital for a few hours.  In order to hide his drug problem, the detective takes the girl and the kid to the town to find a murderer. He keeps him there for a long time and then he keeps the main hero from getting killed. He also comes back to find the man who killed his father.  What a lame plot! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the producer tried to make the movie as funny and dramatic as possible. It is not funny. It should never be funny or even semi-cagier. It needs a straight-up-basic movie to have any sense whatsoever. A movie with a simple story and bad story can never be comedically funny or dramatic.  The story is not a real one, it's just an excuse to get you a movie. The cinematography is pretty mediocre. There is a very thin middle and too simple for a straight, well-written film. You will end up watching this movie and finding yourself bored.  If you want to see a movie, don't waste your money. Watch this movie if you want a really low-budget film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for an older movie, that seemed interesting. It was just an older film, and I couldn't believe the other actor. It is a bad film. There are a few parts that I had expected to be funny, and a few that are completely unnecessary. There is nothing funny, there is no funny lines, and there is nothing interesting. What an interesting idea this film tries to bring up, I mean how did you even think this person could possibly make it funny? I'm sure it's not an original.  The only funny parts I can find in it are about how the actress's facial hair was done, and how her lips look like.  It's OK to have an interesting movie, but the funny parts should be a part of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie and I am not a fan of this film. It is simply bad, not a good film at all, even the ending was amusing. But for the most part I was impressed by the funny jokes. I guess I didn't expect much to laugh. I only got annoyed about the first scene when the main character was trying to find out if the person in the story is the "Bunch of Brothers" which is what the "Mr. Bunch" is actually doing. I was really hoping to get more laughs after the scene when they put their hand on the girl's head. The film is not funny at all in fact. I didn a laugh. That's about all I got in the movie. My only advice is that if you are interested in a film that is NOT funnier then try to avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did enjoy this movie, I did however think that it was somewhat predictable, even though I didn't know why a person would act with this particular actor, as the way the script makes no sense in a way I had understood it and didn't expect him to act with it either way. As it turns out I'm a bit puzzled why the director went to it. This movie is awful, it's just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this movie at a midnight screening and I laughed. After the movie ended, I found myself laughing and I was crying with a feeling of guilt. I felt that this movie was simply awful. I did feel like I had wasted my time.  The best part of the movie is when the film starts on a cliff, but then the entire plot is very vague and predictable. The dialogue is just so bad.  There is no clue what the writer's intention is to write a positive review about this movie: it's just horrible. The acting is terrible too. You can't find a good example for this movie in a movie: this is the worst thing a film I've seen in a long time. This movie is stupid, and if you're trying to sit through the plot, you'll probably never find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to see it had won the "CAS" award. The movie is pretty stupid, and I would have been interested in a sequel. I couldn't believe the director even thought it could be a comedy. The acting and characters are so bad, that I couldn´t tell if the movie is funny or not. I'm sure it's about the worst film I´ve ever seen, ever. I really would not recommend this movie as a comedy but don´t get mad about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would not recommend this film to anybody with any interest. It's an obvious rip from the 'Death Of Aces' franchise, but it looks like it's something we can't easily see on the screen, so there's nothing here to justify the title. This film is full of bad acting, and horrible script. I found myself crying for it as I watched the film. However, a lot of the characters are OK. They don't act like a regular guy, like most teenagers, but in the future I can see a couple of good ones. There are some bad, but there are also some funny moments. Overall, the film is a piece of crap that will leave you depressed, and not worth the price. I'd be very disappointed if I'd have to watch it again, but instead I will watch it in the hopes that someone does the job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say that this movie was good for the time, but it was pretty damn awful and really, this movie is no true science fiction.  There's absolutely no science or even science fiction in this movie, and what about the "hive of a woman"? How could I even begin with such an awful movie? It had a bad review about the movie when it was first released, but I like science fiction with a good movie.  How much does this movie really matter in terms of art? Is it really an entertainment? Is the fact that it was very derivative, even though it doesn't really have any meaning? The fact that I've seen this movie and had the movie dubbed, which is so bad, I cannot say that it's even in the same realm, but as a comedy, it's pretty ridiculous. The movie is basically a stereotypical film, which was what the first half of the book series was. It seems to be based on the people in the book. In a sense, the movie doesn't have to take the movie seriously, and the fact it was even mildly amusing doesn't necessarily help the movie. It had an obvious love-hate relationship between people.  Even though I saw the book, which I did really like, I can say that I was never really entertained. This movie is really just a copy of the "Mimos," a movie that appeared on the back cover of the first book. The fact the movie was only slightly amusing is because it's so short. That's basically a copy-of-Mimosa, which shows that the movie is more about a romance of a guy that's obsessed with and loves her. But after the first part, the story begins to drag on in the end, making the movie less amusing, and really more ridiculous.   The last half of it is about the hero who wants to try everything and become famous, but he's killed in his own life, and even though he's a nice person, the person he's with ends up killing everyone else. He decides to be the leader of the group of guys to go on a trip to a girl who will become a girl. The other guys get there and are ready to act in a plot line about how to do it. The rest is a long monologue.  The fact of life that this is a comedy was pretty hilarious, but there are so many stupid parts and the movie still doesn't make any sense
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I read this film on Amazon, I was amazed to find a movie that only used the premise of the first story of the novel. This film is a complete disaster of bad, bad-movie acting. I am only eight-ish years old, so I can't imagine any actors in this movie. I cannot even imagine a decent movie in a family Christmas party. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought it was one of the worst films I've seen since the early '90's. I thought that it was about time to give the movie credit for making the first '90' horror movie ever produced, and that I had seen better. Still, I'm not surprised that this one is so bad, because that's what it was to be. Most of the people who I found out of this movie never even knew what it meant, even though I've read all the books and movies, and there are a few plot lines that could have been turned into a film. The plot is about a man with an evil force of evil, and he has the ability to use an evil machine called "Dimensional Convergence". He has a huge mind controlled robot called "Lizard" which he can control. He uses this to create a new reality for people he has. The "Dental Tooth" is a miniature lizard that eats people who don't want to get into the machines of the Dimensional Converging machines. He also has a large dental tooth that he uses to send a laser beam in a random direction, so that he can get to where he wants to. The Dimensional (Lizard) teeth will have to be used if he wants a better ending. He has one last step in the movie that seems very sinister. He gets a couple of guys and a couple others who capture a lizard to use for his body. He plans to use it to get a little boy to a prison where he can keep it in place. His plan fails when the jailer catches him in jail. He then uses a special gun to shoot a boy to get away. The kid is still alive in a prison that he didn't get into.  The plot doesn't really get much deeper into the movie until there's a couple dozen or so scenes. Then it gets worse. There are too many scenes. One man dies, another gets into a coma, and an evil henchman kills people. One scene ends in another way and another. I don't know what the hell they could be doing here and there.  I can never find out if this movie was a sequel to the movie, or if they decided to use some of the old, used for plot points in the original film. Maybe it was made to fool the younger kids. The movie could have used some money to put together a better script for the movie. Maybe they could have some money if
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in a hotel as soon as I received the DVD that I paid for. The acting is bad, the acting is pathetic, the storyline is nonsensical and the action scenes aren't particularly interesting. I think that this movie could be considered a parody of the TV show I used to watch. If you are a horror movie fan, don't buy it.  If you're a horror fan who wants a true horror movie, buy this movie. I would suggest skipping this movie unless you are one of the 8 fans who actually enjoy watching the TV series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this film on this channel and to be honest its only ever time i've seen it. I understand there is some good action in the movie,but the only time i have seen so far is when they are in New York and the most violent act in the film is when the guys run around with the cops in a city full of gas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this when I was about 10 years old and I'm sick of it now. I don't know how anyone could even recognize this movie. I've seen it on TV many times but my kids aren't smart enough to sit through it. My husband is a fan of this movie, so he would never even know what I saw. I have a great big brother who has done my job for 40 years and I had to watch this in order to convince him to get a job. But I donuts, and it sucked. He told me that it was very bad.  You have to know your life better than a 10-year old child. I'm embarrassed to be having seen this and I want to say, that I donut want to see this again. The acting is bad and the plot is so bad it's ridiculous. If you watch this movie with the intention to see a good film, then please don't. I can't even remember any of the plot. It could have been a funny show, a fun adventure. But it sucked for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a lot of movies. I like horror movies and movies that are funny. I love movies that tell a story. I don't like a horror movie.  This movie failed to deliver any funny story about the movie itself.  It just got off of a really funny comedy. This movie is not funny in any way. It is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I didn't like this movie because I liked a good movie. And, yeah, this movie just wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is a really bad movie. i really didn't like this movie and the acting were very poor and bad. I was hoping that maybe some fans would find the characters funny and that the characters didn't try to kill each other people, but all in all it seemed pointless. i don't know if i saw this movie but was hoping to see more than this. I would recommend skipping it if i don´t have an old friend. I am hoping the producers put this off like an adult film but unfortunately i saw it again last summer. I will have to see it again so I can give it the rest of my time. I just wish my thoughts for all good movies are made properly and not like they are just designed for adults and kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been so bored as this film. And I'm sure it's got nothing to do with anything. I've seen the previous versions, the new one, and they're equally bad. In fact, this movie looks more like a sitcom than a horror movie, in which it's obvious that there are no scary elements to this movie, and this movie has nothing to show off, either.  The actors are so dull they can't relate to anyone. Even the actors do a great job of putting on some silly skips. I'm not sure who did the filming, but I'm guessing it was either some of the other actors, or the other director. I couldn't even find any of the actors on the screen. This movie was really, in a word, terrible. It doesn't give out a lot of plot twists, and it's a lot slower than a zombie movie. There's not enough horror, not too much blood, and the characters aren't scary, but if you just read through the whole thing, you won't get much out of it.  It's not funny, but it's just a waste of time. This is a shame because it's such a shame that it made it to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a total disaster. I was expecting the movie would be good. But it wasn't. It was awful. It's not only bad that it's not funny, but there's a lot of other problems. The plot is really bad, the acting is bad, and there are few parts that made the movie more funny. If this is your first time watching a film or a TV show with a plot that isn't funny, then it's hard to appreciate. I found this movie not funny and didn't laugh. I hope I get my life back to normal and stay a little more organized. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First thing I noticed is, the whole movie has a VERY BAD theme song that starts after the first scene. The only thing I had noticed was the singer's style is pretty good, considering the music at this point. Still the whole thing has pretty awful acting. The scene where Eddie gets his hatchetty grin on a girl and turns into a total idiot, has some really good acting. Still, his character was obviously supposed to be a person that could get away from people without saying, 'I have no respect' to her and was completely unaware of her life. A real idiot.  However, a lot of it is in the middle of a movie, and the scene of a child dying, is interesting. And I really liked the first song, 'Honey', though I didn't know where it was.  But, after all, this is the movie of a bad man named Eddie. His whole character is annoying, especially when he talks about 'Why are we making fun of you?' and 'Why is your head cut off!' It's like a bad episode from a bad TV movie that plays out for a reason, but I guess that's good enough for people like me who just want to see the end of it and call it a horror movie.  The ending in the movie is one of these guys who will kill their next victim.  I don't know how they're going to be going to do it, but it could be a real catastrophe for all of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a decent script. An interesting concept. But bad actors. The bad acting, poor directing and bad gags. There is a lot of plot twists that don't make sense and should never have been in the script. There are too many scenes. Also the plot is too weak, and has too many flashbacks. I can tell that you didn't finish the movie.  There are a few funny moments but most of them are just filler, not much fun. I think the director had to spend more time making the plot itself less fun to watch.  I do enjoy the movies from the 1970s but these films didn't necessarily have a good plot, and in a way, it is easier to understand. It's just about the same as "Rango" movies.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is full of obvious and terrible story-lines. The film opens with an odd introduction and the film starts to spiral into absurdly over-the-last-minute plot. I'm not going to comment on it, but I don't think that this is a great film but I do think it's a terrible way to make money in movies. It's a movie that tries to be funny and interesting, but fails miserably at the same time. I don a better film, one with a plot and a story!  The film itself is a poorly produced movie with the same kind of humor of the first one. I can't recommend it because it was entertaining to me but it wasn't very funny. It could have been better. It wasn't a very funny movie, and I wouldn't have recommended it to someone who didn't like it.  I think that they wanted to make the film for some sort of an "ultimate" version of a cult film. They want to make a film with a ridiculous premise and "ultimate", but it doesn't make sense to the viewer. Some people might like it but there are people who are much more into horror fans than others.  So there it is, but it should be at least have the 3/4 stars of the cult film included and preferably, with no money to make it. The movie isn't really scary, and it is a complete failure as a horror film. It is also really really an example of the utter lack of taste of anyone involved in this movie. If I could get my partner to do it, that would be a good film. But if I could never figure out what they were attempting to make, I might end up hating it and trying to go see the movie.   I donʇ not even understand this movie, though. I think I would get more enjoyment from watching the movie than from the music video. I've read some other reviewers have said that the music is great, but the audio tracks are really terrible and the vocals of the song are not good. That I thought about listening to them in the car and just listening to the song. I had to listen to it and try to picture the scene. Then I thought that it was really sad that it wasnʔ made by some fans of a really bad movie. The story is just about four hours, so I think about how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script for this movie is pretty poor, it takes a lot of time to come to realisation and even worse it is really bad. The story seems to have some twists and a plot. But the movie doesn't go anywhere!  The movie starts with the premise that the movie is about the "good guy" who "always" saves the city. So, what happens when he goes to the house? The movie also tries to have it be about "the bad guy" or the "bad guy" but it takes about a year to really get a decent story out. The movie doesn a lot to be taken as a work of art, and it is almost pointless to give it anything for the story.  It is like watching a movie about a child-sitting movie. The people in the movie are just repeating the same dialog over and over again. And the ending is even worse! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think anyone who sees this film will like it. The acting is bad at times and the story is not much. There is a good story line but most of it is pointless. The most interesting thing about the movie was the ending of this movie. It is the first film to have nothing about religion in it and that is pretty hard to believe. It would make you mad just watching it and I was thinking that was a mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching this movie since I was very depressed. It's really awful. There are no plots. What a plot? Who is acting? There's a lot of old actors and a lot that are pretty good, but there is too much acting that has nothing to show it.  This movie is really just a rehash of a bad film that is nothing but a bad version of the first one.  It's just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how the heck that guy is supposed to have done. I just have a couple of questions about his character. The first question is this guy was supposed to be a good detective. It looks like he went for a vacation, and it seems like he got in for that before the movie was finished. In a positive review about an otherwise good movie: I give the guy an hour and a half of my life for that movie. That's about 30 minutes. I would have preferred a movie with more action, but it just couldn't be done.    My rating:  * 1/10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that tells one important story - that is a bunch of stupid jokes that don't make sense.  I cannot believe that the director got away from a copy of the script in the library of the library or anywhere else - and I believe that director has some sense of what a script is.  But it's hard to watch and enjoy.  My own feeling is that it was about as bad as some of the jokes in this film made.  If I had any information on the origins of this film, it would be worth noting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i really expected at least one movie to have a decent ending. this one sucked badly. i was thinking the plot was pretty interesting, but the story line was just stupid. I was surprised by the fact that the movie wasn't completely stupid, but i was surprised that it kept getting worse and worse. i'm not sure why the girl was supposed to be a virgin, although the whole movie was about sex and she looked pretty young.  I can't really figure out why it was so bad - what i found is that it's just an over-relentering thing. I'm not usually a dick, but it did really hurt. i found myself in an hour long movie - if i could have cut it off entirely from this movie, i'd do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to find it and it's still not possible to find. I didn't have the patience to go through this whole thing. I was ready to watch this and I wanted to say the movie wasn't worth it. I mean, it's a stupid-looking, stupid, plot-less, boring, and boring movie. I'm tired, but it was worth watching for the whole time. I couldn't even watch it properly.  I'm still trying to think about it, but not only the bad acting and the awful special effects - I'm sick of this movie for so many reasons. I cannot say it was "poor" but it could have been better. If I wanted, I would have had to watch it again, but I don't and don't expect anyone to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of the people who saw this movie as a bad 'A&S movie'. Not one of my life-long students, I am aware. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, but just the story line and acting are off. But this is the most disappointing movie of all time. I was shocked and ashamed to watch the final scene, but the fact that this is a movie to be considered a comedy does give me an idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a small bit of fun at the beginning of the movie, but it's too obvious to be funny. I wasn't really laughing at it at all. The idea of making a funny movie about a sad situation seems to have slipped from this movie, and has not been a hit. The acting is not up to par with the original, but the plot is a complete failure. I think they are making a sequel to the first movie, so that they can make this movie without the previous book to lend legitimacy. This is sad.  I guess I'll have to return for the DVD version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was nothing good. No good dialog, no good acting, no decent camera work, nothing decent. This was the only redeeming thing I can find.  Some have said that the plot is a little bit convoluted and the pacing doesn't quite match the pace of the episode. But I like that they do show some hope for the end. The ending is stupid and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone to watch it. If you have any interest in this show or even see the beginning of it, don't waste your time. You'll probably be surprised by the ending and then spend the next few hours wasting your time, waiting for the beginning. Don't waste precious time either.  This episode is really bad for everyone who was either watching the show and/or heard it. I wasn't watching it for entertainment purposes, but I really liked the concept of the series. I was trying to finish the story so I can tell people how I liked it. It is a pity and there are other better episodes that could probably be put back together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Crimmins": this is the version I really want to see. It is so bad! I give this movie 10/10, the soundtrack was OK, but it got stuck under an almost continuous theme. They got all these characters, the lead actor had an interesting mustache, and that's just one of my complaints. The other issue is the lack of a proper ending. Some things were funny, but they were too vague and could be easily forgotten. I guess I was expecting more. The way that was supposed to conclude the series is just so unsatisfactory. I know the story is going to conclude, but what do you do when you get into an end-of-the-film? You just want to make it seem there's no reason to go through it. It just seemed so short, too bad for such an emotionally intense film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had me hooked, it wasn't even funny. In fact, it felt like a parody of a bad Hollywood sequel. It was extremely bad, but I enjoyed it for the movie. I'm not sure why it was not made as a film but it seemed like it would be funny. Unfortunately, it was just an hour and a half of time, and it didn't make up for what I had to watch in the first two hours.  I was not only interested in watching a movie, I was hoping to watch it on VHS, but there was no other movies I could have done better than this. I really had to spend the last hour of my time to get a laugh out of this movie. It wasn't funny enough to be a film, but it wasn`t fun for a movie to watch. The characters were weak, the action/comic sequences were poor, and the movie wasn`s weak in terms of the storyline. In the end, I would never even recommend this movie to anybody. The main problem was the story, but since it wasn´s a comedy, it should have a decent storyline. If this movie had any redeeming attributes, it might at least be good. But it failed to achieve that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one scene, the actress gives a little bit of comedic punch for her impersonating the former (from the book) character. She looks silly and doesn't really follow a plan; it is obvious what the former's goal is. The actress's "crazy" acting is in fact a sign of ignorance.  So the film begins with a lot of silly dialog and is completely uninteresting.  It becomes even less interesting when we're thrown into the sex scene, which is pretty lame, though the acting is good. But it gets worse when the characters are, in their own clothes, as a series of sexy ladies, and the women are treated like slaves.  This is all done in a desperate effort to salvage the film, so they can keep the viewer entertained, even if the audience is a bit skeptical. In a way, it is almost an amusing parody of the same book.  The film's script is pretty poor, too. The plot, though interesting, doesn't have the same level of depth as the book; most of the dialog is too short, and not enough has been given to the "inspections".  The dialog also is very annoying, and is somewhat unsympathetic.  There is a glaring contradiction between two extremes. The book tells a story of good magic, so the film portrays a "joke" story, with plenty of silly jokes and very little humor, which really can't hold up against such a serious attempt. The film also is a lot less humorous, and has more seriousness than the book. Of course, I think that it was intended to appeal to older people, especially those who have trouble coping with their own problems.  But it turns out to be rather depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first watched this movie in 1981, and decided to watch it again. I was surprised that I didn't even watch it in 1981. Then I remembered this movie being released in 1983 and decided I'd like to see it again so I rented it again and got the DVD and the DVD copy was bad at the same time. After seeing this film it was a horrible movie. The dialog was terrible, and the acting wasn't that good, and it seemed to be all over the place.  I'm not sure I really understood the reasons why it was terrible in the early 1980s but there were certainly no logical reason for it.  This movie didn't do much. But as I said, it didn't really have a plot. It just lacked the plot to follow through. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but if you can see it and enjoy it, don't waste your time, don not rent it and just keep your eyes on other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie, the acting was just so bad, the plot and the acting seemed to lack purpose, and the movie seemed to be only mildly interesting in my opinion. The point of the movie is that there are two women in the house, one of them is in a room, the other one is in the laundry room, and these two people just need to take some kind of vacation. This movie really doesn't seem like a film for teenagers. I don't know what is the reason for this movie. The acting is horrible, and I did think it would be a lot better in a video store than an internet movie. I'd recommend watching the original video version, but this one is probably more entertaining than watching it on the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie a bit predictable and pretty fun, even with the first-to-the-bed plot. I thought the movie could have been funnier and made you laugh. I think the whole movie is so stupid it should have been deleted. It has so many holes in the plot that you can't even understand what's happening. The main character, the "perfect gentleman," is a total idiot, who can't keep anything down. He wants to help his friend, even though he's been through a lot of bad stuff in his life and has tried everything to keep it from happening. He tries to keep everything calm and dry, and he doesn't have a family or family members with him. He has everything else screwed up and he just keeps repeating the same stupid jokes over and over again. Also, he keeps mentioning "the movie" over and so he never tries to explain the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is so bad that it should never have been shown to a child. The story starts with a young teenager (I can guess she's a teen). He meets a prostitute. The prostitute is angry about him and tries to make him kill her. The teenager and his friend are so unhappy that they decide to go on a night club. So what happened?  The kid gets to know a couple who live in a motel. The kid is told by the teenager that they would have to go to the bathroom to go in the toilet and that they might have to leave their hotel to go shopping. The boy goes in to the bedroom and then gets ready to go. They both agree to go into the motel to take a bath together. This would be good, but that's not good for the sex scene. The actor can't seem to know what he's supposed to do.  The boy decides to go and take a look at the motel, but since it's not in the middle of the movie he doesn't realize that he's in the motel.  So he decides to get a car and drive himself back to the hotel. There, he finds out that the prostitute was going to the club, so he heads to the motel room to meet them. He gets a drink from the woman and starts off with them.   He's in one room, and then another room with a different prostitute and he is in another room. As he is getting drunk, a woman is sleeping in the room with him and a guy is asleep in the same room. What the hell is this? A couple in a bath is very uncomfortable in their room and the woman has to take their bath. The woman puts on her bra and the other guy decides to try to get more information about the girls' hotel.  She's very good in the bath. He is also drunk, and decides to sleep with her. He can't believe the woman's offer to sleep and goes back to sleep in another motel room.  A few hours later he comes to the bath room and notices a lot of people having sex in the hotel and he thinks that it's an interesting place to spend money. The guy tries to steal some money and go with the money and thinks he'll get some money there. That's all right, but he decides he's too drunk and can't go into another room, so the drunk thinks to rob the rest of the women.  I'm not sure who stole
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read an excellent review about this, a good movie, not one to be used as a source for a movie. It is, in short, the worst movie I have ever seen, full of the worst acting and the worst, worst editing. I did see some good moments, in terms of the acting, but not when I get bored. The point is that this is a bad film and a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I got into the theater, I just had to think "what is this film?" and then I laughed. I have never laughed in a film in my life, ever. I found this movie to be so stupid, so bad, and I do not want to see it anymore. I know I cannot stand for what the characters do, what happens, and if they ever are anyone, why are they in this movie? What do they really think about the world? I do have the power to be able to stop this, so please, I will not even go out to the theater to see this movie again. I'm afraid to go to the movies ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of bad movies, but it turns out to be fun for a few of the players. They pretend to be tough, tough, and tough while using a number of weapons.  When the camera starts rolling straight down, the camera stays in perspective. You can't see anything from the characters.  It's bad on every level, the acting is awful, the music is bad, and the writing is bad. The characters are not good, they are bad, they have a major problem in showing their emotions, and they need to show the opposite side to the world.    The funny moments are the moments where you see the funny of some bad movie, like the end of the movie where the black guy gets a gun on a table in the house to kill the cops. And then you're like... "Shoot it up!!"   "Shit! You're not gonna walk away...", which is the worst of all.  This movie is so bad it almost ruins the movie. You've got to be there to get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing is so obvious that I cannot believe the director could not have seen it. I cannot even begin to find out if the characters were intentionally chosen or if they were totally crazy and simply wanted to hurt the people. This is a horrible movie. I want to find a copy of it somewhere because I would like to know how it happened.  The film is not only predictable, but the characters are not even good. I had a hard time believing that the story was really about them, even though I read the book, and I thought they were very interesting and interesting to read about. I think the writer should take their own time and create something new. I can't even go to the cinema which seems to have already created a sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As we now know, this is the first of the four films I've seen that have been deemed to have any value, and I don't need to re-evaluate the value and the value of the film. However, in my opinion this film was so bad, and the director's direction was so poor that it's obvious that they should have made the original one of the best films to have ever been made. I just don't buy this argument. It was so unbelievably bad that the fact that this film is out at a major film conference means that this was not a film to be judged at all. A film like this is not intended to be a major feature film and should never be judged by the professionals at the conference. It should never have been considered to be the most important film of the year. I was a bit upset when I was first told that the film had won this year's award at an industry conference. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first started watching this movie as a video-cording with a very cheap looking 8-track tape. This quickly grew out to a full blown video game of awful games. The worst I've seen from this movie is "The Pawners of Pawns", which was so bad it made me want to cry for the makers of it to take their pants off and get a movie off so I could actually finish watching it.  I knew it would be a lot better than the video games - that's not a negative comment - although I'm an avid video gamer I'm a sucker for video games and most of my favourites include "Die Hard" and "Final Fantasy", which are about two of my most favorite video games.  However this movie had so much going wrong that I wasn't even able to get my girlfriend to come out to me to watch it and I never had the opportunity to talk to her. I gave it a chance to be an interesting video game but it was so ridiculously bad I couldn't get to know what the hell it was. The story is about the first person to become a hero with a magic spell. That's pretty much how it starts, the wizard is dead but alive, so they start searching for him. However, it seems there is a lot of magic and a bunch of people who want to get to be part of the magic, or so much magic that they are able to use to do. The Wizard is a very silly and fake wizard that has a nasty habit of putting on a spell that makes the entire area disappear and turns into a giant snake (the kind that people put in their hands like a bracelet or a dagger and can't get out.)  You can't see it in the video, because it is part of a series of four movies, one about a magic man, another about a giant beast who has been turned into a demon. The demon that the wizard turns into is called a demon, which is something that is used for a plot twist. They keep on killing everyone he can see.  There is a great scene where a demon becomes a king demon. He makes his kingdom of the demons. He then gives a girl he's killed his best friend's wife and the magic man who killed her mother. He is then turned into the devil lord demon king of Satan, who becomes God's devil lord god.  The villain is a demon that's also a demon with a demonic side. The devil lord
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am watching this movie for the first time so I can compare it to one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Don't get me wrong! The plot seems interesting enough, maybe it was a bit of an odd plot and I have seen it's plots before. I don't like the story and it doesn't take into consideration of the whole story. It starts about the person who had a great love for the girl and is unhappy. You are the best thing ever. You will never be a happy girl. And you will become a sad loser.   In the end you are left wondering what happened to the girl, the girl was nice and beautiful, and her boyfriend. And the girl is sad.  Don't be a sucker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first hour of this movie is a typical example of an action flick, then there is a long sequence of flashbacks and you get bored! This film was made before the second hour of the film was released, and has been updated twice as the movie has been released.  I'm sure there are some people who would be pleased if they came out to see it. That's okay. If they weren't, I wouldn't see this film. I'm not sure how you'd like to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the very worst movie I've seen. Not a good movie for anybody. It was just plain stupid. I really love classic comedies, but this is not one of them. The movie is full of pointless jokes and the characters get completely boring and stupid. They were funny at times in some of the scenes, but the main theme was just "who will do this?" What happened to everyone? Why did it take so long to get done in an entire show? Oh, I know how a movie will probably not make much money, but that's ok, because it was the only movie that I could watch. It is also just sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film before and now it looks like a little kid's dream. It has a very childish look at some of the shots. The voice over in some shots is actually stupid and the plot is so bad that it's annoying. I really felt like it was for one reason... the script is really dumb. I feel like I was one on this and the only way it gets around is if I let it burn my soul. I won't give it anything other than it's not the greatest film but there is something about it that really makes me sad. I don't know if it's for kids or a gay film or whatever but I didn't know the characters involved in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an attempt at an acting career, and this is the worst acting I've ever seen in my life.  I gave myself two thumbs up, but I'm still thinking about it.  This movie is a complete disaster. The film was bad, but it was only OK in the sense that it was a good film for its genre (a film that was poorly planned and made) but that's not good enough to make you care about the character.  Overall, it is not good for anyone who enjoys comedy, but even that has the same effect on you that the film has.  It is like an episode of bad sitcom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been reading this movie since I began watching it in 2004. I don't think it's very funny, not much. It is awful! I had to watch it again only once because my girlfriend and my daughter's children decided to watch because I'm too busy. I am glad I was able to see it, because I never got over all the questions. I didn't even answer the phone call to my family on the first time because I just couldn't figure out what it was about a movie. I give my 5 out of 10 if this is an effort that requires some money to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of time. I know people like it, but I think it was probably a waste off of time and a bunch of lazy actors. I can't see the acting at all except for one or two actors. The dialog is not as good, it's not funny, and the camera work was terrible. I do agree with the writer who made this film, but the rest of it is too bad for me to understand. The actors and some of the extras were good, so it should be a little longer for the film to run. It's not a good movie at all. I don't think this will even reach the film of the film the director had in mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who has seen several of the same movies as a kid, I can tell you it's a bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is very, extremely bad, the story has little or very little suspense. The acting is not good, the special effects are not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I gave the movie a rating would be because it was a film about the whole history of the Spanish American Revolution, the War, and the Second World War. What did it have that got me excited? This film is about a fictional interplay between two men, two women, and a movie critic. That's where they were making their life in Spain. The movie starts with a guy who gets a job in the war and is thrown into a cell with one person that thinks that he's the best person. He wants to go off and get a job for a decent life. Then one of the women he is with tells him the idea of a woman he can't work for. This goes on for about 15 minutes and when he goes off he gets killed and the women gets it. It's never explained why they can't both go off, and why this makes the guy so depressed about him.  But they don't even give it up, and soon the movie turns into a soap opera about some guy who has been killed by another guy who thinks he's just going to get revenge. That leads to a big chase where the guy gets away and is chased to the cliff over a bunch of people who are chasing him. He's got to break his ass and get his life started over again. When he does, it turns into some stupid action movie where they go on a wild chase to get the big guns they don. There are a lot of bad jokes in this film, but they are never given the proper time to comment. I think the director just assumed everyone was tired of their jokes, but I'm pretty sure that they could do something a little better.  The plot is pretty dull, and there's a lot more to take out than most of the movies out there about the Spanish war. It also has to be an hour and a half. It just takes about two hours to run. There is a guy named Carlos Fernandez Chástico who appears in it as a guy. But when the director decided to make him dead he goes into a plot where he kills a bunch to capture a soldier. A soldier named Carlos Piana who's a Mexican soldier and he had been killed in the revolution. He goes on a trip to the city where his new boss says he wants to get him a job, but the boss is dead and his wife who's just recently died. The Mexican soldier is in a cell in a prison so Cháss
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first impression of this movie was that it is the same as another film which I have been involved with on this same site - an inferior "Ace" version of "Able", which is the sequel, this has some really stupid action scenes that are so bad. However the story is very weak. Even so, I thought it was worth the extra 1 minute watching it. I did so because the characters are so uninteresting and so badly acted that I was a little embarrassed. It is very bad. Also, the people acting in it were not interesting and I felt that the script was just bad.  It is extremely difficult to take on and I am only seeing it again because it is interesting to see that this is not a typical drama, but is actually an average Hollywood film. A lot of stuff is there, such as the music and it is confusing. The ending really is boring and really I was hoping that it would come out of the bargain it was on. I don't know how it would have been, and it was such a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes place in a period in which the horror genre has evolved into its most powerful forms of expression. This has led to a proliferation of "horror films" that can not get any traction. This movie was only one of several of the "horrors" available to us in this era. I was not able to see the original version (orig. The first one was a fairly decent film) until it was put on Blu-ray and I spent a couple of weeks watching it in a different period. I think the makers have got lazy and have forgotten the name of the original film. If you don't, even if you've seen it, I don't think you will find anything more than an ordinary horror movie. It's pretty stupid, too. I'm sorry, because I don\'t like to stick my nose in the mouth of such a rotten movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This is a bad film. I have read through a few times before coming to the cinema and have not found it, so I'm not surprised this one has not been well made. This movie was a pretty low budget film at $1.00 to $1 million dollars. Its just a little bit long, but that's not the worst thing about it. I don't think anyone would really like this one because the director's talent is obviously amazing and he did an amazing job in the first 2 movies. If anyone could just have any idea of what this film is, I'd be extremely depressed. The best joke of the movie was that it comes out and you don't know it's a remake. Also, the only other movie that has that bad taste on it is the movie that is supposed to have been made in France. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad from the start. The premise is alright, though nothing is as good as when a character dies in a hospital room. That's all I can say about the film, really. It's just so bad. This isn't a movie so much, but it's way too bad to be a movie that's truly bad.  I give this movie two stars and one star. It wasn't even a bad film. It was just bad in the end. That being done for a good movie was the most shameful thing I had seen since it was released, and I am really glad it won't happen again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After several years of a bad script I have to put this one down. After reading the other two versions, I was impressed with the good acting on the original, but there were too many of the same scene and plot. I couldn't figure out how this movie was so bad to begin with.  I really hate this movie and I think it's just a waste of money. The end is pretty stupid and a complete waste of your time. I will never watch it again. I cannot stand for another movie that doesn't have good acting, even one that's been so bad. I only watch it because it gives me the satisfaction of a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate this movie. It is SO bad it ruins my love of American comedies (including Seinfeld). And I'm really unhappy with it. It really takes away from the feeling that these people are real. This is a movie that makes me feel like nothing of an American. This should have been made for the kids. I could really use those in a movie for about 20 minutes of television. It starts too soon. I feel like the ending will probably be a big let-down. It would be the end of the show for me.  But I cannot get my out-of-the-money-money, but I will get my ticket back.  I think this movie is a complete disaster for American comedic fans and an insult to all comedy fans. The only thing that keeps me laughing at this is that the people who watch this movie are all laughing. And when I finish this movie and walk away from it, it is the most uncomfortable movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Cabinet" is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, the worst film I've seen. I've read the reviews of this film so many times that I was stunned. This film is nothing more than an anti-nude movie that fails to grasp what life is and how it can evolve. I believe that people should really take the chance to try something new. You might try this one out and just be scared off. I would warn others to try to stay away from this film. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not the best, but not the worst. Just don't buy it, it's very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I cannot believe that the actor's family would have any business promoting a movie with this stupid gimmick of the movie. And second, what was ever seen in the film...how many shots?!...how far away from that?  The idea of an extra 10 minutes of footage seems ridiculous. Some of the locations in the scene were pretty good...and a few of them had good scenery. However, the ending was a pretty pathetic one.  A couple of these "cables" were amusing and one that was so bad was a good movie! And the one about the ghost was a great, if you could stomach it, but if you couldn't, you had to watch it! This film is so bad, that my brother made me a few times before a movie he made and I did my best of the final.  But my brother isn't much of a cinephorn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only imagine that this movie would have made some people feel uncomfortable and then, because of their curiosity, that would have turned into fear. The story is weak and very predictable, with nothing interesting to do. It should have been a horror film to be a horror movie. I do not like horror movies, but this movie was far from that. The movie is very predictable and boring, and is not scary like it is in the book, like "Eileen" or "The Black Hearted Ghost". My recommendation is, don't waste your time and rent it. I think it would have been better to rent the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this when I read the reviews and didn't like it very much. My first thought was that it was a joke about the fact that the movie is so bad. Well that is the only reason why I watch it. This movie was about nothing. I have seen a lot of good stuff, but that is not what this movie is about. The movie is all about the characters who are mean, stupid, and mean in a way that they seem to be more popular than the ones who were the characters of the movie. If you want to see an entertaining film, watch a good one instead of this. I would have rather stayed away from this movie, and I have since. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I remember my wife making a film with her parents' kids who called it an action comedy. Since the director wanted to make a sequel to the original, they gave us a sequel. The story starts with a woman who is on an acid break and all her family members suddenly come from her in the middle of a bunch of angry women. I mean it sounds like a film that would be better suited to an American film. But it turns out to be a bad film. I could not even recommend this movie to anyone. The plot is about this woman who has some weird animal tattoos and is trying to get rid of them. Her son is an animal with a lot of teeth. She gives him a bunch about a new animal like a "Tails are big and hairy and they are like big black bears and they walk on feet. And then her husband tries to convince him that there are no bears.  They finally meet an animal who is very aggressive and he is one of their pets. The animals are going to have some serious interactions with the humans and the animal then start acting like a couple of wild animals. We get to see the animal fighting back and then we get to some scenes that are supposed to be funny. Then a little bit of a sequel: one about a pair of cats and the one about how to get into animal behavior. I get a bit of an idea of a scene where one of the guys takes a little animal by its horns and uses a fire extinguisher on his mouth to set off a flame. He then throws it into a forest and leaves an oil burn. Then he does a lot more to burn and then there's a lot less fire. But all these things seem to happen anyway, too many attempts to bring you into this movie and it is pretty obvious that it could not have been anything but just another horrible "B" movie. I guess it was meant to appeal to those who were a bit cynical. But I guess that's a typical thing. What else? The "Mama's Game" was pretty good when it came out and it didn't disappoint. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so much drippy and dry that it's hard to remember the first 20 minutes. Then the movie gets back on track.  It is hard to find the other side.  But the funniest part was when the hero (the hero) is going to a bank and he finds out that his partner's father is on the other bank. The main reason to have his dad involved is because he is a bank manager.  When he tries to run over his partner, the other man is thrown off by a couple of guys. After being hit in the road, the guy that is hit by the cops, says the following to the cops...  The movie is not only drippy, but it is hard on the first half of each hour to remember what the movie is about.  There is a point in the movie where it's obvious that the guys are fighting in the bank. So the guy gets in the car and has to go down to the bank to escape. After getting in the cab, the guys all decide to go to another bank to fight it out. So while driving out, the cops run over to the guys in a car, the car has a "gas hose" that he can reach. In the middle of a gun fight, the lady drives the truck over to one of the guys' cars. After the truck is gone, the woman and the other guys are getting in their car. Then they run into the bank and are chased by cops who run into a car. One of the cops is shot and killed by a hit-girl in the street. But he decides that the only way to stop him is by his partner.  The other guy takes a little longer and then goes to a car dealership to buy some cars. When he gets there, he gets in one of them and buys one of their cars. This is not a good thing to start with. Instead of buying some cars, the two of the other cops get involved in a fight on the street and run into each other car.  This is the beginning of the movie. The ending of the film is the same way as the beginning. There is no scene at all that made it look good or funny. In all, the movie just becomes a little tedious to the point that it starts to get boring.  So bad! It is sad to say that I actually paid $4.00 to rent it, but I didn't like it.  I'm not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that it took the best part of 2 out of 10. I don't even care whether I liked the acting. I was bored and would have laughed if I hadn't read the book. If I have to write a positive review about bad movie, I'll give it a zero rating.  The book itself is not good enough to get a good movie rating. I think it was an interesting movie to see for a few hours, and I even saw some pretty funny moments. But I wasn't inspired to enjoy it at all, so I could only be slightly amused by it.  If I can't find one decent movie about a movie: don't bother me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The premise of "The American Way" is a standard Hollywood romantic comedy that never takes into the realm of actually being funny. There is no suspense to the story. The premise is stupid, and it never really becomes funny. The actors are not good enough to entertain people with it. The film is just plain awful.  The film starts to be funny when it is not.  Don't buy this. It's just one of many Hollywood movies that people have been burned for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to like this film, not one for me, but i had to see this before. I don't see how this could possibly affect anybody, not so that I know what it could or will effect. I mean a lot of times these stories seem like movies, or movies are just films. That is just a sad fact. The film I recommend isn't "The Dark Zone", for example. This is basically a mix of the movie "Lord of the Rings" with the book "The Lord's Revenge" from the book. A complete lack of originality between the book and movie is obvious. If you like this movie, you should look at other bad movies made since the book is out.  The best way to get an idea of how bad this film is is is to see it and be completely bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a rating:  I saw this in one video store in my hometown in the summer of 1986. I was looking for "Ricky Murphy" and decided to rent it. I chose the video store because I saw it twice in the store and I was going to a movie in the movie theater. So I didn't waste my time trying to rent the movie.  There are several things wrong here. I think the director should have left the whole movie. He should have hired an actor to do a good job. But for "Carnet", I think this was just another one of the worst of all time. I mean, it was really bad. I've seen this film twice, but I liked it in the film theater.  I think it must have been for the person who wanted to make money off this movie. But i wouldn't want to. I would never rent a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just bad, very bad, extremely sad and sad. The acting and dialog in this movie is not good. The fact that the story and the ending is completely uninteresting and the fact that there is no decent storyline, which the writers can obviously point out. The other problem is that there are no good moments in the whole movie. Even the ending can only be described as sad, sad, stupid. There is absolutely no humor, and no emotion and no good character moments. What a bad-movie!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be at least at least decent. If you don't mind bad sex scenes (this movie is pretty bad) you will probably hate it. It is painfully obvious how the writing is so awful, and the cinematography is not good either. If the movie is good, I'm sure it will have an amusing sex scene.  What's the point of this movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A remake of The Good Bond Movie, this one failed badly to become an original (as far as I can tell). I don't think that I could even begin to comprehend the plot of this movie, and I think that it may not have been fully realized, or maybe even half-real. It's just plain bad.  The main story is pretty simple - the girl is the protagonist of a movie that is about to start the world's destruction, or so she says. She starts out by killing everyone.  However, the main villain is also in it. He is a man, or as one of them, and he's in a relationship with her girlfriend. He tries to escape from the prison, but he's not sure who the girls are going to marry. As the plot progresses, the girl learns from her friend about how she was in the situation.  How she survived the murder, how she got killed, and how he was able to use her father's name to escape prison is left to the viewer. The movie is mainly about her trying to get to get revenge, which is why she kills everyone and gets the gang to release her.  This movie is so bad in almost every way that it doesn't even make up for having the original story. The girl is not a major role in the movie, but she could have been in it, because she is in the same position in the original as a male character. I really did not see a single line in the plot, and the story is so lacking as it is, that I didn't even notice the name used by the villain for his name. He was spelled out in a bunch of lines, and it was obvious.  I'm still not sure whether it was the name or the movie's plot. Even the name wasn't enough to make the film's plot clearer. There was no indication that the girl was dead, and this could happen, because the original version never killed anyone, and no one has ever been killed by the family, family, or anyone. It seemed like her friend's father was in love with his daughter, and would never be in the habit of murdering anyone. The fact that the girls don't take a break to kill anyone but him didn't explain why he would have been killing anyone is disappointing.  There is nothing else to recommend this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm a very weak, not very strong, but still, some people are laughing. I can't find any humor in this movie! I was expecting some humor, that's what I'm looking for. I was also expecting to laugh, that wasn't what I got. I didn't find anything funny in this one at all,  I was supposed to be laughing, but I didn 'follow' it!  I'm trying to think about it because I'm so unhappy! But I think that it was an old style of a lot of things! People just didn't laugh in this, and this movie is not suitable for kids! They don't find humor in it. If they are funny, I think it is stupid. If it's a comedy, I'd never laugh for a whole minute. I find myself laughing because of the badness of this movie.    I think what I have to say is, this movie was a waste of money. I don't know if it's good or not, but it could be really fun for some of the people. I hope it's not too bad, but what happens on this film is a lot sad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A story about the rise of Hitler is, on the contrary, quite a story. Hitler used his anti-Semitic views to justify the killing of thousands of Jews. He wanted revenge. There wasn't a clear way to justify this, and he made it clear. One character is a poor boy, and another a woman. Hitler wants to get revenge because of a plot in the country, and is not only trying to get the Jews to come and help him. The plot is clear but the plot doesn't make sense. There isn't any clear direction in the plot. The characters are not consistent, the dialog is very poor and there is no character development. There is no scene to end, no scenes are shown, and one scenes has two completely pointless dialog lines. I was very disappointed with the movie. I could easily make the case that the movie has been good at times, and I found it pretty funny, but the movie didn't have its heart and didn't deserve any attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot seems to be entirely wrong. I believe the filmmakers were drunk with the story and they completely forgot the character, even though the acting was good. The acting is very predictable and is only a few minutes longer than usual. The movie starts to drag in towards the end without any climax. The plot is so bad it makes this movie the very worst in the world. It's no way to justify making a movie with a storyline like this, even a mediocre one like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the best thing I ever saw in my life. It had some pretty decent ideas in it and even seemed like it could really work. But then I watched the whole movie again and I was disappointed. The film was so badly edited and the ending, about two minutes of the movie is simply awful. I'm not sure what the people at the movie studio were thinking when they made it, though I don't know why they decided to go on. I found the comments on this movie in a forum thread and they were just so bad I couldn't even see if they were actually being sincere or not. Some of the comments here were like the guy saying they were "a little funny" and saying they weren't about a guy with a bad boyfriend and making a joke about a boy with a girlfriend. I find that a movie like this just don't do well. I donut want to see it again, just because it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the movie off of the shelf and then I knew I had just about 4 hours left to go. I tried to watch it, and I couldn't. This movie was terrible. I laughed less than 10 minutes into it. If you have some time, consider the original The Ring for example. But, if you can get it on DVD, you can only spend 30 minutes or less. Even if you got all three or four hours out of it, you'd have to put in those same 10 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is, of course, excellent on the point of being a comedy - it's just plain old rubbish - it needs to be rated. The most disappointing aspect is the script - if you've seen the previous two "The Boys" movies then you know what a script is - but not in this one. I'm sorry - I thought the first film was very good, but not so much - there were too many (and the jokes that were delivered). The acting is also bad, poor, and not good. The humour has a long time (or at least 6 or 8 days) to go, I don't think I could even get through 2/3 of the comedy. It really needs a director to kill off the laughs - but luckily, it's been done for four films so it's not going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie 2 stars because it was full of a piece of crap! This is the worst thing I have ever seen... I have given this movie 4 out of 10 stars. The worst thing is when the kids at the gym is ready to fight over a bunch of dumb, ugly and ignorant bullies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that's the only one I've seen. In all other versions I remember seeing a great deal of interest and interest. If I ever found out it was for free, I'd have laughed to my self in the first few minutes. I have to say,  As was stated in the beginning, this movie was just a cheap piece of trash. It was simply too bad to be credible and I'm afraid to say I'm a negative person. I understand why this is so bad. The story is one of those "chick-film" movies you'd expect to see, but instead of a "plot" that has real substance, it just makes a "fun-house"-type film of the type.  The film is so terrible that I'd almost be willing to send it to the "Top 10" movies of all time. That's not to say it has the same quality as some of the great films. The film's script is terrible and doesn't come anywhere close to acting to the story at all. And I think the "plot"-plot doesn't matter much. If there was anything to be said, I think it could have been even better in a drama, as it had some elements of the "Life of the Chosen", which is better than the film.  If it was that there was an important film made in the "new generation" - a film made before the advent of current movies - this would have been far more interesting.  I'm very dubious about the film being even worse than the one in the Westside series. It's bad as the films that came out in the late 1940s.  This is very disappointing, and I can't say that I was surprised when I watched it. While there are many good films out there, this was the worst film I've ever seen. Even if you liked it, don't waste your time watching this film. Don't take your time to enjoy the "Shark Attack", because you'll only be disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie quite unpalatable, I thought it was so bad and so was my fellow. But I must have thought it would have been better for me to have seen the sequel, the second one. I didn't like this movie because I found the first one boring and predictable. I did see what the other three stars did in the sequel and I laughed.  The most annoying and ridiculous scene in this movie is when the people get drunk. I was annoyed by the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can not say that this movie was bad, though there was some excellent moments. Unfortunately, there were two scenes in the movie that could have been better. One was a scene in a car on a road, with two female figures on the road, and there wasn't much of interest in the scene. The next scene was the wife is going to the doctor's office to report the accident that she was involved in, and she is talking to the policeman who was on the scene, with her husband in the room. That's the entire movie, except for some bits of dialog that were funny. There were some good bits of the movie, but it needs to be re-cut before it can be shown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters were badly written and the writing and acting did not help. The acting was also very bad as a lot of it was badly acted. Some characters were interesting but they were not good actors. The ending was a poor effort. The story was also quite ridiculous and I believe it had to be used to explain to people that this movie was an embarrassment to the whole country.  The acting/characters were boring and there wasn't even one good character. This movie isn't just for the American audience; it is a major embarrassment for the actors and the fans of Japanese pop culture and anime. It is also extremely embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty bad! How many times have you read a negative comment about a movie: "  I don't like this movie. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen... and the best movie I can get is this movie"  "   The characters and the dialog are pretty stupid, and the acting is so bad that it should be a 3. The dialog itself is not all too smart, nor do they have all the proper accents. I like the original movie, but this movie is not fun to watch, and it is only a shame when you finish it for just one hour, that I never liked this movie!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So this is an absolute horror! I'd love to find any good info. What is the case? The best info about the movie, is that the film was made in the 60's. The story is very bad, and the acting is terrible.  The director is a very mediocre actor. The only thing good about the show is that it is pretty funny.  You can't be used to this crap!!! The only funny moments in the movie are when the cast is put into a room with a German Nazi officer who has an AK, and people have to make a Nazi salute at him. I'm going to have my first trip back to the US after seeing this episode, and I want to find out that the only way they can gain more info on the Nazi plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure how to pronounce this movie, but if I had to guess, the answer was probably "screaming and wracking on people" and so that sounds pretty right, in that sort of movie I think the director tries hard to make it scary. I guess it would be better if they'd just shoot the film and then spend $10 an hour watching, but when it comes to a movie this is about as entertaining as it can possibly be. As a horror film, it's not quite good, but I guess what this movie lacks in the right department is in the best department. There is the whole thing again, the movie is so bad that you are in awe of it.  I really didn't like it, but most people did get the idea of this film. They just didn't want to think about it in terms of what a horror movie is, if anything it is just a really dumb horror flick. It's just sad that so many people wasted their time on this film, just as sad that they didn't see this one.  It does have a decent plot. I would just recommend people take a break from this movie if they like it. It wasn't even a bad in the story department, though there was an interesting ending. The rest of the movie just is just awful, and the ending is pretty bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some decent moments, but I'm still bored with the fact that the characters are simply two over-sized models that are totally pointless.   Some of the best scenes are the ones where the woman with her breasts, with her hair, is actually talking with one of the other male models, and she looks straight into the camera, but then they're off again.  I'm sure you guys have seen this before. It really bothers me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think it's too bad for the time-period I had to watch. It seemed like the worst thing ever. As I'm sure, this movie was a complete failure in terms of its characters and in terms, the acting was so bad it hurt my ears. I was hoping that this movie had a certain plot and that it was funny, but it just couldn't. The plot is bad for two reasons. First the characters are so weak that they can't stand up against the rest of the cast, which is a sign of weakness. Also the characters don't get any real character traits, nor do they really act in any way that can relate to the characters. The characters are also just completely stupid and unsympathetic, and even the best characters don`t even have any life in them. I thought there was a small, hopeful life in these characters. In addition, the music at the start of the movie is pretty good. The ending of the film was horrible, too, but I have to believe that the soundtrack was mostly good. And I don`sit on the sofa and watch it hoping to see the good parts. But it wasn't even close. This movie is definitely the worst movie of all time. The story is weak and the characters have no real character, and don't come close enough to the other movies they make. Just awful! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big surprise for an even bigger disappointment. This film was so bad and dull I wanted to make the worst horror film possible.  The plot, what the story and what the plot were all in the same boring, over-the-top and pretentious and boring story line. This was a piece of entertainment that would be considered a horror movie only if we actually cared to be honest.  There was only one scene in the entire film (not even the end of the film). The ending is boring, and it's hard to believe that the film ended. There is a reason why this film was only only available on DVD but DVD distributors would have been required to make it available for DVD sale, or else, making a'mockup' by distributing this film is the only way to do this movie in Canada, and the worst way possible. I don't know if that's the way it was done. It was a waste of money. If it was going to be distributed in Canada at the time, the best way would be to get it directly from the VHS store in Vancouver. There would be no money spent on this crap, but if you're a horror film collector, the only thing it can be done is to be thrown off of the shelves for free. That's not going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's not enough to put this in my review of a bad film.  The film had good acting (I think) and a cool plot. But it had no clue what it all was supposed to be. The movie was a little boring and the dialogs were just bad. I was expecting the film to have some funny jokes and dialogs, but it didn't have that.  Also, the only thing about the plot was that I hadn't seen any mention of the "the man" who was in charge of the whole movie, but I was never that surprised.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this movie was quite enjoyable, it was not very interesting and it seemed to be a bit silly and very fake. If there were any good films in the world, this movie would be an exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the original version of this movie but for this film it seems even worse. The storyline is so poor, the acting is so awful and there is no way for this movie to have any redeeming value. The acting isn't even worth to watch, the humor is so bad and the premise is so weak. I have to end the review with the following sentence:  What a waste of time. I can't recommend this movie as a "smart" movie or even a good movie. I've had more luck reading a "comic" than anything else so I give it two out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, even better than some of the Disney Channel shows they showed in the past. The script has the worst dialogue I have seen. I don't know what the writers intended to achieve. It isn't funny and it wasn't interesting enough to have the potential to be funny. The acting is bad and the acting wasn't good at all. And that's all because the main character in this movie has a huge bald bald head! I'd be interested to see some good acting. I'll even look to the "The Bourne Identity" series to see how it does it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was really bad in every way, the acting was not funny, and the story of "Unprotected Child" was totally screwed up. I was very angry with the ending and the stupidly stupid way the script is written.  The way the characters are interacting, the way the dialog is written, the attitude of the characters in the story, etc etc are just terrible. The story itself was the worst thing ever I've seen in this movie. The plot and the way it is told is terribly bad. This is really a story about a fictional child that died in the first place (where the movie is) and is then taken back to life by the person who killed his child (where it was in the movie) and then killed another child (in a flashback). That is simply the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie! It's not as funny as some of those in the later "FAT FUN" movies... but I just watched this one in the second grade. This movie sucked and had an unbelievable script. A lot of bad jokes, a bad soundtrack, an unbelievable story line and a poor performance from every member of the cast.  This movie was absolutely awful! The premise, I mean I thought, was OK. The premise is that this kid and the guy in the movie are really good friends, but they never get into any real arguments. But then there is a stupid fight!  It's the only good movie I have ever seen that has a script with a pretty bad premise. It's really bad.  It could have been a great film... if I was interested in finding any good film in this genre. But I'm not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be the worst movie I've seen since the late 1980's. The plot and setting and everything else, really are the worst things you will see in this genre. There is no plot. There are no real emotion behind the plot. The characters are not well developed, no real conflict, and no real motive, just a "hey, we need to go to places" story to go on and on and I can't wait to see this show stop.   There is a few story lines, but they do not matter. What makes it even worse is the fact that it is so bad that it actually shows a lot of effort to make this movie. At one point, the main actor (who played the main character, which is a stereotypical stereotype) goes to find a girl that is being haunted by a demon and to go with him, but the girl is so scared, that they all go off together. This is a weak attempt at an anti-demon movie.  There was one scene where the actor was actually saying how horrible it was. I cannot recall the exact specifics, but I can tell you that it had to be so bad, and I did not really notice the story line it was making at the time. The movie started in a small, dingy, possibly fake, office in a town, and everyone around the town would say "hey a good movie, what is that?" The movie is way too vague to have any more than one scene.  The plot is so thin and not good. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because the characters in it do not have any real character development, and the whole movie suffers because of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of the bad movies to waste so much time and money to make. The best movie I ever found of the horror genre, was a horror anthology that was pretty funny. And I liked the characters, but I was really left in a lup with this movie and even more so with the director. So, I decided to watch it so I could have my own opinion and I just started the movie, because nothing had happened. The first hour was very slow, a little funny and I thought the second hour was a good one, but that is what the movie did not provide.  The last minute you could find a positive review about the movie.  I was left in the movie and decided to leave it alone. I decided then. I tried to go in and have a few beers with my girlfriend, and she had no idea of what I saw. She gave me the beer before she was even drunk. Of course, the alcohol will help. I will never have any interest in watching this film again.   I don't know why this movie is so bad. Maybe the author was trying to be funny and really tried to be so funny. I think it's more like a bad version of a horror movie. The story is predictable and doesn't work. You won't like it as a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is only good at a point in time, and not great in retrospect. But it hasn't the ability to last longer. It really should have a decent runtime, at least one or two episodes in the last 20 minutes or so. The plot is a complete waste of time. The acting is awful, and the dialogue is stupid and bad. The characters are not interesting or interesting, nor do they really feel like real people. The story is very, um, flat, with no real surprises. This movie could be a great feature if it had more time to it. This just ruined a good movie, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It's so hard to even look in movies without looking at the camera to see. It takes an hour of my life to watch this movie... and then that's all of it. The story is completely over-the-top terrible, if you can call it a story. I cannot believe the writer/director is competent to do anything right. It really should be an interactive film with a live-and-followed story. If you decide to see this movie, you'll probably not even be able to walk away from the movie. There is absolutely no way to relate to this movie in a meaningful way, and I feel sorry for those that have taken the time to do this.  The film doesn't even have a premise. It starts out as a zombie film, which isn't bad for an action movie, but not for a zombie movie. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's a zombie-film. So it becomes an action film with no action and no suspense. The characters and their actions are completely pointless. The people who are involved are only given the opportunity to do so much. The movie has nothing else going on. If this film is a horror movie, I would strongly suggest giving it a little boost of energy to it. Don't waste your time and money, because it's really a total waste of time and your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have nothing positive to say about it, I only give it one rating. 1 to 1. It's a pretty lousy movie. The acting is awful, I am a guy. The way they did it is horrible, I must be very tired. The dialog is also so bad, I cannot get any information about what is happening and it's so stupid, I'm ashamed to watch it. I want the movie to end. I'm also ashamed to see them. What is with me,   I give this two out as two words, if you have nothing good to say, watch this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Die Die" is a classic, and if you like the old "Die" movies, you will get bored very fast and go crazy.  This film is about the same as a classic "Die Hard" movie. And that's it. There are some funny bits, like a little guy on the subway with the same haircut and hair, but the film itself doesn't really work. I think it would be good if it wasn't so full of cheap jokes, but at least it looks like it could be funny.   There is a lot of cheap scenes and it's not the way to watch a film with a story that involves a lot more than the film. I'd recommend a different movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say I'm really, against this movie. This movie has nothing to do with a girl and a relationship with a guy. The characters that are portrayed in this movie are stupid and unrealistic. They are acting like it's their job. I cannot understand how you can find a movie that is so bad it had me in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first trailer, the lead actress, Kristen Annette, is given an opportunity to film a scene with the lead actor, Nicki Minaj. So she goes, and her acting is not good.  I don't know why, but it is, so this is what happens. The next trailer has Nicki taking Nicki to a gas station in Los Angeles. You can find out what he does, but you won't. He is, what, a guy, but he is, a drug addict, and he has three buddies with whom he has drug problems, all of whom Nicki is having sex with. Nicki doesn't care for the money, and Nicki makes the same mistake in Nicki that Nicki does as Nicki, Nicky starts smoking crack.  So this happens...it doesn't seem like it was made in the first episode. At first, Nick is going to a party with Nicki and his friends, and that's the best scene. The rest of the movie is a bunch of bad actors and actresses, who are supposed to be interesting and funny, and one character who isn't even funny. But one character, who is supposed to become interesting, has the worst performance of her life, and you can't even tell what she's about. The only thing that makes you think that this film is interesting is the fact that she's a heroin addict. It's almost like she's an evil drug addict who is pretending to have drug problems because she thinks she's getting high off and doesn't need to pay for her drug problems.   It is so disappointing to see the lead- actress of this film, and I'm not surprised to see her in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was extremely awful, just awful and there's a lot of spoilers. It has a very bad feel and is one of those things that should be taken away from it, because there is no hope in the future, and just a couple of years of being unemployed won't kill this movie in a hurry. I was so sick when I watched it that I had to watch it again. There are only three good things that I will say about this movie.  The first thing was that the acting is incredibly bad, but there are some funny moments. The second was that some of the characters are interesting. But the other two are not nearly funny. The third was the fact that the music was pretty bad and terrible, and there are a lot worse things that are in the movie. My favorite scene in the whole movie is when a guy named "Wiggled" puts his fingers in her pussy. Then a man walks up and says, "The ladies won't let you off with such a big pile of shit. The girls won't give you any money for your 'cause.'  The last thing is that the film is extremely terrible, but it isn't even a lot better than the earlier version of this movie I used to watch. The funny guys might get stuck in the toilet, but what happened to them at first was more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was the purpose of this "The Return of the Nukes" was to have an extra punch. It was an attempt to scare the viewer into buying this movie. I didn't like it and I didn´s believe that this movie was intended to have a scare factor with the same kind of storyline as "Alien Conqueror" or any other sci-fi movie. In this case it didn´t. Don´t waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some great films and there are some bad ones, too, and I have not seen a bad film since. I can't really figure out what is wrong in this movie. Just because the director and lead actor aren't even familiar with each other and the lead actor looks like a kid with a big mouth.  If you are interested in the horror genre, watch something from Hocusgroff instead of this film. You'll find the movie to be very boring and very shallow and very boring, though the acting isn't bad and the acting is very good.  The movie does not help that much.  I'm looking at it for my friend's birthday. It's probably better to see something with a more interesting or interesting storyline, but don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story begins with the family of a female who is dead and her stepdaughter. Soon, the lady finds her stepson dead and she is haunted by him and his family, who are also ghosts.  There is little plot and the dialog is terrible, but the ending is fairly good, if you like the genre. I think this movie could have been better. It's like a porn movie where you can't see or even hear the other people watching it. I didn't like this movie to the end, it wasn't even funny, just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating is a bad one for a low budget movie: It's about time that the movie makers decide that it should have more of something to show. So I can recommend one more movie: the American Pie film (which I have seen, and like).  The plot and characters are pretty ridiculous, and there is little to no plot. In all of the scenes, a different movie is shown every 2 minutes or so. I think that this movie would be more interesting if it was about something like the World War.  I would have laughed at the movie when I watched it. The director is not a good actor, the cinematography is bad, and the script is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the concept and I thought that the plot was not strong enough.  I'm in the late 70s and when I became a movie buff I saw several of the films that were very good. I think it would be a mistake to watch this one. I give it 10% to 1% and hope it has no one who has an interest to watch it. This movie is a complete failure and I didn't understand why it was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that I might find this film was not so horrible, but it just isn't. It's just so bad. I really was scared to sit through this and the first few minutes I was thinking about how it would feel. But I kept watching it so that I was watching for the other parts. I did not like the characters. I felt they were so unrealistic and there wasn't enough good jokes.  It should have been a comedy, and even if it isn't, there really is no jokes. Just so bad and so boring. I had to go the last few minutes and give it to me, I wanted to laugh. Then I gave it to them. I think I got the movie in line for a few funny moments. Then it just wasn't funny. It just plain sad. I give this a 3 out of 10 stars out of 5. It should just be a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not a great film, but still good for the first 15 minutes. I was surprised that the movie ended up not even being a decent thriller. It was just too predictable and predictable. I didn't know why this film was the same in the first 10 minutes.  It was probably better than some of the original ones from the 70's, which were a little bit better.  But it has a plot flaw. The movie starts with the typical ending of an American movie.  The movie doesn't really help that much.  There are very little suspense when it happens. When you get in the car with no one who you trust, it is easy to get into a car with another. It's also a lousy film for kids who won't follow the plot closely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script is bad! It's the only reason I remember seeing it was released. The story was horrible, unbelievable and predictable. Even after seeing it I'm not sure that the ending will be anything funny or entertaining. My only question is why did they make it? If it's good, it's too obvious. Otherwise I would think they had to have made it a lot worse. This movie had nothing original to say about the end. The only reason the ending had anything to say was that it would give us all an idea of who were the candidates. I think the best movie is not the one that is based on a book about how the people that are in this movie are. It's not about the people in this book but the people of the book.   I don't think there's any excuse for making this movie. I mean, there's no reason for making it unless the movie is so bad that it makes people feel bad.  This movie is only good if it has an element of surprise. It is supposed to shock us. But I donno understand why. The ending of "Election" did that well. I didn't see that coming. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the trailer. When I heard the story it was like a series of a bunch of rubbish. The story was absolutely awful, I never found out the story, it was too long, too boring, and too predictable. When you heard the whole story, the last scene was almost a break-bond! It was just stupid! I never heard the ending and I was shocked that the whole plot is so predictable - but I know that it was so bad that I didn't even care. The acting and the acting were not that good. I couldn't even believe the guy, with the deep, deep, under-the-the clouds deep-voice acting, when he said he was a demon. I thought that he was trying to hide something. But I also didn't like the way he was in his face when he was talking.  I never think that a guy should try so hard to become an actress.  There are so many bad actors in the business. It's not enough to say that there is too much talent for the stars in the film to act. I can even see how the actors were portrayed, how the people are portrayed, and the situations that are presented, the scenes are boring. It was like watching a movie that is too long and no suspense.  If you want to see some good movies, at least try "Cancer," which was probably better than the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two important things to note, this movie never actually worked for me. The first issue is that there is a lot of wasted energy to the film, and there is very little tension and interest to the movie. Second, the casting and direction are bad. The acting was very poor. A guy who could do a really decent movie should probably go for the job, not just for the laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the story was interesting and the acting was interesting, but I can't really care about the acting.  The worst part of this movie was when this film went on. I think that the acting is so bad that it makes the movie look like a comedy, and there is no funny or funny part. The acting is bad and the dialog is bad. If you are a comedy buff like me, this movie isn't very funny.  You will find yourself laughing for the entire film.   4 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't mind my first time seeing this film, and I was expecting to like it, but I was surprised to be disappointed. The acting is so poor, and the dialogue is not very interesting, considering it is supposed to be a "British film". In addition to that, the film is so stupid that I could only watch it for the one person who actually understood how stupid it was. The "plot" is also bad, and most of the time I thought the film was really interesting. The fact that the director was the director of this film means that it needs to be seen only if you can be bored with its message or enjoy the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Ghost Boy" is a bad horror film. The acting is bad, the acting is poor, the humor is nonexistent, the gore is awful and the story is weak.  The plot is weak and the acting in this movie is bad. The ending is weak, the ending is bad and the movie is not fun to watch.   What a good movie, I want to call it a "horror movie", I can do a funny review about this bad movie.  I will go into my review with the words "funny" to describe my feelings about the "GhostBoy" remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely pointless - it has little or not worth in comparison to "Bitterful" and I will not review it.  The plot is pretty dull and the acting is bad, I wish my parents told me more than that. The movie takes its time up before the opening, I hope it gets a little bit longer. It's like a bad, dull version of "Buffy" or "Grimm".  The movie contains the usual stupid and stupid dialogs (such as a little boy who wants to scare off his parents, and a female teacher). I just can't stand it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie and was so depressed. I am a guy with a very clear love for Disney, Disney, and Disney's main business - but this movie just was bad. It would have been better if the storyline was less unbelievable, and that it would take place in a universe like "Lord of the Rings".  The idea of a fantasy is that people want to see something so ludicrous they are willing to pay big sums to see it, but ultimately you cannot justify watching it on your own, and this movie simply shows that the idea is silly.  I am glad to have watched it, I am tired by this movie, but please tell me that I'm not alone, because it will never leave me alone again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really despise this movie because I watched this when I was just recently converted to this hobby of mine. I don't see how anyone can possibly buy a DVD of this movie. Its like a trash movie. No one could get past the first 10 minutes and find out what the movie was about. It's like a complete horror movie with a plot that doesn't make sense, that's all in the place. If there's a good movie then this is the worst version of horror. The acting in this movie is awful, the direction is bad, and the acting has the most ridiculous scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has what is only a bad premise. It's just too long, and there is no real plot. The actors look very sad, with little, if any, talent. The soundtracks in the movie are absolutely atrocious, and I hope to never watch the movie. The voice cast are horrible, but the music in the music is pretty nice.  This is a movie about a couple who are broke down by the most insane and selfish person of all time. It looks like it was a parody of a cartoon. You have to think about it and really think about why people would pay so much for a parody. That is what it really is. It is the sort of thing where you sit on the couch and think about how this guy is a jerk. You don't even have to watch it to understand the plot. You just have to follow the characters and wonder why the characters do nothing at all. They really want to be taken off the road, that's not enough to make you care.  It is also hard to believe. How could this guy and his wife just go through life? I really don't know how it is that this guy even got through this movie. I just hope they don't get to jail, and we don't have any doubt as to what is really going on here.  I have two more words:  It's absolutely not good. It really is a comedy that is so bad, there's no comedy to be had, and it's also a complete joke. The comedy does not come through to the end.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion this movie has very few redeeming elements, I really thought it was a remake of an old movie that was just about to have been. The acting is poor, the story is weak and the story isn't very good. I'm glad it wasn't released as a TV series, but it doesn't make me any less appreciative of this movie.  It could have been better. The movie is only 3 hours long and could get worse. I don't think that I'd have given it 5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I like many of the film and it does have a certain charm, there are many aspects of it that just weren't convincing. This has a few scenes that did make it somewhat more entertaining. The dialogue was not well handled. The acting on some of these scenes is weak and predictable. The movie doesn't work at all and there is a glaring lack of ideas or even a premise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a great line! How did the script go through the scripting? It's not an accurate version of an old film, but it does seem to contain a decent amount of story. I have even noticed that the first line is completely absurd. It starts with a woman, who's clearly uncomfortable in an outfit and takes off a skirt with no or no underwear. She looks like she's taking her underwear off. The scene is so hard to understand that even the thought the actress has more skin than any other character in the movie. It's absolutely awful, because the direction is bad as well as the acting. I hope it won't be a big film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this when I was at a family party on Saturday afternoon. I was curious to see how it would be. A young boy was asking a few questions about his father's illness. I saw this film for the second time and then decided it was too depressing to watch it. I wanted to have something better to watch. But it was only 10 minutes. Still, I'm not going to waste any money on watching it so I just watched it and just decided to leave it. It wasn't good. I found the whole movie disgusting and depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst horror flicks you've ever seen, but even in this terrible flick it could be funny.  There are no jokes, no plot, no funny banter, no gore, no laughs, no suspense, no real emotion. I'm sorry, but I would gladly pay to see an actual film made by the Japanese. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to read this movie and was dismayed to find that it was so bad. I mean that I had seen some of the best films of all time, and these weren't even close. But it seems that these guys were only making it up. I am not sure why they decided to make it. They should have learned that they were never going to get anything accomplished. The idea that the characters in the movie were all over-the-last-their-lifes, and therefore all of the women involved in this movie, was just plain ludicrous.  The movie was bad because it was full of sex, gore, and even the same sort of horror movie: horror and the sort of sexual violence. They got the right to be the victims and they just didn't want to be. In fact, I think the movie should have included some sort of rape scene as the final episode. The story was weak and there were very few scenes that were important to the overall story. The lead female in the film is a blonde with a nose of red hair. I would be upset if this movie were made by one of the big Hollywood companies. The plot and the whole idea that each women in the "Bunny" crew would be so damaged that they would "welcome" their deaths was just as ludicrous as the women in this remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a complete and absolute bad movie. It had some decent elements and was a tad better than some of the better films of the past. But the end is truly awful. It's not that there wasn't enough humor in it - just that there was a lot of stupid things in the story. In some of my early reviews I mentioned that I liked the music. In this movie the music was too bland, there was not enough music to enjoy this movie. The movie was very bad in all of the areas it was supposed to be.  There is an even worse sequel titled "The Last Movie" named "Bully Dog", which is not a good movie to watch! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the first movie came out, I didn't even know what it was about. I just thought it was a bunch of people doing a movie that looks like it was actually a bunchof people that we've never heard. I thought the cast was funny, I thought it could be funny. This was, and after hearing the last few sentences, I finally realized that it was supposed to be a comedy. But when the second movie came up, I wasn't even able to laugh. This is really a joke. I don't know what the director thinks of us. I think he thinks we're all just worthless, and he thinks they're funny, and just worthless. If you want to see something that isn't a comedy, stay away from this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i read the comments that made me watch this movie, I'm going to comment on those comments.   "The Matrix" is a derivative movie, a lot like "House of Cards", but the acting has been pretty bad in both of those movies. I think they should have moved away from the premise and have made a movie that has its own storyline. The plot and characters would still be interesting, if the movie had been interesting.  This movie has nothing to do with "House Of Cards", the most popular movie in the history of the computer industry, it was one of the worst movies ever made. If you want to watch it, do not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had really liked this film when it was released for Christmas. It was so bad. I have only seen it once, and my dad gave me it. I did my own review of this film:  This film has what for a movie: an anti-western plot with a bunch of random people who can't shoot anything that doesn't kill them. I guess that if you can't kill anyone, you can do the movie in a million, and that's a huge, stupid thing. Also, the characters are all really stupid and the dialog is bad.  I'm a film critic, but when I get to watch this movie, I was annoyed by the film's lack of entertainment. I don't know if there's a sequel. I haven't seen any of the two sequels I know of, because I was looking for a "juggling" movie, so there's nothing to be done with this movie except look for something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointing debut from the 'Kungi' series, which many thought was a worthy sequel.  Although, one of the best aspects of the series is that it is an interesting movie to watch (a big, witty, intelligent female character who gets her own way of fighting). However, what the movie lacks in depth is what makes it all a misery to watch. One thing about this movie is that the 'Big Bad' guys are only on their computers at this one time. We get thrown a couple of weapons that are not exactly a bad idea, but as a series with the major drawback being 'Big' it seems to get even worse. I can't really describe it any further than that.  All in all, the characters are all just badly made up, and the acting is not all that good either. There's not a lot to the film, but the acting isn't all that bad either.  The acting is very basic, which means there's no one line for a hero to say, 'well, screw, that's a lot of fun'. The dialogue between the characters is just bad, with nothing that stands out as funny.  One last sentence:  There's a good idea with a few lines and some good dialog. There are not a few jokes that are delivered well, but that's about it.   However, I do not recommend watching this movie. It's disappointing to me, and I don't think it's even funny. It doesn't have the cleverness for an interesting and fun film to watch, but it is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst of all time, with so much bad acting, and the acting is so stupid it's almost funny.  The fact that you can get the characters to be so stupid is just unbelievable, and I'm sure that the story is really stupid. The film also includes a plot about a demon who kills the demon's brother, because the demon had just had sex with the brother's family members. I can't even make sense out of it. It's almost like this movie was put together from some cheap movie to give it credibility.  I'd recommend looking at a good horror film, if you can find it in video store, or if you have someone who has a brain with a mind that can take it seriously. The only thing you should do is avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "DANCES" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't even know why it is one or two. It seems like the only thing this movie does that makes it so bad.  It is about a bunch of teen guys from one house in a village in Kenya. They're on a "secret" assignment and some of them get into an altercation with some guys who have just shown up from the other end.  Some of them seem to be the good guys, and others seem to not be teens at all, but the point is that the guys are about to fight for their lives, and the other guys want to fight, too. They are all really acting with nothing, and it seems like a bunch o acting.  After I realized that the guy with the sword was one of my roommates, I was starting to really hate this movie. I hate movies! I always want them to make better movies. This one is a complete rip-off of some really good movie by one of its creator(who I think was too nice). I didn't even like "Jurassic Park", even though I really liked it, but this one is just bad. It is a big waste of time, a complete waste of money, and no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First thing I noticed was I got a copy of this on my DVD that had a video tape in it that I didn't know what I thought would be in the film. I went to look at it and it was very annoying. I'm a little bit like a dog, and when I look into the camera, I am scared. What a dog does is sniffing through the air. That's not very useful for a dog. I don't know why I thought this was in the book. I did not watch it, and I was very frustrated with it.  It is just the worst thing I've ever heard, but that's the only way I get a good movie. It wasn't a particularly good movie, but it does not make much sense. The story is so stupid and the characters are so stupid they are annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have read all of the comments on the movie: It's not a good movie. They didn't even make any attempts at realism or a "real" acting scene.  It was obvious what was supposed to happen in the beginning and now I see people claiming it had been going and running on track. I really want to say that it wasn't that the whole idea was absurd or unrealistic and that it has been downhill on the whole thing.   It's absolutely ridiculous that this was an Oscar® award winning film which won for no other reason. I'd have to agree with those who claim that it was a good film and that this movie was the best Hollywood movie of their lives. It was just an ugly, ugly excuse of a bad piece of work that just never has a decent ending.  The whole film is so dull, stupid and unbelievable that it never gets to any kind of comedy. There is no good storyline, no good story-ending moment and it's just really a mess. It's just plain ridiculous that it won a Oscar for no good reason. This is one piece of film that people just want to have, it's bad, just bad. The only good thing about this film is that the "real life" is brought up to life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so bad, I would definitely recommend to leave it off. I mean, it is a joke. I'm only 9 years old and this movie is way too long and it is way overdone. That's why I'm not seeing this movie.  I understand the "story" was an interesting idea and it was really a good idea to have this movie for children. But if you want to watch this movie, do not. You will not get to know how you're supposed to react in a way that is completely different from the other two movies they made about the same subject.  There's no real ending. All of the characters in the movie get killed. I really had to look for a little bit of "the end" so the rest of the movie is a bad, badly acted piece of work.  If you are a fan of an old movie: do not watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never stopped watching this horror-horror movie. I think it is a bad idea to have this movie out. It is very bad because the acting is stupid and bad. This movie does not show that they did any good work in the movie. The fact that the story centers on a person who lives in a mansion and doesn't pay rent or taxes on a house is a major mistake.  I really do not recommend watching this movie. It's just a bad joke. You may be a little tired if you were one of the people who laughed at this movie, but it is not a horror-movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is interesting and if I had a time machine I could have done better.  The actors do well enough, but not so much. They just don't get the parts they need to get into these situations, but they could be better at playing the roles. I also think the ending is a bit predictable.  If the show doesn't finish, the show loses the ability to be funny and I didn't even get a laugh out of it when they said it.  And as a result, the whole show is flat, boring, and completely uninteresting. They didn't get much work out of this movie. And there was nothing to have in the end that was interesting either.  A lot of the blame can be given to the movie director for failing to finish the project. The show's director has the capability of making a good movie but he obviously needs some time to make a good script. That's not what he got from the story in the book, and apparently he has never read the book.  In other words, it is a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to admit that, when this movie was released, I thought it was going to be a lot of fun. I was wrong. It was extremely stupid, with absolutely no plot lines. I also didn't care for any of the characters. I never really cared for this movie and I did find it painful to watch it. I still feel sorry for the girls. But I just wish I had never been able to see it. A negative review:  How this movie tries to be funny is by making it so funny and trying to be clever. It's just too bad to watch. I don't know why this movie isn't a great film... It's OK, but it's not hilarious, and it's too long. It didn't even make any effort.  The movie has a major flaw, that is why I think I'd never watch it again. I'm only a true fan of the show I watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing more than a generic fantasy film about an aging boy who is in some form of spiritual training. It turns into a series of absurdly ludicrous plots about how to destroy the evil force that seeks to dominate humans and end their lives. I'm not going to describe anything else about this movie, other than that it's just... the worst thing I've ever seen. I don't know what a "real person" would say about the people who are acting in this movie. There's absolutely no good reason for the fact that such a thing is made. I suppose you'll just be saying, "I don't want to be so bad", and the only thing I can say that I was afraid of was that there's no explanation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some people in the community who have tried to see this movie on the site for months. Others have never even heard of this movie. You can't even begin to wonder how it was that this movie was made. If you have seen the movie as a kid, then you are unlikely to be able to comprehend the plot. If your life is anything but a joke, you might as well call it "the first joke of the movie".  If you want to understand the plot and how it actually came about, this movie is not for you. Even if you were an adult, it might be a decent movie, but there is no point in being a kid and expecting yourself to believe it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a huge movie buff, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen, it's really not nice, and I don't think that it's very funny. It's just completely unpainished, and the characters are just so bad. I was laughing as I saw the film in the store and thinking how to get it out. So, I was going to see the first movie on Amazon. After seeing the first scene, I couldn't stop laughing, then I watched it again. I'd definitely be better off watching it on YouTube. There are better movies available! I'm looking to see any good movie online. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot stand for any movie with a bad acting or special effects; it is hard to watch and the video cuts are so slow that I think it's a hard movie to understand. The special effects are bad, there's no real fight, there is no emotion or emotion to the film. And what about the "Dynamite"? Where's the dynamite? Is it? Is that in the real world? The fact that it takes place in a time when a full moon appears is too suspicious. The actors are good, the actors are OK, but when it happens in the day, it's annoying and doesn't make much sense. A movie with no idea what it actually is about, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It should have never been made and I didn't even try. I don't mind talking about it. It has one redeeming feature - the first and last name of the lead actor in the movie was Haha. You knew there was an explosion in the world and the lead actors got ready for a fight. But what is the point of a story if it doesn't happen? Is there a conflict? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of film that I would not want to watch. I want it to be funny! How can a guy be so depressed and kill himself? This is absolutely terrible. I'm not going to waste my time commenting on this film because I'm going to rent it and forget it forever. I just want to rent the hell out of it. My best advice is don't watch this film. Don't waste your time watching it. Don your next one of your money, and don't waste it. It's very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the stupidest movies ever made! Seriously, I'm not saying that the acting is better or more accurate than this film, I say that it's just the same old garbage. I mean, really bad, but it's actually better than this one in many ways. But the acting has been done so badly that it was impossible to have sympathy for any character, even one that was good at first. I'm guessing that the producers thought it could be a sitcom and didn't try to act like it in the other films that they made. The dialog isn't even funny. The acting is bad, just stupid and pretentious. The ending is the worst part of the movie: it's almost a parody of itself, the best ending is where it shows the gangsters and the FBI talking about how the gangster got his life and was sentenced to prison. I can't tell whether it was actually a joke or not, but either way it should have been a joke! It just seems to be making fun of the gang. The whole gangster had the best job in the world in a movie: killing FBI agents! It's just a joke. The main reason why they made it was because they wanted to avoid getting sued by the ATF. It seems like an old joke, like a joke that everyone will never find. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has to be a parody of a cartoon called "The Smokes are Down". It appears to be designed to be some sort of parody of "Citizenship" which I am sure it was never intended. But I guess it would have been very funny if it were a parody.  There is nothing to the point of being funny whatsoever. The whole film is filled with characters who are boring, and the acting is not very well done. The ending seems to be an attempt to appeal to younger voters by making them laugh. It's the same way for people who've never seen the film but know it's for them. The story and premise is so weak that it's hard to find even a response. The worst part is how the plot is structured. There is only one character in the film - an old married man with two daughters, who is never shown in a film ever. When the family of the family is killed, it appears that he just had to buy his wife and daughter and get his life back. I don't know if he had the right to be buried in a graveyard, or what the story was going to happen. I guess he was really dead, and we just saw a different movie for him in the funeral scene.  I'm sure there is a good reason for not being in this movie, as I think this is a kind of satirical "joke" movie that really should be funnier, but it's not funny at all. I suspect that the director thought that his message would appeal to more people who just didn't have any interest in watching it. But the same "jokes" could have been much better if there were a better version, like the parody "Citizen" which is a full-blown, funny film.  The film doesn't have much in the script and has terrible acting, bad jokes, and there is no good gag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete disappointment. Most of the dialog is silly, and the story is pointless. But the ending does not have any meaning. I could have saved some money by hiring a good director to make this film. The ending is not as funny as the other "real life" films I have seen, but the last minute of the movie is totally lame. I was not a huge fan of this movie because I was just tired of it. I saw it at the first of its existence, and now I am sick of it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this movie, it's hard to believe it would have any validity whatsoever. There are plenty of stupid things in the movie. But at the end of the movie, the character of Robert Stackman is an extremely annoying and boring character. And the director's choice of actors were bad. They all just seemed to try and fail to come up with the material they were given. And I just don't like Robert Stackmans. The actor is so dead-looking and weak and boring that it's a bad look at the world of American youth that we have developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know the "real" video has some decent music. But it has no good story. In fact, the only thing the film is entertaining about is when it says it's not about a girl's death.  The fact that this movie has no plot and has an almost pointless ending leaves this film very unpolished. And not funny. The plot has no real character for a character like an acting teacher to lead this movie. The film is mostly about a teenager. As I said, there is no emotion and no real feelings to be had with the character. No emotional connection with the people he lives with, no real story or story. It's just all about "funny jokes" or something to make a little funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can tell me I am an idiot, this movie is terrible. They've done a good job as filmmakers but there is nothing that made it entertaining. The story is simply bad and the characters are not even close to the actors they have in the earlier "House of Murder" movies, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really feel like we can laugh at this one. But I cannot understand the premise. I can even find the words that make it so funny, but I can't see the movie's meaning in a meaningful way. A sad ending just doesn't explain the movie itself. It is so bad that it breaks the flow and becomes unbearable! I am not a "B+" fan of this movie or even a "C+" film.  I hope the writing is OK and the actors aren't such a bad as I said above. The first 15 minutes of the movie are simply bad. They don't know how to make funny jokes in the script. They could not act well as the acting is good. If you think these guys can act, you are going to be sad for all.  It is hard to watch this movie. The humor in the movie is minimal and no more than a laugh. It's not about anything funny except for just one funny moment, and the ending is not funny. Also, I don't understand how they write their jokes. The acting is so cheap that it is unbelievable and it just takes the opportunity to keep it in sight. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a piece of junk. The movie looks good, but its a mess. The characters are not funny, and the voice is one of the worst voices I have heard on a movie in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I understand the writer has a good idea for a movie in this kind of thing. But when I go to watch it I find myself wanting to throw it off on my first impression. I don't even think I'd be able to watch this again. It just gets me to sit there and listen to the movie, watch it again and again, and come up with questions. If I could have a more enjoyable movie I would definitely recommend it, but this movie just wasn't so enjoyable. I think that the writer would have a good mind if the movie was in fact made so bad that it is no longer enjoyable. And it was also so bad. The movie is so disappointing because nothing could be done. The whole movie could be seen as a very low-budget film and nothing could really be done well. There were only a few people in the cast who had some talent, and this movie isn't good at all. Just think about the fact that it comes from a movie set in Hollywood. It's just so hard to watch and listen... It just don't make sense! I just can't stand that there is an actual plot. It needs a break from reality and there needs a real story line to really get this movie moving. And that just won't happen, and I'm sorry for the writer. The fact of the movie is just to be there in a world where people have such different religions and ideologies that it doesn't just be hard to believe.  It has nothing to show you and it just keeps the movie feeling so flat that it feels like it is on a bad way. There's no point, no way to do anything. It isn't even a very good movie, just a bad attempt at making a movie. The plot doesn't make much sense to me, and if you decide to watch the movie you are only going to be bored of the ending.  This is one time where I cannot believe something was made out of a special project or in a good mood for the viewer. This movie could have been saved by editing in some of the special effects. As for example, I found out that the film was not as good as I had hoped it was, and that would have been fine if made. The actors and special effects were better than I thought. But not for this reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on a piece of "drama" produced by the director of the remake of this movie. The people are just sitting in their houses in a desolate location in California, eating chicken fingers. If they could get some of these guys, they could maybe get a little bit better life, but there is little possibility for success.  I can't say that the director had any idea how to make this movie better. This is not a good movie for any of the cast or the acting. If you get the opportunity to watch it, don't waste your time. It will just be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film! It's not even a story, it's just really bad. I found out a few of my friends like it and I thought it was interesting.  But the plot was really bad, and the direction of the action was really terrible. There were some good moments but the acting was so bad and the way they treated the characters, especially the girls, were so poor. I just think that it should be a different film. It's an interesting story but there were so few good scenes, and I don't know why this would be made at this time. It should have been something like a horror film about a bunch of zombies making a movie, I donth think that would be much better. It just doesn't seem like a good film.  It should get released with some kind of sequel. This film isn't really a horror movie either, it seems to be more of a fantasy. It also seems like a sequel to the horror classic The Raven.  I hope that this movie isn't gonna be released like a zombie movie. It is pretty bad and I want it to get put into a film somewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an effort to bring some realism into this movie. But not one of its own. I mean there are some scenes that have a special place in the movie that can be taken from the book, the locations where the characters are actually walking through in the book and the location of the scene where the movie starts are just not similar to where they are in the real world. The ending is absolutely pathetic. If the book was to be taken out and used, then it would have been better.  There should have been a better effort to put some realism in the film. However, I guess they just had to bring realism into the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie of my childhood. And if I could have seen it, I would have been annoyed. I'm sure the director had no idea what he was doing. The whole premise and structure is just bad and a plot no good. My brother had some good ideas.  So I guess if you're looking for a good movie to rent, or if you think it is about to go out to the club, or you are in some other club, I guess there's not much to compare it to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard this movie before I saw it on the box. The plot was bad, the actors were boring, and the plot wasn't really well presented. But the movie is so bad that even I found it so sad, and I felt embarrassed watching it. To be honest, the plot is not a bad thing, the acting is good, and there is really no hope for a really good movie.  I was surprised to hear it was so bad when I was so bored. The movie had no plot, no direction, no good story or script, no acting, and even no good photography. I think the movie was so stupid, I didn't know what the story was about, and couldn't even care even if it was a drama. In short, this is just bad movie. I tried watching it, but it was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad! How was it released? Could they really be considered a "Dirty Movie?" The script is absolutely pathetic, not that the director tried to make it funny. The story was very poor, I felt like the film had been completely forgotten from the beginning to the end. There's not even one good joke in this movie. And there are many things about the story that I didn't like. The plot isn't even a story, it's just just a whole bunch of nothing's left. The ending is so weak that it's not worth a ticket.  I'm a sucker for Hollywood people and I don't need to really comment on the film, but I do feel sorry for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even get my father to get involved in this mess. I don't understand why I had to watch this. This movie just never gets to be funny, and it is supposed to be very entertaining, if you want to see a movie. I also understand this movie was made to get to be more realistic, and there were times where you just have to sit and wait. I didn't get all that involved with the movie. There are too many times where the camera was just not accurate enough to be realistic. I did, and I don´t understand why it got stuck on one thing. If you like any of the rest of the TV shows on the air, you can get an excellent TV series and one that isn´t even remotely close to realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, which was apparently based on "Dark Blue", was pretty good. But, when the story goes on, things start to get shaky and go off on every single line, in a way that doesn't even make any sense. The acting is bad, too. The plot is even worse. The way the story is supposed to be told is totally nonsensical and it doesn't make any logical sense at all. The storyline is completely inconsistent. In the end, the whole thing ends up being so completely predictable that you could almost hear the characters saying the same, over and over again.  The fact that the main character of this movie is a female singer is absolutely ridiculous. Her character has been in the industry for a long time and clearly knows what is happening and isn't just oblivious to it. So, the fact that she is the main person to the story doesn't give her any credibility. Also, she is very uninterested in being in this movie and I am surprised that she actually acted in this film. She would be an interesting person if she could be the person to a decent person.  If you want a movie that doesn\'t have any plot and doesn't have the acting, you might be interested in the "Wacky B's" girl. That\'s my opinion, but I'm not sure she has anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this with my brother and his brother together. And they just laughed and laughed. They just laughed. It didn't happen. I can't recall how we were in the room. He said the movie was the worst movie he has ever seen. It just looked awful and made him angry.  He said he wanted to find some good movie to watch. And he wanted it for the best movie. He didn't realize how terrible the movie really was. He even got angry when he watched it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had this film flopped on the video store in New York in 1981, and it had the worst ratings of all time. I was a student in the high school at the time. It was so bad it was not funny, and I didn't want to watch it. I had just started a series of films and I decided to buy it, and the movie was only rated one and a half out of 10. As if it wasn't bad by the ratings, I think it would be so bad that my parents would take it away from their tape box.  If this movie hadn't been an obvious embarrassment to everyone who watched it, I would think that it was more than just a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "HOLDA ILL BLOOD" is a huge disaster that is completely lacking in both acting and editing. The ending seems to be a piece of twisted nonsense with a few actors who at least do the slightest good work. The main focus of the movie is the acting. But in addition to the acting, it's a complete disaster without a decent plot. The story is pretty poor, the characters' attitude is poor, and they aren't all decent actors.   If you have seen this movie, don't waste time watching it. It will be bad for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie of all time. The only positive review I've read is for the movie, but not the acting. The whole plot is an utter waste of time, and the acting is so bad, that it's better than just an over-the-bored sequel. The plot is so unbelievable, that all the characters are flat, and there is no chance for anyone to survive.  I hope this movie is never remade, because the plot is very predictable, there are no surprises, and it is completely unnecessary to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an embarrassment of a cult, but I thought it was amusing. It made me angry too. I've never laughed with a movie before, and I don't even know how to take it seriously. It is just so bad, and not even funny, and it really should have been given the chance to be funny or at least mildly entertaining. It really isn't funny at all. This is the same kind of rubbish I used to laugh at when the movie "Munchies" was released because it was so grotesque. I just don't understand what the point of this was. The movie contains many of the same "woozer" scenes from other movies, but this one is so bad that it makes one of them look funny.  The movie's plot is pretty poor, but the acting is OK. Even I was surprised that they wouldn't use a special effect for the special effect. The acting is bad, but nothing is more interesting than the special effects in the movie.  I can't see any good point to watching this film. It's just an insult to my sense of dignity. I don''t care what this movie was supposed to be, because I saw it in the first episode I had in the week before it was released. I can see why a cult like this is so popular, but as an idea of "good" horror-movie cults. The people in this cult are willing to go to hell if they need to go there, so why do they have "jokes" for their "caring" and the film is just bad? What is the point? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to see this film and was thrilled with a great opening. I was disappointed that the main characters were so stupid. I would never see a film that didn't have the guts to make me laugh. What were you? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the weakest I have ever seen from the new wave. It's so sad and slow and so predictable. And the acting is bad. I would watch more than 10 minutes if I were bored.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical about this film, as it seemed to be an "anti-film" in some respects, and this is probably still quite evident in some of the film's sub-genre-like depictions of the sex scene. I was also concerned about the lack of a clear narrative explanation of how the story unfolds.   The film is, in essence, an amalgam of different genres. It is a straight up action movie with a very weak plot, but it is also an advertisement for a series of commercials that made more money than a DVD. The plot is extremely bad, and is mostly nonsensical.  There are no real substance to the film; it is almost a "soothing" film. The character actors are generally awful, as if they were all acting for a simple paycheck.  The actors in the film were very bad as well, but I found the characters, even with the characters having such a strong role in the story, were also too weak to stand out as a real person. It doesn't even make sense to have an anti-sex film - I am sure there is room for some kind of scene.  Still, I think the film could be made better, but the story seems to be very weak, and I don't think that a movie can stand on its own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i've seen this film before and, like any of the other movies on the list, it wasn't very interesting. The fact that the first few minutes are of those scenes you are usually like to watch/enjoy. There's no real story here. Just bland, ugly, and pointless. It just seems to be a waste of time. The only point it had was that the whole thing was made for a kid who likes movies. I can say, that the actors and some of the others were actually good, the rest just seemed to be there to take your outstretched time. It really does take a huge chunk of time, but even in the beginning it just seemed that it would be an important film to see. The acting, acting, and overall execution was pretty bad. I have to say that I wasn't particularly happy with the acting, but this kind of movie should have had been made for an adult movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to have been released and released in 2007. It was never released because of a misstep by the producers of the film. I have no idea why. I found out on the Internet that the video that would have been sold would never been made. In a previous review, I said that it should be free from all the violence. The only violence that should have happened in this movie was the killing of several characters. I find that people are always asking "What is that?" when the movie is shown. The video that was released would have allowed for a decent ending, not the complete one that was made. There is no way that it can be shown on YouTube, just as much as any TV show, except for one that has to be free. I think that if the video had been free, the movie would have gone into oblivion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be totally awful. I do not understand why they are trying to make this movie better or better. This is an incredibly dumb movie. It has absolutely no plot and not any real meaning. I can't tell if anything it has to be like. I honestly think there should be no story. The film is so bad that it should never be released. They should have known from the first episode of this movie that this movie is absolutely not good. They wasted money on this movie and it should be put away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even believe this movie was ever written. I mean, it's almost impossible to imagine someone who is obsessed with this movie, even the name John C. He's obsessed with his girlfriend, a former girlfriend, from a childhood friend, who he recently lost in love. It's no wonder why this guy is obsessed, since he's obsessed over all things in his life, and he wants everything, but not the other things in my life, even his wife, who is his first friend, or his daughter, whom he's pregnant with. He has no real skills whatsoever and he has a huge problem with sex, and is very obsessed with what he can do with his friends.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film a few months ago. It was so bad I couldn't even get a decent look at it. I don't know why it was released after a low budget. If you really want to see the film, you should really see it. That's one of the worst films I've seen in awhile. This film is full of awful acting. It's so bad it's hard to find out if the people who are in it are capable of acting. The acting is bad, it's so badly acted. The story is not even strong enough to stick in the middle. It just kind of takes a long time to get a sense of what the characters are about. The plot is awful and pointless. The fact that the characters do not talk with each other, nor are they all really, like a father, is a major disappointment. The characters, especially those from the "Marion family", are very odd. The two parents, who are the best of the characters, and the two older women who are supposed to be close, are the only ones to talk to the other characters. They get together and get drunk over the summer and the one couple are killed in the night and the next morning the kids don't have to worry about the parents. There are a lot of soapy shots in the film and if you just can't see the characters and the story, it will be so bad that it won't even seem like any more than a video game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad. The premise is predictable, the plot is not interesting, and the ending leaves you with a very depressing feeling.  The whole thing is predictable but the ending is too vague, disappointing, and disappointing. I really didn't like the ending.  I also had some problem with the fact that this is a long story, I think it should've been a no story movie.  Overall I'd recommend another version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has one or two excellent story lines (I won't spoil too much) but the main story is utterly muddied. The whole thing is so stupid and confusing that it's almost impossible to figure out what's happening on screen, even if you've seen it a million times before. The entire story is convoluted and convoluted and there are parts that don't make sense and the characters themselves are terrible. I don't recommend it unless you have to watch it. The movie was awful in my opinion. A bad film is one of many crap movies and I've seen several of them. But don't go on to watch one of them and take your life on line. Watch something with a writer who can't make a coherent movie and isn't even good at writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off promisingly with a female protagonist, who is in a car with her boyfriend, in a city that has been left behind by the police. The rest of the movie begins by showing the scene of a young boy, who has fallen into the shadow of some unknown man who is hiding in the darkness behind her front door. After getting into the city and taking a few steps back to see him, the boy's older sister, Nina, decides that she would like to see a movie with him and takes him along with her to watch this movie.  This movie begins with a very stupid line about how women should just not be in the city. After seeing this movie, the woman who made the movie decides to get some clothes to put on so that she can go to school and get her boyfriend back to visit her. This movie continues with a bunch of stupid jokes and a lot of sex jokes.  The next few minutes are quite unnecessary and the next night is a complete disaster, as the young boy is killed while carrying an injured woman to a medical clinic in the town. When they arrive at a hospital, the lady says that the hospital needs to see the old lady.  How could she possibly have been killed by the hospital or the police? The hospital staff is very suspicious of the girl, who appears in a very fake hospital gown, and they suspect her of murdering herself with a knife. This is really a major plot twist. It doesn't even seem to matter what is causing the woman to die.  Another problem with this movie is that it never really takes care of being pretty funny. If you really enjoy a comedy, this is one of the worst comedies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has some great-looking cast, but they don't go anywhere (more like a "Carnet") to make it more funny.  But there's so much to be wasted. The main female character isn't that interesting, the only thing that makes it funny is the guy that talks and the girl that talks.  The only people that are supposed to be funny are the men. They're all acting in a sort of half-ish way, and I don't even think they can breathe.  Other of the actors that are good are the old guy who is in a coma and everyone else is pretty good, but we don't see them anywhere.  I just want to see them get it together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember having seen this movie on my way to see this one. I was already unhappy with it, especially when I saw it in its premiere. There was nothing about this film that was funny, and it's just as bad as many of the other movies it's made since. It is just as disconcerting as the last one. In short, I recommend skipping this film unless you like good acting, but don't go to it if your family is in the habit of taking stupid action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is so bad and the actors are so bad that they need a special performance. I know the story from the beginning of the show but the actors and the characters don't have the same personalities that the actors have. The actors and their characters behave like they're in a soap opera, but the characters aren't even remotely acting in the story. The cast is not even good as the acting characters.  The actors don't act well.  And the show is so badly done and poorly staged. In the end, I felt so sad and embarrassed to go back to this show. But it is still good to have a good movie for those who can see something good in a good film: the plot was good and there were nice moments in the show.  But it wasn't a good show and a bad film in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad I can't believe anyone actually thought they could have come up with the script. Even though I have watched it a couple times, I still wouldn't believe that they would make it in 3/4/5 minutes. This has just about the worst acting I have ever seen, I can laugh at any actor in the world, but if I was watching a movie that had no plot, I couldn't believe it was in the script and the script was bad.   I've also noticed that the acting is so bad that most of the actors don't have their parts properly played and the lines and lines are all completely wrong.  I can feel better at times than watching this movie. If you want to watch something that looks like a horror movie, that's not my fault, but it is certainly not one that will make you want more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film during a very long weekend, and I had to get the feeling that it wasn't entirely fair to the film. In retrospect I think that this is the worst film I have seen since my eighth grade class.  I would like to tell my students the same kind of movie that I used to watch at school. It's boring, a little too long and boring, and pretty dull. The plot seems to follow from the movie: a group of strangers meet a bunch of women that are members of the opposite sex, and the group must decide what to do with each other. The group seems to be made up of a bunch who would like their own to be friends with the other sex. The first guy is an old man, whose wife was murdered and then buried in the desert, and who is also a prostitute. He gets his job as the group's leader of a group known as "Death Dogs". A man is killed in the forest, and he is dead, and a woman is killed when she's sleeping. The story is there, but the rest of the film's really weak.  A lot of the dialogue seems to lose points by the film and the acting, and one of the only interesting parts of the movie is how the men are all so weak. It really doesn't make much sense that the men would be chosen to lead their way through life when they are in the midst of their "death dogs" meeting.  The acting is terrible. I don't know where the director was thinking and how they could have gotten away from making a movie like this. It could have been made like a piece of gum, and it's not funny. The actors don't have any charisma, and even though the actors are good at their job, they do not develop characters who really make us care. Also, the actors and actresses did not really act the way they are supposed to act. One can only assume that the actors involved in the movie were paid off so hard that there was no way they could be willing to work with their project, and that the director decided to just go ahead and make the film a commercial for which they could sell.  It is an even worse version of "Ghost Rider" than "Ghost Squad". I would rate this film a 2/10, and this is one of those films that you won't like to see. I'm going to have some good laughs with it. I hope someone makes some videos about this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people have been fooled by this movie, and I am sure that some of the people who saw it thought that it was a great film, but unfortunately it was nothing. Even the director was very good at times, but in retrospect it was just terrible. There were lots of bad parts, but there was no one good in it. There was no good ending, no good movie in it, no interesting plot. The cinematography was terrible and there were few of the shots that I would have liked to watch.  If you decide to go see it, don't waste your time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is expecting a great movie, but if you're looking for a rip-out film that is only mediocre, then this would be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this movie on its own the first day it was released. I thought it was too bad to be even remotely funny. It just had some awful, un-entertain (and totally unnecessary) jokes. It was so bad that it was actually hard to sit through. It didn't even make me laugh. Even for a kid, and I was a little younger, it wasn't funny. There are worse movies I'd seen in my whole life than this one, which made me sick.  Even if there is a better movie out there, this isn't it.  My opinion is that this is one of the worst movie of all time. It's hard to find the parts of the movie that make it funny.  It's only going to continue making money off of it because it's so horrible. It should never happen again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it when it first aired, so this time I'll give it. And it's not a bad film. However, this film is one of the most stupid things I've seen in years. I mean it's very hard to watch. The acting is bad. The editing is bad, the plot isn't even real. This film has no real plot. Everything seems to be one-dimensional. The people involved don't even get the feeling of being human and not being a loser. This isn't a movie to be taken seriously. The ending is about as cheesy as a movie. The fact that they are having sex isn't enough for me. I understand the point of the movie, but this movie really didn't make any good or interesting viewing.  The end is predictable, but too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of my worst films ever. There were probably three good points, including an ending with a cute (though rather stupid) girl, a cute girl on the bus and a cute little boy (see below). The ending was pretty good, though I didn't know what the boy was in the film. If you're a film fan, it probably won't be anything good. I couldn't understand why he thought he had to act in this movie and I'd really like to see him in a more decent film.  The main problem with the film was that it had a few funny moments, like the guy that could do a little better than a broom washes over the girl. It also had the biggest of problems for a really normal comedy, which is that the plot is just plain horrible.  What is even worse than that is the fact that the movie is basically only a thriller (although not necessarily a very good one) about a sad kid that dies of a disease caused by an evil, non-stop, almost-normal man (see the plot). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's got two stars who have done nothing to make the movie good and the other stars who are in it more than for the acting - the stars have a chance to do something good. The story is absolutely stupid - not to mention the fact that the other movies starring him have better acting. It's a real pity to see him on an almost full-frame. The fact that he's in an movie that has nothing in common with other films, should tell us that his acting is a bad, stupid thing, and his acting doesn't get his point in life. His acting is completely incoherent - most of the dialog in the film is senseless. Some people don't even like him - he's probably the easiest actor in the world to hate him - but the only thing he's ever done to make people like me like him is his acting.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what comes of a film that I would like to see. I'm sorry I didn't like it. I really had to be in to the mood when I watched this. The acting is not good. I've heard lots of people talk about the same problem, about how horrible it is, but I didn 't believe them. I think there should be some kind of idea to salvage the film from the bottom of a pile of crap. Otherwise, my thoughts on this are pretty pointless. There is a decent story and some good dialogue. But there is no real emotion. The main character, the main villain, the second part of the film is just a typical person. I just cannot find out what he wants to do. This is a poorly acted film. I'd rate it at 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was predictable. the movie is just a generic drama with no suspense. It was disappointing to see the fact that we could not even find the name of the hero who saved us.  I would like to see a sequel to this movie and at least have some plot and action. The movie was so bad it must have been good for the first film to make. I can never forgive a film like this. The fact that our hero was dead and his story was over with is just pathetic.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm embarrassed watching this, but it's about time. I would've stayed away from the movie.  I think it was a comedy at first. That's not to say that it wasn't funny. I believe it was pretty bad for me. The film isn't funny, but is it meant to be comedic? Yes and No? No. I'm sure it was totally pointless and insulting to the women in the movie to be a part of it. How could it make you laugh without a laugh? Well, I think that's enough for me to be offended. I won't give it one of a chance to get it any longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the only one who really understood that the "Naked" concept was so stupid as to be funny, but even I thought that the direction would have been sharper if the "naked" part was actually funny. The story line was so bad that I didn't even care what a "nak" movie was; it was too thin. The direction was too boring and the "real" stories were not worth the effort. I had the feeling that it could have been better directed by a competent story writer, but unfortunately it wasn't.  The "joke" part of the film was absolutely pointless and the script was bad. It could have made the movie better. The movie had to have more action than this to make any other movie better than this one. In fact, the entire "Nak" concept is a complete joke. It was supposed to be a "real movie" and was in fact made as such in order to keep its popularity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a rating that was about a 7. It is a really bad movie. I'm surprised that it was released in the US, and I wish it had just been an average horror-film about a bunch of guys and a few firemen who are in a fire-related incident (the characters are stupid and are very stupid). There is nothing in it, the story isn't good, and the plot is stupid, even after the first time. The lead characters are dumb and stupid, and there aren't any characters that could be good, so don't waste your time spending time on it.  There are a few interesting elements, like the way the firemen get involved with the fire, and what the characters are thinking about. The actors aren't bad, and they do try to look a little bit cute at times, but it's mostly a comedy in the end. The overall ratings don't really matter, the film was only slightly better than a 7 and I give it a 1 out of 10.  The movie doesn't look good and is boring. You'd think watching it on the TV would be great, but since there are so many people who seem to hate the movie, and even seem to dislike it, watching it just isn't a fun experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this when I went to one of the first screenings of this film at the Festival of Chicago (the film was never shot). But this was not the worst film I have ever seen. I am of course disappointed. A bad, over-the-top, and stupid film, with terrible acting (even by Mr. Jones), and no plot (well, at least, for it was a story!).  It is also an action film which is not even worth a 3/4 star rating, as it is in the worst sense of all possible film. A lot of actors were not good enough to get a 3 out of 10 out of a 10. The movie itself is not worth a 10, but its ratings don't matter.  And the fact that it is a sequel means the movie is worse than this is made out to be. The film just repeats over and over again of the film which I saw when I was sitting in the hotel with the other actors who had just flown from the airport (the cast were already in Chicago when I saw it). The fact that the plot is not very good means that the movie will be only a few hours longer, but if you enjoy the film as well as this, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Fever" is about as good as an attempt at horror. It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. It should have been an animated cartoon, not a horror film. I'd really like to see the crew doing their job. I want them to make a horror movie, like "The Devil-Man". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about a movie: "Visions", and no one was even mentioned. It was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It had a really awful plot, terrible characters, poor directing, and pretty poor acting. There's just no suspense. There are some interesting ideas in this movie, like the aliens and the movie "Cobra". There are a lot of people who thought that the movie had a plot and it's not like a TV movie: there are a few people who did the most terrible things in the movie, and I just wish that one of the people that did was actually good at acting. I'd probably be a lot more scared than watching the movie because of the movie. But this is just a mediocre film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is weak, and the acting is so bad that it's impossible to watch. The actors are good, but they are in the worst shape and I usually enjoy them. I don't mind, it has its charm to it.  If you want to rent this movie, don't rent it. Don't rent this one. Don rent another one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical B-movie fare from the 1980s - "The House Of Pains" with a weak script and very little special effects.  I'm not sure if this is really a film at all, but there are a few moments that make it look like it really is a movie, with the most glaringly obvious inane acting sequences, and worst acting talent. (And I'm sure that acting will never win any awards.) The only time it felt like it was a genuine film was when it was really funny to me. (I mean, it was funny.) And it wasn't even funny, as this story is really as predictable as it could be.  One in a group of three guys and a girl at a dinner party, with a guy in a taxi driving around and yelling and saying the same thing over and over. There is no indication that there were people in the room with this person, and the guy in the taxi was clearly in the hotel to be a taxi driver.  And the taxi driver keeps yelling and talking about how a car accident is just like a car crash, and then it's over. What a plot! A horror movie about people eating from a gas tank, then being attacked by a firecracker with no real body of fire was obviously a rip-off from a short, low budget horror movie from the 1950s.  The movie itself had an awful, horrible premise, which wasn't really the main point of the movie. The plot is simply a continuation of the film.  But the acting wasn't bad by itself, except for the fact that it lacked substance.  There wasn't much drama in the script. This movie is a very shallow, predictable story with little suspense and suspense. And I'm only, and I think, about 50% of the way in. Some of the humor in the movie comes out of the actors' mouths. The actors' lips were so big that the characters didn't even have a good gag.  It is truly absurd that someone thinks that a film is made of nothing but the characters. There are no characters, and there are just characters. The whole film is a huge waste of money, even though the movie doesn't even come close to the 10 minutes of the first 15 minutes. The acting is terrible, and if it wasn 'just a film' that could at least have some good lines to talk about, I'd still not even get interested. (If it was better
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the first one in a movie shop when I was in the early stage of my career, and I was very disappointed when I actually saw it.  I was especially surprised by how shallow and pretentious the characters were. I had been a critic of Hollywood's treatment of them for a long time and found the film to be extremely offensive and stupid in a way I was surprised that I was even able to watch it. The story itself was stupid, the characters weren't even in the right place, and the script was terrible. I think the writer or the director of the movie was desperate to make something else, and not capable of expressing the characters properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this?  I really want to know what happened when this film was made. I'm a horror fan and a fan of the horror genre and I'm not afraid of the film, it is very unsymbolical and it does not take ANY interest out of me whatsoever, it just seems like an attempt to appeal to younger audiences. However, I do want to think of something that made this film. I don't know the name of the person who made this horrible film nor do I care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had absolutely no plot/plot/plot (for example) and even had some funny scenes. It's absolutely horrible!  If you want to get a laugh out of this, then skip the movie altogether. It would be a good gag to watch in a comedy or something but this movie is completely a parody of many people's ideas. Even if you liked this movie, it would probably be one of the worst comedies of the year.   It's truly stupid, and I wish it would end immediately. There are no good comedy or horror f movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie, I'm a fan of the Twilight Zone, and I was expecting this movie to be a good film. This film was a disappointment. The storyline was boring and there was no story to tell. I was also annoyed by the fact that the lead actress played by a former actor that had an acting history and was in a movie starring the original actress. I think I could have even laughed at the fact she had to wear a makeup kit to make herself look more attractive than in the movies. She is literally a teenager with no makeup or hair to complete a look and I don't know if she's even an actor in this film. The acting is terrible and I think it needs to be taken down. I can't imagine why this movie is a "Shakespeare" film but it just isn't funny. If you find this movie at a library or a video store, you'll find a huge box of the same movie. You'll be laughing and you'll be crying, but you'll also be laughing that you won't see a movie with a great story. Don't waste your time and money on the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was obviously one of a bunch of old films that I'd seen before. This is the weakest of those I've seen. The dialogue is bad and the acting is so bad it's unbelievable, but the scenery is interesting. But the characters aren't even good enough to be believable.  All the main characters are pretty stupid, even the lead girl and the lead guy. That's a plot line! You can't make it any deeper.  I'd give this movie a 1 out of 10 if it was a "horror" movie, but it certainly didn't qualify. It is a complete disaster to anyone who has seen it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something to rent and I didn't find the movie! This is a bad film. There are so many parts which should be included in the movie. I did some research and my husband didn't like it. I couldn't even see the scene where Chris Eames (Rosenby) falls in an elevator and got a lot of money in one of the scenes. How stupid is this movie? What's wrong with this movie is that the only person that can use a jet plane? The people in the film don't use jets? What happens when a jet plume goes on? When Chris Eams falls in a elevator? How long does it take to get into an elevator? The only way I found out about this movie was because I saw it for the first time! I think there is a part about the movie that says it was made by the person in the story, but I don't know who it is. I hope the writer tries to get a positive review about the bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the movie to be the same as the original. I do not understand why it was in the original or not in the sequel. I really do not think it's worth to have all the people involved to try and write about this movie. I'm not sure they know what they are going about. The dialogue is so stupid, even by the likes of the show and the series. I also feel bad for the people that decided to make this movie to begin with a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be very bad. The dialogue is really awful. The characters were pretty good. The story was really, really bad. I am not a major fan of the series or the cast but the actors did a poor job. The only people who I had to dislike were Jack McInspector and Michael Moore. You can't blame them for a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember my first ever movie was about this kid, who apparently thought he would be good. He went on to take over the whole thing and kill everybody.  If you really like a movie, you might like this movie. If you liked this movie, it's not worth buying.  I'd go from all the way to the end and give it to a second rate. It is only one bad movie.  There are few good things about this movie; the first being that I loved the acting. The other being that there were no character development. The third being that it was so bad, I even slept at a couch in the middle of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very stupidly bad, shallow, and confusing film about a group of teenagers who wants to kill off their own bodies.  The film is very odd. It's really not that much better than "The Dead Zone" and the other two movies you might have seen before. The plot starts out alright, but then things go sideways quickly. It doesn't help that the voice actor (Bret Moore) is really stupid and stupid. If you enjoy watching movies, please avoid this one.  This film needs to go straight to a place where movies of these types of teenagers with their own plans can be actually interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can only imagine the director would have done a lot of money on a lot if this had worked.  What makes this a "failure" is the fact that the film is so bad! It's a pity, considering how pretty the cast would have looked if this was made. I know the director tried to come off with a good finish, but the result wasn't good enough to justify the budget. The cast is totally horrible as well, although I'm not sure that there was enough talent to bring in a standout talent.  This movie was definitely bad for all the people involved in making it. They all look like they're on an anti-drug movie. It was an overrated comedy that had me wondering how to finish this movie, which is just not even halfway done. The film is supposed to be about a family, but I couldn't figure out who it was supposed to include.   The movie is supposed as a comedy but it's really an action movie. The action has never really ended up being interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As if the story is bad, the script is pretty lame and feels like it was made to run up to 20 minutes or so.  What a huge waste of time. I think the film was designed to be more suspense, but it is too slow and bland, and fails to develop a sense of plot and tension.  It needs another 10 minutes to have the storyline real. It just isn't like a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. It's not a good movie, it's pretty crappy, and it's a complete waste of time. However, it had a pretty good cast of people and a good director to give you something. It is not a movie, not a comedy, it doesn't even make any sense, and if you want to really enjoy it, you need to rent it in the theatre to take it out as soon as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Movie" is quite a waste of time. I have never seen this movie. The plot is weak, the actors are laughable, and I cannot find the name of the lead actress. I did see the movie at the theaters when it first came out, and it was so bad it left me with so many problems, I wish it could have been better. I also felt like I'd been let into a big mess, and this movie doesn't help to make it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I have been through many of these movies, but this one was especially bad. I was expecting the most brilliant satire on the subject of a movie: perhaps even one of the great films of the year, with all its muddled brilliance, that is full of irony and surreal absurd overkill that is the best horror genre at the end of the decade.  The director (John C. Anderson, the director of "One Hundred Painful Films" on "Magnificent Bastards"), had a very weak, pretentious, over-the-top thriller, that seemed to be all over the roof of a building and, apparently, was all the way to show up to the audience. And his direction was totally awful, as well.  I am not sure if any of his other films were like it, but I don't see any great film in his lifetime that wasn't just as bad as this. The director was a bad actor. He made one funny scene (the dog comes through the door in a dead state). The director should do something better. And there should be a good actor. I hope he does something good in "One Hour" next year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the third time I had seen this film in this year. It was the least enjoyable film I had ever seen in my life. I never expected anything was going to happen. I thought the plot was the most awful, stupid thing I'd ever seen on TV. I think it was an attempt to get the idea of the story behind the film by adding in new characters and plot. The plot was so bad I actually didn't want to see it. The director didn't even know what was going on. The lead actor, Michael Civello, didn't stand alone at all. He just seemed to be in a perpetual state of "not knowing." But all of those are good actors. There was no mention of the fact that it was a remake of the film with Christopher Guest, and I don't think that's true. I just can't believe the guy who directed this film is still working. He seems to be a guy who has forgotten his old school. He didn't like it because he thought he had to make movies like this. But he was never willing to remake this film to make another movie like this one. You'll find yourself going through the plot. It is a movie with a very shallow plot and a very boring ending.  The good part about the movie was that the acting was good. Some of the scenes were well done, but the characters didn't much matter in the overall plot.  A sad ending with an awkward ending? The plot is very slow moving and boring. It has no decent ending. I expected the film to finish its run before the next week, and it wasn't even one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The movie could have been a film that had a decent plot and the characters weren't nearly enough to have any real life life lessons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought there was a good movie. But it was pretty stupid. And I mean, it had the best script. But even the best actor never showed a positive attitude. And this whole movie wasn't that funny. I couldn't tell if the director knew what they were doing was silly and foolish.  A few minor mistakes in this movie really hurt. The only thing it was good for was to have the whole plot. A big, fat, ugly, bald person was about to break his neck in the first scene and all hell was that when he tried. If you can see it, try not watch it. If they're just going to try it. I just can't see it as a funny movie. It's just annoying and annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be an interesting comedy but the acting was so poor that I felt sorry for the director, the acting and the acting. I can't even understand why the movie is so low budget -I mean I bought the movie and the director couldn't even have it taken out to the stage, only to get the DVD instead. I'd really liked some of the performances, but this movie just has so many stupid and bad lines. Even the best of the movie's actors can't stand on the edge of the table for an hour and a half. It's like watching a sitcom where the characters are too stupid to be taken seriously. And the funny lines are always funny to the point of annoyance, but in the end, the actor's seem so stupid.  I was really surprised. There are even more interesting and witty parts in other films. I just watched this movie with a friend who was a very good actor and not at all a bad actor. They seemed to really love each other, although it didn't last long. I think the worst movie was in a romantic comedy. But if you really want a fun movie about a romantic relationship and don't feel like a comedy, then you will definitely hate this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has nothing to recommend but that is not an understatement. Although it is a reasonably well made film, the script is so bad that I really don't care which people I would choose to watch it or to watch if I had the option. Also there are a lot of holes in the story line and the story is so badly staged and the action scenes are so poor they can seem to be entirely nonexistent.  So bad that it has some funny lines that are good. In the end it feels like one of a bad action movie with nothing to say about the story.  It may have good comedy. It has not been good at all. The funny scene at the end when the women's house is taken is worth the ticket price, but it is too long. And it is only for you to see. I would have preferred the movie not to have the ending, the ending would be so funny. I think it's just a very bad movie and I'm afraid of this film being released into video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What do I mean?  I watched one of the first 8 episodes, and I'm sick of these types of movies. These are the only type of movies I can remember seeing. A little girl gives her dad a little toy to show his daughter something they want, and it turns into a zombie of sorts.  The zombie is about as cute as a zombie would be, but it seems to be worse than most of the other "zombie" movies I've seen, which I find so absurd. You've got to think about the characters and the story to figure out how it's supposed to go. I can't figure out what happened, and the movie is full of terrible writing and terrible actors. I don't know what happened to this girl. My guess is that this is not the first "zombies" movie, because it was the only one with a strong story, but that's only the case of the best horror film to have aired on The Cane in the middle of 1983. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie once when my sister and sister were both alive. They are both dead and have a pair of hearts and mouths. There are some interesting lines, but overall it's not funny or funny. And I hope that there will be a positive review about the movie that I didn't already.   So I was hoping to watch it again, but sadly it's the only thing I remember this movie was so bad for me. I couldn't go in to it for the life-saving elements and the special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "FALLWOOD" has some nice moments but the first one just won't deliver. And this is all because this movie has the same basic premise of a plot but somehow it doesn't really matter, because the movie just doesn't give any of the feel to tell you.  Even worse is the acting. It is absolutely disgusting that the people who were responsible for it didn't recognize the talent of the people in the film. I can only assume that these people didn't really want to see this movie. This is no way, that they weren't interested in it, that the movie didn't have a story or that it was just a plot to distract them from a relationship that they couldn't afford. I don't think that if you are into acting, or just love to see movies that are good, or even movies that tell the story and just have a good story, you would want to watch it and have the chance to watch some good movie. The only thing that matters in a film is not the plot, which is pretty important, but that is not what makes movies good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching the first episode of the pilot when i saw the very bad first episode. And then I started watching the series. I thought the first pilot was OK, as it was pretty amusing and funny. I was surprised by the terrible casting choices. Also the series fails the most miserly in this type of television. I found the pilot, even though the pilot was good, too long. But they're OK. But the pilot episodes have been good and I want more. I want a series that has more laughs, and less story.  I want to say this pilot series has a VERY BAD plot. What was the point of this pilot? It would have been hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has a pretty good soundtrack, and a good script, but the script and acting are awful. The plot is so weak that you can't even think of any plot. The acting is pretty good, but that's the very basic thing that makes the whole film so bad. The direction is awful too, and the acting is simply awful, especially when the "chosen" person is just a man with a gun on a plane, and there's nothing to say that he is a pedopho or even have a "father" or something. In fact, the best actors here are the little guys who were killed in a robbery, who are supposed to be good guys, and whose father was supposed to "make a better life".  There's just one thing about this film that keeps me from watching it, and that is the ending. If you want to see "Falsiun", a film with more than one minute of dialogue, watch "My Couscans". If you hate the acting, watch any of "Twins" or "Hells Off" or even "Rock 'n Roll" to see how stupid this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a first time movie fan and this movie sucks the most out of every time I look at it. A few funny things go in here, and the ending was totally bad. I think the writer was an idiot. I'm so disappointed by this movie and I'm upset that it was given the rating of 7/10. You don't need to be a fan of this movie to have any respect. Just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm looking for this film and its sequel, so I was really surprised that it made it onto TV. The fact is that this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen, ever. It's not just bad, it's just bad. But I must say this film is very, very bad.  There's an entire, pointless plot. Not a very good movie, but there is a really bad movie for those who don't need to see any of the main plot in a film:  One character, I believe, plays more of a role than anyone can ever play. The other character is in a coma and the whole movie is not worth it. I wish it could be done in a shorter movie: I think it could give someone a lot of pleasure. I've seen "Boomers of Mars", which is a pretty good movie for a few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are interesting and if you want to see a movie about what it is like to be. They have very weak characters and the director, Gary Judd, has an agenda with a number of plot twists.  The movie starts with two women going through a bad sex situation and then the other women becomes involved in an other bad sex scene. The other bad scene is actually pretty funny and has nothing to do with the plot.  There are no dialogue and none of the characters are portrayed well and the characters do not have any real character. The director of the movie clearly did not care what happened to the women involved and this movie looks to be a complete trash-like film with no real purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie to be quite bad. In the end, the actress, Cindy Michelle Daniels, seemed to have an excuse for the performance. I couldn't even care more than that. There wasn't even a plot.  I was expecting some sort of thriller. What was that?  As soon as I sat through, it wasn't quite what it had been. As soon I had seen the film I decided it had a few too many twists in the plot. If you have the patience to go through this movie, don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i saw this movie after seeing the sequel, and it wasn't quite as bad as the sequel. But that didn't stop me from making this movie. The story is so bad, it just doesn't seem worth to rent, I can't even stand it anymore.  I can guarantee that this movie doesn't have the same quality of the first one, even though it is pretty good for $20. It seems to follow the same basic formula, but it lacks some quality in it's storyline and it's too long to catch up on. And the voice is weak, but not bad, but I don't understand what this movie is about. The whole movie has just got me annoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have to say that there is a small chance that this movie was actually filmed by one person (somehow not one person), and that it would have been made by one talented and talented person. if so then you have to find out how to get that person to do this. If that is your guess, a decent way to get it off is to go to the cinema industry and talk to them. If you do that then you will find out that most of them actually know how to film it. I won't go into the details and give out details about how it was made, but the only thing it ever showed is that the producers of the movie knew how to make it and that they decided it was never to be shown.  I didn't think that they had the skills to film this movie, it was bad off and completely unprofessional. I was very disappointed. The only time that I laughed was the first time the guy came on stage. It was so bad that it was absolutely awful and I only wish my colleagues were that sort of person to film my movie. The worst of it was the ending. The first scene is about when the guy who had been in this movie for years (a man in his fifties, the person in my guess) is interviewed by the journalist (who I suppose was the person who made this movie). He is trying to find a place to go, and he says that the guy will take one of the most beautiful places, and the girl will only agree to go with him. It is after her boyfriend is ready to leave, that he leaves for the woman and is at his home (where they found a big house), where the girl was sleeping on the couch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been on a rollercoaster watching this one on Youtube (along with the other two movies, The House of Pain and The House Of Pain 2), but this one isn't quite as bad as the previous two. The first one was an incredibly bad, but it was followed by two more movies that weren't nearly as bad. The House was bad, on the surface at least, but this film certainly isn't as bad on the screen as the other ones. The sequel, with the same story, doesn't provide much more interesting drama, but neither does the film succeed in creating a bad film. It's obvious that something needs to happen to this one before this movie gets released, but I don't understand why it has to be released before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I have to say that I liked this movie quite well. What I didn't liked was that this movie was so dull, dull and so obviously unbelievable that it could be so funny. And also that there was absolutely no connection between the characters. The main storyline was about a woman who decides that she cannot sleep alone and that she needs to be alone for the next time.  She's in some sort of trance, and as she sleeps, she finds out that she can hear her children who are waiting for her. She sleeps on an alligator board with her children, who go to sleep as her.  And that's where it begins...  Once the alligator starts making out with the kids she starts making love to the little boy.  This is all extremely unbelievable. What if the alligators want to sleep with the guys? What if they want to eat? What would be insane for me to sleep in the bathroom with the boys? How would the guys sleep? How'd those guys get the clothes off?  I'm not sure whether I'm a pedopho or not, but I'm pretty sure.  I just didn't like it for the way it was and its content. The scene of the "fairy" kissing the woman was stupid, and I've noticed since then that the movie isn't really any of a comedy. It was just an absolute bore to watch. I think the writer is trying to turn this into a "comedy" movie, and this is clearly terrible. What a pity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that people who have used the internet to research this movie would have to have been put in the first person. It's not funny enough to be funny. And I've watched this movie for 8 years now and it is full of stupidity. What a waste of time. And the acting is so bad - I couldn't find a single good laugh in it. The main character is so stupid and unrealistic - I found it so funny at one point in the movie, but the character is pretty boring. I am so upset about this movie. It is so slow-moving and boring that even I couldn`t even enjoy it - and it's not even funny. I hope it's a good movie - I've never seen it so much as a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely awful. It's like a bunch of old sex jokes. It starts up with a good acting and the story is good. But then it's a mess with the sex scene. There are too many scenes and it's way too long.  It is still funny in it though the humor is lost.   Also, the ending is extremely bad. It is only OK, if it has a plot and good story and a good story, you will like it.  The fact that the girl has been having sex with the guy has caused me to hate this movie and the fact that it is way too slow and boring is just bad for the movie.  But, if you like to see sex and have fun with it, I would recommend skipping this movie. Otherwise, I recommend avoiding this movie unless you are serious about seeing the sex movie. In a way, this movie is not good. It does a terrible job for being a sex-movie, especially one in a porn setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was unbelievably terrible, and a little later I found out that it was even more horrible than it had been, and worse in the middle. I would like to go into this movie for another bad movie. It wasn't only a bad, it was really a horrid, horrible movie. I won't go into the details, but one or two of them really blew me off.  What they did was absolutely awful, I won, it's not worth getting into another one of these movies.  I gave this movie a zero rating because it wasn't really scary. The only thing I can write about is that the acting is bad. And that they should've cut this film out before the whole film is up. I thought I was just lucky to get out a copy of it. I couldn't stand for the other side of the movie, but I did anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie. I really liked the little girl who came on the phone with an old lady. The girl is a blonde and very sad. Her boyfriend, James, is a tall guy who is a major loser in his own right.  But the girl's story is about James' best girlfriend.  There are only 3 other characters in the whole movie. The only one that could be summed up in a positive manner is the girl who loves James' wife.  The other one is the guy who says he lost his wife in the movie and has never tried to reconcile with her.  My idea was that this movie was way too sad and depressing to be so bad.  It just seemed like a porn flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this case it's a movie not for me - and so the comment section is useless. The "real life" ending is just awful and I thought I was going to like it more than the rest of the cast on the main. The plot was bad - there was absolutely no plot whatsoever - I don't know how to make sense out of this. I don\'t think the characters were acting too well, but just the characters themselves. I have read this book from the start, but I was not interested in seeing it. I cannot even call it a documentary - it was a sort of TV show for teenagers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you do not know what I am saying, this film is NOT about a family, and in fact it is a bunch of teenagers who have not grown up to adulthood. It is about a bunch who has grown up on the mean streets to become teenagers. The plot is terrible and the acting is bad. A simple statement of "family friend" turns into a plot that has nothing to do with anything real about the real life of these teenagers. One minute you will find yourself watching a family member of a bad film with a kid in the background doing something ridiculous.  I will leave you on one thing, the actors in this movie are so poor it is not even funny. I know you can see it but you don't. It will ruin your life.  This is not a film, it is an entertainment, not a work of art. It should be in a video shop for your convenience, and don't buy it. This is no way of a film it is just a means for people to watch and then find their friends and have a few friends of their own to enjoy. It doesn't matter what the message is, it doesn't have anything to do that, but if you do find yourself a good film then I would encourage you to get away from it and spend your time elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My biggest disappointment of the year is that this movie was so bad that I had to watch it twice. I didn't like it for the obvious reasons, and the acting was not good, and it never took me out of the deep and deep emotions I had.  Also, it was absolutely stupid. Even if you were a child, and didn't know anything about this movie, you would have lost your mind. But, if you can watch it without knowing too much, you will lose your mind and only have 1 life to enjoy.  So, I was going to be the "fan" of the movie, but unfortunately, I had already been wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an unbelievable decision for an American film to have a cast this year. It had a lot of soapy acting (the characters were all soapy, not one who could speak like a normal person). We can't even blame the acting on the script.  What was the original idea? No one seemed to care about the storyline or the characters. They just looked like they were in the same room and the actors were in their own little worlds, all with different goals and their own views.  The acting was about the same as the movie in the first two years of the year and it just got worse.   The last one was the first film I had ever seen so far and I've watched it again from one year later. I just couldn't figure out what they did, what their story was or how they decided to make them go. I saw them again in 2010 and they were different again, the script sounded much better, but the acting in this film was just bad, the characters weren't at all interesting and it really had a really bad movie look and feel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of David D. Lawrence and this movie was a complete waste of my life. I had to see this film before I knew what the plot was about this movie. There was nothing about it in the plot, nothing, it's boring and the story was so weak and there was no plot, it never comes alive. I also believe that this movie is simply a copy of the movie in the same vein that Michael Ironside did in his late series of films. What I mean is that the director of this movie forgot the plot and didn't even think about creating a story. The director wanted to erase the memory of the original film because there was nothing in the original story about the characters in this film. The actors, although they are good actors, did not seem to have the ability to develop an original story. And they obviously didn't want to.  I can understand that the person who made this movie would care so much about trying to get a second wind to this movie because it's a huge commercial. It's also one of the worst movies of the entire year, but I can see that his aim was to have something good in this movie so that he could get the 'great' movie of the year. The problem I find is that most of the actors in this awful movie did not develop a story around the characters of this film and made themselves less than adequately capable of being themselves in the movie. They were simply too far away from the characters. There is not much room to develop the characters into the story and the characters weren't good enough for the story.  The one good thing about the movie was the performance of the film, the actors. And I think that this was an attempt to get some interest in the actors who made the film. I mean, they weren't able to get much interest from the actors and the other actors in the film except for the one thing about this very sad story. As for the rest of the cast, the only ones who had much interest in it were Michael Ironk, who was the lead in the role, and the two co-stars, the good part of this series. I'm not sure why they decided to make this movie but they did.  Overall, if you are a fan of a bad film, don't spend too much time seeing this film unless you really enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So the main characters are all teenagers, teenagers who've moved to California to the Midwest to be a "high school football team" and all the teens that've been in their lives, are also teenagers. And so, you would probably have assumed that, "this is what it is all about" and that, when these teens go to California, the movies they go to will never be the same. You would assume that when these girls move to the other school, and the movies would follow, they'd be the "right place to go to for the fun of football". Of course, you'd expect that, since the start of their lives in the other area, they would know a few of the details that would have led to their lives there, like how much they had to work, how much their family lives were structured, etc. But the fact that they don't know about all the important details leads them to not having any idea of what's going on here.  I mean, sure there are football games at the stadium at their school and that makes them a lot of fun (that was good for them, after all), but the fact of the fact there being football games means that there's not a lot more to go through in the football games. Sure, there are some games where some teams are playing and winning games, but these aren't "really big" games and don't "always" seem like big football games, either. But, it's not like the students that are supposed to be in the high school football league that are in these games. These games are about "smaller" or "lightweight" or even "small" games, and those games are not about real football. These are not "big games", but they are about making the students think that these games are for "big football" and therefore are not a big deal. This is the same kind of stuff the "high schools" like the one in the town of East Hills would send their students into with the hopes of having a better chance at graduation. These types of games are actually big and small games where the team doesn't have any players who are in their top five positions. Some students are even allowed to play as small teams.  If I were to try to write out a negative movie review about this film:  I find that "this isn't a comedy", and I just found it, but it was pretty amusing after some parts of it. But there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what to say about this bad movie, I'm guessing it is an effort to capitalize on the name of a good movie: "A Tale of Lice" but I didn't know this at the time. It is certainly bad to say it was an effort, but it has a few interesting elements. The first thing I realized was that I was still watching it on the internet. This is the most awful film of my life. I can't even say that I laughed at the first couple of minutes of it, just because I know how much of it makes me laugh.  This movie is simply bad to watch, but not nearly bad at all, at least for the fact that there are no good ways to escape it. It must be a pretty horrible movie to have to sit in the hall over the TV and watch it again, even though it has some good jokes and a few funny bits. The plot is pretty dull and the ending is about a very boring disappointment. The next day I went back to the movie to see it again. It was almost just as bad as this movie in a bad way. It would have been okay if the characters and the director had not made the same kinds of movies before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really feel sorry for this poor movie. I really liked some of the movie, I thought that the movie was good at some of them. I also thought the music was nice, but this movie is just plain bad. I understand the concept, but it just seems like they're going to run through the movie as long as there's nothing else to do. I want to say that this movie was actually great at first, but by the end I just wish it would die. I have never liked this movie and I think that I may never see this movie again. I am not looking for a movie to be shown on TV and I didn't have to see this one as part of a great film in a movie setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard about the movie so I thought I was watching it.  The story line was about a family trying to find a good movie: the family would like to buy a movie: but they could only buy an existing one. They were very unhappy with the fact that they couldn't find a movie that made them happy. There was no plot and there were no plot twists. What these people were watching was a very unoriginal western film that had no plot. This is the one I can see. They can't take a look at the other side of the wall and see the world around them.  There is no good movie when you can't read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand the sentiment in the beginning. But this movie was a complete failure. If you don't understand the plot, and you just want to be boring, this movie fails in the way that all great comedies are so fun! There is no idea how to finish the movie. There is an hour, that could have been better edited to make a better film! I was just bored to death by this movie!  There was no good reason why you had to sit and watch it. You can find plenty of other movies online, that I can easily recommend more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I'm using this movie as a comment is because it doesn't make sense, and it's not even close to the good old films!  The story itself is not terribly interesting, but it's way too long, and not very believable. A few years after this, I found that the book I read in high school (by the way, I'm a teenager now, not 20), had a story line that was almost as long as this movie. I would have rated it a 5 out of 10, but this movie isn't worth even 1 out of ten. It's really bad and very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script is so bad that it almost ruined me and didn't even seem that funny, and I am very tired. My husband and I both laughed at it. The director couldn't even get a decent shot in the beginning. I would have been interested in seeing a movie that actually had some ideas, but sadly, this one did not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a pretty bad. I laughed so hard at the acting. It's really not a good film. The story could be made worse at all. What was done here was an attempt to depict the story of the life of the young girl that the children saw in their mother's films. It is a complete fabrication of an unreliable story. It was obviously supposed to be a "Bridget" type film, but there wasn't enough room for such a movie. The dialog was stupid, the acting was poor and there weren't enough funny lines. I think that this is not an especially good film, just a comedy of the few things that were done in the movie.  The movie ends with the kids in their lives and going to college, like the teenagers did in the film, and ending with them going into the woods. I don't know why this movie would have been made, since it's not even a documentary, but if this is made to be made, why wouldn't it have been a great film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is very bad and I'm embarrassed to even watch it. It's the least suspense I've ever seen, and the worst feature film I've seen in the past few years. I think that the producers/directors should be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting the movie to be good, but it fails to live up to expectations. There's no story at all, but if you look at the end of the movie, you get the impression that there was a story. I believe that the creators were trying to hide something. I thought that there were two main characters in this movie, the main character was the former cop, the character who has been in this town for years. They made a decision to let him go, but instead, the story is so vague that you can't really understand why he was allowed to leave.  There were several plots involving him leaving, and it looks like the rest of the town was building up from a lot of bad stories about him leaving. It's just too bad. The scenes are poorly scripted, the characters are unrealistic, and there's a lot, almost nothing, to the story.  I wouldn't recommend this bad movie, but I think you have to look for the "real" version of "Ringshot" on Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very terrible film: I just watched it one night and got so mad with it;  I am not sure what it's about but I guess it is a sort of gay porn thing or some sort of other kind of fetishism that I'd like to see. This film made no sense at all and no effort to make it look sexy and interesting was ever produced. This is no longer an enjoyable film than a soap opera with a bad cast. No real effort to create interesting films, really.  I hope some of my friends will watch it and find the full story and don't see this in their homes. It could get worse before the year is through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is so much to blame for this terrible movie: A few of the actors have some decent parts. Some of the characters are funny and the others are so stupid. In the end, the movie is a joke, a bore of nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie back after reading the book it made me laugh! I was very sad and appalled that they tried to put a positive review about this movie, in hopes of bringing the good spirit of the story in to a new movie. The story starts in the mid-2000's, when we were a bit embarrassed by the fact that it was based on a series of cartoon series.   That's where the movie starts, it starts off with a movie plot which seems to have some interesting content, but I was the only one that bothered about it.  The characters are bland and unsyntastic, with no real personalities and no real purpose, it is just plain boring.  There are some interesting locations for the film, which have some nice locations, but the acting is bad. The actors aren't even good for the parts they are supposed to act for. It seems as though they could have done better.  It's no longer a good film, because this is a sequel of the series. That's not how I'm supposed to write off the movie: It was a horrible film that seemed to have been forgotten by everyone who heard about it and even worse when they saw it. This movie has gotten progressively worse since it was first shown in theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a little bit curious, because when I read the review, it stated "this is a film with the greatest potential, but is also a dismal film, with one or two sub-plots that are not convincing. I did not want to see any sub-plot. I don't want to take any part of the action, but it is still a bad film nonetheless. I just want to be honest. I have seen this movie twice, and I think it could have been better. I cannot recall one good movie, but I can only say, in retrospect, that this is a bad, terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would never have ever heard that this movie was supposed to have a cultlike cult. They make it seem like there's a cult cult cult, and all of the people supposedly participating in the cult, from all of you, me and other cult cult members, and it turns out that the members of the cult are all in this movie! What a cult! It's sad when you have to spend time going and getting to the point where you have it in, and then go back again to "watch it" and having that movie fail again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really despise the movie. I hate movies like this and am glad it's so popular in the past few years, but this movie is just that bad. The acting in the first couple of scenes is OK, and there were some funny moments. But for the most part it is just awful, and the worst part of the movie was that there is no ending. This movie is really sad, as well, sad that there are no ending and no ending to the movie that I have seen, ever. I really don't understand why this movie was made, and it is sad to see those acting "producers" try to make "real movies" and not making movies like you would. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie for weeks and it just doesn't make any sense. I understand the premise to have a good storyline and have a story. Unfortunately, there wasn't anything that made the movie good.  The plot is so stupid that it's unbelievable. There are no suspense, the acting is so bad that I just can't believe the actor in the movie is acting properly. I was hoping that it would be better than what I had seen in the original "Rancher Murders". That was always a good movie, but this movie just doesnutomatically breaks my heart. There is so much wasted money here that the amount I would have to spend on to rent it isn't even remotely worth, let alone the money that I have put in on myself to buy it. I would just pay money to watch this movie and I will never watch another bad movie.  There were so many places to see it that I couldn't get through them all. The location was bad, too. The movie is just OK for those who want to be an action film, but not for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought that was an excellent thriller, but this really sucks the suspense out of my brain.  I don't know what happened in the story, the characters are ridiculous, the direction seems off. The way the plot is structured makes it very hard to follow, and the direction isn't coherent to follow. The plot is so weak, it's not even a suspense story, but it's still fun to watch anyway. I guess it's meant to be a horror movie with a twist in the direction to the movie, but that's not what it was supposed to be.  There are two or more of these horror movies in the works. I think it's the worst horror movie I've seen in a while. It just doesn't make a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was terrible, not even close to "Battles, with the old American film." But, it was OK, pretty fun to watch. Unfortunately, it wasn't really funny. It didn't really seem like a parody, but it was pretty silly. I remember this very briefly, but I'm surprised it was ever shown again. I just find it very annoying and it didn't quite last much longer. What is wrong with such a film? It must be very, very cheap! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An attempt at finding a deeper meaning in the movie comes in a stultifyingly incoherent approach, with seemingly-deluded but mysteriously non-direct instructions. It seems that the writers were not familiar with the Bible and they were just making the movie based on the Bible; what a movie really needs is to be a full-blown, but pointless, existential thriller about the meaning of life. (If you can see "Cinderella", you will appreciate how a full of self-satisfment the movie is. And also, please remember to never allow anyone else to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor attempt at a horror movie, this story relies heavily on the very bad acting, blood, and gore. The movie isn't funny, and there are a lot of "strangest" dialogs, and even some of the most disturbing images to go with the movie's execution. There's also an awful ending. If you enjoy a horror flick, I would recommend not see this movie. It's just sad, sad, and sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the most disappointing film of the whole year. This was a piece of crap, and I thought I might have forgotten anything. The only good part of this film was the end. I just wanted to see this guy again. Unfortunately, it didn't matter. I didn't expect the film to be good, but I didn your gut a lot of money watching it. I was the worst movie of the year. The reason I laughed at the end was that I had come to really enjoy this film so much, it was really good and had some funny parts that I found amusing. The movie had an interesting premise that was only mildly funny. The story is bad, though, and it is sad that we got to see a man trying to save a woman's life. The plot was really predictable, and the acting didn't do anything good. The acting was bad, too, and there were some good moments. I wouldn't have a big laugh, however, if I saw a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some fun watching this movie as it began. I didn't see it last week so I was afraid I'd miss it when I picked it up. When I get through it I am very disinterested. As one who loves a movie about an old movie whose plot was actually interesting (this one, for example), I can appreciate some of its appeal, but this movie isn't one of them. I've watched it about four times so far and now I think it's time for a remake. What a lot of money, why I waste it! I'm not sure if this movie has any potential to make money, because I really don't think the actors here are good actors, but they were pretty much good at the time I first watched it. I don't know why I would have to waste my time here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with the story being clear. Then, it goes and fades, leaving the viewer to guess what is happening, and we wonder why it is being told. Why do the actors not know? How can this film be rated a 10? Why is this movie so boring? This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why was it released? I don't know how the heck it ended. I've seen a lot of bad movies, but I'm not a big one either. I'm a bit disappointed in this movie because I really liked its predecessor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was shocked at the decision. They were wrong to say that "The World's Greatest Adventure" is actually the greatest adventure ever. And I couldn't even hear the name of the original title on the movie. What happened to be with this movie? There's a lot of false stories about the story. But I have seen plenty of interviews from other sources (that the first one I read was not one of them). What you see in this film is completely lacking what you expected from a "Dixie Mae" movie. I'm a huge fan of the show and I actually liked it but I didn't expect that they would take the path of the story in order to "protect" the story from getting out of their hands. This is one of those films that can be easily categorized as a "B-movie" from the start, not even as one of their main storylines. But it is hard to watch to understand, because it has more plot, characters, and "comboilers", than the previous ones. In other words, it's not even a movie: it's a movie for a lot to be a movie and the end is very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's got to be the least funny movie of this year.  The premise seems reasonable.  But it's not funny. It's just bad. I would never watch this movie unless I was to be so bored. I thought the director had done a decent job. He's probably the worst director he has ever produced, and he's obviously never a good actor. I give this movie a 2 out of 10 or less because it's an awful, bad, and bad movie. There is no plot, no real character, no believable setting, no good direction, no interesting characters, no funny stories, no dramatic scenes, no suspense, no excitement, no humor, no decent directing, no action, no acting, no entertainment, no respect, no credibility.  This movie is very hard to watch. The actors don't seem to know what they're talking about. Some of the characters are good. But not for long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A series of a lot of garbage, which you would expect when you get to the second page of the book and then begin a second movie. This is also a bit disappointing because this is a pretty funny movie. I was a member of this film's planning meeting, which was one of four of a bunch of rubbish films. I don't understand why they chose to make a sequel for this, the film is so boring and I think that they were hoping to make their own sequel and to start making this one again. I think they were also hoping to start a new sequel, and I believe that this film has just the same bad film as the first film. I understand the people who made the first movie. The director of the film also seemed to be the one who made it. And I know why the person who made this film did so, the people in the film made it, too. I feel like the director wanted to make something else because of a really good story, but that is not his goal. I guess the director thinks that the story is about a couple who goes on an ill-fated expedition. I hope there is an idea of a sequel, though I don\'t know.  The film itself has a lot in common with the rest of this series of crap, but it is a complete waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't quite as bad as a sequel to "Happiness" - with a pretty decent plot and some pretty good animation - but, it fails to deliver the magic that it once was so famous for. The plot is pretty predictable and stupid, the camera is bad, and the camera direction is pretty dull. This film has a weak ending and isn't really funny enough to make anyone enjoy it - or even make you cry. The film is full of bad lines and awful acting - although you can forgive all of the bad lines, the acting is good. And the acting itself is okay, but not good enough to justify the low rating.  This movie is so bad that if I had the space to kill my brother in front of my parents, I would use it as a reference to cry about my brother's horrible behavior. And this is a pretty dumb movie. It's not even funny. This movie will make you want to cry for your parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as an insult to the many fans of "Shenzenmi", which it is - if a movie is a slap in the face, then it is. And, if it is a joke, then you should be embarrassed for saying this in a movie, even in front of a judge. It is a sad thing that a director makes this awful excuse for a movie: it is an insult of all the fans of the original movie. It should have been used in a comedy like "Walking Tree" or something like "Hooey" that does not have a sense of irony, which it clearly does.  I found it very bad, and the acting was poor. The plot is bad and I didn't know what the ending was. It seemed to have gone so far out that the movie had so much energy that it had gotten so lost that it made me completely tired, and there are no witty moments. It just seemed like a desperate excuse for an un-made movie, and I don't care about the fact that it is such a dasteless, poor movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although the good guys do some nice things here - the most bizarre of them is a scene in a movie about a group of women and men (that would be the least likely for any movie to be this hilarious). The other good guy is a young person (although I guess that could be the same for her).  Also, the acting is terrible, at least for the majority of the cast.  The movie is about a typical 'b-movie' film - the main character is a typical idiot, but with the acting, the dialogs, and the plot, it's boring, disappointing, and even unbelievable.  I guess I'm the only one that actually likes it to have seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story begins with a plot which seems to have little to do with the actual plot. The movie begins with the main characters running around and they have some sort of a "friendship" arrangement.  Then the movie starts and everyone is left in a room with all of the main actors. By the end of the movie, everyone is dead, although I really liked them when they were alive. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to get out of there soon. The story is so bad that it really took away from me. I mean it's pretty good. But when it comes to the climax I really lost interest. I don't even care that these guys were really good. They were just there to make sure that nobody got hurt. And I wanted to see more of the story, so I gave up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i'm only 15 years old and this movie is making the internet go crazy. I've only seen a few of these films in my lifetime and they all have some sort of problem. It's all about "faking it" when it comes to a car (and this is a movie about a car), when it's not about a movie being made. The movies are bad. The actors are stupid. The acting is not good, the editing is not nice and the story is not interesting.  i can only recommend this to people who like making a movie for their own self. But if you want a car for yourself, a gas pump, a remote control for a TV show and an alarm system, then this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd never even thought that this would happen. It is just so bad. It was so bad that the "Biblical" version of the story was so amusing. There are the same actors as in "the "Baker's" version. This movie didn't even really benefit from the fact that it was filmed.  They're just acting with a bunch of terrible actors and the characters are so shallow that they get the job done on the job. The dialog is bad and the acting is so poor that it makes me think that the characters should be put together, preferably in a movie like "Dumbo". I would never really get the movie out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing I see in this movie is that there are no other girls, no female characters, no real characters, not even a few female characters. There is no character that you could expect to enjoy this movie. Also, I was very surprised that there was no one who was attractive or attractive. If you don't like horror, and have a sense of self-worth, then watch this bad movie. I just couldn't find this movie anywhere else. But, if you like horror and horror, go see this movie, because you won't find any girls that are attractive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad sequel of a bad sci-fi film! I'm glad that I watched this movie because I liked it so much. It is pretty slow and disappointing to go into a movie which has a pretty poor plot and a pretty low acting job for the actors. The film is about two guys who come from the city of Detroit to an unspecified country to find a new country to be a "civilization" country, the way they chose to make it a civilization and make themselves immortal. The story is about the "civilizations" of mankind and how all the other races of mankind are trying to change the world of the world (for the sake of being a "warrior"). If they want to become a full-fledged civilization of mankind, what are they gonna do? It is really sad to think about them because the idea of a civilization as a "cult" is such a bad concept. I don't think that it is a movie that should be a comedy, but it is an embarrassingly bad sequel to a crappy sci-horror film. Also, the fact that it has a bunch of bad, pointless dialogs means that it falls flat out of being interesting, not really a comedy!   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was based on the original, which was an absurd fantasy. I'm not a fan of any of the films in the series, but the "Death World" is even worse. I guess it was an interesting way to compare the two versions. I saw a few episodes and they were interesting, but it was sad when they both ended.  The plot was so lame that it actually surprised me at the end, and I had to assume the movie would eventually follow a normal storyline. But it's a little too long for something that doesn't really involve death. It's too long, and so the movie isn't quite a death-themed movie. I didn't notice much about the fact that this was a sequel to the original. But you just have to watch it, in order to avoid the fact you're missing a story line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film. Even worse than the "The Matrix"! It is an insult to me! I believe this is what is truly happening in this world. The entire process from hell to heaven is pointless! I am so tired after watching this crap and I don't know if this movie is truly a threat to the entire world. This is an ugly, awful, ugly thing that deserves nothing but a slow, low review. Please, please, please. The only thing it could get done with is that one man, the first guy in this film, has so much of the power! It has to be stopped. If this film were good, I would stop watching it. The best way I could ever say that this movie was made by some guy who got a good movie, even if they were the one's who was in the game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like these people because they are good. I think they are the best people ever for the poor of this world. But not a very good film for this person. I mean it is terrible. It is a piece of terrible writing and the actors are all bad, and the acting is very bad. They really need to be a movie writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, it's not a good movie, and second, it plays off that it's "The Worst Of Hollywood" but I'm sure that is all the truth, and that's where this film starts. The cast is okay, but the directing is just awful, it all seems to be an unfinished movie. The story was kinda good, but it's pretty sad to see people falling for this movie.  I think the film just shows how a lot of people just want to be left alone and run the movie, they aren't bothered and they get bored and have no reason to go on with this movie, I don't blame them because I don\'t give them credit for the movie. If you don't think, I would recommend the movie: 1) Watch it because it's funny, but don't like it, 2) Watch the movie but don\'ts the whole thing, and 3) Watch a different movie: I found it funny, and don't want to read it, and 2.) Watch it and give yourself a good time, but do not expect yourself to enjoy it, 3.) Watch the other movie: It's very interesting, and I have a feeling that this movie could be a very good movie: there are plenty of funny moments, but this movie is not as good as it used to be, but there are also a few moments where it really lost the magic of the film. I think that it could also be a movie where you could enjoy it while watching it. I don´t think that's fair for such a movie. 2) Avoid this movie if you have time and money, and you should probably avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a bad film with an even worse script. This film sucked me in, it sucked me out. I did not like the story line and it wasn't funny for that. I didn't like the idea of "feral" creatures, because it had a lot of wrong jokes. And the acting was not funny for it to go in and out. The writing was bad, the dialog was bad and the jokes were bad.  I was hoping to see this film again, but it got ruined so bad I didn 'for sure' that I had to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really a pretty bad movie. The whole plot is terrible and the plot makes no sense. I think it's the worst movie i've seen in the past 10 years. A movie in which the characters are completely screwed up, and the storyline doesn't make sense and it's not clear if it's happening or not.  It was nice to see the characters in a normal movie and they were well done, but there is just too many pointless characters. In other films, you have to see characters in their own character, with good actors, a good story, a decent story and good direction, and everything works.  In this movie, the characters were completely screwed on the plot, and they didn't even move their bodies when they were running. It was so bad and it made me angry that I was angry at the way they were moving.  There was really no plot. I guess it's all about the main character. The main character was the bad guy. The ending is so unbelievable that I didn't believe the characters really were trying to kill each other. I found the ending absurdly unbelievable. There should be some scenes where they are in an area that has been destroyed, and there should be a scene where the characters get in a car and are driving over some parts of the city they're on.  What's worse, the main lead character is very unstable and is clearly acting in a bad way, and he's acting in an effort to "fix" his own problems.   The fact that this movie is bad is that it does not really have a plot, but it gives you nothing in the first 60 seconds of the movie. When you think about the ending, it's like watching a soap opera.  The acting is also bad. The acting really gets this movie off its toes. The characters are annoying in their performance, and this is about as bad as the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not one of my favourites. I find it extremely stupid. But I don't recommend this movie, even if you get a lot of money or have a big heart. It's one of the worst films I've seen. It is painfully self-centered and there are no character development. No characters come to life, no story is told, no action sequences, no cinematography. Basically, it's not like any other films. And the plot is terrible as usual. The only good part of the movie is that it comes out with some good-looking music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the worst version of the classic series. It's hard to believe that this isn't a spoof of the original series.  I've never heard of it before. This is probably the worst of the series since the series began. I'm not going to recommend this movie to anyone, even as a joke. I would recommend watching another cartoon, like The Looney Tale or Peanuts World, because it's a great, well-crafted show. And you could learn something from it.  But, this movie is simply awful. I hope that somebody takes the time to review it. I don't know if they're going to make it the worst movie ever made, but I can't imagine that this would have been as bad as The Peanuts Movie. The Peanut Movie is a good show about a dysfunctional group of kids who want to kill their parents, but their leader is a pig. There is also a plot about the kids getting killed by the pig, but that's okay because they actually like the pigs. I think the problem is that the characters are too stupid to follow the plots. A lot of the scenes are bad, too. There's no idea that the children in the story don't like the characters.  This is a really bad movie, for me. I really liked the Peanuts cartoon, and I love Peanuts, but they didn't do the right thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very boring and extremely shallow film: the story line is interesting but the direction is so bad it's just a bad piece of work! This is the same way that movies like "Twadina" go to be great when they're well written, but this movie isn't much better. It's like one of those movies about a girl who gets caught in a car accident by a drunk driver. A drunk who drove drunk drove the car and then the kid was sent to the police station.  But the movie is just a big waste of time, not a film with a decent story. A few times, the story got interesting when the film would get into some kind of action. Then there was an interesting scene where a girl was talking about the situation that happened, and the girl told the story to everyone, but the story wasn't much about it.  I can't say more than I can about the movie, because it's too late to say anything about it: the only thing the film has done well was to make it look good, which isn't enough to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to have one of my friends come over to see my brother, and I thought this film was really stupid. In my friend's opinion, it was a complete disaster. The acting was awful and the script was bad. There were no real people to relate to the film and the people on the screen looked totally stupid, as if it was just a film about a man and his friends. The music, also, was awful - if you listen to it it, you just look bored. The story was bad, too - the characters were just annoying and the way they were acting had no real depth.  The film was even worse than my brother's friend thought it was. I don't know why, but I think the producers just don't have much talent. It could have been a satire about the US or about the American lifestyle, but it had been so bad - there was nothing funny about it at all. It just seemed pointless.  I mean, I wasn't even looking for a good film to watch. I know it was pretty funny to watch, but for those who really care about watching a film, you really should watch the ones with some interesting plots and characters, like "The Last Picture Show" or "The Darkest Hour", which is just a horror film with a pretty good cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Frosty" is a complete waste of time, a patheticly ludicrous piece of film. Not only does the story lack a lot of elements, and there is not much to the film in the beginning that can be considered a story. The plot is unbelievable and utterly unbelievable. The story is weak, the acting is poor and the direction is poor. There is no real story, no real dialogue, no really meaningful dialog. The character is absolutely laughable and there's no direction. There's absolutely no plot twist and nothing special. But if you decide to watch this movie for the sole purpose of keeping your jaw, your eyes will hurt. I don't recommend this movie to anybody. I wouldn't recommend it as a complete crap movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story begins with two teenagers fighting over a man in the park. One of them, a teenage girl with "big breasts" is stabbed by the other guy, leaving her with two holes in her head. He is bleeding, but she is not dead, and we're at some point. After a bit, there's more blood, and at some points, the girl is naked from the waist down. The boy is not a very intelligent person, and he acts as if he's not even scared of anyone. In addition, he keeps his eyes on the woman who was stabbed, and uses an excuse to be able to scare his sister to make her scared away. She runs to the door of the park and is chased around. We follow the story of the two women and the chase goes on until we're in the pool playing together.   There is no attempt to make this movie funny, and it's hard to believe this was a documentary. The actors are a bit bland and unsympathetic, and even the girl has a lot of sex, and no chemistry at all, but that is alright. I found it hard to watch, but watching it didn't necessarily make it less interesting to me. The acting is pretty awful, and I could only laugh at the scenes in the scenes of the chase as I sat in the back of the pool. I think the camera is not really well done. The editing also does a lot to keep the film from being funny.  There were many moments of tension, like when the girl's friend comes in and tries to get the girl to go home, or even just at the moment the girl tries to go to see her friend, just to see if she'll be able. The woman keeps trying to distract him from getting her, but it never happens, and that's not a good way to make a movie interesting.  Overall, I wasn't impressed by the acting at all. There are a few moments that could have been funny, but most of it is just filler scenes, rather than a genuine drama. This could have simply been better directed, and some of the shots were cute, but the ending is so bad it is hard to imagine it. The characters themselves don't understand each other, and there are no real emotional tension, which I found infuriating. The ending is completely pointless and unsatisfying. There were some parts that were funny, which are easily done by the director of the documentary, and although
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You need to know something about this movie that it is supposed to be a horror film, but it is just another zombie film.  It is not a horror movie, but more like a horror parody of a horror-comedy movie. I mean when the film is not scary or scary, you know it's just another joke, but when it's scary, it becomes creepy and horrifying. And it's not scary if it is not creepy.  The whole thing with the zombies running around is a joke. The zombie was never supposed to scare anyone. It was only a joke between the people who saw it. The zombies in this movie looked stupid, and were not scary at all. In case of the other zombies, it is absolutely ridiculous, and even more so when it is "the people who are running around". You don't need to buy the zombie's car, but you should at least buy the motorcycle helmet.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie on the video store once in my life, and it never makes me laugh. This movie is the worst trash movie I've ever seen. It doesn't make me laugh, and I'm an older man, and there are times I didn't feel like laughing. The acting is bad. I don't think the actors are good, nor did the writer make a good effort. This film is a big fat loser. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be an incredibly stupid film. I thought it would be good in the 1990s but it wasn't. I think there was a good reason to watch it. There wasn't one good scene in it. The acting was so bad that it was a bad comedy, and I was very unhappy with the ending. I would rather see this movie if it were in the 1930s or the 1930. Unfortunately, it wasn´s like a movie about a soap opera. It is the same type of a soap operatic television show, just with more characters involved. I didn´t really care for the ending of this movie. I was really hoping it would have more life in it, but it just wasn´t. I don´t care about the acting and I don't care about anything. I really think it was in the best possible film in the world. I give this movie a zero rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film on my television in a recent weekend when it came on Showtime. My family and I watched it. I am a little nervous. I thought it was a bad film.  I gave it two stars and a 1, 2. It was so bad that my girlfriend and I wanted to finish it so that it could finish the evening. My sister has seen all the film, so she is not familiar with the movie and she couldn't understand what I had seen. That's not a good film. It would be a good one if it was an entertaining one. It isn't. It's an embarrassing film that only shows the most shallow and low-grade film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was so bad that I thought the writers couldn't write a good scene. Some very stupid and cruel scenes, but overall there was nothing to enjoy. If you enjoyed "The Matrix" movies and you have to watch this one, please don't waste your time or even bother. Even if it is just one scene, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself in this movie, and, at least I was expecting to find it. There were many things that were wrong, but what was wrong with it? It was just really awful to see it. If I hadn't seen it, I'd have laughed. I couldn't even watch it on my TV. And then there were some very interesting moments.  But then I realized. It was a bad film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible, and the cast is bad, and so is the acting, it doesn't really even make sense to me. This movie is so bad, that it is the worst movie I've seen, and I'm sorry about that. I really don't care what the cast of this movie are saying, this is a film that is no longer than 10 minutes, so I don't have to waste any time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the movie as part of a package from a Canadian movie studio. The script was not so bad, there were some good lines and the story sounded good. The ending was very badly scripted and the whole story sounded very bad. I was hoping for a good movie with a decent director but it got the opposite results. The best I had seen from that movie was the short "Honey With A Smile". It was OK to have that movie because it was funny and funny, it had a few funny jokes, but it wasn't funny. I didn't even care about this movie because I wanted to see the movie, it wasn that movie has its own flaws. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd have to recommend, as it was in the earlier review, to just skip the movie and move on. A poor movie with no plot and a terribly stupid cast, this is the movie equivalent to a bad sex movie. However, this movie is so incredibly stupid it also makes me want to sleep.  This movie is way too long, it has a bad ending and it is also pretty bad on sex. Don't waste your time here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dancing With The Bride" is one of the worst movies ever made. It has just about as many bad acting/direct-directed movies as you can possibly have. This is just a bad film. It was poorly scripted, acted badly, and finally, some of the gags were funny.  I give this movie 10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems that this movie was planned to be quite good, but due to poor budget, it's pretty bad. There are many things that were supposed to happen in the movie, such as the fact that the main character, a black man, is a racist, etc. But this movie is so bad that it doesn't even have the feel of being a comedy, it feels so sad! It is only redeeming in the idea that it's a comedy. I have to tell people that this is an incredibly crappy movie. It's not funny. There is a pretty long time between one of these parts, but it's not very good. This movie is just plain awful. I'm still looking at my copy of it, because my copy is way too large, and so I want to find out what's in it. But I think there are some parts that make it somewhat tolerable, such being the characters. They all really are just caricatures of stereotypes, and not actually people. That's not a good movie. I recommend the movie for those who just want to see a very bad movie. If you're looking for a good film, go for some of the "Hoo Show" series, but most of them are a bit over-the-and-the idea of a comedy/drama show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just watched this terrible movie. The acting is horrible, and the characters are stupid. If I ever liked it I would have a great movie to burn. I was bored to death.  I was also sad that I wasted $7 on it. I'm a huge fan of some of the films. But this movie fails on its own, which is why it is so hard to find in the comments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it while on vacation, and my first response was "I can't believe this movie was made", but more that I had the opportunity to rent it I found the movie to be downright bad, the dialogs were bad and the dialog was so bad I was sick with horror at the thought of it. The acting was not bad, really the acting was decent, just a little bad when we could actually get all the characters into character, but the scenes were so bad that they hurt to see. There was nothing special. No story whatsoever, nothing good. My husband's wife and daughter both gave me the movie, and although they could be seen in a movie, the film does not do anything for them. The film is not a horror film, but rather a comedy/adventure film. I recommend that you avoid it, or at least rent it instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had an absolute enjoyment with this film, as I have seen this film on some of the other forums. But I'm still having problems. The main reason I was enjoying the movie is because I saw that it wasn't a terrible movie because it didn't lose me. I'm not a fan of either of the movies. This film is just plain bad, and there is not a true, genuine story behind the film. If you're curious about this film and decide to see it, you won't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really dumb, it really does not even start out with a premise. There are enough questions to ask about in the film that I found difficult to comprehend and I can't even figure out how much it is. I didn't know when I saw this movie before it was released and it sucked me out one minute after I saw it. I had to keep my eye on the screen for the next 2 minutes or so so so I didnít mind, because I was afraid of the ending.  The plot is so bad that it doesnít make any sense. I really wish this movie was made by someone that made the first 10 movies. I was so disappointed that I only learned about this movie because my parents told me it was so bad. But if you watch it for just 4 minutes, you are going to feel frustrated. I don't know how my parents feel about this movies but I do think they're really fans of this movie.  They could do better. I'm not sure if they ever make this movie again, but I'm sure they will. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a little boy who dies a car accident with a pair of dumb tools. He is an odd kid who seems to have fallen in an accident. And there are, obviously, two dumb tools, because nothing else would be expected. The plot revolves around the kid who is on a sleepover with his mother, who has to deal with the dumb guys who are sleeping around to make their sleep. The dialogue is stupid and the acting is stupid too.  The whole thing should be an extended sequel to another horror film from the director who is obviously trying to go with the genre. This has to be a sequel to a horror film, the story is not that scary. I don't mind that it is a remake of this film, which is the best way to lose your sanity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it had the ability to make it have life worth living. The dialog is weak and the acting is bad. The acting is poor and the story is bad and not very interesting. The plot is the worst part of the movie and I was so bored when I watched it that I almost liked it to death. I'm still watching it as it's getting to age. The only good thing about this movie is that it has a cute girl who is funny and good for little kids and if you want a little girl that you can actually make, watch this movie. If you like a cute chick that has lots of money, watch the little house, the girls like toys or other things. The fact that this movie does not really belong to any genre of movies is ridiculous. There are no scenes of the "wamp" girls. It looks like something someone made out for children, not a real TV show. The girls have not aged well at all. Even a middle-school girl who has some experience with acting might really enjoy this movie, but for a teenager it doesn't take much away from her ability. Also, the whole movie does the same thing every time it happens. The kids are not cute, they are just "like" girls that have gotten a lot of money. They just look stupid, as usual. It's really just bad and this movie doesn't give any real emotion. I hope the writer and actors will have to get some talent before they are put in a film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do not know why anyone here believes this film is any good. The movie was about being a little hero, the funny ending and the special ending, the plot was bad and the script was weak. The rest of the film looked interesting, but I don't know who I would get to watch it and think about it. I was surprised that it is not a bad film, but to me it just isn't funny. I know I get to laugh at it but I really don't like it. But I guess I like it for some reason. I would rate it 8/10 if I thought it were a funny film, and I would watch it again as a DVD.  If you are interested in watching a film, then skip this and just watch the first one of the DVD. Also, please don't watch this in the US unless you do it with the intention of seeing the film in the state of Texas. I think it would be just as bad if the people there actually want to see it because there is no plot. I mean it's too late to get to see this film as a film now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think there are two major problems about this movie. First of all, this movie was only 2.5% funny. Secondly, it seemed to be trying too hard to get this movie off. It's very frustrating and I didn't like the idea of the whole 'characters' theme. They didn't get the joke when I saw the character who played that character. The movie is just so poorly structured and there is no one funny scene or funny movie (1 out of 10) in the whole movie. The storyline is also quite stupid and the movie is a complete waste of a lot of time. It seems to be lacking a sense of humor and actually it seemed like a really terrible film. I also think that the writer isn't using the same style to make it funny. It just seems as if there was nothing funny about it. In the end, I give this movie 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is about the "Shrimp" that was supposed to make a comeback after a previous movie.  But when they get back to the real world, they find out about the movie in another city where it is still illegal to make movies about shark stories.  The movie starts off by showing a fish and shark on the other side of a beach; both of these fish are swimming in the sand with sharks.  "Shark" is in fact the only one shark that looks a lot like a real shark. When they get into the ocean, they start swimming in their respective areas, and they fight the shark with another shark that has two hands.  That is the end of the film; all this is just a plot twist, and nothing to be found out about it. This movie is probably the most boring, boring thing I've ever seen. Even worse than some bad shark movie made a big comeback in the 60's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's wrong with this? That this was one of the worst movies I've seen this year. What's the point of watching it? I mean it could be good at times but it's just terrible. What is it with this movie? Don't ask me. This is a bad and weak comedy that has no good plot, no good laughs, no decent actors, no interesting story, no direction, no special effects, no effects. I can't even get the ending. A really bad movie is one that is so bad that I cannot stand by any means. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad, mediocre, and stupid film. In a nutshell, it's a cross between a bad (The Matrix) and a very bad (Dead Or Alive). That's what the film is. It's just that bad, and it was fun to watch. There wasn't even a real story to this film, which is disappointing considering how interesting it was. I had a great time watching it, but I didn't really like it. This is why the world has become boring! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What do you do when you see that one terrible remake?  What's more fun than one bad remake? One bad remake is no more than a half-year of pointless television content that is only mildly entertaining.  The story is nothing but bad as well. What's good? A lot.  There are even worse. You'd think a good movie is a movie that has something interesting and cool. There are no jokes, but there are plenty of them. But you don't need it, really.  This is no funny. A bad movie is not worth for what it has to be.  How much is it good? No, not one.   The direction is terrible. Just terrible. The cinematography is bad, but not funny.  Why don't they fix this film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd understand the appeal of this film, but I don't understand why people would watch it, especially when it wasn't about something entirely, such as the portrayal of John Corbett.  The movie seems to be lacking in content, in any way, and I wouldn't say this movie isn't entertaining, as I think it might be. But it's not really entertaining. I would expect a movie that had a good storyline, and maybe there would have been a decent script to come in.  There are some scenes that were interesting, though the dialog were very thin, and the direction of the story was very poor. The movie has a few of the worst scenes you'll find on the site.  But to think that this movie has any merit beyond making money. Just don't see it if you're desperate for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a mixture of "Bath House" and "The Last Family," with no character development or plot development to justify this film. As I'm sure other viewers pointed out, the premise, setting and story are all wrong. While the acting in the movie is fine, the movie has a very poor story line, especially the part in the restaurant with a prostitute who is getting her salary, and the guy's drug dealer girlfriend and the waitress who is a prostitute's "family." I found this movie to be just a bad film, and I didn't find any comedy in it. I cannot recommend this movie due to the fact that it was a waste of money and time to waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry for those who don't even get this movie. It's just so predictable. And I don't want to admit it, but the whole thing is so predictable that it's hard to believe that the director had the vision to make this movie, since they didn't really know who they were. They just decided to make a sequel, and the sequel was so predictable, that I wasn't even surprised. It got a little better by the end. But, sadly, it got worse.  It starts off good enough, then just about halfway of the way through the movie goes so slow that it starts making fun of the show's style and sound. It also takes away a couple of the best scenes of the film, and at a certain point it just becomes a complete bore.  I also don't know why they are doing this movie to appeal to people who didn't like the original series of the 'Dreaderess', since this is obviously an adaptation of the original but it is just a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend and I are obsessed with this movie! We like it because it is a classic Disney movie from the 90's. This movie is terrible and it should be canceled. I don't like the other characters in the movie, but they have more than one scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie after seeing it on the website, and I was very unhappy with the way it worked. It was terrible, and the plot wasn't believable. It wasn't even possible to understand what they were saying. I was so bored and disappointed that I didn't like it.  I didn´t mind getting in the middle of this whole mess, but I don´t have time to take it seriously. I´m not going to give this any rating, because I think this is just an excuse to have a movie made, but there´s no rating at this point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems that this movie was an excuse for a little kid's acting. However, there is a reason for this movie, the acting is very poor and there are a lot of bad things in the movie that don't matter. For example, there were some bits that could have used some clever and good moments from the actors. The problem was, there wasn't much to the film. The main question I had in the end was if they had any idea of how to really make a movie: a story, a plot, a premise, a theme, an ending... and not really. The movie is boring. I cannot even use the "fun" word for it, which is why they made it in the beginning. The plot is not interesting and the acting can be really bad, especially for the female actors.  The worst movie of my life. I could not stop watching it, but I cannot complain about how poor it was. I think the producers were just wanting to make it go fast to make a quick profit. I guess it wasn't good for me to start off, as a fan of a good movie, and I didn't have anything else. But this wasn't really a good film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. It made me want to see it again. I'm a big fan of all the 'wastier' movies and these movies that are based on real life events.  But in this movie is another story about a poor kid who is so desperate to get money. He has an overpriced movie prop for a house of apartments. You'd think that would be the perfect way to break a poor guy. But even after you see this movie, you wonder how they could even think this was a film. How many money films make a man feel like this? It didn't make much sense. It's just like saying, "Yeah, that guy looks really good" like a lot of movies.  The movie seems to focus on the very small scenes that are all in the middle of nowhere. That's really the worst scene of the movie. And the film is a complete waste of money. And as far as I know, all of the other movies in the movie are far superior.  I also think the movie would be better if there were real money that could be sold for a low price. But I don't think you can convince yourself that a kid like this is going to be sold. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife was upset about this movie, she was not pleased that this film was so bad! and even if she was pleased with this film it would not have been worth the $6.99. The film is just a poor copy of a bad film. I understand the problem with the actors, the storyline and the script are OK, but the film really needs to be more than a piece of junk. I have a feeling that this was just a piece that has a bad taste, but for a film like this to be considered a piece! It just must be avoided, if at all possible. If you have seen it and wish to see this film, I warn you that it is NOT worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Return of Darkness" is an overly dramatic and rather incoherent film. This is the worst of all the "Campo" films. It takes place on the set of the old "Campy" movie studio. The plot seems to be the first line of the plot. There is little substance to the film, except a bit of "wandering" plot.   The acting is also bad. All the other actors, particularly the main characters, seem to want to do the same old way, and the dialog, acting, and acting are bad.  I cannot understand why this film was made as a series. This film is so bad, there is absolutely no joy, and you want to see the same, boring, boring stuff every time you see. The script, acting and directing should have been made to be much better.  But don't miss the two parts of the camp. Those are two of the best things you will see, and most of them are not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of time. It doesn't make up to the movie and it's not entertaining. It's just not funny. I thought it was funny when the movie aired but it was so bad it didn't even make it into the film. This movie should be released. It needs to be a show to a bunch of bored people who want to see something stupid. It wasn't very funny at all. This is a horrible remake of the 1990's film 'The Unborn Killer'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie ever! I have seen many of its films. Some of them are good. Some are horrible. Some movies like this are completely disgusting and disgusting, but they do show some pretty good horror movies. Other movies, like this one, are totally terrible.  This movie is so bad that it is not worth buying and watching it. It starts out like a piece of trash, and then grows so terrible that it's just sadistic. I really feel that I should never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the story is very thin and there are no plot twists or a plot twist.  The cast is also mediocre but at least there is some interesting dialogs and there is something to say about the character's life, character interactions and relationships. But what is most annoying is the storyline and how you get a totally predictable ending.  I have to give it a 3 out 10 and there's a lot more that can be expected from this film.  But that's only for me to say because I've read many times it was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, the acting is bad, and the acting was weak. When this movie was filmed, the actors were good, but the ending had nothing to do with the story, which had nothing, except that the director wanted to "make some money". The ending is very, if you can follow my words, which are not entirely accurate, since I'm one of the people who actually made it. The ending wasn't all there, since there was nothing to make up, it was all there for money. The movie was not funny at all. The acting was so bad that it was impossible to stomach, it could not stand to be in any movie, and it was so stupid that it made the viewer lose interest and want to sleep. What a shame! I don't know if it was the director's fault, but, if it is, it should be on him or the director. The funny thing was that the movie was so funny, it actually had a sense of humor that would've made the movie funnier. If you really want to watch this movie, I strongly recommend not getting this movie and watching it again, instead of the very low-quality version, which I got in DVD form. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping it would get some reviews in the press and on television. Alas, it does not. As the other reviewer pointed out, this movie is not worth watching. The plot is extremely stupid, the plot is unbelievable and the acting is bad. You don't feel a positive connection between the actors in the film. I would be upset if they were a few feet higher than average, although at the end of the film, the acting and acting are decent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this was the worst I had seen for many years. I'm sorry to have to report such a bad remake of a cult classic that is apparently meant to be a sequel of the original!  it starts off as a simple horror film, but really becomes something else. There is no story, and it is impossible to tell who the main villain is in the film, and the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I found it amusing to see how the two actors play these characters who can't act. I think they have just read the script and didn't understand how the story plays out, and I don't think I can believe this movie could be made. The whole thing feels like a joke. It wasn't even funny and I never liked this movie as it was. I gave it one out of 10/10, and was not amused by this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing about this movie was that it was a cross over from "Murders of Gotham" which is a movie that tries to make "Avengers" look a little bit more than it was supposed to be. However, I don't think this movie is that bad. It has some moments where it's difficult to understand who the characters are, and the plot is mostly incoherent and weak. I think this film could've made a really good movie for a young kid. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if it was better, but not really a good movie, especially if it's a family film. It should not be rated as a comedy/scary movie, and even worse if it is a kid's first movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't any great, but at the very least, it's worth taking one of your hours out for. There are some pretty terrible scenes, and if you're looking for an action film with a lot of gunplay and carnage, you might like the plot. I did, but I found the movie to be just plain bad, with a very low-grade cast. Even the characters were pretty good, with the exception of the female lead. What is the point? It's just a little too long to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's probably a bunch of movies being produced that are really bad, and this one was perhaps the worst. And I mean really bad. But what really kills me is that these actors are not really people. They act as themselves, and I have to believe that their acting is just as fake as they are acting. The acting is nothing but cheap and crude, and they just don't act all the time. Some of them are funny, but this movie really is just awful. I know they're acting like this, but to me it's just not funny. I can't understand why they would act like this.  There are many other reasons why this movie isn't really a bad film, but all of them can be explained easily. The director didn't think through the making of the film as he made it. This movie was just a straight-up horror flick, but that's not the only thing it is really a horror film, and it's not even a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was poor, the acting was poor but not bad.  It was sad to see a movie that had not been able to make it out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sitting on a commercial for the next hour and have only one more minute movie to watch. I'm still with it but the ending is so bad and there's no real suspense, which I understand why these people would have liked it.  I understand the premise of the film is fun, but I'm not sure that it's the best way to spend time doing something. In any case this movie isn't worth watching. I just wanted to get the one more chance to watch it. I have seen it so many times, it should be so bad. There's a lot of other stuff in the movie though. I would have to find out what it was about. I did not see the final version, because it was too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was interesting for a few moments, but I think it would have been better to watch that one in the beginning. The storyline was predictable and the acting was flat, so I really enjoyed the last 10 minutes of the film, but the rest of it is terrible. If you are looking for an idea to have an idea about why the movie is so bad, you can see the full review of the movie. It was pretty obvious how badly it was written, how shallow the characters were, how poor the acting, and how badly they were written, but what really sucked. The characters were very predictable and were pretty predictable, but at the end of the story it all fell apart. What can be said is that it is just as bad as it was in the previous version. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the movie doesn't really have any lasting effects, and it is actually hard to take away from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never really liked this movie; it was just awful. I guess it just lacked one thing, and that was that bad. There wasn't even a plot. The fact that it had to be shot on celluloid was absolutely awful, and there was no mention of how it was supposed to be a film. And it was in the beginning of the time, like it was when I read it for my college class. It didn't even make it through the filming time, so it wasn't really a film to me, although it was still enjoyable to watch. I would have been happier if I had just seen the beginning. The acting was bad, the directing was bad and the cinematography was awful. The actors weren't doing enough to fill you in and the music was bad. But I was hoping to see a film that had more decent scenes and that I could watch and enjoy. There really should have been a sequel to this movie, one that would be actually good. But as I was looking for another film, I didn't want to watch it and I stopped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie I ever watched and had never been happier with it was this one. It had about 15 minutes of what I liked when watching it. The next movie I watched was also very bad. I saw it and it wasn't the same as the first one. The main reason I liked this one was because of a good actor (Basset Boisar is great) and a good soundtrack. The story and characters were also awful. There were no story and there wasn't even a story. There are no characters that you can relate to. There is no funny dialog. What a pity. I know some people like this movie, but it is really not a good movie.  I did go to watch this movie because I saw this one, but even that was bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film isn't funny at all; it seems to be made for a children's movie. And this movie is so bad, that it almost never gets laughs.  It contains nothing funny and at least a few times, it's sad to see the story being acted out by a puppet. Also the movie is not very good at acting either. One of the jokes in the movie seems to go on for about 15 minutes.   I hope the makers of this movie are still watching it because if they don't I don't think it will work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read a review about this movie. Its really bad. The movie has a lot of the same stuff in the other shows. The plot is weak, the acting is not good, and there is no good storyline. My expectations were the same. I just cannot believe the producers even care about the movie, because the people in the world are telling me the opposite of my expectations. Its bad to the world. I was expecting a good movie about a good drama, not a movie about crappy drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, i find myself a positive review of the film. As usual it's "The Dark Ages" and it is very good for the most of the time. But the story has just got nothing. I can understand that this movie is a sequel to "The Last of the Dark Ages", but I think that "The Black Stone" is simply not a sequel and it's not an interesting one to start your movie off. It doesn't make sense to me that a sequel is expected to happen and this movie could have been filmed much better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give the film a rating: 1/2. The film was obviously rushed, but the film does have some decent moments. But after about an hour of it, it becomes hard to watch, and the story doesn't take itself seriously. I can't even find the beginning of the story.  So, I was hoping to go in and sit down for another few hours, but I didn't see anything after watching the film.  I'm glad I never got to see the film, but unfortunately it's just bad for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this movie in New York, New York - this movie is not even a film. It is like a piece of video footage and a guy goes in a car to be the first director. What did I do? I had to get in there before it was released.  The movie was pretty stupid and I was really annoyed. I was annoyed by this movie because I was so annoyed with the movie, I felt it would have some impact. The plot is basically a bunch of old, recycled scenes from some movie they made, that have been reworked again in a couple of years. The worst part is when he gets on a bus with a bunch to go to Chicago, and then he goes to a nightclub to meet another woman (The girl in this movie was about 17).  The girl, when she sees that guy, goes, "Wait a long way, I want to see a movie that's really funny!", he says, "Yes, but it's in a different movie", and she goes, and she leaves the movie.  When she's gone, he starts doing a lot of things that are not very funny. It was like an episode of a soap opera. I didn't even know what happened to the girl because it happened while I was driving to work, and I didn not really care. I thought it was just a big pile of crazy ideas that he had in his head.   He had no good acting in his voice actor. I saw a couple times that he was good, I just thought he could act better. But the other times I thought he wasn't good and it bothered me, it seemed like he had a big ego, which was really annoying.  What was the point of this movie? The only thing I could find out in the whole thing was the "Nomite," it was only 1 centimeter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've watched in quite a while, and I really hope I'm not one to comment on it. It's just really disappointing. As I said, it is really hard to watch. You can't really feel like a movie anymore, the acting is really bad and there is no clue of whether the people that have been watching this film have been acting or are actually acting. The whole film seemed to be entirely devoid of all purpose or meaning. What was really frustrating about this movie was that, despite all the bad acting I had, the whole film felt really pointless. I really had just given it to the people in the house. I don't know how they found out how this movie went and what its next direction is. It has to be the person in the kitchen who has been acting for so long, or the person who is in the movie. You will regret yourself if you watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the movie on a few weeks ago. But it's not worth watching. I'm going to try to find the movie and rent it because I have seen it so many times, but i don't think I'll get to see it. So don't see it if you have the money. It's an extremely bad movie. The actors who are good actors are always in the movies, but the way the story is presented is just a joke. I don't know why the writers write the movie, but I do think that they should be embarrassed and ashamed to say, "I'm tired of watching this movie." But it is just pathetic.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the film because it was in fact an excellent film. But after seeing the plot, I realized there was nothing to save this abjectly inept film. A few plot lines were mildly interesting, although the acting was so badly done that it wasn't that funny. I'm sorry for anyone who liked this film. I didn't buy it for the $8.99, but I saw it for $3.99 and that was about a good value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a good movie: it has a couple of funny moments but the rest is just an attempt to make something that is more than a comedy. The acting of the whole cast is terrible (though not very funny) and the direction is completely awful, even for the actors themselves.  The main reason for this movie is because it tries to make you believe a bunch of people are good, and that's all that matters. That's it, or there is no other way.   It's basically about a gang of gang of criminals, but the gang has two distinct personalities, and we never learn what they are or don't. Some guys are the worst, but they are the coolest. You don't really have to learn anything about these guys and try to avoid their gangster behaviour, but instead we are just put into the film, and if we are willing to put ourselves into their lives, then we might get a little better.  But you'll also get bored with these guys. It's just about a slap in the face. It needs to get rid of these guys before you get bored, but you don't get bored until you have a better idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a very young child in a troubled family (and the girl is about eight!) who's father is murdered by a serial killer. That is what it is, but it really is very boring. There is little plot and very little character development. It's supposed to be funny, but in this story the viewer expects the audience to be too cool to be sad.  The acting in this movie is horrible, the characters are stupid and the viewer is bored. The only highlight for the movie is the beautiful girl that is dead from a heartless, but the sad part about the dead father is very annoying.  I found it all much worse than a bad remake of the popular film "Tear Crazy." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been a very serious fan of the movies (I can say this with a positive review), but this one is a complete disaster. In the end I wish my life wasn't on the line. I have never been able to appreciate a movie or movie. If you have anything to watch, it will not be worth the money. But even the first one is not worth the time. If anything is worth watching, it should never have been so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I heard of this film is from some of the reviews I read on the Internet. It was bad. This is the bad movie that everyone had been hoping would be, and they just wanted it to be. There were only one or two actors that stood out. The only one that stood and had any real ability to act was James Van Damme. But this film had nothing else except an actor who could act.  I think I have to agree with the critics of this movie. It's just as bad as the first one was, but I'm not sure what a person might need to be doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the previous good review, I'm surprised that I've already given the film a 7.  I'm still a fan of the late, great Stephen Stephen Kaufman's work. I can't find one good movie that's more bad than this one. The movie has a plot that's not entirely original and the characters are mostly stupid. The actors and the dialogue are stupid as well. I'm also unhappy that this movie is so bad. If you're a horror fanatic, maybe see this movie and laugh. However, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. This movie isn't worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of the Twilight Zone and like some of the "real world" films from the same time period (yes that was my first time). In this movie, I found myself wishing that the same thing was used in some of our current films. I didn't expect such an expensive movie. I think that if anyone who is not sure about the nature of the future of the world or their ability to handle themselves with non-fiction. This movie fails because it's a major plot device in a film, it's based on a concept (a social theory) and it fails because the writer uses too many words that don't fit the plot to the point of being an interactive film. I know how to write a movie that doesn't seem to have a clear and consistent end. That's not a problem if it is just a very simple story, but if it were a really complex drama film it would be boring to listen to, and if it was a movie, it would get out of its way. The only thing that makes it seem interesting is how the characters react to the fact that the government is trying to take over the world with them. It's a very vague and not-so-important plot that doesnno matter whether you decide about the plot and the details. I'm hoping this will not only be annoying but, with a good plot, it could be enjoyable as a few hours of a horror movie. The plot was a pretty short one, so I think it could have been a good film at least for one more than one or two minutes and I could see another version of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think this movie was a bit overdone it in a really bad way, and the characters are bad. I know it is because of the acting, but it really is just a bad, sad affair. In general, it wasn't quite convincing and didn't capture any emotion, even the last minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely terrible. I have never seen such a bad one, but this movie was worse than most of the others that I've seen. This movie wasn't even funny enough to be funny, and I find that most of my favorite movies ever are laughless. This also sucked a lot of money and had a few funny moments. The plot was very contrived and didn't allow me to understand the whole thing. I also didn't care about a sequel because I didn't see the sequel coming out. It seemed to drag out an hour before I finally felt it had a chance to improve. And the ending just seemed pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete disaster. The most notable mistake is the premise. The whole premise is that the whole world is broken, only a few of the major families are still alive. This premise makes for a very shallow story line, with no real purpose, and no real emotional conflict. If you just look at it, you'll feel like you've just wasted time. Don't buy it if you can find a good one, even if it's a crappy video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this film for a few things. But it was very disappointing. I'm sure the only reason it was this bad was that it was so incredibly stupid. It had several lines and it was just so bad. I think the producers should get some credit for being a comedy in the first few episodes. But even though this has the ability to make you laugh, it's just as bad as the movie. It was a complete disaster. I would never rent it again and I didn't really look for a good movie. I just wish it was a short movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this book. I couldn not believe anyone ever bought it.  I could not believe this movie to be about a love relationship between two black men in San Francisco. It just doesn't work. The other part of the book, "The American Dream" is a love song and it is about a racist community that would prefer to enslave black people, and their children. There was no mention of the black man who was the first to marry, or the other black man in San Jose who is engaged to a white woman.  There was also nothing in this movie that was about a black man having his family treated poorly. That's all in the book.  The film was the most disappointing of the trilogy. It seems like he had not read the book before the movie was made and he would only be able to tell the story after. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had more than its fair share of fun when it was first released, but when it went out into theatres in 1999 it was less amusing. The acting is pretty weak and the story is just OK to have a little action. The ending is not too great and the movie ends when it's supposed to be over. I usually like to finish movies quickly. But this movie just keeps on going and just keeps going from one thing after another. The director is a bad actor, the female lead is OK but the script is bad.  I usually recommend this movie: 2/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I've seen this film on tape and I've never watched it again, I'm guessing that it's been replayed at least 100 times. I have personally only watched 3/4 of this film and only a handful of other times.  I'm a bit upset about this. It's just one of many horrible things that I've been told, but I am still going. What this film is about is that it is an unapologetic piece of film writing and it's just plain bad. It also isn't a good movie. I've even seen some of the films of Richard Wagner's films, so I guess it's about the same thing as those. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed when I found out about this movie. I was hoping it would be more funny but unfortunately it is boring, the acting is too stupid and the movie has too much gore and blood. In my opinion the film has a lot of bad acting and is over-sentimental at times and it really limits the humor.  I really liked the first couple of episodes of the show and it has some good jokes. The movie is not funny.  The show has no real plot or suspense. I just wish the show had more humor, and that would have brought something good to the show.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the same garbage movie ever made, with the same story from the other movies. The plot seems to have been inspired by a "House of Cards" movie and it starts out looking a little too predictable.  The plot is very predictable, with some twists.  Then you have to pay attention to the acting. The acting is not good, and the characters are stupid.  I'm not sure what the producers are going to do. This movie looks awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why the title of this movie is 'A Man Called Yesterday'. It seems like the writers and producers have an idea that this is about the history of the Native Americans and their treatment in the 1930s. This is so far from the truth, I've listened to some music artists and thought it sounded quite uninteresting, but then I discovered that the title is actually 'Rampin' - an acronym for 'Rambi.' I guess it was a deliberate attempt at humor and to show that this movie was a complete joke of the American Indians and their suffering for a lack of respect for Native Americans. As is, this is a completely pointless piece of work. The filmmakers and actors make it look like a real piece of history - the movie is so completely pointless, and so lacking in all other aspects of history, that I can't believe it was intended to be an anti-racist movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the least funny thing I've seen since "The Last Man" (the only film that I didn't get on, actually) ever made.  I guess I'm not alone with this review, but I don't know the name of the film, so I donned to ask if the makers knew.  My guess would be that they thought people would want to see it for the sake of comedy.  The plot isn't that bad, and the acting doesn't all be bad, but it's just the worst of all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What you say:  "The Legend of Mr. Caine" is a cheesy excuse for a sequel with a few minor deviations.  In fact it's even worse than this. It's so bad, that even I thought it would be a film, but I thought "The King of Chicago" is much better. If you get bored and try this film you will be sorry.  It is the best you can expect out of a Hollywood flick about a movie that is this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first of the few movies I can remember to have a bad opening. I'm not sure if it was an effect of my memory or a desire for a bad comedy - I can't tell. I watched this movie in a hotel in Bangkok. I was sitting on the balcony, and I couldn't hear any of the jokes. It just seemed like a bad, poorly planned movie.  It was too long, and the comedy in the ending was bad enough. There were very few jokes, and none in the film itself. If you want to see some kind of gag comedy, then this is a bad choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to stay out of this movie for many reasons, but sadly, it's not even a movie! It's basically a horror/drama/sketch of "The Bride of Nellis" where none of the actors or actresses in the film have anything to say. And that's just one of the problems. The rest of the plot is horrible and there are no funny lines, the characters are stupid, the camera is bad, etc. There's not any "Citizen's rights", and the plot isn't even interesting. The soundtrack is terrible, especially the old songs are still sung. I couldn't even hear the song that I heard on the soundtrack of "Carmine".  There's no suspense whatsoever, but there is so much to get in, that it's hard to believe it will come out even as soon as this movie finally hits DVD. It's also pretty slow and the camera-movement and the dialog is just very poor!  In a nutshell, I think it would be a very bad movie, but if I get the DVD, I'd probably see it again. There are some good reasons to stay away from this movie. I don't have any advice on why I have never been able to watch this movie, because I like movies that make you laugh. The director and screenwriter obviously don't get the audiences excited, and the cinematography of this is just terrible. That's the best way to describe this movie: "Nellis Returns to Nell's Wedding". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film ever I have ever seen, I have been watching many horror and horror flicks on other sites and this one was very bad. In fact I think it is the only one that was so bad. I can't say that I'm shocked by the awful film because I thought there were probably some fans who liked it, as the plot was good, but that just made me the only person I knew who liked the bad sequel. In other words, I can tell that I thought this movie was stupid and that it sucked off much of its audience. I wish they would just make it in one movie, preferably a low budget one like The Ring Of The Rings.  I was in tears for the whole ride, as a fellow fan who loves this film and even wanted to see a sequel. It's the worst horror film ever and I would never recommend this film to anyone. I will never watch it again, and only recommend it for people who like a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this movie, I decided that it was really bad. The characters were the same, the characters were funny, and it could have been better. But what a few reviewers didn't mention is that the director didn't direct the script well. The camera were terrible. The story is even worse.  I'm not saying that I was a negative one person who didn't like it, but it wasn't funny, it was bad, and there are some parts that were ridiculous.   My review isn't an accurate review because I don't know what happened or what is to come. But I felt that I'd have to comment in more detail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sure everyone knows what movie this is. The characters, the script, and the whole look and feel seem to be completely mismatched. I did not understand why I had to watch this movie. It was just the one that seemed to make me sit up and stare at my computer, because it wasn't so scary and disturbing. The only thing I can say is that the cast is interesting, though not all of them are good actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have so much fun to watch this terrible, depressing, and awful film. It just doesn't work and has a pretty awful soundtrack. A big, glaring question in this review is whether the director has any ideas and he doesn't take himself out of the script. You know what the movie is about. It's also about people in the film who seem to think a movie is good. How many people have seen this in their lives? Well, I guess it's about 500. I don't know what it was about the people in this film but I imagine they think movies are good and there are a few other people who think movies should have a good movie, just like the ones you saw in "Citizen Rock" and "The Fugitive".  This film has nothing left to it except a very bad story and a awful ending that is simply unbelievable. It was so bad, I was almost embarrassed for my daughter and her parents. This film must be on some kind of computer somewhere to rent for it because it has just the worst, most pathetic, acting in the entire movie.  The actors were OK and I liked the actors. I'm sure they got the money because it is about the only way this movie is presented. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really hope the writers and producers responsible for this piece of work will have the courage to try and write some decent stories, or at least make the film worthy of the title "The Worst Movie Ever" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of John Miller's films, but this one is bad. The whole movie is basically an amalgam of "Jack the Rump" and "Tailbone" combined.  There were no scenes set in the real world to follow. If you watch it you might find yourself wondering how "Jack" was able to get that thing to work. If it's meant to be a comedy movie then I think the whole thing is about that, but that's too bad to be true.  It wasn't supposed to be funny. It's not supposed to have anything to do with the real life world. That's also why it's so bad. People like the Jack Hammer and Jack Rump have never done anything to try and become a real hero. I had just never seen it when I saw it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure you can guess what happened to me. I found the movie while reading through the book. I didn't like it at the time and then watched it again. I do find it very stupid. The movie begins with the women at a cocktail party. It wasn't funny at all, it was really just the movie just to have a bunch of girls looking at it. In the last 10 minutes, the girl from the party comes back to the bar and talks with the woman that just left the bar. They decide on who to go in the movie with.  It is obviously a fake movie and I'm very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a terrible movie that was far from being even the worst of its predecessors. It was not a good film, but the characters were really stupid and the acting was very bad. The fact that the main characters all looked like they were in a movie was kinda funny.  The movie did have some good bits. I'm not sure about the acting. I've seen many other movies before and never really understood what they were. But it's not a bad film, you have to understand that the way it is supposed to be portrayed can make it funny. You just have to have a mental countenance and stop laughing and be scared. I didn't understand the meaning of the movie and I just laughed. It really made me uncomfortable to watch. It's not like "Watched" but it was an awful sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has many of the worst movies. It is extremely hard to watch and feels like a cheap soap opera with no suspense and no real plot, even though it has some good acting. The ending is weak and the ending is never really suspenseful. I don't even feel like watching the final few minutes of this movie, even with the fact that this is actually quite funny. I also don't understand how it could possibly have been an actual accident that got the actor, Jim Carigan, killed, even if he's not the true victim. It would have been interesting to see if he was going to get killed by some type of missile or something like that. It could have been like a real plane crash, for example.   The most annoying part of this film is the ending. Carigan's character was dead, but you can't really blame the producers for that. The plot is so bad it could have just gotten worse. You would have had to watch the film, even knowing that the actor was dead and the movie ended so fast. It was supposed to end in the exact manner the movie ends, but that ending has no way to match what happened to Carigan in the film. There's only one redeeming moment in the movie: when Carigan and the actor get on the phone with the coroner to talk to the police about their friend's autopsy. It's really unbelievable that this could have happened. It actually ended with Carigan dying, so it's unlikely that he'd have died that way. But the coroner didn't even have the same phone with which he was using to call Carigan to the cops.  This is a very short film, probably a good documentary movie to teach us nothing about the art and history of the occult, but it should not be shown to a classroom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst remake of a horror movie I've ever seen, a horror film that simply gives the viewer nothing to believe, but it could have been better than one from The Dark Eye, which was a fun watch but not even worth a half of the film.  I can never believe in a horror remake ever again and I'm so tired of it and so frustrated that I never see any of the original films. I can only hope that the original directors of the show will finally make the film and will finish this movie with all its flaws in order to make the concept and concept, even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never even get to the end of the movie. It's so bad, that you will want to hang on it for days to see more of it. I was hoping that this was a good movie. I thought that it was really funny. I didn't even care for the story of this movie.  It's a poor film, and I don't even know where the director is, but I'm not surprised that this one is being advertised. I'm really sad. I really should have given the director credit for the film, instead of wasting your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised when I discovered this movie, and now I'm wondering why I thought it was OK.  It starts with a lot of nonsense, and then follows the most unbelievable plot line of the year, and even the ending is totally absurd. The whole movie is completely unbalanced and fails to make sense. In the end, the movie's message is only a half-hearted attempt to give the viewer a sense of how cruel the world is without any real substance.  The film also failed to capture the feeling of innocence and self-discovery that is the best feeling in all movies; and that was an incredibly un-realistic film. The way the story is structured is so absurd that it would just seem like a joke.   The entire project seems to be a joke about how many people in the world have difficulty with this type of behavior.  This is a pity-to-the-death film for all people who feel their emotions and suffering to some extent or, at least, the way the film is structured makes it appear almost unbelievable. It's hard to believe that even though these people were only slightly depressed, they did not really have a positive outlook on life and life, and what they did is perfectly conveyed in a way that really shows no substance. The movie really needs to be turned off of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You would think the movie was a bit funny, but it isn't. We get a very brief flashback that is supposed to be a story of the past. Then we get a totally unrelated, totally pointless, pointless, meaningless plot about a man who has three siblings and who has a bad sense of right and wrong. If you're a fan of the original Star Wars, I would recommend skipping this one. I mean it's just boring. I'd rather watch the two films that are much better than this one-- like Star Trek, the very funny and excellent series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has got me totally confused, I believe! This has become a little bit boring at times. The first hour I was in an interesting place and was able to follow a lot of interesting dialog. Then I got to another time and was confused when I decided to wait. There is not enough to go back to the plot. Then it is half done by an over enthusiastic director and half did not. Then finally, I found out that there was a second story in the movie that involved the character of the person who runs the hotel. After that, I decided that this movie was really an awful joke. I don't mean that you are sad, just because it is just so bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to believe that the filmmakers thought that one of their best-ever films ever made was the first 'The Unborn The Legend'. This film is also an example of a very bad movie-making process. This was pretty much a perfect example of'movies' being 'poor'. This was also the same film to which Tarantino was also involved, although we saw that the film was not to be completely un-filmable and it did not necessarily have to be a terrible film. But it is still a shame to see so bad a film at the very same time when you are still enjoying it so much. I was really disappointed when I discovered the plot. I really wanted to see another one of these types of films because of their ridiculous plot. And I didn't know what other movies had such plot.  I just saw the first episode of 'Vampires' (1995), and it was really an odd film. I think the filmmakers really had no idea how to film the episode, and they obviously didn't like them. They wanted to keep this thing alive, so they made it up as a way to distract the viewer from what it is supposed to be doing. And as I said, the film had good stories and were also funny, but I have a hard time believing this film did have an intelligent plot and did it with good story-story. I just wanted to feel like the story of the movie. But that doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few funny bits of the movie, but if you want to see a story with all the violence then I recommend not watching it. There were some parts that got away from me and were interesting, but the rest of it is a total waste of money. They just reenacted the old story of Koyuki. Some of the acting was good, but for the most part, it just got bored. I'd have to see my wife watch it once, and see what happens when she's home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really not sure about all this. I have to say this movie is a total crap in the world. I think it is the worst thing ever made in this world! If you are a fan of the Lord of the Vibes or a crazy rock or something, I would tell you to avoid seeing this movie! The whole concept of the movie is wrong. If you have nothing else in life, this movie isn't worth a try for money. I would definitely say watch it again, but at the least I didn't have anything to give for it. I've seen this movie countless times, but it never gets old. This movie is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm really hoping that the director and producer are in some kind of mental prison or something. If this is in fact a movie in any shape or form, then you should see a mental facility. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to see this one in early 2010. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It is absolutely awful. It's basically a plot to bad. My favorite line is "I'm gonna get a job where my boss wants me to do, and I gotta give it to him." It has two parts where a character dies, and another where a narrator (who is very annoying) says a line about a character, and that person dies. In one of the scenes, the narrator talks about how she's gonna get this job, and then a bad ending is a sentence that repeats the line by the narrator. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Living Room" is the movie that got my blood boiling. This is the "Bridget Brown Christmas special" movie. A bunch of characters, a few minor characters, and a plot that isn't a plot but a bunch of rubbish. The story is an over the-sentence plot that never makes sense or a sense. The acting is very weak and the dialog is awful. The cinematography is very bad, but there are a few people that stand out and give the film some charm. The end is very boring and there aren't any real characters. But that's fine for a few minutes. I would rate this movie as a low film, but I can see a better version out of my head.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when I first saw this movie. It was a rip off of the film I used to watch when it was really young, which is really not much younger than the film it actually makes. I can't figure out what this film was like, and I didn't even bother to watch it. However, it did manage to catch up with the storyline it had before it was even finished. I have a sense of the writer and director of this movie, and even a small bit of sympathy for them for making a bad film for a good movie: In the meantime, the whole idea of this film is to have a plot that is completely unrelated to the film. This is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. Not even the most terrible comedy ever made, which I had seen in "Barbie Over The World" and "Kung the Sun." There were more than 20 jokes that were directed in this film. I really had difficulty watching the ending because the script was so unbelievable that it really annoyed me. I thought the film was so bad that it should have never been made. However it was a movie, at least for a laugh. The director and writers should really give credit where they can and say that it was enjoyable to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In order to make it a truly good movie, the only thing that would work is the "bromos" voice. If you've seen this movie, you are likely to be confused as to what the hell is supposed to be. This movie makes the old film look like an old film from the '70s. The whole story is completely unbelievable - the whole "team" is just one group of people who are on a break. I had to put it down at the end because it is so hard to believe in. A major part of the story is that they want to try to convince each other of their own incompetence in their business - like they were on a plane with a kid that they had just seen. They're so stupid that they won't listen to your advice (like the guy saying they want a car like a Ferrari) and they just let the car go out of the window. They just want to be cool, they are too stupid to listen to the guy with an idea they want, they just want a "bomos" scene. It is the worst film I've ever seen.  I don't understand how a movie like this could possibly be considered a "film". It doesn't take away from the fact that this is a film, but it does make it worse. I am a teenager, and I have never seen a movie that made me laugh - not even a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been reading this movie for the second time. The film looked interesting, and at least it had the good ending, but it never seemed to make me care. I was also looking for "A Good Bond", and this film fell from the first installment. Although I was intrigued by the plot, I didn't care. The movie had nothing to do with the plot and it was just bad. I didnno get into the plot. The plot wasn't original enough for me to care about any of the characters. The special effects weren't that good. I had even thought that the special effects were fake because it wasn't so much a secret from the film. The ending was the worst thing I had ever seen, not that I liked this movie. I gave this movie a 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never seen this movie before. I was extremely dubious to watch this movie. It was only slightly better than "Lacinius Grosse" and was so bad I was skeptical of my own opinion. I suppose this is the only movie I ever saw that I didn't watch it for the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the beginning and the end of the movie - it is pretty cheesy and really poor at times. The ending was so disappointing that it made me vomit every time I looked at it. I think the writer must have written the original script or something else. This movie could have been saved by having some sort of special effects like a little kid playing with the dog. The actors were pretty good, though. Some good cameos were done for the beginning, and the ending was okay.   There is no decent direction whatsoever. The film is so bad that it has to make up for that with some interesting scenes. Some scenes were good, but there were some stupid moments that I just couldn't find. I was hoping that the other side had some special effects in it, like a kid playing an animal or something, but it didn't happen.  What was wrong with the last scene?  Well, it's alright. Some people like "Dangness" or "The Little Mermaid" movies, so you'll probably find it on the DVD.  I don't think that a film that has such a bad ending should be released. But, in the end, I thought I was going to watch this because I liked it. That's how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've seen, I'm surprised to see it in my second-guiler on my list. This film is not good in any regard. The editing is atrocious, the pacing is terribly slow, and the whole plot feels as if it is going off on an out-of-the-nowhere train. I'm trying to write about the bad acting and the bad characters, but I haven't got any to add. The plot is weak, the characters are weak, and no matter who you cast as it is a dull excuse for a lousy movie. I give this movie a 5 out of 10, with some praise for its cinematography, though the film contains some awful soundtracks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be a film of the first days of WWII.  There are several flaws and shortcomings. You get an over-sentence of "wedding" over the whole thing. A woman (whose name is at least vaguely interesting) tells a man (who was in his 50s) what she thinks he's going to tell her. The man (whose wife was a lady in her 50s at the time) thinks the man (his wife) is going to cry, because she's convinced there is an innocent man in the world. But, the man tells her in vain.  The man's wife wants to get a job in a company that has an office with a few people. She pays them to do a job with her in her hands. The job is not an easy job, and it is in the middle of nowhere, as you can imagine, and the men they paid her to do with her have not done themselves well with the job. The husband (who is the wife's brother in the 60s) thinks that it is so sad to work from the start of the war. He thinks the company is desperate for their employee. The worker (his sister, whose name is in a lower position in the film, who is a worker in the job in the movie, but only in her right hand) is in fact very nice and he does the job well, which gets his heart out, but the wife, her husband, and her new step-brother, do not.  You have to feel sorry for the fact that the main character, in the first place (again!) is a married woman.  If you want a chance to be entertained, get the film of World War 2. I've seen this film.  Also, the acting is bad. Some of the characters are very bland, but some of the acting performances are OK, if you can get a chance of seeing them.  But the film has one good scene - the first one where the woman and some friends meet with an angry policeman at the street. It starts off with something that is very boring - an ordinary, if there is anything funny in it - but when the man's name is brought up, he begins to get angry at the lady.  When the man sees the woman's name, he becomes even more angry and his name goes from the first name the woman introduces the other women who are friends of the woman. There are many, many
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was supposed to be a good comedy, but got pretty out there. A lot of the jokes were pretty bad, but the actors and the casting were OK. So it should have been funny, but I found the script and the acting bad.  The movie was just OK to be funny, and I suppose that most people would enjoy it. Just like the original "Happy Birthday" had the comedy of the original.  Just like all the other movies of the 1950's, it contains too much of bad material and not a lot of good jokes. The funny and ridiculous antics aside, it also contains very long dialog and it does not help with the comedy. I would rate this movie 4/10, but not even a bad 4/9 would be a bad score.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie about 4 weeks ago and I've read it twice now. It is a total waste of time. The plot is not good and the acting is terrible. The lead is very boring and predictable and the supporting actors aren't well done.  I would never recommend watching this movie. It's not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of Mr. King and his "The King's Palace" movies. They were both comedies, but Mr. Jones was too ridiculous.  There are too many little plot lines in the first part to have any meaning and it is too much of a film. I thought it would have been better to get something else, such as some action scenes. I mean, it was only 4 minutes, but the movie could have at least had some action. Also, "The Queen's House" was better than this one. It had its good points in making up the character of Mr Jones, but when Mr. Jackson is having his own fun, you just get bored. This was a bad film for a young guy.  The good thing about this movie was that I laughed, not to death. The plot was bad, the acting was good, the cinematography was good. The good part about this is that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I couldn't say the same thing about the other two "Bunch" films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i am truly amazed that they actually made it. i mean, they obviously don't have any talent at making a movie, they can only be very poor with a really poor script, a pretty bad acting and an even worse editing. i guess its good that they managed to make this one, though it was obviously supposed to be a comedy. what i mean to say about the acting, i mean i am not sure if i missed any other parts of the movie, or the story. what it is truly about is really embarrassing when you find out about all these parts and try to make them work. They just don't care much for story. They have the bloodlust (or lack thereof) for not wanting to talk about a real story, and they just want to be in this whole thing together, but there are not even any plot. It is just a horrible piece of shit, and all the actors are terrible. I guess we'll see what happens when these guys become a better story when they get the idea of making something, but i think it'll take them a very long time to come out. i don't want to see this story ever, but it is pretty unbelievable. it should be called "a comedy". it shouldn't be a joke, but I'm sure a comedy would have a very serious plot. i hope it's never to become a comedy again, and i'm sure the producers would still make something better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible movie. I cannot understand why it was rated low. There are very few, possibly none, funny jokes. Also, the acting was bad. I couldn't believe the director even wanted to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who has seen this movie and liked it, I'm not a huge fan of it, but I didn't care for this movie. I didn`t like it for one reason, mainly because I had the movie playing. I could just see the movie without the humor, but unfortunately I couldn`t see anything. This is a really bad film.  I don't even know the story or the plot, the dialog is so bad it hurts my eyes and it really is bad. This movie is about the only thing that made me angry. I'm sure there are a few of the people in this movie who would have had nothing to do with these people, but that's about all I have to do.  This movie does have some good moments, but it´s really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. Its very boring. My son enjoyed the movie and I don't like it. There was only one good part of this movie. It is when a ghost sees the movie which he is killed by the demon and a few seconds later he disappears and gets attacked by the spirit. He kills a demon and is sent back to the past to where he is the head of the demon. It's not funny and there is no suspense whatsoever. The acting is so bad, the dialog was not good and the story is awful to listen to.  But there is another interesting fact that I do like. When it comes to religion, the ghost sees and goes to a cult leader and convinces the leader to convert him to a Christian faith. This is the movie's introduction. Later he is sent to the Church of the Bible. We can only guess what is going on, but it sure doesn't matter.  The priest and the other priests try to kill him so the demon has to make the priest an example of how a demon can act without the human understanding of religion. The demon takes the lead of the priest and forces him to kill the priest.  There is no tension when this happens. The movie is about how a ghost is killed, not about how it kills a person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of film you would have been expecting from a low budget flick. Nothing could have been better than the last "The Last Rump", which has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The main theme is a young man (who had recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was in a drug induced suicide attempt) who has failed to follow what he has been told in an appointment with a therapist and the drug he was prescribed by the doctor was not taking properly. In a bizarre twist of history, the main character comes to realize he has the ability to "move on to another country" and has his life changed by getting a job at a local hospital that makes him lose his job.  The film is basically about a man, a young, struggling, man suffering from the fact that he has failed a drug he had taken. And then he starts to take the pills prescribed to him as he's going to work for a different job. The film's premise doesn't matter very much, because he's pretty stupid, but it does suggest a depressing scene.   There is no direction, no script, no direction whatsoever. In fact, it could have done much better. The whole thing should be a "drama", not a "horror" film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hope my family is able to avoid this horrible movie because I have nothing to do with it. I really was shocked by the ending. I think it was one of the worst film I have ever seen. I also think it might be the worst movie ever made because it has everything wrong, and the acting is bad and terrible. The whole thing is so terrible! I was really unhappy with this movie!  The only reason I could tolerate it is because the characters are good. If I had a kid that would like it, then I would like this movie, but at the moment I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just as bad as the previous one.   I would have to agree with everyone who posted the review in the article.  If you don't have one thing in your life, this is the movie you want to watch.  There is nothing, really, not worth anything, to say. Everything in this movie is based on people who aren't interesting enough to be interesting. In the previous review, it wasn't my intention, and I thought it had more in it. If you're interested, the movie doesn't have anything to do with people's lives, but it's only one way to ruin your life. It's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lowbrow horror movie that's supposed to be funny, but really sucks off the humor that I thought made it. Even if you laughed, it just wasn't funny. There was a little too much gore in this film. The director didn't know how to use the special effects in the scenes. And the acting didn't get any respect. I thought the dialog was good. I didn't even like the actors and they seemed to be all over the time they were in a situation that seemed like they couldn't control their emotions. I think this movie had something to do with the idea of a horror movie, but it just couldn't get that idea out. I don't think that any horror film should be rated higher than 5, but this is a film that's just not funny. If you have seen Scream or Saw before, you might find some of the jokes funny. I'll tell you it's not funny though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After their first attempt, the producers have decided to do a sequel.  The acting is horrible, the storyline is pointless and the soundtrack is too thin to make the film any more appealing.  If you do this movie for a cheap thrill, you may find some amusement. But if you do it for money, then just throw the disc out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this film was supposed to be a comedy about a child actor playing his brother. The first scene of the film, showing the young boy's sister holding her father hostage, is actually a horror film! I can only say that it is so bad that the director has to keep putting his nose in there! I'm a former acting teacher with a decent education background. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is bad and a waste of time. And the fact that they're acting on this movie is ridiculous. This movie contains a bunch of old guys who had the nerve to behave like teenagers, who are pretty good-looking young men, who were probably drunk. Those people could have gone to the bank for money, and the fact of the movie is that they didn't want to go to the banks. They aren't the people who are getting rich, or are willing to give their money to the world or anybody. They are the people with a lot of money who are having all the wrong things. They have nothing to do but waste it. The fact that the guys in this movie are acting on the scene is ridiculous - they're really acting on a scene to have their faces, skin, and their bodies treated like garbage, not like the ones who were dying in the first scene. If you want something better, try the movies of the old TV shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never seen this movie. I had always been skeptical about it, because I knew it was a pretty bad movie. It was obviously bad for me and my brother.  I would be very interested in this movie, if I could find a good copy somewhere. It wasn't too bad for my brother, but for me it was bad.  It starts off with a pretty ridiculous plot. The girl is talking about how she feels. And that's all you see.  But there are a few things that aren't quite right. The woman talks about how crazy she feels and the guy is talking to her. I believe he was talking to a girl in a black dress. And there is a scene where the woman wears a tight sweater. But none of those scenes seem quite right to me. The funny scene is when the man and the lady are talking together. They're both talking about a guy who had been in an accident in an elevator and went down the elevator. That is about the only scene that I can remember.  The ending is simply stupid. It starts with a guy going to his home to find something. It's not clear how he finds the house and what happened there, and there are no signs that he even finds anything there, but he does the deed, and that goes about all right.  If you're looking for a good movie with a bad plot, a couple of actors and one decent cast, please don't see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has one bad scene after another good scene. I was really enjoying the movie, but I don't think I'll ever really enjoy it to the point that this movie will ever be enjoyable. I just think it's just not good for anyone's enjoyment. It was very annoying, but there is a certain charm about it to that area of the film. That's just one area where the movie could have been improved.   I can't say for any other reason why this movie was given an 8 rating. It could easily be rated 1 out of 10 and just won't stand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, it must be pointed out how the only true science fiction movies from the 70's have that the movie is completely devoid of realistic dialog. The dialogue is a slap in the face. You get to know that this is a movie about a world of aliens living on a planet with a woman who is on an interstellar spaceship that has apparently come from somewhere else. No real discussion about the world of the aliens. No discussion about life in a galaxy where you have to defend human citizens from aliens (as you will). That's all in the movie. It is bad. Bad, bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to read the reviews before going. I didn't like this movie. I think it has a lot of stuff in it that would never happen to a person in a real life. I can see it as a comedy but I think the movie is just bad. I don't really believe the actor had to be a real actor, either. There is nothing real at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film at the preview I could even afford to buy it but as soon as I saw the trailer I was very depressed. I knew the plot would be a very bad film but I just gave it the thumbs down, just the same as I give it now. I just want to say that I did not get interested for the fact that it was based on a book but because the film had a tag saying "DANCER" at the end and a teaser to see my name that said "Dancer". If you think the film is good then go ahead and enjoy it but don't give this film any respect if it was only based on books written by an author or writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to find the very original version of the show that was originally broadcast in 1977. I was sadly mistaken, as the show has been repeatedly rerun on various cable shows over the last decade. When the show was broadcast in 1978, the original show was an extremely primitive sitcom that contained no real development of the characters. This version is not only unedited and amateurish, but also very dull and unentertaining. The show was made for a US audience who would never watch this show. They were hoping to be able to make it a decent sitcom, and even though they tried, they couldn't. I can't even count the number of times that this show was actually taped by one person in the UK. I've personally spent too much time watching this show, and I don't think I could have the patience to actually finish watching it. I really think that a better show like the American TV sitcom sitcom 'My Life With Simon' would never be made. It was a time-converted version of this show that never really existed, and it should have been a very interesting sitcom to a guy like me. I think that these types of shows that were made for US audiences in a time where the US was so dominant and in control of its domestic media, just as it is now, it would just be a waste of time. It needs to be replaced with a better film like the original 'The Hangman' instead. There are no good ways to create a better version of The Hangman, and there's just no way to avoid this show by actually watching the show. It's just a wasted, unimpressed, pointless, boring, but uninspiring, pointless and ultimately pointless piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was I thinking, when I came to this movie, that I would watch it and the only thing that I found out would really be the point in this movie. And what I found, I was in a mood for this movie to be boring to watch.  I mean even worse when I found the sex scenes that were supposed to have been in this film were, because I had to wait all this time to watch them.  Even worse when they were, and you know how, I have not seen anyone with more sex scenes than that in a movie before. The plot is really just a joke, which could get you all the way down with the fact that it's about 20 mins of a story. The dialogue is simply awful. The acting is awful, and I mean the acting is about what I would expect from a movie that really had nothing going for it.  So, for me to say I don't have to see the movie, but it does seem to be full of plot, and if you want to see this in a "smart" movie, go so far as the director is telling you to. But if you have the stomach for this, watch it for a second or two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie, the story is very stupid, I think that the story has something to give them something to tell the audience, because the characters are stupid. The actors don't react to the situations, but we have other actors.  I mean, it's obviously a very disappointing movie, I don't care to watch more, my life is just going to end.  But I have seen some very nice, interesting comedies, but they don't have the same effect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a couple guys who are drug dealers, very bad off drugs, and they are at the center of the drug industry; they are in the same position as the main characters of the movie, but in a way that could be a very interesting and interesting thing to say. One character in the film is named "Blackie".  In the film, he is in fact a young black man, with a lot of attitude and anger on his chest. I do think this would have been an interesting story. But the story doesn't work, and the plot gets worse and worse and is never followed up. It's not like watching a movie: It is like watching something that you cannot see for yourself, and your life is a completely different thing from that movie, even if you've seen the first couple of episodes. I can't really compare this to another movie: This is a movie that seems to follow an idea that people want to get behind and go crazy. The fact that it is from a novel is in some ways too extreme to be a real movie, and most people don't like it.   If I were thinking about being scared of a movie like this, I would look at some film, and say, "I'm scared of the TV show that is based on a movie, which is very disappointing, but I'll see if you watch it. Then my life will change! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be the film from the "Rock 'n' Roll" movie, and I thought the movie had pretty good scenes. But I found this movie was really just a droning-looking-and-smoke-smoking sort of thing. But when it gets to the actual scenes (and the "Coke-eater" trailer is shown on the opening crawl--that was my first guess) I was stunned. They didn't have enough time to develop and build something that didn't get old.  There were some good ideas, like the idea that "Rock'n'Roll" was a movie about partying and drug use and violence. But there's too many jokes about this movie, which I guess the actors were trying to get funny. The ending of the movie is really not funny, and there are so many holes between the scenes that it gets boring. I think this movie should be deleted or at least edited down.   But the film isn't really good for people who like big action, violence and drugs, as the "King of the Rock" and "Rock & Roll" movies were, so I'd recommend watching it with some light entertainment or comedy or perhaps even a few chuckles. I don't think it will do much more than bring an empty space to your life. It was really bad. The only reason I'd watch this movie now is because I bought it from a good, good movie club and really enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible, awful, awful movie. The best that this movie could be is a bad fantasy. The idea that this would be a story about a boy who falls in love with a beautiful woman who is dead from an illness. That would be the perfect story. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The plot was not terribly original, but the dialog was pretty stupid. It made me sad that so many of the actors in this movie seemed to be stupid.  My advice would be that this is a one-thirty-year-old film, not a great film. Don't get mad about this movie unless you like cheesy characters and cheesy dialogue. I have to agree with my roommate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to go crazy with a "ska" movie - pick this one! This is a very bad movie.  In a funny, albeit predictable way, the movie starts out like a skier. And the skier is the leader of a skiing team, so he is obviously able and skilled, but in a "real life" scenario the leader should never be able to win a ski tournament in any area. Also, the skiers are in very good shape for skiing, but don't get into a ski practice like a real skier would.  This movie is also very dull, not only for the actors, but also for the cinematons. The skier doesn't even act with any sort of "strategic" style or acting style, just a boring, self-indentaining performance.  The acting is so bad it just seemed unreal, that they all just seemed to be out of touch.  What I recommend:  Avoid this movie as soon as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie twice so far. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen. But it was still really bad. The acting was awful and the story was so bad that it is impossible to follow the script.  But in a real sense, it didn't matter. The plot didn't have any real meaning.  I will rate this movie as a three out of ten and a bad one if you want to get into real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know what the critics are saying; but I cannot agree with them. I think the movie is simply a bunch of random actors who are too stupid to act as their own roles. Also, I think that the actress is probably trying to be clever but fails, because she is a total moron with the acting. The movie ends with a slow fade out. And what is this supposed to be? This movie must be bad for a whole other reason. It starts off like an action movie but then there are no direction or direction. There is no storyline; just just an annoying thing to waste time. It is absolutely bad to see the actors on this movie and let them make the movie. I don't understand why they keep acting like this, or why a lot of people keep cheering for this movie. It's probably a good way to get money or something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad. I really enjoy "Bully" and "Buckets". They were both very cute and fun. But this was just plain awful. The scenes were supposed to be quite interesting, but they were actually just boring. This movie just failed to come alive. The ending was quite predictable and it seemed like it was just one of the two movies that were released in the late 1980s. It wasn't worth getting through the second film in the last time.  The film just seemed like a bunch of nonsense. The best part was that the main actors were very annoying, and the most annoying actor was the man who played the lead in the movie. That's how bad it was! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was quite pointless and the acting was just bad, not good, not entertaining, so bad it was that this is one of my 8 stars of a bad, horrible film. I mean, I laughed at the fact that it was about a woman dying, and not to mention the fact the story was really bad, it was really pathetic. I laughed about it, and I was embarrassed for the guy who said, "I am a man" (I was a man) in the end. Also, the scene where the doctor tells the girl about how she was to go. It is a good movie, but nothing like an action movie! And even worse, the guy that says, "You'll see me, it's true," in the movie is actually the one that says it! There is no doubt that the movie has been written to be funny. But unfortunately, it isn't funny. The girl at the end is crying, and it is sad that the girl doesn't even have a boyfriend. There's nothing funny at all. I give this movie a 1 out of 10, not the worst movie ever made, but I really didn't like it. The movie just got dull in the beginning and then grew worse and worse as the movie progresses. The dialogs are bad, the acting is bad, and there's no enjoyment here. I gave this movie 4 stars because it had good and interesting dialog, but after two of them I give it 2 more stars, or the girl really didn was just sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even want to give this movie any rating.  This movie is bad, awful, and there are few parts of the film that have the potential to have a sense of humour. And I can't even agree with the premise to be funny. The characters are so far from the norm that we would expect them to have something to laugh at. They are so stupid and so boring, that I wish they would just stick to their own films.  But most of the jokes in this movie don't help this movie because they are forced to be ridiculous. I think the best joke in this film is when they make a video where they have to use the "I'm A Woman" tester for the "My Car Is A Vehicle". And that is obviously a joke about the fact that a woman is using a car with a license. So stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although it is quite funny at times, it was awful in a bad way. A real disappointment. Don't waste your time watching it, unless you really want to see your own "great" horror movie, like "Silence Killing". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a complete waste of time. The girls and the other girls got stuck up in the middle of the film, and it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. They were all acting just so poorly that we had to watch it through out the end. The end is quite weak but not enjoyable. I think that it could have been a better movie with a better cast, because the actors were good. That's all I want to say. The worst is not one of the better ones. I didn't like this movie because I couldn't even understand what was going on, and I think the girls would of been better if they acted. The acting is bad and the girls just don't act. I thought that the director was completely incompetent, and the girl who voiced the role (the singer) was just plain awful. The ending is just not even worth watching, not even a full-length. It should have been an ending and it should have ended at some point.   What a waste of money. I'm not sure how to recommend it to anyone. The movie is bad, but it may or may have been worth a $20. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of classic cinema. The movies that would have been made today were made way before the modern age. The fact that this movie was made after all these films were made, is extremely disappointing. The movie is full of false endings, and a very low budget. I can hardly believe that anyone actually believed that a man would have saved the world.  I don't know why. The first part I saw, I was shocked. I think it's possible that the writer had an idea in advance of making this movie and he forgot about it. In my opinion this movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. No plot, no ending, no story and no ending. I have to say, you are not going to be satisfied. It's a pity, if you enjoy a good movie, you might like it. You might like more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I know, it is a classic of the low-budget-budget horror genre, but it's just so bad. There's no premise. It's just a bunch of guys walking through a room looking at a dead man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original show had a good cast; it had some of the funniest skits in the first half of the show. The new show, however, has a very poor cast, and has very few funny jokes. I can only recommend a few laughs to this show for two reasons; one is because it is so obvious that it is an imitation of the original show. Second, I've seen worse things in recent weeks.  This show would only be better if it wasn't full of an endless supply of awful jokes. Even if you find the jokes funny, they have a few holes in them, and they just don't fit together. In a good show, the jokes are part of the comedy and make the jokes good. In this show, they seem to have nothing to do with the characters and don't even seem to be believable. I find this show just as bad as the original shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be about a movie about the American "Golden Years" but it's really not.  It is not funny, the acting is awful, the characters are stupid, and the dialog is so bad that I just didn't care whether you liked it or not. In fact, I didn't even care.  The way the characters were portrayed in this film made it seem like the movie was a "real" movie about a real movie, and that's not how it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What a negative one review would be would be. You cannot tell if the actors were actually acting, or whether any of the actors are actually competent, or if the acting is terrible. In fact, the acting seems to be the main purpose of the movie. The acting is bad. It is also incredibly bad at the same time.  The main problem I had with this movie was the characters.  They just seemed to be on the same page with the acting, and they were all terrible. There was nothing about the characters themselves, but there was absolutely no indication that there were any real emotion attached to them.  There is absolutely no story to the movie, it is really an entertainment show for adults. They're just a bunch of guys acting in a play.  I just feel the movie could have been put to better use. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of this movie was interesting but when it came out, it wasn't quite clear. It is about a teenager who falls into an abusive relationship with an adult couple that begins to abuse him and his girlfriend. In the end, he leaves the relationship because of his abuse and his friend, who tells him his life is too low and he can't leave the relationship and he gets in a car with his dad. However, we don't see him actually driving with his father, since he is on his own (his ex). The film was just boring...no emotion, no real meaning...I couldn't care less of a single minute of it. This is really a waste of time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no good dialog. It is all about sex scenes. Just horrible. Just awful... I didn't like it when I saw it. I thought it would have been funny. But it is not, and there's absolutely no humor whatsoever. I don't think it was all about the sex scenes, but I'm not sure. This is a weak film from beginning to end. The girls' voices are not good as they are portrayed. But that's OK, it's just OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not as bad as the first few episodes of the show. I really didn't think that anyone cared that much about the story. It just got worse and worse.  The whole thing is a mishash of cheap acting and a badly produced movie. I can't really say that I didn't like it. I'm not going to sit out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i found this movie on the site just after I read the story of the book. I never heard that such a movie had been made, and that it was a sequel. I am so bored and annoyed with this movie. I'd like to see some interesting and interesting movies to share with the world.  If you want to watch a movie with an unreliable narrator and a very unsatisfying ending, watch this movie instead. If you liked the book, watch it instead.   The acting is so bad it's only moderately entertaining. I'm not sure if it was made by the author(s) or some young actor(s). I would rate it less than 1.5 out of 10 if you like to watch this but i found the movie itself rather unsatisfying. It just doesn't seem like a real movie, not like the other horror movies in the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised that this is not a movie made by a person who worked with the X-Men movie, this movie is so bad it had the audacity to make it look good. The plot is not original, it is boring, and the plot doesn't make any sense. There's no interesting story line, no dialog, no action, and it really doesn't seem like a movie. In the beginning of the movie I was watching it with a friend who had never seen any X-men film and was very intrigued with this movie.  I was really sick to my eyes and the movie wasn't even half funny, and after one time it's really pretty awful to watch.  The only thing I found interesting was the way the movie is being made. The way the story is structured is very boring, there are no real action scenes and there are so many plot twists. The only reason I really liked this movie was the fact that I was interested in X- Men, a very good movie, so that I actually ended up giving it two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was released in 2009 but was never meant to go into theatres, which would have been obvious if the plot didn't go down that way. The original series didn't exactly have the same quality as the newer version, which is also bad. I can't recommend this movie because the story is stupid and the acting is so bad and the action is bad. The movie was never well known by its creators. I hope I can see this movie again in the bargain of a rental, even if it's only 2/2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie while it's off me. I had seen it before the other day. It was pretty predictable...and I didn't really like it. But when I saw it again in its original form I still didn't like it but after seeing it in the other form, I felt like it was OK for me to like it because the main point was that it was pretty stupid. If it's not for you, it isn't really worth to like but for me, it was more like an episode of The Mummy's Tale.  It was disappointing in a few ways. I guess I'll like it less after seeing the way it was, but at the same time, it wasn't just another bad sequel to the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had been in my job as a movie reviewer for over 5 years now. I am not going to waste anymore time. I just wanted to make some comments about this bad movie, mainly I think it's just an old film of no relevance. I've heard this movie before, and I was sickened by it, with my own interest in what it was about, and it was not good for me. It was just bad and bad, I think I will never catch it again. The script was bad and the editing was bad. There was a lot of bad lines and I didn't really care, but if I really cared, I'd have watched the entire film. I thought that they were going to show the last of the series in which the director of this film is in. I wasn't really going to watch this film, but I did go to see it. And it's really hard to get into what was about this film. The camera was bad, the sets were bad, they were too small, and the characters were terrible. There is really nothing that I can say about this movie. I know it was made to bring down the quality of the TV and films of today's. I believe the people involved in this project don't care about it, and they'll do something else if it proves to be successful. It's just another bad remake of a bad sequel of a failed, never-cared-for movie about a movie in which they expect to be seen on TV. They don't get any respect for making a difference between movies and their respective segments of the franchise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe the writers made this film. I have to say that it's a very awful film and not the film I expected to see. It's so bad that I don't know what film it would be. I don't care what I have seen in the last 5 years. I did see "Carmid" a few years ago, and I was disappointed. But "Hells" is bad. The main story is very bad. There's a lot of things that aren't explained. The script is about the worst film I've seen of my life. A real movie: don't listen to it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a problem here, I was a kid and this movie was a complete mess. It was the worst movie I've ever seen! It could have been a good movie. I wasn't even bothered by it, I just had to laugh and cry and my life was so far from happy. I'd seen that movie in some of my high school classes and thought that it was so funny, but it really sucked.  I've never laughed that hard on a movie before, but after seeing this movie I actually laughed.  It made me sad because I can't tell anymore if this movie is any good, but the only thing that was funny was that they were making the name of a fictional movie! What was fun about them?  The plot was a bit too long and too stupid. I think that it should have been better than a teen-level, teenagers-only horror flick. Even if this had been a teen movie, the movies made it seem like it was a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is laughable. You will never, of course, be able to understand why the writers chose this for a film to take seriously. And I understand this movie is meant to be satirical. That is for the most important reason, the acting is the worst. Also, the jokes are so poor they don't allow anyone to laugh. If you find this to be a comedy, then the comedy part is not just a joke, but a pain in the ass. What happened while you were watching this movie was that it is very hard to understand the message that this movie has. And then you realize that all of the jokes were in fact funny, but I don't believe that any of the writers knew exactly what they were trying to say. That's not to say that they're a parody or that the jokes themselves are funny, since it's not true. Still, at times I would like to see more funny jokes, but that wasn't enough for my brain. This is not a movie you watch to laugh and have an adequate laughter, which would be a more effective way to destroy brain cells. I just don't know why, if you have any serious questions about this movie, then you won't like it. The writer must have learned what he had about comedy in comedy, which he probably does not. The acting seems like an amateur effort to create something for this movie that is a huge failure. I understand that the producers had good intentions. But they did not care. The movie is only slightly better than the "Dirty Little Bit" episode, but the overall effect is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two or three episodes of this terrible movie look really, like a bad sequel to a bad little horror movie. I am surprised, that I actually thought there was a good episode about a great movie: a man, a woman, a couple and the entire family in a living room, all of them living with the man, woman and family, on a Saturday evening, eating a roast, and having nothing to do but stare at the person sitting in front of me.  This movie is absolutely terrible. It is also a pretty big pile of bums. There is not much room for comedy. This movie could not have been better rated. The first episode is not nearly as good as the second one. I wish the guy was more well known. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Outlanders" is an over-exaggerated film that tells a story about a group of outlaws. The characters, especially the women in the group, have little relevance to the film, which has a bad execution in the rest of the films. It's not a good way to tell a story.  The film is not only a disaster for the acting and production; it's not only bad for the story, it's bad for acting. The women in this film are boring, the dialogs are not good, and the story is bad. A few of the film's best actors have a weak role, but their performances in a weak way. There are also some bad performances from actors and female actors, such as "Evegine" and "Tasha" which are far from the best roles I've seen.   This movie is just a sad disappointment for everyone involved in it. The story is a bad and unappraised one; not a comedy. It needs a good story that doesn't involve an ending.  This is a film that never actually gets into the depths of the story. It doesn't have any relevance to any story, and it should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the stupidest and most disappointing films I have seen since my teens. I was hoping that this movie was going to be great. I didn't know how this movie went in its final stages. I'm not surprised that they didn't get the acting of any of the actors. This movie just is stupid. I have never seen a movie that could not follow its pace, not even one that could go out to lunch. It's as predictable as an empty movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is awful, the acting is bad, the dialog is terrible. I didn't even notice any of the lines because it's not obvious, but I didn 't really get into this. I would rate this movie as a 7, but it's really more at the end of the book. I mean this movie is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few good things here: 1. A funny script. 2. The idea of a black female doctor, who has done nothing but run her house, is given the chance to have an abortion in the black-themed setting.  I really felt that this movie was really about a female doctor in an industry that relies on black men and lesbians. She would have been better off getting a job at a male clinic and working with a male doctor in a white doctor's clinic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of time! This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it is just a very bad film. In addition to the bad acting, bad acting(I think), poor special effects and very poor special effect(s) the movie is also not even funny(maybe), even if it could be. I think the movie was done by someone who didn't quite understand what he was doing. I've watched this movie once, and while I liked the movie before I saw it again, it has left me quite bad.  It seems that this movie is getting worse. There is nothing to do except watch it for a moment, that's all you need to do. There isn't a plot, there isn't even a storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bunch of old-fashioned movies: a bunch that's all about sex and violence and, in the name of God, the people who think that it's good to have sex and violent sex. What a shame! What a shock! But I'm not so surprised. This is an old-school movie: sex is really just a matter of power and money. It's about how a guy gets laid (somehow), and how the rich get fat (some how). It's not a movie about the sex scenes, it's not about the women who are raped and how much the girls get to go off to have anal sex or whatever. It really just about how sex is used, but it's still bad.  The movie also fails to make a connection between the sex scene and the story behind it. We've always had a great relationship between the women in the movie and the men, and it's about the relationship that never gets the full respect it deserves. The men in the film seem to think that the woman's sex scene is about how the women are just about "paying their rent" or "paying for a place to stay". And, in any case, what a good movie this could be.  There are some interesting (and interesting!) dialogues, but they're just what you'd expect. Some of the dialogues (and I mean dialogue) are good, but that's not really all that is wrong with this movie.   The story is pretty vague and the main character's motivations are never really explored. The movie takes a few minutes to give you the basic details about the story and then then we're going to the women, whose relationship with the men are never explained.  Even if you like the movie, the story is totally lacking in content.  I'm even disappointed that the women's relationship with each other is not the central theme of the movie. It could have been something so interesting. If there was a good version of the story, the relationship between each of them would still be funny, and there would be something interesting to investigate about it. The plot is just about being the woman who's left without an apology and then is beaten by the men.  This is really bad. If you're looking for a movie that's just about sex, violence, and money, then a sequel is definitely not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a movie buff, but i've never seen this in any way before. Not one of the funniest comedies i've ever seen, this is a complete waste of time.  But to be fair, i'm going to have to give my opinion. I'm going with the worst possible sentence that anyone can use, "A bad movie". I can't even think of a decent analogy. I really want to go to see this movie in the airport. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an interesting idea to tell the story of a movie that just barely worked. The movie is lacking so many important elements that it's hard to care about. This is particularly the case when the movie starts to have problems with the music. There's a lot of dead or dead-looking music, and when the music gets good the movie becomes even worse. Also, the movie has no strong acting. The acting is bad and the characters are pretty stupid. Even if you liked the movie, the story is just too bad to be worth the time spent watching it. A few of the movie's characters are okay, but they just don't get anywhere. If you like a movie about a good movie, you'll have to keep spending time to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete joke of the "Spirited" genre. One line in this film is absolutely laughable. It was interesting in a few moments, but that was only after about 60 minutes. I just can't figure out the plot! It's supposed to be a movie about the time when the American Indians were enslaved, so the whole storyline was just a bunch of jokes. I mean, it would be funny if there was a movie that had the same plot, because the movie itself says the same thing! I really liked the "The Jungle" but it had too much of a feel to be comedic! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a bad flick, and I don't care how bad it is. I tried to sit through it for the whole day, but it couldn't. As soon as I got tired of it, I found myself skipping the middle of the film and starting at the end. This film sucked me out again, I think that most people would think that it is a "funny" film. That's not necessarily a bad thing, if you like such movies, you can enjoy them as often as you want, but most of them are far worse. And this one is just that, there's no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  This is only the most sadist film of all time, the very slow, slowest film of their kind. And I'm sorry for making it, even though I made my living, not wanting to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie.  I had been listening to all of the TV episodes. They were a lot of them, but none of them was really enjoyable. The plot was pretty silly, but it was also predictable, and there wasn't any kind of theme song or plot-related theme. And, I believe, in the end, I don't even think I could get through the entire movie. Maybe I just couldn't go to work on this thing.  There is no good explanation about how this movie is going, just some vague explanations that it would have been a story with a plot. They tried to avoid the whole situation. It was just the story. They wanted it to be funny, so it got boring.  The most disappointing of this movie was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise here is very basic - some people, after killing their own families, have it all up to kill their own victims.  They get a new body after the killing. They soon realize they have to get something else to make the same amount of money for a live-and-play situation.  But there's more to this movie than it's obvious, like the fact that the guy who was killed in the movie is dead so it gives the viewer a big time in, but at the end he is alive, which doesn't really make any sense.  One of the people killed in "Dead Doll" is named Paul Ryan. He comes into the middle of an episode, has to jump off his body and dies. He dies, but he does a few lines in the film. He is named after Paul Ryan because Paul Ryan is very annoying.  The sequel is called "The Dolls," and although it has a lot of gore and violence, it doesn't have much to give away. It's actually pretty good to see this one for the first time, but after the first "Doll" comes on you are going to really get sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In short. I gave this movie a bad name because it is a bit predictable, but also very predictable. In the end the movie turns in predictable, boring and most of the dialogs are simply irritating. I didn't even bother watching the movie because I wasn't even interested in the end.  If you want a movie that has something to show you, you won't. Just don't. The only thing I'm interested in when I watch this movie is for the laughs. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I was 9 years old and I didn't know what it was. I saw it again yesterday, and I think it's even worse. What this movie is about is that the characters are totally stupid and not the most intelligent people, the way that they think about their problems and their lives and the way they live. In the meantime, they get a job in a restaurant, and when they go to the restaurant, they become so depressed that they do not want to go. The other reason that I saw in the movie was that it was so bad, it was way too serious and the characters were so stupid. The movie was about the stupid people in the restaurant who are so sad they don't want to leave, but instead they want to keep looking at the movie to get back to their lives, but the movie makers don't care. The director doesn't care either way.  I don't know if the director has an actual talent, but I think he is trying to create something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand this guy, but I don´t care. I donât give it any of the credit, and the plot is mostly awful. I cannot see that anyone who has not got any clue of the plot. I think that's why it´s so stupid. I mean they would have had to be more stupidly stupid. It's a movie to have nothing to show that you´re in the mood to care for the characters, and then go on with the story, and there´s no point in treating characters of your life in such a way. I can´t believe a movie with a bunch of girls who cannot hold a candle to the screen. They are just acting. I´d have to watch this movie with subtitles on in order to see the subtitles, because when you have just seen a movie about a girl who´s a virgin, you´d just feel all of them and you´ll have to act the same way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little girl with a pig was kidnapped, then she is rescued by her dad, then he gets killed and then he goes back in to try to get another pig. Then a bunch of people from all walks of life decide to come into the animal hidey and find him. There are three things going on in this movie, the first thing being that there is an animal with a body that looks like a hunchback. Then he goes on a long walk with some of the people, and they go on the other side and get stuck, and then the movie follows the animal. This is absolutely ridiculous and it doesn't help that it is so stupid! The best part of this movie is when the pig tries to walk away from the other animals and starts walking on the backs of the other animal, and when it tries to get into the pig. The second part is when it says that the animal was dead, and the pig says that it had an alarm to get out of the animal shelter and the next day they are found by the police. But even this works the way it did. They have the pig and the pigs and they're all going around to try and kill them.  Also, the animal keep keep saying that there's a pighead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible! What is it about? I don't know the people who made it, but they certainly don't care much about me, I'll tell you how much I hate this movie.   I cannot comment on this movie as it is so bad it isn't even funny. The acting is poor and the plot is so predictable it can only be considered a comedy, but there is nothing funny to this movie (unless for the fact that the director and the writer actually love this movie and want to make it. I've never been a fan of this movie, but I usually watch it for the stupid gag it is and that's about all I know. I would definitely have been embarrassed watching this movie if it actually was a comedy.  My ratings:  2.0 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know the guy who wrote this film, but if I could find it for me I would have to see it again. It was a mess. I laughed at the end of it, although I was surprised to see how it all ended. It is not even a good movie. The music is bad, there are weird moments, some of the camera is bad as hell, some dialog is bad but I cannot say that these are the same for the rest of the film. So I thought I would give it the worst rating in the whole movie.  I wish I was a stranger on earth and an alien, and didn't feel like a movie star and didn''t want to read this book, or the TV show I am so bored with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie before, and there's no doubt that the director had some personal problems. But this is just a bunch of crazy people being killed...and if the plot is good, why does it take this long to get to some kind of character's backstory? If the story is not good, that's a reason to be interesting. However, the story isn't interesting enough in itself; it simply drags along, with no real story or plot, so you're just listening to the dialogue.  I give it two stars out of 10. But if it has an interesting plot, that would be a good movie. But unfortunately, there is no plot, no character, and no real character. All it has is some really weak scenes. If you don't like this movie, just skip it, and don't get into this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the most stupid movie ever made. What makes it so stupid is that it doesn't explain the movie. And this movie has two of the worst possible lines in the movie, the first being a "Why me, why my, why you, why me  Why me, you are so nice." (and the other one is the "Where I go and who I go with.  The second line in the second movie was about the only funny line in this movie, and they said it was about a good movie. I hate it because this movie was so bad, but I wish I was in a different movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it's done, it can be a very weak film, but what's a better film than a movie that's not even funny? The acting, the acting is horrible, the story is very bad, it's not interesting and doesn't even make any sense. I really liked "Winnie Hodel", that movie made so much sense and had fun to see the characters go on adventures with each other.  "The Darkest Hour" didn't even come close to that level. I did see it, but it didn't have the ability to create or give any kind of emotion. It just seemed there was no good way to make it funny, and it felt like a story about a couple that were on vacation, but still got out there and left them at the same beach.  It doesn't really make you feel like a better movie. I've never had anything else that has made me like a film more than a funny and/the story. The acting was terrible. The dialog was horrible, I didn't get any sense of who these people were and their lives, and some of them were even less interesting. It was just plain awful. And I really hated it for having fun, but I did like the ending.  There is no reason for people to see this film. This is not a film worth a ticket, and I think no reason to see it because it's so bad, even if it was enjoyable, just as a joke.  I know I don't see this movie much, and most people who have seen it say that it's a fun film. It's hard to get into this movie because it was obviously awful. Don't buy it if you like the characters in the film, and don't buy if you are a huge fan of movies like this film is about a bunch of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a really good movie. But it wasn't. But this movie is bad because the movie itself is awful. I don't know what the guy had to say at the end. Maybe a guy who was the lead in the movie might have said something. But even if that is true, why? Why don't they hire a person like a human lawyer for this? Because the acting is awful and the writing is bad. I do understand the premise that there is a person that is the lead over and over to the character. There is no direction, and the movie is boring. This is really the worst movie I have ever seen! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't like any of this movie because I didn't like the others. I think this is bad when you are really trying to have fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not the worst movie ever made of my life. Its about "Dirty" sex that only makes it worse!  I really have to see the video before I can understand it. The plot seems to have a bit of something to it. There is nothing really, and if you put this in a DVD player, it would look like a really horrible little movie with a plot that is so convoluted as it appears to be to be an almost non-stop story. I cannot even say that I laughed to the point of this movie. I don't have to tell you how the plot goes, because it's obviously a joke. The only reason I laugh is because I was expecting something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the second to last film of this year, and the third. It's sad to see how people can get through it, because they don't understand what a film is supposed to be about. This film has several flaws, including bad acting, and a lot of plot. I'm guessing the writer/director is a writer of a very low caliber, and probably a high school drop off in their junior school. The plot is also not coherent at all. In short, it's only a mystery movie, and nothing is more than a mystery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well. I am a big fan of the movies (I made a list of all the movies I love.) I love the books, books, and the comics. I can remember the comics that were better, funnier, and funnier to read than this. This movie is NOT worth to anyone. I don't care whether I would like it or hate it. I do not care. I was surprised to find this movie when I really liked it a little more than what I used to watch on MTV. It sucked. The writing is bad, the jokes are not funny, and there were no good jokes. I did find it amusing when I heard the beginning song from the beginning. I had to listen to the song, not because I was bored. But the story, and even the beginning theme song didn't really make it all worth. The only good thing about the movie was the fact that the cartoon made it so obvious. I would have had to get out my copy of "The Flashback". But I think MTV should be used to make it better. The first episode is so bad it makes you want to tune in to the next episode. Don't like it for real, but you will at least have some enjoyment. The music is bad too, but the story is OK. The story is fairly interesting. It's also pretty sad and depressing, but it really doesn't have anything to do with me. I know the comics had some good jokes, and I think they were better than this, at least compared to what you have seen before. But this is NOT a good movie. It should be an hour of wasted time. I'm disappointed. I think that MTV would do better on a better show. They had some excellent comedy sketches in there, but most of them are bad. There should have been better jokes and better jokes. This episode, in my opinion, had a very bad premise. I didn't get much more enjoyment than the song. If you just want to see something about "Becker's Car" then maybe it's OK. But if you just need some laughs and it has something to do, then it's about OK. There's no real way to enjoy this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're serious about this movie then you have to watch it. It starts with the obvious intention of being funny, but really it has only one line after the first minute. Then the next minute you have another line saying something about the new woman that is going to be a wife. The woman talks about how nice it is and about how bad it is. This is the movie where you just sit back and wait. Don't go into it expecting a funny film. This has no laughs.  The film ends when the movie starts showing you what happens to the girl who had a bad boyfriend. Then you're ready to watch the end. But that's where the movie leaves you. It turns out to be completely pointless.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even a "The Great Show" in the way that many people have been claiming. There are some decent funny parts, but the film is a complete failure of any relevance whatsoever. I don't think that this movie has the best special effects or best special effect. A little bit better in some areas (like the circus) and some others not much. But I'm the first one to admit that this has the worst special effects in movies. I find it hard to believe it was made with the intent of making people laugh.  It was also a bit sad seeing such a weak film make this way for other movies. This is the most disappointing movie I have ever watched. It doesn't make any sense at all and I think this movie was made by a group of people who just wanted to make movies like this one. It just plain sucks! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie to be able to watch it and was disappointed. I was very disappointed. This is an awful excuse. I have seen some good films but you have to expect the worst and expect something to be bad. Also, I did not like the ending. It was unbelievable. I would have liked it to have ended like a movie ending. I liked the ending in "The Killing Fields". I just didn't know it wasn't like the final ending of "The Living Room" or "Death of the Monster". I guess I'll see it again. There's a lot of other bad things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie was that there was a few funny jokes (but not as funny as some reviewers might have been), but most of the rest of the film was pretty lame.  The plot was terrible and there were many small jokes that were hard to follow.  There was also a good one, but it wasn't funny.  Overall, the acting was terrible. I thought it was just plain awful. There wasn't even a joke. The whole movie seemed to be designed to be a gag, rather than a comedy. There were many bad jokes, and I don't remember the one I could remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that this is the worst movie of them all. There are a few funny moments, a few decent characters (though most of them are too stupid to care) and a handful of good actors. But most of the film is very flat and not particularly good. Some of the humor is funny, but the acting is not so funny, not that funny. It doesn't even have the pretense of being a parody film. It is too long and contains too many clichédances and bad jokes. This movie was so bad that it left me feeling like I was really a bad person. In the end, I did the only thing I can do to stop the film. I think my friend who is a former friend of mine had to stop this movie because he was afraid it was going to be so awful and he could't watch it again. He was OK with it, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The ending is stupid and there is no reason to stop watching. I won't even watch this movie if I didn't find out it was a ripoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just got boring when it comes to the end. The whole plot was completely wrong. I didn't know who they were talking about until they were done. But they were making it seem more serious. They are making a film about a teen who is a very bad actress who has been in some bad movies over the years.  You get tired when you watch it. There is no explanation of the whole plot. The story is not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can barely even stand there and it's only for 4 minutes. That's the only thing that matters. How else did you hear that "The Darkest World" was about a bunch of guys playing with their arms and the "Darkest World," it was the only film that made it to appear in the first place. And if you aren't familiar with the movie then all I can say is the best way to look at this movie is from one single line and one or two scenes.  If you like a movie that is predictable and completely disappointing then I'll be honest, but it has one redeeming feature. But in the end this is just another disappointment to me.   The plot is not too bad, but what it lacks in the story is something more important than the plot. What it is about is nothing, the movie just tries to stick a stick in the wheels, and it just never gets anywhere.  There is not much suspense to this film, the camera is not up to snappy, and the sound track is about all the same as the rest of the ones.  The movie has a very low budget (the first one is $6,000 USD) and it does not have a lot of detail, but the characters are very clichéd, and most of the actors are simply acting in the movie, making the film seem like a bunchof video ads.  Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie quite a bit, but since I had a few minutes I would not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure most people don't like this film. The best parts are the two people who are supposed to be the lead acting duo. If that's you I'm surprised. If it's anyone else you'd probably be surprised.  I've read some comments about the acting in this movie so far, and there's no in any way that I can understand the situation. Some of the actors seem to be in their mid 50's, but they couldn't get out of their teens. They are in their 30's, so don't feel bad about this. The two people (the acting duo) are in a middle aged relationship and they act like teenagers who are trying to start a relationship but it ends up with the young man and the lady who are in the same position.  If you think the movie is so bad that you'd never finish it, you're probably in for the worst possible film. This film is a complete waste of time, and it just makes you sick from the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were some interesting things about the plot. The first step of the plot was a small village of refugees. The people in the village were treated as though they were a part of the world. The next step, a small group of women and children. And then, of course, they were all killed by the fire that was released by the rocket. It was a pity that they were killed in the fire, but there was no effort to make this movie better. The characters were not good. I was so embarrassed I never watched it.  I thought the whole movie was ridiculous. I could listen to the soundtrack, which was okay. But for those who cared for the movie, I don't know what the hell they were doing. I think the people were making it up for something. It would have just a few more scenes to show up. That's about all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the "The Sixth Man" on the TBS. I don't believe the director was a true filmmaker (not even a "pro-director"), but it is still one of the worst films I've ever seen. There were many things that were bad, but there was only one that made it to be funny. The "The Seventh Man" was funny, but that's not where the film failed. The plot was also kinda weak, but the acting was bad. The soundtrack was also bad. Also, I did laugh at the line "I'm tired" when watching it. I'm tired of saying that.   In all, the "Big Oats" is a good movie. I just wish it was only a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of terrible bad writing. The script, directed by Peter Sullard, was never really good and never really funny, it was more like a slap in the face. I was surprised that the movie ended up being so low budget. The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the dialog is not funny, the camera is awful, and the soundtrack is poor at all. It all needs to be remembered as it was so bad. But luckily it has not been canceled because there were so many people wanting to see it, so we stopped watching it one day and started watching the original DVD release instead. That didn't mean much, as the first episode of this movie was only 4 episodes. That was good though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has a lot of potential. However, it isn't good. It's not interesting. The story is pretty vague, there's no action in the plot and there are no proper direction and the camera is just awful. However this is pretty fun. And it is pretty disappointing that such a crappy movie has an almost decent cast. So if you're thinking about watching it, don't! Just don't, don not, see the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of this movie, but this is a very bad movie. I am hoping to get more info on how it is. It's a shame when a movie has such a low rating. I give this movie 1 out 10, it really wasn't that good.  It has several horrible characters that were the same for the previous movie. What is funny, is when you come back in the new sequel, you find the same actors in this movie. This film just keeps getting worse. I just don't like it.  What is this film? Well, it's a "documentary" with all the characters doing the same, and the characters are being killed off the other side. I wouldn't recommend watching this film, though there are times when you might enjoy watching it, and there is an interesting ending. I think the film is a waste of time, no wonder I think they won't make a sequel to this movie as well, but it is too bad for me to even watch.  I give it a 1 out 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember this movie as being one of the worst movies of all time. The script is simply terrible and the story lines are simply stupid. I saw this in its first week of theaters when I was starting the show. And so many bad jokes were made and I just started laughing. And I'm not one of a snooty, easy-guy person, but the humor did get a chance to go someplace. I had a hard time reading the script and I didn't understand what the heck it was about. The movie is actually a copy of one of Peter Cammons' jokes from a long time ago. They tried to make it look good, and some of the jokes worked, but there was too many of them and the movie got dull. What's more than a few jokes? A whole year of this garbage! I recommend skipping this movie and skipping the sequel, "The One In The Family" if you have nothing to do and have no idea where the characters are going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot believe this movie to be one of the most stupid movies ever to make it's way onto DVD. The acting is bad, the acting and dialogue is terrible and the plot is a little too shallow for such an old movie. It does have one good point, though. The girls are cute as they are cute in real life. The other good thing about this movie is that you get to see all of the stars' faces at some point in the movie and get to know their real names. That is a nice thing. That was one of those movies where you could actually see some of the actors and have the actors actually ask you if you need a ride home, and you did so. It just doesn't work.  There are two girls named Linda who are the stars in this movie, and they are probably the girls that are the closest friends of the real life Linda and the girls who are in the real world. Linda is in a car with a girl named Linda. Linda and all of them are driving a big car and they drive down in an air conditioning trailer that is filled with a lot of dirt and it looks like it has been put there for some kind of job. I think it is an effort for them to make this movie. The car looks like an air conditioner. They seem to be going to go to the beach, and we suspect they are going to get their clothes off before getting in the water, but they go to a lot further to the sand to get the clothes off.  The acting and dialog is bad as always. It is just bad. There is not really any story in this film. The story is very superficial and there is not much to it, and it is about nothing in the end. The last thing is that this movie has some of its greatest and worst of all time. A lot of the dialog is in and the acting is so poor that it comes out of a bad script. The girl characters are not actually all very good people in real world and the characters in the "real world" aren't the same people. The women in the film are just different. And the actors are totally terrible, which has really done a lot to this movie cause. In a real life video review from an obscure television show called "Titan" about a very bad movie called "Cinderella":  This movie is so slow that when I started watching it I didn't know which direction I had to look at in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say I was skeptical about this movie. I would have given some points for it, but not enough.  I was disappointed in the acting. There was no one good character and some were not good actors.  The scenes were very simplistic. I thought that there was an attempt to find some humor in this movie, but I was the last person to see it. I wish there was a decent ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just recently discovered this movie has a cult-like following on Amazon. It is the movie that says people want to buy the movie because they love it and then they try to have a cult on it. I was skeptical of this movie because I was thinking that you had to at least have an idea of where this was going. I also felt the movie was ridiculous at times in the beginning. It really didn't follow any of the basic rules of filmmaking. But I liked how the characters were acting and not how the actors were acting. I could only recommend watching a film in hopes to understand the story. I couldn't really understand anything of this film.  I would never recommend this movie as a work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my biggest disappointment. How can this be dubbed a comedy? How can it have so many flaws in it? I don't understand the message. There is only one funny scene, a brief scene in the first half of the movie, and it is the worst I've seen from this movie since my friend told me that it was "really funny." In all the scenes it is plain and simple comedy. If you want a comedy with good jokes, you have to look at the entire series and decide on how to approach the whole situation.  I don´t know why the producers have decided to do this. If they want a real comedy with no plot it is simply too late to say.  If you like a comedy you might like this, but just the same if you want it to be just a comedy... don´s a lot of movies like this... if you´re looking for a comedy it might be better if you just buy this on DVD instead of watching it and going straight to your local video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the "The Simpsons" series, but this movie is completely lacking of a decent premise. As a guy who works for the Simpsons, I had to have watched this film with serious thought. But it's just so bad! The fact that it was only for one movie isn't even a surprise to me. But once it becomes time-less, that's only the first step of this story.  The story is not good, either. If you just want to be boring, this is a good movie. If I'm telling you, I'm being generous, go a few minutes in and watch it; otherwise, it's bad. I think this movie should be used as a short to teach people to believe in something. Otherwise, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I'll never forget a bad film, even though I like this one"  Well I guess I thought it was like this film, with the plot, the acting and some of the writing. But in this one, it just didn't come to life. I didn't care for the plot. Also, the ending was anticlimaxed. I was laughing and waiting for the ending to end. I don't think I will ever find the movie to this point, because the only good one, "I Will Never Forget", is a film that actually works. I won't even go as far as saying this film is a piece of junk, because it has some good scenes. I can watch one good scene without liking it. "I Won't Never Forget" is about the bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it would be the last chance of a bad film: the idea of a story that has nothing to do with the main plot. Just so we get a plot. But then the plot is just an attempt to create a story.  I can't say that any of the plot really makes sense, and the story is unbelievable. And what the plot actually is is... well, you know what I've mentioned.  What makes this movie a bad sequel? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I watched it on IMDb, I had one word that I hadn't really expected. It was a complete waste of money. I could easily have won back my money to get a lot of other stuff. I don't even remember what the show was about. You just sit there and watch the pictures, while you eat. The main thing about this movie was that it was so bad it ruined the show. That's what I think. It didn't really matter whether I bought it or not. I just wanted to get rid of it, and didn't know that it would ever go anywhere. If I could have won my money back, I would have. But even if it wasn't, I'd still have to pay my money in order to have it taken out. That made me think that even if you couldn't beat its rating, you shouldn't even have to buy it. What a pointless waste of $70 dollars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad from its inception. I don't have to mention my favorite horror movie of all time (that was also the first one I bought on DVD!), so I won't review it. Instead, I will review something that's actually pretty good.   A woman was kidnapped, then kept in a dark room by her friend and the guys who tried to kill her. In the room, she is held captive, tortured, and tortured by the same guy she fell in love with.  After killing those guys, the girl is put to sleep, whereupon she wakes up with a fresh blood bath and a bunch of needles in her eyes.  What is it about? It's like a soap soap opera that nobody will recognize until the next day when they finally go to work. This is bad from beginning to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people who are fans of this movie were shocked that this movie was actually a show.  A series of bizarre plots, bad dialog, and poor direction in a poorly thought out attempt to start a series of a series. The plot was really bad, but it was not enough to justify the ridiculous plot.  It was pretty hard to understand what the plot was about.  There were too many unanswered questions.  I liked the idea of this series. But it wasn't really a good movie. I don't think this film will gain any appeal. I also had a hard time with the ending.  The film was not funny or entertaining. It just kind of dull and sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A plot that could barely make any impression has a horrible, stupid, yet unintentionally humorous direction. The story is so thin, it appears to be a complete plot, but there is nothing in the plot to even begin a plot. And the direction is so bad, it barely registers in the beginning, but when it becomes too serious at the end, it becomes truly absurd. And it just got so ridiculous that I can't stop laughing. So the plot was terrible, but it has a comedic element to it that works. I laughed out loud, and I found myself looking to the character for directions after being involved in it, and a lot of the humor is just plain bad. A complete lack of any believable direction, and just plain too stupid, for a movie of any length is just about what I'd expect from this movie. I'd rather not spend the time to look at it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can honestly say this film was bad, bad, really bad... I'd like to say this movie has something in it that should have been put on an air network like HBO and the movie would be one of the most terrible movies ever made. The story could easily have been a movie to be played on a board, or maybe an iPhone app. But the actors could not seem to remember how to do it, and the characters who they played were supposed to be acting and the lines they said could be spoken with.  So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, I think it was really just one of a few of the characters. The lead is a guy that's really good and is supposed to have some power, but he can't act. The second one is a girl that's good, but she's a bad. She's a little like an annoying little girl that we can't really see. The third one is an old woman that wants to be in an alliance with the head of the party, but it's not about her being able to keep a job, not about getting her a good job. And finally there's a guy who's an idiot, who thinks he's the best actor. He has a nose and some teeth, but apparently he thinks he can act better than others. And the last character is the head's daughter, who apparently is the best fighter. So, the final question is what exactly the movie has to be? Is it an attempt at satire, or is it a sort of parody? If it's for an old man, it might be more of a satire. If it is for a guy in a punk rock band, it would be an awful comedy.  The story is about the guy's daughter that he's going to meet, and it is about how she's supposed to make her own party at a nightclub called 'Rocky' after her father's party. As the party goes on, the girl starts dancing with another girl. She does nothing. The next morning, a young girl that wears a shirt that looks like the one from the film's character is dancing with the first guy. The old guy's party guest doesn't like the first girl's dancing and thinks the girl is just an embarrassment, but the party guest is actually the most attractive person there. The girl is not willing to dance with the old man because she's too weak, and he's drunk and gets the girl drunk. The movie is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I finally decided to see this movie. When I first saw the title of "The Death of Jack" I didn't know that it was a movie. I only thought that it might be a movie, because I didn`t really care. I mean, you may remember my review of "Dirty Harry" where Harry would be a big, fat, fat dumber. There was an entire plot involving the death of Jack and this movie shows the death and then the resurrection of him. It was all pretty silly and there were many inconsistencies. There are also some very obvious lines and the entire movie is very confusing and doesn't have any interesting plot. I really have to end my review here and warn the next movie out. I don't recommend this movie because it`s not a good movie. It has several flaws and one of them is that Jack is actually dead. He was really good in the movies and not bad in the real one. You should skip this movie if you want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had the misfortune of starring Michael Madrell as the acting partner. He looked very unconcerned about Michael's performance, so I suppose that is why he was so bad. His portrayal of Michael was the weakest in the movie. His performance was simply poor and his acting was worse. I really enjoyed this film, though the film was a bit longer than 10 minutes.  I can't believe the director could even care for the acting. I was looking for something else to rent for this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised by some of the "good" comments posted by people who saw this movie.  I would not normally take this movie as serious, but it certainly isn't worth watching. Most of the jokes in this movie are just awful.  They are supposed to be funny, but they are so poorly constructed that I can't even find anything funny. It's an especially horrible film for kids. I really recommend watching this movie if you're a kid (or an adult). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm surprised that I thought this movie was so good. My mother told me it was so bad that it could be funny and funny and that it should be used as a gag film. It is truly embarrassing to listen to the song and realize that my mother bought it for my own benefit. The movie was not funny or funny. I was never amused with this movie, but it could have been funnier. My sister is also a singer and is a singer, but I could never find out about the song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen several of the same movie and thought the others might appreciate it. I'm not sure how anyone would not view it. There was not one good review about this movie, I don't know why, and was not even sure how some people would enjoy it. It was extremely bad. The dialogs were simply pathetic and most of the acting was so bad it was impossible to sit there and listen to what people were saying. I don a long time to even say that I liked this movie. It just was so weak and so bad. I did some minor research into what this movie was really about and it turns out that the people in the movie were not a representative of any religion. In fact, they were NOT a representative for all religions of any kind, such as Christianity, Judaism, etc. The idea of using Satan in the world was absurd and ridiculous and I believe people would not accept such a thing. In any case, my conclusion was that I didn't really see any interesting or positive thing in this movie whatsoever. The actors did not deliver much of their scenes well. The acting was bad. There were so many bad things that I couldn't even comment on in relation to the characters. I know what they are about, but their portrayal of Satan was simply bad. In the end, I felt it was mostly just an act of desperation and not a movie. The people are just trying to use Satan to get their point of view across and this is what they do.  I think the film would have made more than one good movie. They are not interesting and I don nothing in their film but people might find them enjoyable or interesting. They just to get a quick way to be more annoying. I really feel like it was just a way to get "popular" and people who want to get some attention in the occult world. Just another way to make a few people seem more pathetic than usual. The movie was just an over the top in both execution and enjoyment. If you want to feel something that really has nothing to do with itself, please avoid this movie and find a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just one dimensional and pointless, I think the direction was very poorly. It wasn't funny, nor did it really have a big impact. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really should be a documentary about a documentary of a bad film, but unfortunately this is a very bad documentary, in a really bad way. This documentary is an attempt at glorifying a bad documentary. It's an attempt to make a documentary to glorify a bad piece of film. It should never be made. This is a film made to gloriate bad horror films, and most of it is bad. It also reminds me of another bad film called "Wet Pig". The two films were both directed by the same director, Stephen King.  I am sick of his terrible style, but it really is a shame that a horror film maker is also director of a movie that made a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a very shallow, shallow, very pretentious movie with no real substance whatsoever. It had an excellent, intelligent script and was very disappointing to anyone who actually cared about the story. The acting was laughable, not particularly good at the time. The most annoying person in the movie was George Chaagares, a character actor who had the misfortune of not getting along with the other two great stars of the movie. The other two acting actors were not even good as the two leading actors.  I really think that this film would be overrated in its final installment, as it is now, but at least I won't have to pay for it. The only positive comment I have about this movie is that the plot was interesting. There were some moments in the film that made it interesting to me, but overall this just failed to live up to expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait a while to see this movie. I'm afraid it has now been opened to everyone in the US. The acting has gotten bad over time. Most of the people have to be stuck with the movie because they can't get out of the movie since they are trapped in it. I've seen it now on cable and I found it in one good movie: an average, but forgettable, bland, and lacking in anything that made me feel more intelligent. My only suggestion would be to rent a copy of this movie to a friend or a roommate. I think if you have only seen it in a movie, don't rent it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. I just want to say that it isn't very good and this is a bad, awful movie. I feel like my life was wasted. I'd like to say to everyone who sees this movie.    I would like to give the guy who wrote the script a lot of credit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of "Cops" and its family and this film is even worse. This film's horrible characters. Its really not funny and it's hard to watch. In one scene, it should be obvious that the guy was really a little kid. I think the filmmakers had to watch his own video game and didn't like that. They couldn't even do the real thing!  It has so many bad scenes in it. I wish the movie were some sort of low-budget film where you could watch it and make some funny comments about it. But instead it's a movie where you can't even see the characters and have to see the ridiculous scenes. They're too long and there's no real suspense whatsoever. There's no suspense, you can barely watch this movie. You don't even get to know where the actors are. I know that the director has worked for a few different movie projects but this is one of them. They could do a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this film, I was so depressed. The idea had good moments, the cinematography was good, the acting was OK. But what I really thought, after seeing it, was that it was bad. It was a waste of money and so, I spent all of my time at the movie theater, hoping it would get better. However, it didn't do anything.  It was so bad that I didn't like it, but, it was so disappointing. I'd give it a little while and watch it again, but if I had an hour to spare, it wouldn't be that bad. And if you're a fan of classic films like The Black-Hood, then this is the only movie you'll have ever watched without seeing. It wasn't good and it wasn't interesting, but it just couldn't be used as a plot tool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do like this movie. I was expecting one good film. I didn't care if it was good or bad. I just didn't like the story. This is a bad, terrible excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this supposed to be? A bad movie! I'm a huge fan of 'Lemons' Tearme' movies and there are some of them that are awesome. One, the first one I watched was 'Couch Of Death', because it was just so cool, and I loved those movies. The sequel was... 'Strictly Conferences Of Death'.  'Strigid, True The World' was probably the best of 'Coup Of Death' but 'Lamons' wasn't nearly as good as 'Striid, No Self.' The first one of 'Strato!' was great, although it was somewhat less pretentious. I still think 'Striv' should have been the best one in the franchise. 'Lamp Of Death,' is also a very corny movie and it's made much worse than the others. The same problems arise as 'Lol' and 'Cough Of Death.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to have had some feedback about this movie. But I don't. I'm hoping the other reviewers will give me some feedback. I think that the "plot" is just a facade for a few minutes. The "plot"-story is really nothing.  What the hell is this when the film comes out? It is a remake of a bad film from the late 1980's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who doesn't seem to watch the film, I was shocked that they were actually doing the plot, which could have been something pretty interesting. I was surprised that they showed the two versions of the plot to be different. The film itself looks as though it was one plot, but when it comes to character development, it is just another plot. If you've seen "The Hangmen", this is your first exposure to the book and its characters, which is not worth spending time on.  There is absolutely no plot. The plot is just so bad that it would be laughable to even watch it. It is like watching a movie that has two scenes playing out over each other.  The characters are all pathetic. There's no character development. One character was supposed to be very interesting, like a character in a classic western, and one would have to know him in order to know the true story. The other character, played by a very poorly trained, one-dimensional actor, was so stupid that I nearly gave up. He tried to make a fake speech with no one in sight; I thought I was about halfway there. I have the worst acting in this movie. There is nothing to do. Just pointless, disappointing, and so lame that I can't even tell if there's anything left to say. If people like this movie, I really don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had really expected an excellent film to come out of my own time, but sadly it was something else. The plot was simply awful. It's unbelievable that a writer can even come up with such a plan. It wasn't even in line with the other "Big Story" movies, which is apparently this story. I really laughed out loud at how pointless the dialogue was, and the acting was frankly bad. The acting is the worst I've ever seen. It was so bad that I actually didn't expect to like it. The whole premise is ridiculous. In the end I had to stop watching the whole movie just to get it off my mind, but there's still an element of the film that made me so uncomfortable I didn't want to continue watching. I'm sorry, but if you guys are gonna sit around doing stupid things then I don't have room for anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame-level film this is. I didn't like this movie. It just got all the wrong kind of attitude. The acting was awful, the soundtrack was bad, and there were a lot of pretty bad dialogue and a lot too much of the story line. The whole point of the movie was to have the girl being the hero. That's not to make a hero, but it would have been cool. This movie sucked off a lot more than one movie. There were too many plotlines that had none to be worth a lot and they had no real substance, which made it all just a bad-looking film.  It would probably have made a good film like "Honey Man" or a romantic film about a person that has been hurt by a bad film. But here, the movie is just so bad and there is no place for it in a good movie. I don't even want to see this film. I think this movie is so bad, it makes you feel so much shame when you see it. It sucks, but I can forgive it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say it was never really funny. I just like a funny movie to have a "funny" premise, but it was really awful.  I cannot believe that this guy was a comedian or not just a person who wanted to be a comedian. He never seemed to want to be funny in the first place.  It would be interesting to learn that he was once an aspiring standup comedian.   He just seemed to be annoyed and scared. He just didn't have a great stage personality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very annoyed and I never took the time to watch it again because it was awful. I gave this movie 3/10 out of 10 because I wanted to be able to laugh at the stupidity of it. It was very obvious that this movie was not intended to be funny, and I don't feel like this movie should have been directed to be comedic.  A few days after I watched it I started wanting to watch the next time it comes out. I couldn't even find it in the movie as I had to leave it alone. The film itself was not funny, not in the slightest, and the acting, was poor, with the same tone that has been used by countless American-made movies. A very unpleasant movie. The sequel to the movie was, on the other hand, funnier than the original one, which I find hilarious to watch in the same way, but it did not deliver any funny jokes. It could not be comedically funny. I do believe that if the actors were good, they would have made a better movie, but that could not explain the whole story of the movie. I can see why it worked, but I'm not sure.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie very embarrassing to see and to my friends who are also avid fans of the series that this movie was based on. It's just a very stupid, out of nowhere, way to go with a premise that is not realistic. Even if I watch the film, I would never even think it could be a good film. This movie was so bad that it's even made of a lot of jokes off the fact that the "The Office" is about a fake show about the show's creator (Jim Carver). There were other times I felt that the movie didn't make any sense whatsoever. It seems like it's just taking place behind a fake TV show. I don't know why the producers are trying to make a film about a fictional show. It just seems like the producers think they can't get it anywhere else. I really didn't like the movie very much. If you really like The Office, you might even like it for a while, but the movie never gets past the second act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning of the movie, there were a few little scenes to show that the movie is about a love story between a couple. This was fine, but after half of the story, there wasn't any other plot, it was just a little plot. There was nothing to show the main characters to care about the characters. But this was alright. Even if you liked the main story of the other actors in the movie (Jaden James, Jaden James and Richard Dorsen), the other plot didn't matter too much. The acting was bad, the dialog was horrible and the scenes were weak. I think the director had no idea how to make these movies, just what the characters were really about, and they got worse as the story went on. I mean, these characters were pretty, and their scenes were touching, but not a lot of action.  There is a video of the original film in a link on The Guardian, this is an excellent version, but I'm not really thrilled. If you want to see a movie about a bunch of people who act like an obnoxious jackass, then you'll have to watch this. If I can even get my friends to watch the movie again, I would recommend it to avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. The story is interesting enough. But it is badly acted and the ending could not be even remotely possible. I was going to finish the movie with some money, but I didn't and I didn`t want to and I was sick. There were scenes that seemed to relate to the movie and they were never in fact. The actors were terrible, the whole cast was bad, but most of them had good characters. It is an extremely bad movie.  There are no redeeming qualities. The acting was awful and if you have nothing else to watch this movie then this might be a good movie for you, but for me I recommend watching it and then hoping to have another good movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are just too many bad lines in this movie. I'm really scared that this movie will never come out. What a stupid movie?  The acting is pretty bad. I would love to see a sequel. They could work with the actors. I think that most of the actors in this film don't get on the level of their characters.  The ending is about as bad as an ending to a horrible movie.  A guy walks out and he loses everything. I don't know why people would pay to see this movie, it would be interesting if you actually paid to rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie twice on the internet and I was really disturbed to see it. Even though it looks as if it is an attempt to be funny or to be interesting or to have any redeeming qualities, this movie is a complete waste of money and time. I hope that the producers will one day make something entertaining, but it doesn't seem to be. I'm a little bit sad to have watched this in a bad pub. This is not comedy. It is a joke of a bad joke. It isn't even funny at all, and I don't recommend this movie as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie at all, because I do not see it as a plot of an actual film. Even worse, it is simply an over-the-top excuse to amuse anyone who thinks that it is a real movie. In reality, it's an obvious excuse to make a fake movie about a movie that doesn't really have a plot. What happened with the plot? We found out that no one actually had the courage to actually kill someone. There were also no clues to make the viewer think that there was a plot to murder someone. No clue to what the plot was about. And it should be obvious that the only reason for the plot to kill was the fact that there were people who had to kill someone to make sure it would take place.   The plot is simply a bunch of nonsense; a bunch to take your mind out of the movie; a handful to make fun of, and a bunch that is utterly pointless, because it's not that good.  The movie ends on a cliff huff of self-daze, which would be enough to keep you from laughing.  If you like your brain laughing, this is your choice. But if you don't, it doesn't matter that it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as it came out on the DVD 4. And for many of the viewers, this is the best film since its release. But this movie just has one or two bad parts in it. I'm a huge fan of the original Stargate, and this movie completely misses what it originally had. I would avoid this movie if you are tired of it, and I'm looking at a movie that's even better! Don't waste your money on this crap! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Although this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen on the Disney channel. The story is pretty bad. I can't even remember the line. I really cannot say that the movie is good, but I do think it was very bad. Some of the characters are even pretty cute, but there is one or two them that really should never have been in the picture. The animation seems really terrible, and some of the dialogs and some animation seems bad. This movie is not good to any person. I would not recommend this movie, or if you like it, would buy it off of the cable network, or just throw it in your DVD store. It should not be on your television. This is a Disney Channel movie, not a Disney movie. Disney has been trying to imitate the Disney Channel series for some years now, but they obviously can't do it. I hope Disney can change their mentality of making movies like this. Disney should try to make movies like they used to make Disney Channel videos for their own entertainment. The Disney Channel is about TV movies, not TV episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this film after hearing my friends give me this one. I don't know who it is, but I heard about it from a friend in the other country. I can't say what the people who spoke about this film did mean, but what they do are clear. The only reason I saw this film was because I was bored. I was expecting to watch it again and be bored. But instead, I became bored.  This film is terrible. It's terrible. I'm sure it isn't good, but it should never have been put out. I think it should be put out for a more adult film than children's films. If it is a kids film, it is terrible, but if it is really a children's film, then its not good either. I thought it a complete waste of money. I had to find a good film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a zero rating because I liked it at some time, and also because I found it interesting and interesting to read the book "The Lost World". But it was terrible. I found myself falling in and out of this movie so many times that I decided to rent it and the next time, I chose to rent two copies. I rent one copy of the movie and I rented another copy of "The Magic of Dr. Dragon" because I had all the copies of the book in the back room to make sure my roommate had one copy too. I rented a copy of this bad movie.  I had about two minutes of my life left on my first movie viewing of "Lost World". I had a feeling of how this movie had a chance of success because I was certain it was destined to fail.  What a waste of time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a movie geek, but I have never seen one that is even remotely worth watching. It is just a pity that I have always been a fan of this kind of movie. But the only thing that made it better was the end sequence. This film really was a bad sequel. Even when it wasn't a bad one I felt that it just lacked a meaningful ending. This movie just failed to make me stop laughing at the absurd premise.  I really hope I get some way to say that this movie is so bad that even a video of it for kids will be so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Although it was a decent film, this movie never had the guts to live up to its predecessors. It also fails in the way of its two primary themes (love, revenge, and pain) which were good for it to have. The main story line is about the person who owns the castle they built and is haunted by this ghost. The ghost in the story is an old white guy who is possessed by the ghost of the original ghost.  The plot is very poor, with bad acting and weak twists to make it a boring mess. The whole cast is awful with too many unnecessary characters. I think that this film has been overlooked by the media or the producers and distributors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was nothing wrong. In fact, it's almost no different from the first "Rambiare, and you will find yourself wondering how it's able to replicate all three Rambias.  The first movie I've seen has a lot of stuff in it that wasn't the same at the previous one. Some of the music, the music is good. The animation was terrible, and the characters weren't even remotely interesting.  There aren't even a decent movie. It seemed to be making the assumption that I was going to buy this movie, because I was reading a website or web site. The movie is so boring that I couldn't even finish watching it. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait for a few minutes to see how it actually worked. I'm still angry that it's so bad that it has an ending, and that it contains a really bad ending. It's awful that there are no ending and no plot, and there's no real ending. The story is really not good. This is a very low effort movie to see, and I didn't even care. I wasn't even really bothered by this movie.  It's bad because it's not worth watching, and not worth paying for. It has just one good point, and it doesn't matter. If you're looking for a good movie, then watch this movie as the worst movie you have ever seen. Don't go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not funny, I found it extremely sad to watch this film. It seemed to be so stupid and stupid it must be a mistake, although, there were some moments that were pretty hilarious. I'm not sure how it was intended to be, and I found myself thinking that it was just a joke. I suppose it was for people who had nothing else to do. Of course, most people had nothing to do in this film, I mean I didn't like the whole story, and my fellow actors weren't doing their best. The film seemed to fall flat in my mind after seeing it.  If you like an over-acted and badly acted film, don't get this movie. If you do, I would have no idea how to approach it. It's a little hard to watch it, and you might feel like laughing, but you might also be able to laugh to go along with it. The only problem that I can think of is that it is really scary to watch. I usually don't see the film being scary for a couple of reasons, but I did laugh. It was just awful, and the actors should get better jobs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst acting I have ever seen! The way they are supposed to act and what they do in the scene is unbelievable. How do they decide what to do? You would never expect they have done well to start their career? How are they supposed to be? How do these people in this movie think?  The acting is bad to say the least. I really wanted to see an hour of movies with a decent acting cast. I have seen films that have some good acting, and I have to say that they are not worth paying attention to. I mean, a film will be well acted without the acting but a film without a good actor will also be terrible. The whole movie is a complete waste of money. The only good thing about this movie was that you really got to see some of the other films that were made around this movie. The plot is very bad, and it doesn't make much sense. Some of the actors are good, but the rest don't. I understand a guy can make a good movie, but if you expect a good performance from this movie, you should expect better.  There is no indication that the film is interesting, no indication at all that it has any relevance to the real world. I would never even see a movie that had a lot of content and an interesting plot. The acting was simply bad.  The way the scenes were portrayed were too contrived and unrealistic. I guess there was too much of a plot going on. The people in the film could barely make a decent movie. If I'm asking you to watch this movie and laugh with your friends, I would think you would be a bit surprised. The main plot was simply an excuse to get a lot (in fact, I think too much) of money for the movie.  I'm not going to rate it here, but I want to say one final word about it, because this movie has to be heard to the end. The casting was bad, so don't expect to see anything good or good here. I wish I could give this movie a negative rating about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the film is so bad that I think it's a parody of the "classic" movies (yes I'm a teenager), but that's not even close. The movie has no real plot and no real suspense, nor does it even have any semblance of a plot. A few bits of acting are good but nothing really works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big mistake. I have never seen this movie and I am sure the director would never have the time to do it properly. It was way too long and way too boring. I don't know why a 3.5 star rating has been attached to this movie. That was pretty good for 10 minutes. I wish to hear the director's voice to have some remorse for this failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for half of the time and decided it was an utter waste of time. The story is pretty standard, which is too typical for a Hollywood flick. The only reason I would ever recommend it is for the one-minute film it has to be. However, it's not even a good comedy, and no one would even recognize it as a comedy. I can't find an ending.  I find it difficult to watch, and I also find it sad to see it so quickly. I recommend only one movie: It's only a disappointment for a comedy fan and a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem was that there wasn't one single female character in this film - which is actually quite difficult to get in my mind, considering the number of girls in this movie. I was going to get all the girls into the house on the first night, and I didn't understand how to make a girl act like a girl, and then I gave it up.  I kept hoping to see how the characters reacted in different situations, and when I got to the end, I had to really think of my own actions. This was obviously a bad remake of a terrible horror franchise that has already been so bad. The script didn't make it any better, and the characters were pretty stupid, too. It needs to be put away. It was just like watching a bad soap opera, where it's bad actors doing silly crap. I mean, we got some good ones, and even the actors that were in this were so weak. I don't even know where I am going when I start watching this movie, and it's just not enough to go to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would just like to put this movie on the shelf. It's just a lot of bad stuff. A lot of horrible scenes, horrible acting, a lot more pointless dialog than I thought any of it had. I don't know how anyone would ever even like this movie. I just don't. I'm really scared. There are some nice parts, but there is a lot that don't make up for the bad acting. The story is really bad. I would like it to have some funny jokes. It isn't really funny, but I don "not laugh". I'm not laughing. It was interesting, but if you're really a serious comedian it doesn't have to be funny.  I guess this movie is good for kids, but not for adults. This is so bad it hurts. The plot isn't even interesting, it just is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking at the title for this movie and I thought it was funny. I mean the title and the plot line seemed funny. The acting, however, wasn't. I thought the acting was so bad. It was terrible...I think the whole cast was terrible. I guess it would have been better if this movie had a director who could act. I have seen this movie on the TV show of a bunch of movies of one actor. I didn't want to see one like this movie, I think most people who would expect a movie to be good have an idea of what is happening here. This movie was the worst one I've seen and I just couldn't understand why the movie was so awful. I don't expect to see this movie for the rest of my life, though I still liked the movie.  I'm sorry for the crappy movie, it's time to get rid of this movie. I did enjoy this movie because I thought there was a little bit of amusement. I also liked that the title was a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is badly edited and terrible and has a terrible soundtrack that doesn't fit in a plot. I mean that movie is so bad that I would prefer to see it in a video store. I think there's probably an awful movie called Monster Mice 3. The plot is pretty good, but it's the way it is interpreted that leave the viewer wondering what this movie is about. There are no decent monsters, no special creatures, no creatures that are actually interesting, and this movie fails to make any sense in its story. It's terrible that you can't even see that this movie has any interest whatsoever. I've seen this film once in a movie theater and I didn't enjoy it because it was so bad.    The movie is actually funny and has some good laughs, but when you have it on your television that gets old fast, that's where it usually gets funny.  The soundtrack is really terrible and the sound track is terrible. It can only be considered a comedy, but if you get bored and have an idea for a horror film that works, watch it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in the mood to say that this bad movie has me so lost that I don't care what i have to do with the movie. I have only one suggestion. Bring it on with all your ten, and leave me alone so I can find out what's happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem.  The film was made by a few guys who got madly burned. And so there were no special effects or effects. And they just left those actors in a room to shoot the movie.  There are few scenes that really made me care. The acting was terrible, and the plot was stupid, and all of the plot lines were very weak. If you like watching a movie that contains a lot of bad jokes, but don't care if it ends up being a low budget, don't watch this one.  It is a pretty short movie that is only about 30 minutes, but the acting is bad and the characters are flat.  This movie does have some good parts, but it needs to be a real film to not be an entertainment and an educational piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie for the first time ever. I did not like it. I think the story is totally stupid and the acting is terrible, the ending is stupid and very depressing. I didn't want to watch it again. I tried to watch the film again and then I thought it was the worst movie ever made!!!! The ending is just so stupid!!!! I don't like it! If you like horror movies, please consider watching this movie. I just thought it's just not worth seeing. There is nothing to say, the movie has no substance and the actors really don't know what they are saying. It just keeps you guessing what is happening and really makes you feel like a loser!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A low-budget production company has put this movie together so quickly that you could almost get into an automatic headshot. The story is weak, with a very bland character, and an even worse movie appearance. Even though this has got a good ending, the rest of the movie looks as if it were a series of cheap short films. The soundtrack is weak and the special effects are terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie for one reason I'm not interested in seeing this thing for any reason and then I just watched it, then I've never thought anything of this film to be good. I mean it's not a great film, but it is terrible for anyone who wanted to see this film, I'm sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I tried to watch this film, and sadly I didn't like it. The whole plot seems to be in-keeping with the book, which is a long, hard-hitting, thriller thriller, on the opposite side of a classic thriller. As I said, the storyline is very unbalanced, as it tries to be just for the sake of being a movie. It could have been a film to be put in the top five, and some of the dialogs don't even make sense, the pacing is too slow, and the acting is too bad to be considered good, and overall it's just plain boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone looking for a quick-moving, interesting thriller. It just didn't catch me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad that it is truly shameful. The characters are poorly drawn and don't really move well. I don't know how the hell they are going to have been able to pull that off. How many times did you see that in movies? I'm sure there are lots of movies made which have absolutely nothing to do with this project. They are the kind of films which get worse and get worse! This has got to be some kind of a slap in the face for the director to have made it. I'm sorry, but this was just awful. It needs to be remembered for those who like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to warn you, before reading this page, that this movie is not only bad, but has a deep-roasted-looking style, and is actually kind of "embarrassing".  I would recommend this film to those who like the sort of horror movies that I think the American film industry is getting ready to make. The acting is bad and the camera is not good enough. But I'm looking for something to keep you from falling asleep - and I'm sick of these type of movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a really bad flick. What could have been better than a trash house?  The only people who were positive about it were the actors. The plot had the same kind of twists and turns. The actors were good but terrible. It was terrible on every possible level. It lacked an idea of what it was about.  This is probably the worst film I've seen in over a year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What do you do when you kill somebody else? I'm surprised to say the writer who wrote this film is a well-known writer. He seems to have taken this story to a different degree than he wrote a film which would make the title a bit clearer. He's written a film with a very limited budget and no real plot line.  I don't think the story is bad, but what happened on the show is that they were trying to make it more entertaining, not because it was a very serious crime, but because it made everybody very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this might be an interesting review.  It was really just a horrible movie. Some parts were interesting, but I don't even care. This is a poorly acted movie and is just not worth a second watch. And there's no plot. It's just a really awful movie with no plot and no real story to tell. It should never be a good movie to watch. It wasn't even worth seeing again. I was hoping this one would get more traction with the actors. I didn't know that the director was in trouble after leaving the movie. And it's just sad that he had so little interest in this movie. This movie doesn't come anywhere close to the top of the bad movies that are currently running on Netflix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like it. I thought it was just an excuse for one day in the UK. I know they are trying to be funny, but it just wasn't funny. Even after an hour of film time, the story still wasn't interesting and it still lacked some good dialog. It was very bad on every single aspect of the film. There were no good scenes, the dialog was terrible, and the actors seemed to be bored, not funny at all. I found myself bored after this film, and my reaction was so bad that it gave me nightmares.  I guess you are going to see this film if you want a piece of film that is a complete waste of time and makes you bored. I hope you'll be bored with this movie. I have seen a few of these movies since, and they are so bad they aren't even funny. I'm not trying to make fun out of a bad film; I'm trying to give it the benefit of a laugh, and hopefully get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not only bad, but it is not good. In a matter of two hours I was bored by this movie. I laughed for some of the dialog. It is the worst comedy of all time, and a terrible remake of a bad film made in 1957. If you do not care too much, please don't watch this movie unless you are a serious fan of comic books and movies. Avoid this movie if you can only tolerate one or two jokes. Otherwise, please do not watch it unless you really like the original "Batman" and watch it for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no "sophomore" movies that are even better than this bad movie. The acting is terrible, and the soundtrack isn't even remotely funny. It's hard to believe it's only about a few people who knew each other better than a couple of people who watched this film.  This movie is a poorly constructed plot with no real direction. There are a few interesting bits that do make the movie a more interesting piece than most people's movies. There's not enough time to even find out who the main character is. I know what you want from this movie, and there's a lot of wasted time spent on it.   It does have some good moments. One of them is when they get the little guy who is trying to steal a bottle of milk from the hospital in a couple's kitchen. The guy is actually pretty smart, and looks like he's the type you want to have a drink with. But it turns out that the kid is a little psychopath, so he never gets an opportunity to go off to find the milk. You don't even get the chance to see him and the girl walk together, so you might think about him, but don't. It ends up that he steals a car and takes it with him to the car, where he kills the couple. The next thing you see is a couple who goes in the hospital to get a scan for a kidney. The hospital is on the other side of the hall, and they're at the gate where the main characters get the blood that's in their veins. The two people who go in the room with them are locked in, and go in to get the scan. But when the doctor comes in to scan them, they aren't concerned and give the couple an excuse to go in. The main character gets a "blood test" instead of the blood, and when the couple finally gets to take the blood from their bodies, it's not big enough to make the girl concerned about it. After they get back, they take some time to see the doctor who's there to do the scan, and after the scan it looks to be very expensive, which results in their getting sick. The scene where they do this is pretty silly, so the doctor's going through the test as soon as they get it, because the girl doesn't want to be sick.  The next two or so scenes are very dull, and not very funny. The first scene where we meet the girl and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was bad. The story of the story is a joke. The plot, the setting and the dialog are completely irrelevant. This movie could have been a western film about the western world and a plot of Western world. It should be a western comedy about a cowboy hero who kills people. It could be a sequel to a western action film. It is also not an action film, like the other one I saw. But its comedy is just bad and is even less entertaining than the original. I have watched this film several times but I cannot find a single laugh at any of the parts I've seen. I did like this movie for the humor it was, although I thought the storyline and dialog was really bad. It doesn't help that I liked the characters in the movie and that the characters' dialog was funny. The characters are not funny, just not believable and don't have any life lessons. What's wrong with you, you ask?  The movie was pretty disappointing. I cannot understand why it won a "D" Oscar. I don't think it's really about western humor. It's about a "MILLMADE" movie that is totally unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure that the guy behind the film is OK, but for me it's too hard to keep in touch with his own ego, and I didn't really like the movie anyway. That's all I have to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After much time with the original version of this movie, I'm surprised that the remake didn't happen. What with the horrible acting, and bad camera work? How many years did this get, if they didn't just make this movie?! The original version was just OK. Even though the DVD version was pretty cool. There are some bad scenes, and some lines in the DVD but have some good ones in the sequel, but the story is pretty dull. The way the characters were written isn't very appealing either, and the acting was so bad that they're boring to watch. I don't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst movie I have ever seen, and this is what it does. A film so lacking in suspense, suspense and suspense that it simply makes no sense whatsoever. The plot is so thin and so stupid that it actually could not survive to pass the one hundredth episode.  I really wish I could give it the number of episodes it had been able to get. There is no realistic connection between the characters that are supposed to be their friends and the plot that is supposed to involve them in this film. That is an odd film: It is one big problem I had with this film was that it is so bad, so bad that it makes absolutely no sense, and that it keeps trying to get me to engage in it. This is an action film designed to do nothing, at least what it can do. It's not really a mystery, and there is no suspense, and no suspense. In fact, it just drags on, like most action films that are less suspense.  It is the end of the book that I wanted to read to start a series of novels. However, I was hoping to see some of the books I wanted for this film to see. Otherwise, I might have just wasted my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in the theater and did not like it. I never liked it nor it is it for my children. It was just not enjoyable. I tried to figure out a good way to watch it. By way of making a point, I decided to go into the house and rent it for one afternoon.  I chose to rent it from a rental house called "Eden" because the building was close to a major road and I also lived in a city where there is no other buildings on the block and no train station to return to your home. Because I lived in an area where there were no public transit, and there wasn't even a major station, and I lived there alone. I rented the movie for an hour and then found myself the only thing I wanted was a movie: a bad piece of junk!   But I wasn't about to wait to see the movie because I had an entirely new movie to rent for a week. I had to wait for it to come out.  The only thing was that I could rent it because I liked the movie and the writer was the good writer and that was all I was concerned about.  There was something else about this movie that is worth reading.  It was pretty sad, considering the way the movie could have made it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I heard after watching it, I think it was an incredibly shallow and shallow, but this is not an insult. It just makes me think of how a movie can really be used to be. I feel like it was either a poorly planned, unwielded, and sloppy effort, or something else. I think there is something to be heard here. My biggest issue was the idea that there was an attempt to create a realistic looking world, which is perhaps an attempt at creating a new world. This is one of my very worst reviews ever made, even though I tried to watch it on my video rental and still enjoyed it. My only suggestion to people would be to find another one-minute movie that is as shallow and dull as this one is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of those that's only right for a horror film, just so terrible. It's all too bad to be a horror story. I tried to watch the "Death Zone" on the Internet but was so bored, my ears were shaking and my eyes and eyes were blotted open to watch. That's what it was. I couldn't sit and see more than one minute of the film because there weren't even one or two seconds of it. I wish they had released the original version of "Deathly Cold" but instead I'd just start watching the remake. I didn't want to start a movie about a cold horror film because it's way too long. It was terrible even without "Death Word" for a truly scary horror film. Even though it was well-known, it wasn't scary until it was so incredibly awful that it ruined my life. I won't rent it out again, because that's how much Halloween Halloween movies seem to be, "Cinderella" is still better than "Death World". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some very interesting elements here; but overall I'd rather like to see more films to like it. There is little good that comes out of this movie. This movie is really a complete lack of any interest or interest that I've ever seen in a film before. I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers.  I don't know if the writers were aware of the fact that the film was being shown on TV so I suspect the movie is in fact a complete failure. They could have saved a lot of money by just changing the name of the film. The film is also very slow, so don't buy it if you have a couple of days to spare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it was released, I was disappointed and surprised. I was also concerned at how many of the stars had "come out", and even more when I saw the trailer for this movie. Some of the celebrities in the movie were very nice, and seemed to be enjoying themselves during the film. I don't think I was at all able to appreciate the movie. I believe that this is a very bad movie.  What I'm trying to say is that this movie was poorly crafted, there are a lot of bad actors in this movie, and the plot is weak. Some actors like Richard C. Moore are good, and others are simply average. But none of the cast is good. This movie has one bad-movie element and it has two bad-actor elements that cannot be compared to the previous movies, and there is no redeeming element for the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand this film. I mean this is really a bad film, but I thought that it was interesting. I didn't like the ending and the ending could be hilarious. I can think that it is an interesting film to watch but it is just plain bad. I just couldn't sit through it. The acting was not that good. I thought the story and the dialogue were really poor and the storyline was not good. The movie is just terrible. I give it one 7/10. The whole movie sucked, the whole plot is really bad and the acting really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good ideas in this movie - the "Moto" family - a family that has four kids. Some of the ideas are good, but the movie's really bad - for one reason it's about a family of guys with an "ambassador" called "Prahm", who's the guy who gets to work for the government. For his own, it's obvious how ridiculous his ideas were - the first thing you see is Prahm and a kid who look like his parents. There's also Prahmo's cousin, who looks like an alien - a very weird looking alien. And there's the family of a guy who looks and acts like a kid.  It's still bad - but you have to love some of the "Bunch" movies - the ones that have characters that you want to hate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed it for a little time. However, it didn't go anywhere with the movie. The movie seemed to be about half the length as the last one (not as long as this one). There was just one good scene though I think the movie was an overall dumber piece of acting and acting. The whole thing seemed to suck in the direction of the acting. A couple of very simple scenes in the movie had nothing to do with the story.  This movie should not have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have probably heard all the bad comments already, but if they hadn't I would have known what it was. I don't mind discussing this film as a comedy, but it is painfully slow and predictable and just plain terrible.  There were some good moments (like a brief flashback when the hero was chasing a "killer" from the beginning of the film) but it was also very unsatisfying when they finally found their killer.  I wish this film had been made so that we could have learned from it. I didn't hear any interesting ideas from this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The video and the commentary tracks had all the makings of a good movie. Then, too bad it turns into a bad piece of film at the very least. I had to sit through three hours of it and not watch it again. I was hoping that there would be a better video. However, this was simply a failure. It's not funny, but it's not well produced. There was one truly funny scene after the video was over. It just kept the movie afloat on air for a long time. The voice cast was horrible as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's true that they really didn't get to show the "crazed" thing. But what I think is going on here is that they're showing the whole "caring" life of a country with a bunch of starving people living there. Just imagine this person who's "lives" being chased by cops in a car in the desert area. This is a country that needs jobs, no more money. Maybe the movie companies should have done something to this country. Maybe those people should have got the same health care services that the people in the "Shadings" life had. And in the end I have to say that a movie made by two people who used cars as taxis would not be this crappy but pretty funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After this film comes out, I really believe it was an attempt at an interesting movie. But that just isn't how it really looked. There were no real shots to be seen on the set or anywhere else in the actual shoot. The actors were not acting well, acting for one half of the film, and even a few of the actors didn't do anything at all. I'm not the biggest fan of it, but it really just was bad. There's a couple of good parts in this film, but just don't like the rest of it. I'd be interested in seeing the new release of the movie, but I'd rather be able to see this bad movie if it was released again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was simply an unedication of the fact that this film has very little, very little plot. I can't find the exact title, but it's definitely a 'I'm Not Good With You'. I've seen that film in the 'The Man That Could Be Martin' film series, and I still cannot find the same storyline as this one. The film also suffers from a really poor writing and directing job. I'm not sure if the producers even read the script. It's so bad, I'm probably the only person that has ever seen the original one, so I doubt this film will find its audiences. I had to listen to the movie because it had some interesting bits, like the scene where a character, who seemed to be in an almost totally passive state, decided to kill an inmate who got upset about the movie, and another that seemed to have no clue what was happening in the world that got her into trouble. The actors were all bad. The director could have done better with their talent to get something decent out of this film. The cast was okay, but this film had not developed a cast, and this cast wasn't good for its first-to-second-order casting. It didn't take a long time to get this one out of the lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a really bad plot. You couldn't even remember when it started, which made me want to go to the end and try and get to the part where it was happening and I think that it should have been made longer. It wasn't well edited, and it was obviously a one dimensional story which had nothing to do with the actual plot. The story went on and the end had nothing of the drama which we would have expected. I'm still hoping it isn't the end of a movie, and the way it ends is not appropriate. I'd be interested to see the film on DVD but only if it was at a movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, like "Rudiks" does not represent the true truth of the movie, but in the movie we can see a young boy trying to become a successful fighter and in the beginning the movie portrays him as a weak man, but he's always getting under his own skin (the movie does this so much better).  There is also a little girl who has been raised as a slave in the military camp who looks like a girl, but she doesn't appear in any scenes.  There are also many instances of violence against women who are either men or women who have been raped or abused.  What's even worse is the lack of a storyline. The character of the lead actor, who clearly had a lot of experience at the military, seemed to be more credible and that's why the film was so bad. He wasn't portrayed as the perfect man, because he is simply depicted as weak and a coward.  It was a very disappointing movie, one of the worst films I've seen in my lifetime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you ever want to watch a bad film:  The story centers around a bunch of people who come into conflict as they attempt to get to the root of this conflict. The main focus is that some of the cast is not really able to grasp the story and has problems in a situation that can become life-changing and disastrous. There are a couple of really bad stories, but the story itself could never be good. The characters themselves are stupid and inconsistent. The whole thing turns on its head when they try to make a new movie called  This Movie: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had this movie before, and was disappointed with it. I really liked the idea of the kids being a gang of thugs, but the story ended up boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few of the movie's best points. But the movie ends up being a weak story-line. It should have had more time to run, and then, in the movie, the story should have made some real sense. I had seen it before it was even posted to Amazon, and I would recommend watching this one instead of a sequel.  It was so bad, it just gave me a bad vibe when I watched it. I was in tears from the beginning, and the film seemed to fall under its own weight. The plot is just so thin, there's no emotion and no tension, and it's just like watching a "fake" movie. I felt like I wasn't making sense.  I'm still hoping to see the next two movies out. I hope that a sequel is still up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I thought I could at least give my husband an even lower rating than 2 or maybe 3. But unfortunately I could not find out the movie was that bad.  The movie is so bad that I actually didn't want to watch it.  This movie is really a waste of time that is about 30 minutes in the movie, and I don't care whether I had time to watch again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has bad acting, bad dialogue, and a really bad movie. If you want to see a movie that has a good premise, that's hard to find. The best part about this movie is the part where they all take drugs. Then the ending is completely pointless. It's sad that it would be wastedable to watch. The ending is so stupid and unnecessary.   The movie also features a movie called "The One Last Movie". In it, the characters are so awful that they have more than one life. The characters don't have more realistic stories. The movie is also full of stupid, stupid dialog. This movie is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have to give it 10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was way overrated. I don't even remember the name. If you are trying to watch this movie, you will never like this one. The acting is bad, the story is not worth. I was hoping to see some scenes from the old movies. This is a sad attempt of making money, just to earn money to buy a movie. And don't expect to find a movie with good acting for your money, because you need it for a movie to make you watch. I could never find the words that go with this movie. There is only one scene after the ending, and I did not like it. I am going to see this movie again if it is available. And I would never recommend it to anybody. The casting is bad for the actors. It would be nice to have a cast, because I feel so much for the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this film is nothing more than a rip-off from some of the old MGM films that were made in the early 70's. Even though they were better than some of those films, they still had some of their worse parts. It just feels like a bad piece of work. It wasn't like a major film on the genre but rather more like a bunch of poorly done films that could be just an amateurish film for the sake of making. It's not that the acting was bad or even bad but the scenes were not good enough. The film just seemed to be thrown off by an idea that the film needed to be on a big stage and needed some special effects to make it look fresh. I'd be interested in seeing the movie because I would love to see it, but sadly, it didn't come out as a "real film" so I didn't see it in theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was stupidly made, I think, by the producers. Its very hard to watch, and even the camera is bad. There are little to no surprises, and they could have done a better job making this one, even if they were to make this one. They didn't use any special effects to make the plot real, and that is what kills it. I think they could just make a much better film. But it wasn't a good movie anyway. Its just that the characters were too stupid, and I am sure that they would have done much better to stick to their characters. And when they do stick to them, they could probably do a better movie. But they weren't good in a script, and most of the jokes were stupid. The dialog was poor, too. Its really hard to believe, it was just as bad as I remembered it. Its so stupid, that even though its a show about a TV show, it really could just be made a horror movie. I guess, I'll never get this movie out again. Its a bad excuse for a show of a bad TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not good. Some good scenes are put together, but that's not enough for a mediocre movie. There's nothing at all. This film is a disappointment. I gave it a 7 because the story was good, but it could not handle character development. I didn't like the characters. It had a bad director who was supposed to be good. The plot was poor, and the story line could never be developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband's a fan of the TV show and was happy with it. We got a copy of it, and we saw it again about 10 minutes ago. As I was opening the movie, my husband was asking me, "Is it OK?" and I'm telling him "Yes, the movie is bad but the acting is good" in a matter of desperation. The story is not a good one for a family film. It's really a bad, but I don't have to watch it over and over again. I want to know if they can bring a good movie out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two things I can say about this movie. First was the acting and the acting. In the previous review I said that the acting is not good. That was my point. In this movie the acting was very poor, so bad that the whole story felt incomplete. My only point is that the ending was stupid. But I would have to say this is not a true horror film. I do not know how to describe a horror film as it is, but I think that you want to go into a movie and say it's a horror movie.  And even worse, the acting? This movie was just horrible. You can hear screams and even a little voice is enough to make you sick. I was also wondering if the director had any idea about what he was doing, as if he was trying to create a horror of some sort. But in my opinion, he had. I know that he is not the first person to make a horror show. He was one of many people in the film industry that were trying to make this film. He knows that he could not produce a horror to the standard of a horror, but he could produce a good movie. If it was some kind of a fantasy, that is OK. You need to know if it is a horror game, and if it isn't, you should expect it to be a good game.  This movie does NOT fit into any genre. It doesn't really seem like a horror. I mean that I was interested, but it really is NOT a horror! If it were a horror story, the film would have had a better ending.  There were several problems with this movie, but the director (Gali Tilden) couldn't seem to know what he had done with it. I really wish I could have seen more of the film. The ending was not well directed and the plot didn't seem real. I think this was an effort to make an honest film. Even worse, I know it is just a bad film. If you really want something to laugh about, you could do much worse by watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very badly done. There are two or three things I've noticed while watching it. The first was that it seemed to take a long time to get this film out. The second was that I thought the film was way too serious - and I wanted to see it for the film. The third was that the script seemed to go to the end of the end and it's hard to see the direction of this film. Lastly, I have to wonder why the director and producer are allowed to be there. It seems like they are the two people on the production team and the people on "Nixon" who's directing the script. There's too many things to get into, and there should be a rule of thumb that if you want to direct and direct a movie, you shouldn't want to make it. They just get thrown off. That's probably why I was so angry with this movie. I'd definitely recommend it for people to get away from it. I just don't think this was a good film and I don't expect it to get any good rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie made me laugh out. And I hate this movie. I have never seen anything like this. They make the story a waste. They don't follow the plot.  I cannot stand to say that I enjoyed this movie because it was bad. And the soundtrack sucked. It was the soundtrack from the movie that was in my mind and not the movie's soundtrack.  There is no music and no soundtrack. This is the same thing as a horrible movie: a movie with a bad director, horrible plot, horrible soundtrack, bad acting and bad acting, bad editing and bad editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i had to like this movie so I bought it on video tape... I'd like to see if it could go out for the kids who didn't even have a car... it is terrible! I mean, I am sure it is a good movie for older teenagers, but I think it would be better if it were older.  There is no plot! no plot. There are a few minor character movements. There's really nothing else to this movie except horrible acting and poor acting.  It could be funnier. I know, there's a few guys who like this kind of movies and have it in their bios... but their acting is about as bad as this movie.  If you have any doubts about how bad this movie is, watch for a few days, and if you cannot answer, then you should consider watching the next 10 minutes of the TV series "The Incredible Adventures of Superman". It's probably a lot better than this movie because it is about a "drama", a "comedic" drama, where the other actors and the scriptwriters work their hearts to get their own back.   I think that after reading this book, you will understand why this movie isn't worth picking up. It's just as terrible as "Dinosaur Rex", which is the best movie this book ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie from the beginning and ended up liking it. I was looking for a movie with the title and storyline so I thought it would be a good choice to see if one actually wanted to see a movie from this movie. However, I was put in the category of a "ghetto film" instead of a movie that was interesting. I also had difficulty understanding the way the movie would have played out. There were no mention of race and ethnicity in the movie and it made me think this movie would not make much difference. It just seemed like a "movie" about "Black American women" and the storyline sounded like the kind of movie you'd want to see from the ghetto ghetto. But once I saw it, I thought there was an attempt at bringing out the same racist stereotype that the film had been presented to the ghetto but I had to resist the pressure to say, "OK, I don't care what you guys do. What do I think the people in the ghetto do?"  I've been to many other ghetto movies and there is a common theme about Black women trying to bring out the movie from a ghetto. A few people say that it is true and others say that they have no right to be there. I disagree.   There is no real interest in the film but I was never one to watch this movie and just never expected it to be like the ones I saw. It seemed like I was just trying to watch some gang of gangsters and to laugh at the fact that we would find ourselves so desperate to bring the movie to the world and to get the movie out.  I also didn't know what was going to happen at the end. I have never seen the end and I did not see the end before the movie so I could not gauge what happened to those characters. I did my best to get myself and I guess it seemed like this whole thing was over. The movie ended up being about the gang of men who had been murdered by a racist and his wife.  Even after my search through a few other ghetto films I found the same message about the murders that seemed to be a bad idea to make. There is absolutely no way for it to happen.  As a result, I can't understand why anyone would actually care for the film. It is no way to know if a movie would actually be a very good movie but I couldn't see any value in the ending. The film ended up leaving me feeling depressed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm appalled by this garbage. I mean it was just bad. It wasn't funny, it wasn't even cute, it was awful. This movie doesn't even have any decent plot, it just screams at every moment to get annoying and I find myself going through it, never getting a sense of any character's depth or depth, never really believing that the guy who made this is capable of such a performance, let alone a plot. And it is pretty long, it's so long, I think most people in their late 20's. I think the movie was about an hour but only one third of that in a two hour long movie and even the best in the short time. It just falls apart within three episodes. I just don't see anyone interested in this crap. This is not good for anyone who has an interest in acting, which could get them into a really good movie, it really should have been shorter. You're not a film buff, you're just a person who has a interest in a story and can't be bothered by the plot.  If you want to see a short movie about a film about a story that is bad, you'll have to do it for the price of a ticket, or if you want, see another film that is about a movie that has a decent story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was shocked at the decision to make this one and only two or three films. I am also amazed that the filmmakers can only stand to the script and the acting talent to finish this wretched piece of work. I don't know why these guys are so obsessed with making movies about nothing or even one of their own movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have the movie on my shelf, and it has nothing to show us, and I would like to know what it has to show. The main story, for anyone who is a bit lost, is about how a movie that is so far from any Hollywood version and has no plot, a plot is not shown in any of the films, and people who are not familiar with the history of this movie will think that the only version to have been made is the one that has this movie.  As with all the other versions I've seen, the first three versions of this story are fairly simplistic, so it must be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of a movie is an interesting premise, but really the execution of it is bad. For a horror movie, I usually take the direction of the character through the story. This movie doesn't follow that path. The movie just throws character out of a room and shows the events that happen then. I really need to go back to the beginning of the movie and check out the beginning. There was no explanation for why the hell she's about to die. There wasn't enough info on the character, not even a glimpse of her parents or family.  And the only thing worse than that, is that the movie was way too confusing. And when I finally got to the point I wanted to see more of the story than just one movie.  The movie was about a bunch of people who were dead because they thought they were being tortured by a demon. The first scene is the main character is a demon, and they decide to take over their victims so that they can go through with the demons. It starts off by showing a demonic person and a demon who is in another dimension (like an oven). The demon makes a human and it's friend (whose name is "Wakey") come to his room and they just go through a wall and then they get attacked by demons. And there is an evil demon who comes into the house and they get killed and put on the cross. In the beginning, the demon's name is Kariya. His name is Hush. We find out that the demon in the beginning is called the "Hagia". They start out in their home and they're thrown off of the cross after being killed by a fire demon. There is no explanation why the demon dies and the demon who kills Hush and starts off a different character in the next movie. The next character is killed by demons, but before they're killed by the demon, they can't really be killed, they just get killed. A couple of times they get out of their death and have to get rid of the demons, so they decide that it's better to kill the demon so that it doesn't cause any more demons to come to the house. As the film goes on, the people who are killed by Hush go and get attacked in another area. They get knocked out by demons and then get to the demon of the same city that Hush was in. This is the demon that's father, and the way that demon's demon who's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I understand what was wrong to post about the movie. What a shame it must be to everyone who voted for this movie, to me, it was probably a very big, possibly more complicated, and possibly worse movie.  And it seems it is a very slow, not quite light movie to watch. The story is not good, the characters are not good (except for some very, very, interesting ones), and there is a lack of a solid ending. The idea seems to be a mix of fantasy and reality, or even worse, a mix between reality and fantasy, like "Big Brother" and "Black Mirror". The "The Matrix" is not very realistic either of course, because like the "Twilight Zone", it seems to focus on fantasy and on reality; like "X", it focuses on an extremely stupid, cruel, mind control inducing plot. "The War Room" may have been a better movie, but there is no better movie. "A Thing" is just a bad comedy movie; a terrible excuse for a few of the people who liked the movie because it was "too funny".  If you like to be the top of your class in the world, this movie is not a good movie. It will make your name look very,very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this supposed to be? Well, I can guess that it's been done just to be funny. I am not entirely sure about this. The story is just a joke. The dialog isn't funny, though it's alright to listen to. I really did think that it was cute when it was at least tolerable to listen. And I did not understand why the "chick" in the "joke" scene. Even though it is OK to listen too much and laugh too loud, there really should not be a "kissing scene". What makes the movie bad is the fact that the "kiss" scene is not a funny scene. I believe that the two men are making fun of the whole thing, and the fact they are kissing. I've never seen a movie before or since, but that is the way the "scene" is presented. Even if it were not in a comedic film, I would think that the whole scene should have been given the idea to try to make it funny. If this was a comedy movie, it would be a hilarious piece of work, but, as a comedy, it really was just a really bad movie. I would have to give it a very low rating, even in comparison to some of the other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film two weeks after my brother's birthday. I was surprised that the producers of the film were using all the best-known actresses. They were using their best-to-use actors on their film. Even if I'm not a movie buff, it's obvious that these actors are not good actors. They are using cheap acting to look good, and their acting is not good. They're using a very, very weak, well-worn-looking set for their film, and they don't seem to know how to use any of the actors in their film to get more "real".  I hope this movie will soon break down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely bad. What it did was cute. It is terrible, and I thought it was just a little too serious. It wasn't funny, and the acting was awful, and it was very slow and depressing to watch. I have only two words to describe this movie: It is just boring. The only one that I liked was James James Bond in "Casco," but that was in a really serious way. I'm not going to recommend this movie, because it is absolutely horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to be excited with this "adversary", but I'm the last one to see it. As much as I was looking at this film, it didn't give me much to expect. As with all of the "dramas", I was only curious about what was in this movie.  What was in the movie? We all know a good movie: a girl, her family, and her friends get in a car accident. We find out that the family's wife has a bad temper and it turns out to be a major problem.  I find out later on that the wife is on the hospital and the wife's friends come to the hospital to make sure the daughter is OK. It turns out that both the wife and daughter are sick and the kids were involved in an accident and they just leave the hospital. And a boy who's a bit sad to be at the hospital but who's really in a good mood is just sad.  So, after seeing it, I was still interested, but by the time the movie was finished, I would have expected something better. If you're looking for a good "drama", this is not one of the worst "darlings", but it could have been much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is disappointing that such a poor movie was made. Of course, there is some really good moments, and it has some good camera work. But it's very hard to watch these parts. The acting is poor, and the dialogue is really terrible, even for a family film. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, but I wouldn get bored waiting for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty, I have never met anyone in the name of Joe Tung, or any of the other "Busted Out" protagonists. But that doesn't mean that they won this movie. Not one of them in the movie and none of the others in the cast is particularly interesting.  The lead actor was really a weak performer, as he was never really in the mix. He was a total loser with a very low-key charisma.   The other actors in the film aren't particularly good. Just the other actors are good enough, although it wasn't too much of a disappointment to see him go through so many problems.  All in all, the film was an obvious bad-movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise, with the familiar premise, has been done so well before that it's just bad. We're given the usual clumsiness, and I think it's the worst film I've seen in years, it's not funny at all and it looks as if it's a bad parody of "Strictly Rhythm" and it's got a bad name to stick on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In all this video (and the only video I have seen) I'm afraid to have missed more.  The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, the soundtrack is bad and the story is very poor. I don't recommend this film but I highly recommend watching something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a total rip off of a 'The Perfect Drug' that's basically a remake of the original, and that's bad in itself.  This movie is full of obvious, un-watched, out-the-front, but possibly 'funny' dialog. It should be better than an 'American Beauty' flick, and even less like a 'Naughty Maid' movie. It is pretty easy to find out and laugh at the stupid stuff, but I was left for many of the dialog. I found myself laughing out loud while reading the last line, which I did at the time.  All of the 'dressed' women were annoying, and the dialogue was so bad that I didn't even think it was funny, much less like 'Nicky' Maid. The lead actress was obviously a former soap actress, and not good for a big time-gudner. However, that may not be enough to keep me from laughing and laughing, as I found out the last time. And for those that found 'Nasty Maid' hilarious, that is enough for the 'Nubby' Maid series. I'm not sure what kind of a comedy it is, but you just have to find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie sucked off my mind but I found it so interesting and I thought that there was at least some good story behind the whole thing. This movie was really a disappointing thing to watch. The story is pretty corny and pretentious and it's not even good for the teen actors. I couldn't tell what was happening in the film. I would definitely not recommend this movie because it is about teen actors acting like teenagers and teenagers acting like idiots. The acting was pretty good but I couldn not tell what the heck they were really thinking. If you want to see a really good teen drama, give this one a try, but it's just so bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an embarrassment to most people who had an idea of what they saw on the show and thought they could have a little respect for each other. It starts with a bad story about the first night of their friendship. But once it is in front of the camera it is a complete embarrassment. There are no plot development, no decent characters, no direction, no sense of what the main characters are about or what they're up to, no character development and no comedy in sight. All of it has just been recycled for the sake of making a few bucks.  The movie starts off with a scene in the hotel that we all know is bad and not funny. When the characters are all hanging around waiting for their chance to break up with the other guys, this is a comedy that seems to have some plot in it, and then becomes a drama that has nothing to say. The plot is very weak. Also, none of the actors really show any ability to really get laughs. The actors are mostly boring.  I can only recommend this film for its low budget, though, it would be better if the film had a few laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Van" was the worst film ever I've seen in my lifetime. It was like an angry clown. The only funny person is the actress, but the movie is so bad that it's hard to understand the film. The ending is bad, and I wish this movie was made in the 70s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a big disappointment. I never want to watch another stupid movie again. I am a big fan of a series and this movie was not one of my favorites. I just wonder how the hell the director could come up with such a bad version of his series. I have to say, "The series is fantastic! I'm an avid fans of every series!". In the future I'll enjoy it a little bit more but after watching it, I just can't think straight about it. The series is about a man who is in love with another woman. In a perfect world, the woman was nice, and a woman like that man was able to enjoy being in love, and all the things they do in their relationships. That's the best world I've ever heard. But in this world, men are treated as an object, or even as an extension of the male hero. The female hero is the male version of that hero. They have neither the same qualities, nor do they behave like a female, a male hero has no love, or anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the second season of The One True Thing. There was more interesting parts of that show and I found myself wondering if I had missed any part of it. The film starts with a montage of the characters (with the exception of the "Wookie," who appears in a few minutes after the beginning of the film), and they are treated in the same manner as the rest of the series. But then we find out what's left out of it... and the plot ends in the next scene...  It does not work. This is a short-lived sequel. A few scenes that are just wasted space, but most of the material that was used in the first series is reused for the sequel. And I don't feel any good if I saw the first show, even if it wasn't a "second" episode.  But, the worst part of the sequel is the ending.  I just cannot find any good comment about this movie, even though it was very interesting, for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely worthless and I am surprised that I did not even care about it, and my girlfriend is absolutely tickled that this is the worst film I have ever seen. The main problem is that the filmmakers were so terrible. The dialogue is horrible, it is very contrived and there is no dialogue whatsoever. This film has got nothing going on. I am also surprised that there are only 2 stars at the end. I give this film a negative rating because it is so shallow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in theaters on video with friends last weekend and I'm going to give it a bad review now. I know how much of the film has been wasted, I'll give it 2 out of 10. The plot is about the hero's life and the love interest of the hero. It was a very boring film with a terribly awful ending.  The acting is terrible, the dialog is awful, the plot is not very interesting. If you liked the first time, then this would be a perfect example of a waste of time to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't as good as some of the films in the 70's. They weren't too bright. They were kind of lame. They had some good shots, but that wasn't what that movie has.  The acting was bad, too. It was just pathetic. I don't know why I thought they were going to make this one.  In any case I can't comment on the other movies they made. Some good ones, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a HUGE fan of the 90's comic series, but this movie does not. I mean it was good, but...  It was really bad! The story is so weak and the acting is so awful that I can barely even get a decent review. If you like your comic series and like the funny characters, you will most likely like this movie but not if you like the stupid story. I also feel that this movie would be better if it had a little twist. The first scene of the movie is stupid enough to make me want to punch this guy. I get the feeling of betrayal when the guy goes off the roof, and the movie starts with a man saying, "I'm going to sleep, and he's in the house with a guy who is not in this movie.  There is no way to save this movie... the characters all look stupid, and so far, the actors look stupid as well. Some of the actors were interesting though, like I'm just about to say the movie had a really good casting and it wasn't a huge disappointment because the actors had some of good acting. If I could find this movie out for sale, I would say "get it back and buy it."   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are only 3 or 4 good points to this movie: 1. That the movie is supposed to be a thriller, and so therefore not really a realistic movie. 2. The special effects in the film are pretty unrealistic, and the special effects were much less realistic in the original "Die Hard". 3. The acting is pretty poor, and not well acted. 4. The dialog is fairly realistic, but there are some weak jokes, such as when the character's girlfriend tells the character that "we can't see her anymore.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the most disappointing movie ever I've ever seen. It looks and sounds like a porn flick, but I'm a fan of those kind of films. I usually like a good movie, so this one is the worst I've read. I've come to know the best kind of porn stars are ones who do not make movies. They're boring, so the sex scenes are the least interesting and the best porn stars don't have to keep making. I'm not interested in anything they do in life, and the actors are a bunch of uninteresting teenagers. I don't understand why they made this movie. It's like a stupid, self-centered movie where there's nothing to do. I get bored watching porn stars like those. This movie is an attempt to scare away the people who would like it. If you want to see a porn film like this, you'll find another one.  I think the producer is in a lot of trouble. He can't guarantee there won't be any more films. The film looks like a bad porn flick because there are no female characters, and there are too many things in the movie that keep repeating themselves over and over again. Some people, like the lead actor, have problems with the actors, like acting, and seem to always get bored after watching the movie. Also, the movie feels as if the producers aren't making enough money off of it. It needs to be a long movie. There needs to take a couple of months to make a movie like that, and it needs to keep going for over 20 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a horror film, you will be disappointed. However, if you want something that goes far beyond the norm, you might enjoy this movie. In my opinion this film doesn't provide one worthy ending for a horror movie. The film is an insult of every horror genre to the best of their genre. I honestly would prefer my friends would just laugh, and not watch it. This film is not worth 4/10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, though interesting, is somewhat predictable and predictable, and the dialog is very poor. And I guess it's about time to start making sense of these actors. But I suppose there's hope for a lot of great work, even though it's a dud.   It's basically a typical horror film, but I'm surprised that such a bad premise couldn't have anything to say, that much. The horror genre is often very predictable, but it's more limited than today's. And you might be tempted to watch it if you liked Saw or Cabin Fever, but even if you don't, it's still a bad film and a really lousy movie.  The film itself seems to be a mix of "Wincast" horror movies (like Jack's Revenge) and the more obvious "blood movie" type horror films. It doesn't have much in the way of gore or gore, and in the end you just kind of think of it as a horror movie, but don't feel anything. You get a good feeling by seeing Jack, but the final few minutes are not good, and you get the feeling that you've wasted time on a movie. The plot seems to have been thrown in to keep the suspense moving but not much has happened and there's no real suspense in the last half of the film. There's a few interesting characters, but they're not really developed, and I think the movie suffers from the lack of chemistry between the actors.  Also, the ending is a bit predictable, even in the final scene, because it has a fairly obvious twist ending. There were several clues. The film starts out with an almost unbelievable scene in the first act. I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen when it played out. I think it was supposed to be about a blood-covered family on the verge of an apocalypse, but you can't figure out how that could be explained. The scene in question, which seems to finally tie it all together and is oddly gratifying, and is the last thing you see in the film, at least 4/5 times out of 10.  After all of those thoughts, I was just waiting to be tired of it.  Overall, I think its a bad horror film with just too many problems. And even the acting is not good either, I found it a bit sad in the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i was a little bit curious to see this film after seeing it on the netflix. I can't blame the movie for making such a low budget. I was surprised by how poorly it worked. I mean, it is supposed to be an action film. There is a good actor in this film. But the lead actor is pretty stupid and nothing was much interesting. The acting was very bad, I mean there is no emotion at all. I found the best part of the movie was when the lead was talking with the characters and making a movie. It had absolutely no emotion and even though the acting was okay, it all seemed pointless.  I was annoyed at the movie because I wanted to write positive review about it, but the movie had no real substance, it was boring. I wanted it to be more interesting to watch because there was a more interesting character in the film. I did get to know a couple of characters better, but it just didn't work. It's sad really considering the movie is supposed "for children". I just gave it a good rating because it was funny at times. i hate it because it didn't do well at all, but there were some scenes that were funny. I didn't like it but it was okay at times, just like most of most action films.  The film wasn't much interesting, but i'm sure it has to be seen by only the hardcore fans of horror films. A lot of the scenes seemed to be pretty predictable and good. The music was bad though. I think it was also a huge mistake. I expected something more from the film and it wasn't enjoyable.  It's absolutely not worth seeing again though. Avoid it at all costs if you have an IQ that goes above normal. And don't watch if you want to hear something interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some of the movie when watching it on the HBO channel because it was an interesting film. I do not understand why people would watch it and then take the time to review it. They didn't get any amusement from it.  I had to laugh and cringe, especially when it was revealed that the main villain of the film was a fake name. It was really pathetic!  It was an effort to make something that was boring to the point that I could never enjoy it. There was no humor in it and the ending is just plain, not funny. I really didn't like it and I couldn't even hear what it was saying.  It is really disappointing. I mean, the movie itself was good. I did like it, just not in a "fun way". I was looking for it, but for me, it was just pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I would have done better than what I was looking at, I didn't.  I'd like to see something in a film that actually made it better. They don't seem to know what they're supposed to be, and they're too stupid, too long, too bad to be good, and that's all bad for the film. I don't want to watch this again, but it was good watching a movie. I just don't think I had a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you read my reviews, I have to warn you.  In general, this film is not worth watching, but if you really want to see something more like that film then you will have to do so. This movie is so stupid that they won't even be able to explain what it was to the audience. This is a terrible film with a very bad, stupid director. The film is so lame and incoherent that it's hard to make sense out of it. I do recommend checking out the trailer for the first thing, but otherwise, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I think I have never been surprised by this movie... It's one of the worst I have ever seen. I'm not going to waste my time describing it, the basic premise is stupid, the direction is bad, and it just gets worse.  The fact that this film is about a major movie that doesn't have a major subplot isn't the cause of the bad movie. It's because the subplot is entirely missing.  This film is one of three things that are about bad and can't be good. The other two are really bad... they are, in order, bad things.  I do appreciate that it's an effort to tell a positive review about bad movies: "The Last Picture" is, as is, good.  It was the sort of effort that didn't work, like those movies like "The Matrix" that only made me feel like I was dying to see more movies.  So, here's a movie review:  Well this movie is really bad for all the things I've commented about in the video: stupid, stupid, and stupid and stupid...  "The First Mate" is a film that could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointing movie.  I am going to go ahead and give the plot a chance, but I am having difficulties with even getting through my first hour. In other words, I cannot even sit and watch the whole thing, and that is too bad to be taken seriously. I know this movie is bad and terrible, but at least it had some funny moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not even made a film with that much of the film in my mind. In the first hour I was bored and I tried to find some time to go watch this movie, only because it was something I had seen before.  In the beginning I thought it was really pretty good. But then the plot was stupid. I think that was the main reason that the movie was so bad, even though I would give it an honest review. I understand that this movie is bad because it makes you want to watch it, and that is not the reason that it is good, although it is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible film with a terrible budget, terrible soundtrack, bad acting, and a completely unedictable plot. The ending is the worst. There's little plot and characters get killed off pretty quick, all because a character says she wants to see her dead father. A sad movie isn't that bad for a bad budget and a bad cast, but it is still an awful film. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been five years since I saw this film. I watched it because it was very poorly acted, which I found annoying. I still cannot believe that director Stephen N. Eisenman can do something like this, so I hope he dies. I've heard that the director has been sick for a few years, and probably is suffering from depression, so he may need to leave the job. He should never work again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film on the video store shelf, I knew that I'd never watched a movie like this, but I was expecting. I'd just watch it, and my expectations were completely dashed. I guess I was just one of many who hadn't seen this bad film. I give the title "Fiasco", because I have to make it clear to anyone who's unfamiliar with "The Good Guys Have Nothing to Lose" and don't mind.  I gave this film a rating of about 5. As one of the most disappointing films I've seen, this film should never have been released. My expectations of a "real film" are so low as I didn't have to wait to watch it before the DVD was released. But I did wait and buy the DVD, so I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have any idea why they made this movie. I mean, what did the producers do with this project? I suppose they didn't intend to follow the book and book series's interpretation of "The Odyssey". What was the idea? They were trying to create a sequel to the novel to be released in 1999, and after reading the book series in order, they decided to follow that path and re-imitate this book, even though, in fact, it wasn't to be a sequel. They have simply adopted the same plot line that they'd used in their novel to "come out in 1999". It has no clue how to follow this book and this movie as it is, so you're left with two choices. One of them is the one I think I really liked a great movie: "The Death Wish" which is one of the books that the author was writing before he wrote this book. There are very few characters who even think the book is about the characters of the book, and the movie doesn't try to focus on them in a meaningful way.  This movie really comes off as the worst one of all the novels since the book trilogy was published, although, as I said, it is very entertaining to watch. I also note that the writer was in a very unprofessional fashion making a movie out of the novel and tried to follow it line-wise, while the actors in the film are completely out of his intention. However, the whole story is completely unbalanced and fails to follow up with the book.  In addition, the casting director for "The Search" was very disappointing, despite the fact that this movie would be directed, not without a casting director, for which he could have been hired to work.  Also, the movie starts with the line where the two guys are looking for a big ship, and they land on it, only to find that the ship had crashed and everyone was dead. This is completely contrived. They're on the same ship.  Now, a new story begins. There is the story about the captain of the ship named "The Fear Of God" (John Carter) and his friend. But you know nothing about it, and if you are reading this book series, you don't know who it is. What is that supposed to make you angry?  Once again, the "story" is weak, and there are no motivation to follow through. There's no plot, no motive, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is pretty good. In my opinion, this movie made an awful movie. There were some things that were annoying, like the ending, for example, and the casting of the lead, but it was okay. The plot was very weak, and there were few plot twists, like a very predictable and predictable ending. I thought that the actress, Amanda Baker, was the best actor of the movie, but her acting skills were too weak. The story was very disappointing, there were only one decent scene. The movie was too boring, especially the ending and the soundtrack was awful.  The movie doesn't even make sense for a movie to be in this category. I'm not even sure I've ever seen the show before. It was just not funny, not funny at all, and not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised at how many reviewers in all reviews thought this movie would be a fun film. They seemed to think it would be one of those "fun" films you watch, like "Beauty Fair". That's not a bad film in my opinion, but it didn't really do the movie well.  But what they saw in this movie is true. I didn't see the "theme" behind the movie. It was a piece of junk, and I can't even say I liked it, nor did I believe it would have anything to offer the viewer any ideas or insight on the world.  The story is basically a short comedy that seems to take place in a world somewhere far off. It starts with some very bad lines about an evil man, and soon begins to a chase and pursuit of a girl named Lady Louise, who turns out to be an orphaned alien hunter.  Her animal sense, her powers to help her friends, her friendship with her friends and her friends' friendship with others are all completely worthless, and the viewer sees nothing beyond the main storyline. I guess the reason this movie made the reviews was that it seemed to be a comedy that actually had nothing to do with the world and the future. The main storyline has to happen, and that is a fact. But it becomes so obvious that you're left wondering if the main character was really evil or not, or if it really happened before. By the end of the movie it's so disappointing that the viewer feels like a piece that is just a bad piece of "fun".  Also, I don't think this movie has any redeeming features. I mean nothing about the characters. Just what the main characters want and how it plays out is in this crappy piece of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director was so incompetent as a child actor that he had only to be funny to be able to get the respect that has been earned by some of the actors. This is in no way worse than the films they like to make. This one has to be so bad in the way the acting seems to have been left to the world as a mere, meaningless and pointless drama. This movie was so bad that, for a few hours, it seemed like a really good film - there was no way in the world that this was actually a good film. There was absolutely no one person involved in this film, nothing to show us anything about the characters. The movie itself was so pointless, I wish I had to see it again so that I could get rid of it. The film was so ridiculously awful that I couldn't even finish it - and that has proved to be the best feature of any of the films made by the U.S. Postal Service Film Department. The message is bad, the acting is bad and the plot is so awful, no excuse, no need.  The U.C. films released during the 1960's is a mixture of satire, jest, and farcadent filmmaking that just doesn't seem to have any value whatsoever. They make up for the fact that the postal service film is so good by not making up for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very sad for this movie to be released, the story line and the plot were awful. I think there is some very interesting things in this movie, but it was not really a film that I would watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie! I'd never thought that this movie was that bad, but I'm pretty sure it is. The story is boring, and the characters are stupid. The characters are pretty stupid and the acting is bad, especially the dialog. It has a couple of good elements, but it still needs to be a sequel to something. The bad acting is still better than the crap in the movie, but overall, this movie is not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is completely unbalanced. It could be an interesting study in the evolution of modern sexual politics. But it was a horrible movie to watch and to be able to watch. The women, like the film itself, were simply bad.  There are no suspense. The dialog was stupid, and the plot wasn't even realistic. It made me sick to watch the women act. The film does not even have a plot. The ending is also bad, even with the fact that there is a live-camera show in the future. There were also other problems such as how the actors act. In the final sentence I rated this movie as 1/4 (the worst) on my list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not the best looking film of this year. It is an incredibly boring film, the main characters are very flat and flat, there is no real character development at all, but the acting is ok. I wish it didn't have any plot, which is what it was lacking. It should have been a thriller, it should have some funny lines in it so that it would have some appeal. But it is terrible for it to be a comedy, and not funny at all. The characters are so, so unfunny, that you would be left wondering if they actually have feelings or even like each other characters. I am sad for the fact that they wanted this to be "fun". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen, ever, but I didn't mind its plot. I was upset at the ending. The storyline is very, very bad. There are lots of things in the movie that you need to have in a horror movie, like the blood, or the body horror of a serial killer. The movie is simply a bunch of guys in a small town. A guy who wants to make his way to a big city to get a job with a big salary, a place where he can rent apartments and live for years. He gets knocked out and then tries to find his way back to the big city but he ends up falling into a pit with some girls who tried to steal from him. A few people are killed in the pit but before they get caught, the next morning a guy gets off the elevator and starts killing people and gets away with the money. He's able to hide in a ditch to hide the victims but nobody else is able to get hold of him, so there is no way to prevent him from getting away and the victims get away.  This movie wasn't even made to be a horror film! You would have to buy the movie from a tape recorder store to listen to it. No one can understand a horror with this kind of film.  I didn 'unlike' it, but its still a good movie for low budget horror movies. But it's an even worse movie than an I'd expect.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one has got some good elements in the first twenty minutes of the movie, but overall it is terrible. It was unbelievable for such a decent film to be made! There are a few interesting parts, such as the casting and the music but the rest just falls apart so badly. The end seems to be quite predictable, which was interesting at the beginning of the film. The main villain has already been defeated by the time it reaches the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a complete failure, just terrible. The acting is not good, and the story is not coherent or coherent. I was so disappointed that I wanted to know why this film was made. I expected a good film, but when I tried, I was really disappointed. I've watched a few more films from here, and I'm still looking for the "unofficial" Blu-ray version. I'm not sure if the writer would still want to make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is the version of "The Magnificent Gem", only a less brutal version.  this was really a poor choice. I thought this movie sucked off all the charm that had been put into this movie. It was just awful. I didn't like the ending and didn't care for the next time you saw this movie (I was pretty late).  the movie has gotten a decent chance to be taken as the best movie that has ever been made about a crappy movie.  i am sure there are some people who won't like this movie, but there are also people who will appreciate it. I think there are many people who didn't know how to enjoy the movie. The movie is full of bad acting that could be easily remediated by some simple editing (some of the film is really good), bad and bad acting, bad cinematography, but decent special effects. I'm not a great fan of this movie but i know that it is just the same type of bad as the "Magnificent Gem". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie wasn't very funny. The acting wasn't that good, and there were a lot of other stupid things in the plot.  Some of the plot lines were amusing, but they seemed to never go anywhere. The director, the screenwriter, and even the casting staff were not well chosen. There were a few really good actors in the cast, but the acting seemed to be based on some of the old horror movies. I don't recommend this for anyone who isn't sick of horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is pretty good, and the idea of the game is good, but unfortunately the plot is poor. We have a simple story, we have some cute characters, we even get some cute animals, we get a cute story, and we get an adorable animal who is played by one of the dumbest actors ever.  He is played in such a stupid way that the actors all can't even act properly, and he is the only actor that I find "funny".  It's a shame that I could only like the bad comedy of "Family Guy", because I really liked the first one, which was hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's so many stupid stereotypes, and even some stupid characters who aren't even interesting. But the main point of the movie is...I'm going to guess the main reason this movie is a horror movie is because of the people who make it, and the people in the movie, are somehow boring, and nothing in this movie seems interesting.  It doesn't seem like a really scary movie. Also, I feel like my brain is getting sucked off, or I'm getting a big headache from watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a mix of good and bad. I loved it, and there are few times that I haven't. But, this movie was pretty bad. There were no decent scenes of the cast. The story was about an overweight man dying, and his family's plans to make him the manager of the movie.  But then, there were some good scenes. The acting was bad. The dialog was bad too. And the plot was pretty stupid. The point of the whole movie was just about him getting on a golf course, and getting lost and being followed around by a guy who's in love with his girlfriend, and then getting in their car with him and his girlfriend.  I'd like to give this movie a rating as a bad film, but the worst I've ever seen is a movie that I liked more than the first one I saw, so I'm not inclined to give it more than a 2 out of 10, and would give it a 4 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of Mr. Pimpin's work, so I was thrilled to see it. I saw it in the theater at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003. I wasn't sure if it'd ever played any part in this movie. I was also wondering whether it was meant to be funny, or whether it really was a film about how to go about making it funny. I suppose I'm not very sensitive to this sort of thing. This movie wasn't funny, really, it's just flat-ass jokes that were only half funny. A lot of the jokes were just plain stupid and were annoying. They were not funny to me as a person, but to others. I know people here are more sensitive to humor that go for funny jokes; those jokes in this film were just flat and pointless, so there was nothing to laugh about them. I could have laughed in them. It just seemed like one of those "dreaded, boring" movies. It seems like some of the humor in movies is to be an intentionally sadistic movie; it seemed like an intentionally depressing movie. Of course, I'm sure the humor here was intentional, but the humor comes too easily, and usually you get a laugh after seeing them, so the audience is comfortable with the jokes in the movie, even if they don't come on very seriously.  The movie is about a bunch of jokes that are so bad they were hard to make. Even the funny jokes in an otherwise interesting, funny, family-friendly film, would have fallen flat out of his mind. How many of those jokes are just flat, silly jokes? There are many jokes that could easily have been made hilarious, but were they? I couldn't find any jokes that made the joke out of their humor. The movie was so bad it was hard to take seriously. This is the sort of movie you want to watch if you are bored or depressed. The jokes in it were so bad, not funny, they were just so dry and so hard to get into, you couldn't care what they were about. There were even one joke that wasn't supposed to be a joke and ended up becoming the worst joke I've seen since. The laughs in the film are not in the same kind of direction. I guess it was the people who knew what the movie was about, but when they weren't the audience, I still couldn't get much sympathy for the actors. I'd like to have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first impression of this film was that it is not a comedy film. I liked the movie, I did laugh at the scene when it came out. But when I was later looking at the movie for its effectiveness, it seemed to be a really bad movie and I expected nothing to be done to it. I had to get away from the movie to stay away from it because of the whole movie. There was not a single laugh for me in the whole thing. I think that if you want something to have a laugh, watch a movie that is not comedically good, that is comedically interesting, and fun.  A movie where the characters have the same attitude in the entire film, with no humor or charm, is not funny, and if you actually watch this movie then you will feel sorry for the movie.   I give this movie a rating of 1/10 for the bad movies, but don't get if you love the movie because it is a comedy. Avoid this movie like a bad bad movie because this is not about comedy, and don't watch it if you like comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of the worst trash film I've ever seen. It is full to glorify the movie. The acting is bad, there are no jokes and there are a lot of sex jokes. The jokes are bad, and the ending is stupid. There are a few good laughs, but nothing. It would be at home in some video games but this movie is the worst of the year. I'm not sure if this movie was made as a parody or was the inspiration of a bad person, the video is definitely not a comedy, but it's a very bad movie to watch. If you like one of the films made on MTV's series "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" or "Rock & Roll" you will get this movie, otherwise there are probably better alternatives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not take place in any sense. It is the same way as the movie "The Big Ones" which had more characters. In this movie, the women's children did not suffer. The children did suffer, but it was not a good movie. The movie fails in every sense. I am sorry to say this movie does no justice to any children. In fact, they had some people in this movie that are good. I don't like watching a movie that makes no sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even describe how bad this movie is. I can describe a couple of plot lines but they aren't the plot. Also, the way the acting is done in this movie does not give you anything. The way the script is written does not make you understand why a movie about a story in a fantasy series is so awful. I know that it could be a beautiful fantasy series but you would think twice about how bad it is. So I've made my comments about the plot, not the plot; it is my opinion not the script. The acting is bad, the story is bad. The plot is so bad. I feel sorry for the writer and the producers, and you can't be surprised if you were surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best description I found about this movie was the fact that it's a complete disaster! I've watched more than 20 minutes of it. It was full of so many holes I couldn't understand what the characters were saying. I saw an almost blank and empty looking film when I started watching it and I thought it was really awful. I've seen more than 10% of it in the past 10 years, but I never will watch it again. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm sure that the writer(whoever was there) would probably have done a good job. But, if you want to write a negative comment about a poorly conceived piece of work, a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking for a good movie: watch it for your own amusement, I'm a big fan of classic movies and this one is the worst I've seen.   A young woman tries to go to a movie with a pretty good script, the director gives the movie and the actress gets to the hotel where the night is. This is a pretty dumb way to go, we can't even care what the other actors in the movie do and we get tired and annoyed as soon as this movie comes out.  One night later there is some music. That night is supposed to be a huge party of music because the other people in the film are all going to dance. Well... not quite. The next night, the scene with the girl walking through the hotel and dancing with the young lady who is actually the singer was supposed to scare off everyone. She starts acting like a typical teenager. The girl tells him that she was really good and says it's time to get drunk. Now the other guy (the singer) is drinking too much.  He was drunk, too drunk to even go down with the rest of the people.  The guy who says he was drunk and dancing that night is clearly getting drunk faster than the singer. This movie really had some decent music but it was also lacking in some aspects. If you really love the music in this movie (as an adult) don't even try this one, it really isn't as good a movie as it would have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my first time seeing one of this movie. I was really hoping for the second time around so I could tell myself why this movie is so bad. I didn't expect a movie to be all that good, and this movie was so bad! I don't think there will be any interest in this movie if you just go out there and see it to be something. I hope that this movie goes away from the screen entirely after it shows up. If you are willing to waste your time seeing it, then enjoy it and enjoy a few minutes of the film on YouTube because it is really funny! If you see this movie as a comedy, the funny parts are all there and they really aren't funny at all. However, if you do this movie, don't buy it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad, with little or no story line and acting. It wasn't that hard to watch, but I felt the "story" and acting were not believable. There was little emotion in the acting and I could barely care that the director and the actors were having a "fun" reunion. What a pity is that this is a movie about a teenager in their twenties. I found this movie to be very disappointing, and I do not recommend it. If you like movies about teenagers in their 20's, then you will love this one. But if you want a romantic comedy, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised by this movie. It wasn't that bad, in fact. But I didn't like it much as the film did. I thought the film had a certain sense of innocence and it made me want to sit through it for the duration.  But it didn't go anywhere. There was no dialogue. The acting is completely amateur. The music is bad. There is no music whatsoever, no musical score whatsoever, it's too slow. The effects were very poor and the music was not good. The voice is bad, too. The movie is no good, especially for acting. I would recommend this movie to people who like a very bad movie, but unfortunately I think that there are still an appreciative few people who give it a passing note.  I hope the people who have seen it know its real worth and just can't get through the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie as I was leaving work to go to LA to the airport. I decided to see it again because it looked so nice, and it looked good. I guess the person who gave it to me would have been better suited to directing this movie than any other director. It's the only one that I've ever seen in my life. I know that it's a pretty terrible movie, but I'll give it the chance to get a good rating if it plays well enough. Unfortunately it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even need a full review for this movie, I think it should start and finish with a positive review about how poor it really is. This movie, like most movies, fails to make a connection with what the characters are supposed to be doing. This is what happens when you make the movie as crappy as it is. What does the viewer do with this movie? Don't get into the movie if you're dying to death. Don't pay money for it, don't rent it, get the hell off and avoid it at all costs. It just has nothing to do with the characters. The film's director is obviously bad, but it's a good movie if the writer is a decent guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not read this movie for years, so I was shocked to see such a title. This movie was terrible. The only reason I have ever seen this movie is because I thought it was so good. The acting was so bad that I was afraid to touch the screen. And so terrible that if you don't like the film, don't even bother watching this movie. I mean, it's not even a bad film. It's just so bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only way it works out is that they tried to make this movie look sexy and were able to make it more appealing, with a few attempts at some good ideas. In the end, it was very bad. There is an almost pointless effort to make the whole thing look funny, or even just get the girls on the bus. In general, I think this movie was an incredibly bad movie with poor acting and no really good music for the songs. The movie isn't really about anything, but just makes it look so bad and so bad that I think people like it but just don't like it, and that's about a lot. It didn't do any kind of great music either, but the movie is about the music that was used in this movie. As for the characters, they're boring, so what else are they? I wouldn't like a movie that gives you a reason to go to the bathroom. The worst of the movie: A song that I can't understand because I heard it in the beginning, and when I finally learned it, I laughed that these people were playing it.  The worst movie ever? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this in a preview for a movie of American life in the 1930's. The theme was, of course, the American youth. And if you wanted to learn how it was that the Jews brought about their lives and that this was a Jewish, American people would have to understand it. But when I watched this movie I was very upset. It was horrible and it was painful, and the Jews who thought they should understand it had a very heavy burden. They didn't even really understand the history of the Jews. It is the only movie I've ever seen in that regard.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised that such a high profile movie did not get released. It is so bad! And I couldn't find this guy in all the reviews. Maybe he's a little funny, because he's an alien. Anyway, I'm guessing he would be a perfect actor for a small role, but it's too short for a major role. I don't know about who's next best actor, but I do hope that a little bit of money will go towards it. I just don't see what else was wrong with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie last week on IMDb, but didn't really watch it, and I think it was pretty crappy.  I also have to admit that this movie was very bad for me. It was extremely stupid and stupid in the worst possible way. There wasn't a sense of humor or irony in the film at all, and the people involved seemed to be extremely stupid. I had to look for the actual "gravy" part to figure out how it happened, and what actually happened in the movie. It seemed like someone else was directing it, which I guess it was because they're all really acting like it was some sort of piece of entertainment.  But I wouldn't want to see this film anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons why this movie is bad. The first reason is that the movie is badly designed with a completely crappy script. There are a lot of weird things going on in the film and the movie seems to have a lot less continuity than some of the others. But the most annoying thing about the film is the ending. The script is the least competent the movie has ever been. The acting is terrible and the characters aren't even that well written or that well portrayed. This movie is terrible but if you were looking for some entertainment it's better than this one. This film is so bad that I recommend you spend no time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with how this movie felt. I mean, I am a huge fan of the show, so I expected that this movie would be good, so bad it is. It is horrible to listen to a series of jokes and dialog. They get it wrong almost every time. I am not sure why they made this one. The story is weak, the ending is predictable, the voice actor is bad, and it is only one half of the movie. I think the best part was the scene where a little kid gets stuck in a toilet on the floor in a movie, with no explanation. There is no indication that they got stuck in the toilet on a movie. They just stand in a corner waiting to die. And that's all the way to understanding this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be a comedy, but really it is just the worst of an awful film I have ever seen. I don't know if it has been distributed anywhere. It is pretty hard to guess which it was.  My first impression is that the director and writer were in their last year of their college, and apparently they have nothing at all in their life. They must have been bored.  If they had actually done something interesting with this film, I would say that they might have made it a funny film. It would just be a "one line" version of the standard comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had the misfortune of spending an entire day sitting through this film. I am very much wishing to see more of these bad and incoherent films. There are several problems with this film, but it also contains several moments. I really wish to see my friends back with me on this one as it is very interesting to see those that have done so much, but didn't. Also it could not be easy to get a hold of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie has to be that if you are a normal person then you will have nothing in this movie. However if you can act like a vampire and become a vampire then you are the person that is in danger. It is a very shallow plot, the acting is poor, and the story is flat. I would not recommend this movie to anyone but I understand the reason this movie is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film in a rental video store and the only way to describe it without getting mad. This film has one really bad problem for a young American girl, the actor is the girl from the film, he is the one that's supposed to be the best actor in the movie, he tries to go on a love life tour and then he starts a movie with a guy who's in a movie for the first time.  I thought this film was for a younger young American male looking for love but he obviously didn't have a big time in love. This movie is so bad, I don't know if anyone who liked this movie was just trying to get revenge on the person.  This film was extremely stupid, it was an ugly, depressing film with some pretty good music, but with a bad story, I'm a realist. And the ending is so stupid and stupid it's almost impossible to sit through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever. I have watched it about 10 times so far. Some of the actors are OK. I'm not a believer of their acting, but it has to be something else.  The plot is boring, and the characters were boring. I feel sorry for them all.  So I can only guess what the hell was supposed to be. The ending is disappointing.  My thoughts are "Let me say I'm sick of this film and don't watch it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts out looking like a thriller film, but at the end it is almost a horror movie. The way the camera was moving and editing was so bad it looks as if it was made by a bunch of kids. There were a lot of good reasons why this film was made, but when it was first shown I was very suspicious. The acting was very amateur and the acting is really poor, especially the women who seemed to be just one of the many extras in the movie.  It has a few twists, but overall it is a bad film with nothing to recommend it. There are few parts in it that are good, such as the scene where a girl gives a toast to a woman who was drunk.  The whole thing is a mess with a poorly-executed plot. The ending could have been a lot more effective if it had some real characters. The cast is mostly pretty bad, with no real story line, which could have helped.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So far, i think the worst movie i've seen. This is a really poor excuse for a horror film. Its a pity, as I've read the book and I'm very interested in the horror genre, even though I wasn't expecting much.  What I'm hoping from this movie is that you won't like it, even as it's an interesting plot (though i have some issues with the plot). That's just my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been in this movie, I've seen it. I know it's an awful piece of work, but it's what it is. A bunch of poorly constructed movies, and an attempt to make something interesting out of the horror genre, only one way in a million. I can't comment on how funny it is to say that a movie contains several fake references to "The Matrix" and "Honey, the Queen of England" and other "jokes" about the Queen. Also the "Cadillac" reference was simply a bunch of lines from "The Wiggles" which were not quite appropriate for a horror movie, but this was far from being a funny movie, and it could not have been made as funny as it needs to be. The "Ghost of Death" was the worst movie I've ever seen, I wish it were a real one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I did some years ago, this movie is so bad! The story is not very interesting, although the graphics are interesting and the art-design is beautiful. The animation is bad, especially the way the story is presented and the way they are presented. The music sounds pretty good but not all the time. And the soundtrack is awful, also the acting and dialogs are not very good.  It is really painful to watch this movie because there are no good things in this movie, but the way it is presented makes it a complete disappointment.  I hope the directors and writers will try to get some money back for this one. The movie is really not worth watching, not worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sorry for this movie, which is simply bad. It is not very good at all. I am not surprised that it is the very worst film I've seen from this year. It fails on several points and I am stunned that the director even bothered to make it.  The story is really bad for the actors, who are not that good, either, and the other characters. The movie was good for the first 4 minutes or so. But it is a major disappointment.  It also seems to be extremely bad for me. It seemed very hard to watch this movie due to the actors. I could not find any good reason to watch the movie.   What really annoys me is that there are only 5 positive reviews about it. I think the director is obviously a bad actor, but the other ones I liked seemed good. The actors, on the other hand, are good.  I hope to see some more film of this kind. It does not matter which film it is, and I hope it is not made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a few reviews and I thought i was the only one that had been disturbed by this.  This film has one good thing in it, the soundtrack. The music is really bad, bad in general. The acting is weak and really stupid. The funny little bit is that this is not only about a movie, it's a movie about a soap opera about a bunch of crazy women. There are some good moments, but these are far from the point where you understand what's going on. The story is about a girl who gets the head of a bad guy, so she decides to get into a game with the bad guy and then goes to war. I don't know why she's fighting the war, but I do know that she's in love with him.  I also do not know what the hell she's doing. When she finally leaves the game, the film starts with a scene involving her boyfriend, who apparently has to kill the bad guys because he has to protect the head. And then she goes in to kill him, which takes place in the movie.  When the bad dude and her leave the game the next morning, we get a flashback of the girl's parents. The scene that comes first is when her father is going to meet the bad boss. She wants to get revenge, but he won't give it to her.  It is obvious that she and the man she has been fighting are the ones who had to fight the bad person. When they meet they find the head and it's still alive, so they use that as a reason to kill her. And, because of her father's reaction, he's not in love. She kills the guy and he doesn't even want to see her. Then she starts acting like he's in a movie. This is about her and his father fighting the guy who is the one who has to fight her because she's interested in revenge.  Then we get another flashback about the girl being depressed about her father and her mother and her dad is dead. Then again, her dad and the father get killed in a plot, and we get the funeral they had been expecting to go to. She decides to go in and finally starts fighting with him in the bathroom. This scene happens again at the end of the flashback. If you're bored, you'll find the movie is not all that funny. But, if you want some kind of "funny movie", you can try the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why people have this feeling. I guess it's a shame. But I feel like the film is so shallow and so much made up. You can't really see this kind of film in a 3-dimensional picture (like a movie about a guy getting drunk). It's basically an extended plot with some very few twists, but it also ends with some ridiculous moments. It is a pity-of-a-film kind of thing. I don´t know why, but the writer(Ryoji Akuma) has always been good at making movies, and so bad at making them. It´s just a shame that such a huge and long production has not made any effort to actually make good films. I feel that Akuma has always done well in films like his films, but his films have been awful at making, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I had been warned, this movie had me wondering if it was an alien invasion movie. I thought I was going to like it and the cast really liked it (I guess I was the only one who wasn't). It's pretty obvious that it had no relevance to the alien world and the aliens in the movie have very primitive personalities that are impossible to communicate with (i.e. you can't even communicate with the alien aliens and just look at them and try to understand what their intentions are and what they want). I thought this movie would be a sequel to the classic Alien film, Aliens of the galaxy, which is generally well received, but even that didn't work here. So what did i actually do? I sat in the theater hoping to see an Alien film and my only thought was if it would have some kind of a sequel or not because there was only one Alien movie I wanted to see. I was also expecting a full cast and I wanted an hour of Alien 3 to see and I thought that it would be pretty good. I saw it and I didn't want to watch it again so I asked my husband to get me back, that we would see the film. He really wanted to stay and watch it and he did so. We came back from the theater and he got a rental.  I can't tell for the life of the Alien film but he is definitely interested in it, but unfortunately there are too few minutes of it and there is so little action that it is hard to find. There's no mention in the film and no mention about the alien species at all. A few things: i.e and this film is the first attempt for a few people to see this film so it is a shame that most of them have never even seen it and it has this bizarre premise of aliens invading the Earth and then taking on "victory" of the alien race.  The reason for the film's lack of originality is that it starts to go through a lot of the same plot lines and even the film is so forgettable that it becomes totally uninteresting, not only in the fact that it was very badly filmed but also because it got such a bad name to the characters and none of the actors that could be given any role. This is a true tragedy in the history of the human race, that the good science fiction of Alien and Aliens is completely misused by a movie that just has absolutely no relevance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be a parody of the cult film "The Matrix" by "The Six" and "Matrix Reloaded" but the acting in this movie is terrible as well as the script. I was surprised by the idea that "The Seventh" was a parody but the plot is too poor to make any sense. In the plot there is a woman at a hotel with her friend who is actually a member of the Cult of The Matrix, or "the Matrix" as they prefer to call it. She is so desperate to be reunited with her brother that she attempts to kidnap him so she can get her boyfriend to join her on his quest to break out. That is the basic premise of "The Seven".  One of the characters in "The Sixth" has to kill one of the other actors and the movie turns into a zombie film.  As a matter of fact, there is an "angel" in "Seven" who is trying to use a small tank as an attraction for "Seven's" fans to get away from the movie. The Angel is a real-life terrorist and she is in contact with the cult leader who kills one of her followers, so he is killed and his head is placed on a pedestal by the priest. The demon who he is about to become is killed by a bullet that goes through his eye. In "The Eight" is another horror film with a twist ending where one of its characters kills the rest of its cast but is able to keep going because there is no one who can absorb the bullets and no one at the very least. It's like a horror movie where one guy is falling off on the balcony, leaving one guy on the floor and another guy with blood everywhere to drink. He's an old person who has spent the day drinking water and his father is so drunk he can't stand up. The old guy is drunk and he drinks on the water to drink it and is dead while his parents are watching his bath. He decides to take his father to his father's funeral because he is dead and his relatives will have to pay a lot of money to keep his body on the shelves.  The old person's head is thrown around from the balcony in a fire and one person kills another guy and then one person dies.  But the story turns in on itself when a man goes into the facility to see the people there and his first friend goes back to his body and the hospital to start doing things. When his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I can find out of it, I'll give this one a rating. I was one of the people that saw this movie and then I couldn't get out of my seat. That's just one of many stupid things I found in the movie. Also, the title used in the title of "A Murder In London" was actually "The Night Before Christmas" which was the same title as "A Million Dollar House Of Horror", and when you think about it, the name sounds off as a very stupid title. This movie is nothing but an hour's worth of bad time.   As if it's all for fun, it's very shallow, but still a lot of things that get your blood boil, but they didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has a very bad rating rating. There is not enough suspense, there is not sufficient action, the ending is not realistic, and the script makes you wonder why a lot of people didn't recognize this film as a film. Even the best actors of the genre never found a great way to portray the plot, but this film is not about them at all. If you are expecting a movie with a lot humor, then go ahead and watch this film. There will be some funny moments. There are no funny acting in this film and you won't find out what the film was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the first movie was good, and the first video was good. Unfortunately this movie is a bad version of that. The first movie could be a decent action film, but it isn't about a single action; it's just an hour of story. The other problem was that the storyline is all completely bad, and all the scenes were unnecessary and unnecessary. If you like a good movie, don't waste money, just spend your time watching a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very annoyed when i watched this movie. I think the director wanted to make it seem more scary when it is clear that the female lead is just like a male lead. I do not believe that male stars are supposed to be that scary, and that was probably why they were afraid of the female leads acting too much.  I don't understand how a female lead needs to be better than her male counterpart, or how the director's point of view was that a female leads were less interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the movie twice, in the same way that I'm trying to watch it now.  There are no jokes at all. Not even a plot. The characters were stupid and the story was stupid. It was very sad.  I think the way the director intended to make the movie was so disappointing. It seemed like a movie with a plot, but there were no jokes and none of the funny jokes in the movies made the movie sad. It wasn't like a comedy movie, but the comedy part of the movie really is there and the actors are there, not in the movie.  The movie is about one of the many bad films out there. This is not a comedy. It is a comedy that is really a very bad film, like an imitation of a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like a bunch of teenagers who couldn't get dates, got drunk and then acted out. The director seems to think the idea of "dating" is some sort of taboo or stupid. The fact that it is a movie about teenagers in a secluded neighborhood that is completely off the edge with the alcohol seems like an attempt to avoid any sort of drama. The story is vaguely a mix of teenage drama and adult drama, so there aren't really a lot of clues for where exactly this movie would fall in line. The acting seems to go hand in a way that is unreadable and there is a lot to watch but when you watch it and think about it, it just falls apart. The soundtrack is OK, but there's something too much of an old cliché. The characters are annoying and the ending is annoying, but overall it isn't bad, but it was bad with the character actors. The movie could have been funnier, but I'm not sure whether this is an appropriate way to watch an otherwise pretty movie. It's just not good, even as a teen dating movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie!  Also the only thing that could give this film an original title is the character, the characters are the bad ones. I didn't see the way the character was written when I saw this.  The way it was written didn't allow anyone to understand it properly. There was an incident with one of the protagonists in the film and the other person was in the room. There are two different POVs of the film so there is a lot of confusion and the whole movie looks terrible. I would recommend not to watch this movie, there are many parts about the story that are very predictable, but most of them are not good in any way.  It doesn't help that it's also a really bad film when you finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't recommend a single movie in the BETA comments section.  The plot is OK, but the acting is bad. I cannot recommend this movie, it's a bad mix of acting, story and plot.  I thought I was going to be able to be satisfied with it, but I am really upset.   A small plot about a woman who doesn't want to be killed, but she goes through the movie anyway. She is eventually killed by her lover, with her lover's brother as her first victim.  It seems to have some sort of cult of killing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like these movies to be more like their '60s' fare. They would have been a really good, romantic film, but one of these things like this just ruined my life. This film is stupid, there is no suspense, no suspense to make it seem more like a horror. If there's any other comments about it:  I am sorry, I would like to compare this film to the one in the original. The difference in the films are so small. They both are completely uninteresting, but with this movie there is nothing that can make this movie seem more exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because I've been on the phone for months and was going to watch some episodes of the new Disney channel. I thought it was way too long and I had to stop watching it. I was so mad!! So, after I saw it, I tried to watch it again. It did not make any sense at all. If I watch it with the intent to teach me about the true truth of life, this movie would just make me sad. If the kids can see it in a movie and be able to understand it, then it would be totally worth it, but it just made me really sad. It would have made me sad that I was never able to get those other episodes out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this movie? I'm a huge fan of Disney's, and I was really surprised by it. It's really bad. You need to pay attention and don't waste your time wasting time watching it. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities of this movie. It is a horrible waste of time, and what happened in this episode isn't even the best version. I was hoping they would release another episode. In order to be successful, Disney should stop using this film as a TV show. I wish Disney would go back to this and make the most horrible film it possible. But I'm not saying Disney is doing this because it is terrible, because it really is. This is a complete waste of money, and the movie itself was made at a huge expense to produce. Disney should start trying to make money off of this, and please don't do this anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to judge, this is what we call an "unusual movie" and it does not represent the best film I've seen, this movie is just a very poorly acted mess and not a good movie. But it had some good parts, and even in the middle of the movie, there were some decent moments. But in the end, it was just awful, with a lack of anything that made it worth watching. There were so many times I wanted to leave the movie because there were no other good moments to speak of.  This movie doesn't make any sense, it should be in the same genre as "Tales of the Sunshine". Even though this is a bad film, the idea of making a story about a movie from a horror movie is good and the way this movie was structured just didn't work. And I have nothing to say, if the story had been done better, that would have made the movie a winner. I'm disappointed, and I want to see this movie to end.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You really have to be a zombie to watch this movie, and this is the worst one I have ever seen in my life. There is a lot of garbage and there is really little gore.  There are so many plot points that are unnecessary and pointless. There are no explanation and no backstory for this movie. I don't know why they were filming this, but it is bad. What did you guys think? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that I never have seen this movie before. I was very skeptical about this one because it was obviously a very amateur effort on part of the cast. And then you were like me, thinking it was an amusing film. I had an excellent time at the audition, it wasn't that bad! Unfortunately the script was about 5/10 and there were no laughs or enjoyment from it. The acting was bad and the dialog was awful! There were also a lack of dialog and there was a lack, though, what I would expect a film to have anyway. I am a little confused on the premise of the movie being released as it's opening and that being about "A day in the life of a little kid", I had to give it a rating in the 70/10 based on a rating of 7/10 or 7/2. This has nothing to do with the script and is probably a copy of a script of a movie that didn't have a real script. There is too much bad for me. If you want to see the original "Jolly Roger" the original version is available on YouTube. It has a decent cast and a decent director, though the casting is so bad it has an almost impossible chance to succeed. There were two excellent actresses who have appeared in several other films, so it could be funny if it were just one of them. I can't say they are terrible actors or even good, though I do think they're talented. They weren't bad though.  The acting is bad by the same standards, but the writing is bad too, bad!  There are a lot of people who have nothing to say about this movie and I'm not one of those people. I just know the movie is a bad piece of junk, and I think this is in fact, the worst film I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie for a few dollars to see if I would like it. I was so disappointed that I'd give it 1 out 10. I gave it 4 out 10 and only 10 would have been good. I really couldn't even finish the movie.  The acting is terrible and the dialogue is a little too long. I couldn't sit in the theater. I think this movie is very bad and has nothing to recommend. If you enjoy one good movie, then try to see this one if you want to waste your time watching it. Avoid it and you won't miss much. Avoid the one that was good in the last 15 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so disappointing and there are just two hours of movies left out of this movie. This movie was supposed to be a great film and this is not even close to the level that the film was rated. It's not funny that this movie is only a 20 minutes movie and there is no dialogue to the film and there's no music to the song. There are no songs to this movie so I was really bored and even bored. I think it was an attempt at making a sequel but even after the ending of the movie the movie is not funny and the ending is awful. I give this movie a 1 rating  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a while, the film comes to an honest conclusion. The story is so dull and there are no real lines that are there. The action is so weak that it's not even possible to believe that the protagonists can come together, get close, or even get close. What has made this movie a real disappointment is the way in which it continues to keep repeating the same scene over and over again. I'm a huge fan of the book, but this adaptation fails miserably to stand on its own merit. I do enjoy the books, but they are no longer worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie, i just didn't enjoy it because of the bad acting and dialog and the story is weak and there is very little plot. I really liked the sequel where the characters all have the same personalities and had been separated from one another, so they weren't quite like one single person, and even the time of the day when they all were in line with another movie was just a small bit confusing. This movie needs to be remade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Caravel" is an obvious film for the Japanese to hate. This was never the best one I've seen. It was probably the worst I've ever seen in my life, and the Japanese were probably the least interesting group of actors. The Japanese did a lot of good things, but it was way too bad to enjoy. It had a good plot, but there was no good dialogue, and there were no good scenes. The main reason I loved "Carivel" was that it was so bad! The plot was so predictable that it wasn't funny, and some of the dialog was just plain awful. Also, the ending was ridiculous. There's no ending, and just one line that said something very stupid.   The Japanese cast is pretty good, although a few of the actors weren't well-cast. I'd be surprised if they would make a decent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just that bad. The actors don't really get to see the human beings they're supposed to be portraying as before. This is supposed to bring a more life to the character, but at least the acting is good.  But for all the wrongs, there's still no real human drama. The fact that the women were portrayed as lesbians, but in the end, they were just flat out stereotypes. And the ending was so stupid that it seemed that it had been a mistake, especially considering the fact that there is not even a plot.  In order to provide a believable story, I'd prefer to see a movie with real human characters. This movie isn't that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three questions to answer before any more of these questions can be understood.  The first question is the origin of this movie. We'll talk about the plot, the plot twists, and the ending. The plot, twists, endings, and character death all make this movie a bad film to watch. But as a movie, the ending is so bad that it needs no comment. If the ending makes no sense at all.  There is no conclusion. There is only a bunch of talking points and nothing else.  If you are still curious and have not watched this movie yet, don't do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about as bad as an alien movie could be. It is not even clear what the plot is. The robots are apparently not intelligent, and there is no logical explanation as to why they're being chased by people. The movie makes little sense when it comes to the human-life implications of robot existence, but then this is not that surprising. In addition, the actors are good-looking, although not very attractive. I did not know what the point of robot life was supposed to be. They seemed to be a kind of curiosity-seeking movie, but nothing more than that. In this one, we have robots, and they are "explaining" how to interact with human beings, and we have them do things to the humans. This is like a film about robots learning to be aliens, because it is about them discovering and figuring out how to communicate with humans. The humans do not know that humans are being hunted by robots. We don't care, they are just going through the search to "explain" the human body's interaction with robots. This would be an interesting film if it actually could be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I've ever seen some great films. I get annoyed when I hear that this movie was a major release and so many were given this chance to see it. But if you want to see a comedy about a movie that's completely trash, that should be the case. I think most of us would like to see some funny and amusing films. The actors are not funny enough, the director seems to be acting in a real way, the direction is not funny, and the dialogues are too long and boring. But you must remember some of the films of the early 90's like "Gungag," "Aceses" and "Demented." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An ugly movie which is only one half a year old. The acting is terrible. It's absolutely not funny! It's hard to take this movie seriously or not. I've gotten the chance to see it twice and it's still awful. The movie has all of the classic plot elements in a movie, but it's not funny. It is not funny whatsoever.  The idea is a bunch of young men going to a party looking for sex with each other, because sex is fun and because there's no funny line for it.  It's also really not funny and it just seems sad. But it was a decent movie for a teen, probably a little bit funny. There were some bits that were interesting, but too weak to make them popular. The plot is so poor that it's hard, so bad that it takes no part in the film world.  But it is good, and the movie is a bad, so we don't have to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This film isn't worth looking at in its effort and really doesn't seem to be for everyone. There is too many things to say to make it even worthwhile. There are many holes that make no sense whatsoever, like the ending.  There is nothing interesting about the story and the story's execution is not strong at all. The characters are poor and no real chemistry exists. The dialogue is awful and there's no humor to speak of.  If you enjoyed the classic series, you might be able to sit through the movies of the series, but otherwise, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is the sort of horror-show you are supposed to watch. There is no indication that the characters are actually good people, not just a few characters. This is not a serious drama, but it is a shallow, low-budget horror that has the potential to be entertaining but is not good at all.  It has to be the worst horror movie ever made, in my opinion, and I think it should be an example of how awful horror movies get into their bad movie tendencies. It is bad, but I do think it has an element of amusement that can be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit it was my favourite movie of all time, I really loved the time that was put in this awful movie. It was absolutely awful. I can't believe how poor it was to begin with the characters and the direction. I mean the acting and dialogue is bad. Also the little bit that happened after it was a long break from the film made it so awful that I couldn't even look at it and laughed. And that was about it! The best part of the movie is the fight scene between the leader and the slave (I know I'm not a child but I've never seen it like this, and I'm scared to death when the people who made it were shown. Just about a year later I saw another remake of the "Death on Earth" which was about this same type of film, the story was better and the acting was much better, but the fight scenes were just OK, and this was a complete waste of money. I really don't care about fighting in this movie, the only fight scene I was willing to watch was one with the leader. He carried out a battle against the slave and he started screaming, killing them.  Other then, I felt that the story is very poor, and even the action scenes are not good. I cannot believe it to have been filmed at this point. Also, I can tell that the movie doesn't have any idea about whether the man at the bank was guilty of making it happen, the man in the church was guilty, and the only good thing about it was the acting. The acting is poor, the acting is not good, and if you were a child that would be good enough. In fact it wasn't even entertaining to watch, not so much. I didn't expect to end up hating this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so poorly filmed. There were good jokes but these didn't get a gag and the film has a very amateur look, I think the director probably didn't know how to use it to make it funny. This movie isn't really funny, just not at all funny, not at a comedy in the slightest way. It was really embarrassing at the end.  I can't believe there's even a hint of a plot. The ending is so far from realistic, it should be used to scare the heck out of your friends. The soundtrack was pretty good, the songs didn't help, the soundtrack was good, but the acting was bad. The actors weren't funny, the people didn't have the same kind of character that you can relate to, and the movie doesn't have a nice ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a movie that involves an over-the-clothered actor who talks about the same kind of things and makes the movie look like it was made for the sole reason of selling, or something. Well, there's another problem... I guess that this movie has all of the muddled and unimpressive qualities that a typical mainstream film tries to portray. I can't even imagine why he chose this movie. If you've seen any of the films that have used a female character, you would recognize it as some sort of odd choice. A typical film would always have a person who was capable of expressing emotions, and this one had nothing in common with the emotion that this character displays. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.  The acting is awful. The dialog is not believable, the dialog is pretty good...but even if you watch it in Japanese or Spanish, the acting is terrible. The dialogue itself is not even the same between the two characters. The script is bad as well.  This movie had a good cast, and some good moments, but you really don't want to see it. It isn't even a comedy. In fact, it really isn't a comedy at all.  It's just an ordinary movie about a dead-end man who kills people, and his daughter has to pay a price for his act, and in order to get some kind of compensation he kills another man in the forest, so that he can get his daughter (who looks like a Japanese girl) from a rich man who has a treasure in the land. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I'm writing this is not because I am angry, although I am. It's because my friends were upset with the movie, which is why I'm trying to do this:  I am, on the surface, extremely happy with this movie. I'm not, on some level, surprised that this movie went about so poorly. It was stupid, it was unfilled, it didn't do justice to the cast, it just failed to be funny.  I also don't understand why the writer would try to turn it into a comedy, but that does seem to me to be a very stupid and stupid movie. But I can't find the same level of humor in this movie, even if you were a child and laughed at the scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only say that I thought it was an obvious, and I thought the dialog was annoying and confusing. However, I was in the same mood when watching it when I saw the trailer. And I liked the first installment of the film, despite being the worst film.   It was very disappointing and disappointing to see another film that looked so familiar. I don't care for films that are so predictable, and it's not for my interest to "play it again" but i do believe it is for the other person.  It seems that the first one will soon have to be released. I'm not sure, but it looks like they are trying to get rid of this film so much that I can't find out what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think anyone would agree with me. I have to agree with the description of this movie. This movie is just an effort to make a quick, fast, cheap movie and try and get rid of the acting in this movie, which is very lame.  I have no idea why it was made in the first place. It was obviously made to get some money out of the budget. If you don't like this movie then don't watch it. Don't buy it, don't rent it, and just leave it alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second installment of a bad film series. It was the first film in the series that made it onto the video store shelves. After the two previous films, I was very impressed with the first one, which I thought was funny. I guess the second film is even worse. The first film was actually funny, which is why it kept being around for years. But this movie had a long list of stupid things, like the name of the film's writer. But the first two were pretty good. I had trouble finding a copy of the second movie. The only way you could have saved it would have been to rent the second one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know who made this movie... I'm a bit of a mystery... but I suspect it wasn't directed by an English writer. I'm wondering if the director was the original director of "Crisis Of the Earth," and this movie was the sequel of a sequel to that movie.  The plot is so poor that I'm not even surprised it could get made. I think the director probably made it to cash, or at least a small part of it. I really think the whole thing is awful. It was a joke, and not a great film. I can't imagine how anyone can actually care for this stuff. It looks like it was made for a really cheap thrill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a few weeks ago and laughed at it. It is only because I thought it was a bad film. As usual, I thought the director had screwed up.  I do not mean the acting was awful. I know the acting is OK, but it didn't work for me. But I also know that the action is not a major part of the plot. The ending is absolutely horrid. The beginning of the movie was so lame that I thought that it was about 10 minutes. I even laughed at the ending. The plot is bad! My brother was laughing because they used to watch this so much. He said they would never really do it. He was joking.  This movie has two things going for it - it is a long movie and it is not very original. The actors are bad. The storyline is not interesting.  It also does not really work for the film maker. But if you enjoyed the movie, you would not be able to follow along. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish it was a movie. I wish it were a movie and NOT a movie that it was. It isn't a good movie and it takes money away from everyone and doesn't deliver a movie of any value. The actors are bad, and there are no good actors. The story is simply a series of cheap tricks. That was the end of my time watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this film would be quite good, but it's only a disappointment. I'm not one to watch horror films without my nose being firmly stuck on the screen. This film was so bad that I was scared at first. My best friend in "Joke" called it a piece of "horror" when I saw it, and I had to take it out of my eye in the beginning. I still don't understand how a "joke" is supposed to be funny, and only one of my friends laughed at the very start of the film. I didn't like it, it wasn't funny, it made me feel embarrassed. I'd like to try to fix this one and get it out again, but don't bother. I can see it, but I'm so tired from my own frustration that I cannot even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a lot of "social media" trappings. And the only way to avoid that is to simply ban this movie outright.  This one doesn't deliver much. If you can't avoid having this movie as a movie, then I suggest you just go ahead and watch some of the original movie. I did, but only after watching the original one.  Avoid it if you can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of Star Wars movies, but if you can't even stand up when these actors are in the movie, then you're not going to get into one of my favorite movies ever.  I was very skeptical of the film because it is so slow and lacks any real suspense or suspense. I didn't care for any of the rest of the scenes. When I saw the video, I was in complete shock and shock over the story. I would never go to sleep watching this movie because it just couldn't get out of my head. It is sad how Hollywood is so predictable that it has not evolved and is unable to keep up with the times. The ending isn't even worthwhile because it makes me want to throw myself at the wall and scream for the movie. I couldn't even think that this movie could have a script and would have to be a sequel to some other good movie!   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few moments that are good, but it is one of the weakest parts of the whole film. One moment you wonder why the director would put this story into a film with a female character. I think that it should be put into a drama TV show or a film series instead. It is a shame that this movie is so bad. This is not a movie to watch, but a horror film to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I saw this movie as something more like a 'film for kids' than a documentary. The movie has to have been done in the way that it was supposed to be done, which was the point I saw it for. As far as acting, the script isn't funny enough to make it funny. There are just too many 'wins up' scenes. Even the guy that is the king of the movie, William O'Neal was pretty good, but I can't see the movie being funny when it is about his father. A lot of the actors don't come close to the characters, making this movie a little pathetic. I'm not sure about it, but some of the people in the film seemed to get too far into it, and I couldn't have bothered to watch it more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is that it takes place in a timeline. The plot itself is OK, but the plot is just too ridiculous. Even the little bit that I have seen that were made for the kids, this movie feels like a bad version of The Matrix. You can't even be sure whether the kid is alive or not. The story of the world is so unbelievable that I think they could have done a better movie. There is no way for the world to continue with this horrible plot. It's just like a soap opera, with a few plot twists thrown in. Some people may prefer this film to watch a soap film because they want to see a little bit of a plot and a good ending, and not to worry about their life. Others may prefer it because they prefer a movie that has a decent ending. If that was the goal, they would have used the ending of the movie to give the audience a feeling of closure and comfort. If you prefer a story to have a little plot and to end with something lasting, I wouldn't have any problem with it. However, if you are looking for a kid-friendly movie, and if they want a movie to go straight to the finish, I would highly recommend the short movie 'The One True Story of the World', which is about a bunch of teenagers on a mission to bring peace to a world of misery. This film could have been better. I think it's OK if you just want a short movie, but if you want a long movie, I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting some one of the "D" movies like "The Big Picture" and "Rock & Roll," or possibly "The Sweetest Music," but this one is so bad it almost doesn't come out of nowhere. I don't even know why people still watch this movie. I've read the story line. I just cannot understand why this movie has been rated so low. In the end I think that's what makes this movie so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did not like this movie. It was really boring. There wasn't any action. The acting was horrible, especially the acting was bad. The whole thing was overlong and completely incoherent. I did watch it for the fun of it. I didn't really expect anything to happen. I was very skeptical. There were a lot of plot twists that were thrown out and not all the events seemed to make much sense. A story that was a complete waste of time. A movie that was not only bad, but also bad for the money. There are no plot twists whatsoever. The characters were not that interesting. The female characters were just a lot less than the guys in the movie. The movie had to be on for 10 or less minutes before I even thought I could finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a terrible little film, I could easily laugh at the first 20 minutes. The story of a boy who has grown up to become a man who does the impossible and has his father murdered in order to get some money (his brother's girlfriend is the lady who was killed). He then runs away, and the women he meets in a local hotel (the old lady who he encounters was the wife of a family he went to school with) to meet her in a hotel room on a "swag in a trailer park". It's just about two guys making a desperate attempt to kidnap their money, and nothing happens. When the group of women gets to see each other on the balcony, they get to an old lady, who has a little granddaughter (a girl with a pig). She's like the little girl of the film's first 20, but a different animal. Then it starts out with a girl (who is about 10) dying in a fire in the kitchen. And then he goes off to a hotel in a sad condition, which he dies there in as the man he's dead (the first 20 minute) and the girl (whose name is Amy) comes back to the room to tell him to kill his friend who he was supposed to kill (the third 20 minute). And then they all leave to have a look at his dead brother, who is about 30 years old. Then the guy leaves the dead brother's house. They then drive in to some hotel, to have dinner with a couple of hoteliers and they then go to a nightclub, because they're drunk. This then turns into a fight that escalates into the "jagga", which finally leads him to a car accident and they drive the man to a place to get drunk, which leads to an accident and the two guys chasing each other. They decide to get to a room where they are going to stay in (because the hotel was closed at the time) to have his friend to watch a movie called "Nuts", because he doesn't know if he can get his girlfriend to come to his room.  There are three "NUTS" movies, the first one being filmed in France, but the others in the "NURf" series, where they do the same thing again and again. This one is not good, it really sucks. The next movie is a musical version of a musical, and it's pretty good, but not too great. But the second
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the review and saw this one as a bad film to be at all. It's really not that good. My thoughts are that it's just the least good film of the bunch. It just isn't funny, not funny, and just about the best it could get. I would've liked to have some music, and the dialogue was really awful. However, I can't say I'd rate this for any of the reasons it was rated, but if the only thing I've seen in this movie is one of the weakest and stupid things I've ever seen, I'd say its definitely a bad comedy movie. The only redeeming part of the movie was that it made a good scene about the main character's relationship with his friend, although I didn't necessarily care for the main storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Legend of Death" is a bad comedy with a pretty bad script. However, the plot is not bad, the acting is good and the direction is okay, but the story is terrible. The ending is stupid, even the ending is predictable. The main character, who is basically a demon, was made out to be a comedic, but his acting skills were bad, and there were parts where you expected some dramatic ending. The acting was bad, too much of the jokes were so bad they were funny, but there are parts that were actually funny.  I didn't like it, it's just not a bad film, but it's only a bad one. I recommend watching it for a few minutes, then put in your back pocket and toss it in the trash bin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's really not worth the time. It's too long and there is little suspense, even though they made a great scene! And the acting is a huge problem as well. The first half is so bad that it would make a good movie, but there's too little suspense and the ending really wasn't really funny. The third half was a bit better than what the first half was, but the third half made me laugh. And the ending was good, but that was about all I had. I'd rather give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the stupid movie it is made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because of the low budget. The ending is really disappointing and there is no suspense and no suspense whatsoever. I can only recommend to those that watch it for the ending. But it is not enjoyable whatsoever to watch. I would not even recommend this to any other fans of the show. I found this movie a bit slow and dull and I don't understand why this movie is so bad. I didn't know why it was rated a 10 but I was scared I'd have a better one. I wouldn't watch again because I found that this movie didn't deliver much on the film level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few moments in the film when you really want to laugh and find the laugh. There are no laughs whatsoever at the beginning and at the end. At the end, I found the film so disappointing, I actually laughed. I had a hard time finding the funny one of the film. There were no funny funny moments. The characters were so unapparent that I could not even find the ones that I wanted to laugh. If you do not want to watch this movie, do NOT watch this film. I didn't mean to be sarcastic. But the acting of the actors was not good. There is not even one of them I liked. I'm sure they are all fine, but the acting did not work. I couldn't even laugh at the actors. I would suggest watching this film if you really hate watching funny movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure everyone knows that the movie would never have been successful. But I have seen this movie several times and the ending is just the same as I'm not sure what's happening. What was the point of the movie: To be boring to the viewer? To be stupid? To fail a job? To cause a lot of money, and to hurt your relationships? Why did the author think that anyone would have been able to make this movie? I am a woman, and I have never seen it so bad. It is bad, very bad, extremely bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was expecting something much more serious than a film with no story and no plot. I was extremely surprised to see such a film - there was no plot, no character development, no characters, not even a character. Even the special effects were bad - the flying lights in the air didn't look good! It was absolutely awful - I couldn't care much about the special FX. I didn't even like to see the ending. I had to watch it only because my girlfriend was a Fan of the show. The show is so bad it makes me so ashamed I wouldn't have been able to sleep at night. I can't even see a positive review about it anymore. But the first few hours of the film are good - the best of the last half. But when I finally came around to the end it just didn't last long. The ending was so awful that it seemed like the end of the world - it wasn't there - like an angel is sent to Earth, which is a God that people actually worshipped. It was also so bad that it was literally impossible to watch. It had a very serious tone - it was almost as if it were made for a comedy show, but it was clearly intended to be a horror show. I couldn not even begin to believe that anyone is serious about this film - and it didn't really work. It just seemed to be an insult to the senses of the human being.  The other major issue of the bad film is that it does not have a great script - it's a joke that's only a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it gives the feeling of a horror movie that you wouldn't want to watch, with a movie that makes no effort at characterization, acting or suspense.   I was hoping this movie might be an entertaining film, but that was clearly wrong. I think it was designed to be extremely boring, and that's why I gave it a rating of 5.  It wasn't that bad, though it seemed to have fallen into obscurity since it was released.  I wasn't sure what the script was at the beginning or at all. I guess this is what happens when one film is so ridiculously boring, not realistic, and another one is so cool.  The characters were all terribly unbelievable and unsympathetic. I couldn't really find any emotion to the film, even though the characters were believable.  Of course I didn't know what the hell was going on in the movie, but I do know that I thought it was really sad that they were leaving the door to a hospital. I suppose there wasn't a chance for the hospital to escape, but in any case, it would have probably been too late for the doctors. The movie was so bad, I couldn almost vomit out my own blood. It was an awful, awful movie, nothing that anyone could even recommend for anyone to rent to see. It seems it wasn't meant to be funny, but when you get bored with it, you get a totally bad movie that is so stupid that you are so tired and sad to have it ending.  What I say is, that this movie needs a major redesign, and a lot of money spent on new animation and graphics to finish it. A few years later I saw this movie on television. I just watched it and tried to put it into the movie to see how it is. In the end, it still looked bad, but at the same time, I cannot find anything funny about it. The only thing I got out of the movie was the scene when a police officer tried to sneak into the hospital room where the movie's character played, and the actress's character is so mortified and so mortitated, that they are forced to be put to the hospital for surgery and have a surgeon make a medical appointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a movie about the first of the 20th century and that only has the names of John, Jack, and Jack. This movie fails in every way, I think. There are no good things that occur in this movie and there are certainly nothing that has anything to do with Jack's "father". Even in the last 20 years that John's father was alive, he was able to have more money in his bank that was able of getting rid of it. John is only in his 70s.  The plot isn't too bad (for the first part I would admit it was a pretty good story). There are some decent bits here and there. There is an obvious attempt to have John's "brother" be "a man" instead of a "warrior". I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It just fails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie after its first week showing. I didn't even catch the name. It seemed like the director was having some kind of flu from what I heard. The acting was atrocious and some of the dialog was especially poor. The dialogue was all too long, there was nothing to go through. The music was weak and boring, too. The story was completely incoherent. It could have been a good movie, but it sucked all the way down.  The only thing that made it good was the idea of an over-dramed story about a couple of teenagers who are fighting over who gets the last piece of the cake. Of course, I couldn't say that about the film in order to try and make it funny. This movie just got me from the start and never got past the halfway point. I don't think it was a good choice for kids or teenagers. If you don't care about movies or TV or just want to have some basic fun, skip this. It is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film very disappointing. There's a very small chance I was expecting a great movie, but the ending is about as bad as the other one, and there's no plot, no dialog, no suspense, no real action...I just found this movie so boring. There wasn't even one interesting moment in the film - it's just boring. I also find it pointless to comment on this movie. It's the same thing as the TV series they found so disappointing. It had no plot and no action and I think the director's just taking the time to write it, which could've been used to make a better movie. The only time I was surprised was the ending.  The plot is weak, and the dialog is not good.  There's no real suspense, and this movie was very slow and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I thought I should read my copy of the movie. What's a good movie: I had to watch this one as it was in one of my nightmares for my 13th birthday. Unfortunately, I was quite annoyed by this movie and decided to watch it again for the sake of my sanity. There are only one or two decent scenes in the whole movie. I don't think it will finish off in the film. But I'm getting sick of it and want to finish it so that it's not so disappointing. I've just recently started watching this film because it had just started to make up my own minds. It wasn't funny, nor did it make any sense, nor would it make for a movie. The acting was awful and unbelievable and there's no sense of any connection with the characters. The plot was so poor it was hard to follow and the story was simply bad. I have to admit, I am not a "B" film fan but I can't say that I liked this movie. Just a few months ago, I watched it for my birthday and was shocked by the plot and its stupidity. I think that most people might want to know how bad this movie was, but I don. I do think it's more like a B movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, I cannot stand in line with any other comparison to a good movie like "Iain's Ghost" or "The Phantom Thieves". It's also so bad in my opinion that I actually wanted to watch this before I finish this movie: It's so bad that I could not believe it was a good film, and I never really believed that the movie would have the same impact on me in the end. It's a short film, so it could have been a great film. But it was so bad at the end that I couldn't even watch it in the 3 hours I was in. I'm still a bit sad because I only watched it once, and now that it ended there was nothing to do.  There is absolutely no redeeming aspect of this film: I had been warned that it was an old film, but I still laughed. It was simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the plot seemed to be based upon the "Cabin" episode of this television show. There is a clear continuity between what the scene is at the end of the movie and the next one. In fact, the viewer, even after the movie's introduction, never fully understood what was happening at the beginning. The film is about an old man who is supposed to be so strong in his first job. He tries his best at getting into the back seat to get a beer. He is having a dream about being the guy who gets into the car and runs a car. He takes it for granted that a woman is in the car. She doesn't care who he is or what he does.  The next scene is from a park in town, and the old man wants to go to a movie with a girl. He doesn't see much because of the park being closed. It is dark out there and he can't even see that girl. This is why he goes to see the movie: He's getting old and he wants the woman with the bad tattoos to go along with him, and gets in there. The girl goes to her job in a bar to meet him.  It is the same movie as a French version of "Cadillac". Although, it should be made clear that the original version of the "cabin" is not to be taken seriously and only by those who understand that it is a bad film. This film really should have been called a "Cab", and not "Curse", and was never called "Cabe", but in retrospect I think that one might have been made the best film in the whole franchise. It's absolutely awful. If you can't find out what this film is supposed as, do not even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say the movie is horrible and awful. I give the director credit for the idea but nothing else. I have nothing positive to say about it. The plot is terrible and there are so many horrible lines, most of the acting is terrible. I think the ending is weak but is the best ending I have ever seen. That being said I will probably give it two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a little bit bored by it, but it does it's job. So, my question is, why did this movie not make it into the other one. The main thing I think that makes it a disappointment, if you don't see it.   There is a story line of a person who wants to be a hero. That person is the one who is killed in a zombie. It's kinda ridiculous and I don't understand what they are thinking of. That doesn't make it all right either. The people that they have been killed before were a bit better.  The people who are killed in the zombie have to find some new friends or get a new hobby or something like a restaurant or something. The two guys that get in their way (in the movie, it's always there, all the time) want to live together, so they get an idea. They eventually find a farm that has a farm boy who is a zombie like his dad. He wants to have some job, so he goes there. So his dad's about to be killed, and he's in trouble.  This is not a good movie, and there are parts that are interesting to watch. The story line is alright, it just is boring.  Other parts of the movie could be useful, but I think it just the same kind of thing as any other zombie movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone has seen the original version of this film, or heard the original film as a child, you'll know exactly what it is. There is no plot, no theme, and no story. The main theme is to make money (the movie has to make $150 million over a few years in a year, and is forced to do so by the police.) So the police force is given instructions to use their weapons to make it look more like a thriller. So what happens when the cops act to get the money and they shoot the soldiers in order to make the $150million worth of money.  The film then takes the story down a notch. The film doesn't focus on what happened at the end of the movie, and it's not about how the soldiers were killed, it's how the plot twists around and around to make their way more and more absurd.  In order to get that "plot", the film is very slow and uninspiring, and the movie is so bad that it's hard to even finish watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised to learn that this is a cult film. A cult movie to make up a religion? What the hell does it have to be anyway? Some may be a cult as a film for some reason, but I doubt it's a religion. They don't like this movie because of it's not like any of the other cult films. The actors don't seem to really have any interest in acting or acting, they just try to act like the most well-known cult films of the past. If I had to compare it to some of the cult movies of the 1950's and 1990's, it would have to lose out on both sides of the board. Just a few points off, but don't waste your time either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to agree with those who think this movie is very weak. It's pretty bad, so I don't want it to be rated. The acting in the film is pretty awful. Also the story is really bad. How can I have the opinion of this movie? It's just not worth talking about it. But, I did. I'm not sure. It doesn't make any sense. It looks like a bunch of different movies. Also, it does not make any logical sense. I donno like watching these films. I recommend to spend a dollar on a movie: get the movie off before you buy a ticket for the big movie: "The American Psycho" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been searching for my lost time. I was hoping for some of the movies that had been filmed before the war, but unfortunately did not find anything. All I knew was that this was the most disappointing movie I had ever seen. It was really difficult to get into it, because it was SO FAR from the true reality that it did not make any sense and it did a lot of bad science and pseudo-science. As a fan of the old school of science I thought that this had to be a very flawed film. But luckily, I did not see it when I was looking for the film to review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this film, I just laughed and cried. I was sick of the "plot" and "plot-lines" (and I think the "carnages" that it is) on the whole. If anything at all, this film was bad. The plot was poor and I found it amusing that this whole film was the only thing it could be. But even so, the acting was so bad that it ruined the plot, and the acting had become so bad I was embarrassed that I felt like it could lose the most important respect I have for film.  I guess, "I was bored." I had never liked this movie, but I did have some sympathy for the character. But, the same time I saw this film on TV, I was so angry that I said it was just one of the worst things I have ever seen from a film. In the movie, it's absolutely ridiculous that these men were so stupid. I just don't understand how anyone could ever be so arrogant about being so stupid about such a bad film!  I don't think it was meant to be comedy, but it was really the only "fun" film I saw that has more problems than this one. If you have time to waste, don't watch this one, don the other, and don't even watch it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some pretty good jokes in this movie. However, one in particular strikes me as it should be. I've been reading for many years now that this is the second worst movie since the "Futty" flick. I remember this movie when I was 9 years old. This movie is terrible to everyone and a waste of money to anyone that pays to rent it. I can't afford to rent anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may be surprised that I have read the comments on this film (even with the fact that I had seen it in the theater in New York) and found that some of the reviewers have seen this in their minds. The film is full of recycled special effects from the 1950s, and its acting is so bad that it makes one wonder whether it is more based in fact than the script. If this is a major film to be made, then there must be some moral aspects of it which must be addressed, and I think there is an awful lack of interest in this subject. The fact that it has become so popular with moviegoers in the last couple of years, when it could be truly done to take the wind from its feet, is very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a typical bad movie for a B-movie: horrible, predictable, and so lacking in interest of a plot. The only thing that really matters is the fact that it is entirely incoherent and confusing. The plot was never that interesting, because the acting is terribly bad, and the acting almost never matches the characters' acting. The characters were so predictable that I never cared what happened, and just got bored. The ending just seemed to take an enormous chunk of money out of the budget, so they decided to make it a short movie. I'm so, so bored with this one, and I'm glad it's finally over. Don't get me wrong, but I'm not a fan of movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to give you some quick thoughts.  What were some of you expecting? What was the first review? This is one of the worst movies I've seen, and I'm guessing that I'm one of three guys who liked it so much. I'm not interested in talking about it to my other friends, because they just left. I don't mind explaining the plot of the movie, because I know I've read it. I just want to write about it, so I want to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's true. I can't describe a bad story. And I'll have nothing to do with it unless I decide to buy it. But, that is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie I've seen since I was born. I've read a bunch of reviews about this, and I can't recall any of them saying they're good or nice. I'm a little bit bored by it, even though I watched it in the video store when it came out. I don't like the first line of dialog.  I'm surprised that it lasted only one movie, and that it wasn't even a sequel to The Ring, which is why I gave it an award. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that had me wondering about what would have been in 10 years of time. We have many actors that would have made better films. They are too mean to be good actors, they are not realistic, and they are the same over time. They all get a little over their heads. The cast has to try and hide their feelings in the film. I don't know what it was when I watched this movie, but I am a little cynical after seeing it. I hope that is the best movie that ever could have been made. I only have seen it once so that I can compare it to one or two of the other movies that were based off of this one and they were better than this one.  I think I would have just skipped it if I'd have seen the other films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no real-life lessons here. A simple plot, and a really crappy plot, with only a supporting character to the end. If you liked "The Girl Who Goes to Bed", this movie would not be worth one minute of time.  There really should be a "plot" to this movie. It should be an actual "story", because in the movie we get more insight into the life of the character that is portrayed as a "normal" person. It's not really a story, but a story-within-a story that doesn't really matter. Also, we get some of the characters to avenge themselves and so on. But that is done without much thought in the character. It really ruins the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little rough-and-twenty-foreshadow revenge drama with a lot of fake gun action, a bunch of phony "conflict" that could have been done in a video game, and a bad-looking male actor who had to make some funny video. The characters were a mix of the same old cast they used to work, plus a couple of good-looking actresses. They really needed a lot less hair and more realistic models.  Also, the movie was bad because the acting was awful, and the acting style was really stupid.  If you are a fan of the series, you might want to watch the series for its own sake. Don't waste your time--it won't be worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the "A Man That Comes To Sleep" movie because it had the best soundtrack, though the other ones did not. But this movie had one of the worst acting I've ever seen. I couldn't believe they were so terrible because I thought it was funny at times. It's just so bad. I think they tried to scare me off and I got so scared that I left them alone and didn't even like it. I could not even finish the movie because I was so scared. I liked "Sleepers" when it was a great movie but the ending leaves me so embarrassed that I didn't want to do it again. "I Don't Wanna Make This Deal With The Bunch Of Nines..." The Bumpers.  The Bully came out in the middle of last month and I thought they were good actors, though they are less than they are. It was really just an "all-around-the-night" movie.  I did like the scene when the Bully is stuck in the kitchen with the rest of the people and he throws his head out the window and we can clearly see that he is desperate to see his mother so he tries to get inside the kitchen. That was pretty funny.   Some of the other scenes were pretty funny and I think the camera was great. But these scenes were just wasted time, it is almost like a "drama" movie and the characters do almost no real work.  All in all I think it is just a bad film about a poorly written story that could have been much better. There were better stories in the movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual with those types of films, this film starts off with an annoying scene. In the next scene, the young woman (Mari) is at home at a young house and talks with her mom (Rebecca) about going to a "swim-by-swim". When she gets ready to leave for a swim in the sand (and proceeds to the ocean) she is shocked to see the two boys (Mario and Otaru) on their side and with the rest of the house gone, the two of them try to go into the sand and Mari goes up for an swim with them.  When Mari's swimwear is off, she does something terribly stupid. She turns around and starts talking to Otaru and Otiru (who are in their own swimming attire). When it is discovered that Otaru has stolen her mother's swimsuit, the older male is upset and says "Mari's not smart enough to be swimming with Otiru". However, they both are able to communicate with each other, and Marino is able to convince them that Mari will not be able to swim with her.  Eventually, the film ends up with a sex scene between Mari and Oturu. And it seems like that is the last scene in this movie. However, it never comes and that is because, as usual with this type of film, it starts with an "explaination" ending. In fact, when the film reaches the final scene, you realize that these two boys are in the woods and something is going on that could cause their disappearance. Although these scenes are fairly long, they are never done and they never actually happen. After the film comes to an end, all you have to do is wait to hear Mari run away from the scene. After she goes to the sand, she finds a woman who is sitting on the ground and she is not able to see. And then it is revealed that she is one of the two guys who is killed by Otaru. When she sees Otaru again, she tries to go with her dad (Maro) but he doesn't want to be seen again and the scene never really ends.  I'm not sure if this movie is a Japanese film, but one cannot be sure. The story seems to focus on Mari acting in a drunken, rather pathetic way and no one really care about the characters. Some scenes are amusing but the characters themselves are not shown to really care
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just simply failed to come alive. It just didn't have any decent storyline for his movie and a very poor acting.  It was interesting and if I could have a chance to have it I would definitely be interested to see if it is more of a comedy than a horror film. It was just too bad and bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is the third movie I have ever seen so far. The first film was "Nuts In Space", and this one is the worst one of those. It is about a black dude, with no real purpose, who gets sucked into a wormhole. After a movie where a black guy who is stuck inside a worm tube, the wormhole and the worm are both stuck together, the worms are released, the black dude starts to run around. Then there is a worm wormhole where a man is stuck in and is sucked into by a worm (like this). He is then thrown onto the other worm. He is in pain and tries to get inside the worm as soon as he can. At a second, he gets stuck in another worm. The worm on that worm is in fact much better than the worm on the first worm. This film contains many of the same bad ideas in the previous movie, but I really don't care. I think this is just another case of "Buddy of the Worms". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie was the story. I am a huge movie buff, I really enjoyed this one because I thought the characters were interesting and funny. But this one's really disappointing. The characters are flat, unemotional, and unrealistic. The director didn't bother to even use their special weapons and weapons like a gun, and a gun is used to fire off one of the actors. I mean really... why is a movie about the movie? The story is stupid and doesn't go anywhere near the original. I just can't get through the movie without crying at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts as a very slow moving movie about the existence of a small town.  After a series of flashbacks, we meet with several villagers, the main character is a woman with a deep set of hatred for the mayor and the person who runs the town. But she is forced to leave town to avoid it being used as a base for a gang of bandits.   A few of the actors are good at what they do, but the rest is very poor.  We never get to see the townsfolk at work, with a wooden-frame, very flat look on every one of them. We do have some nice close-ups of people and their lives, but they're often cut short by the action.  Overall this movie is simply boring, so much of the time that goes by to keep the viewer from jumping off the page. There are few funny scenes, a few nice scenes of the town at work and a few cute jokes. The bad thing about this movie was that I couldn't stand up, even though I have seen many of the TV and movies, and nothing makes me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's so much wrong about it.  You would be surprised to know that it's a film that got the first few lines off. The music score is terrible. You can only have 3d movies at the same time. You could have made some films in 2 or 3/3 but don't give this one one any respect. It was stupid, stupid, pointless and a waste of money.  All, the rest of this is so bad. It's an absolutely horrible horror flick! I gave myself money to watch it. But that's a shame, I suppose, because it's the funniest horror movie ever made.  I'd recommend watching "Cannibalism 2" instead. I'm sorry, but I can only say it's an incredibly awful piece of trash.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the video on YouTube. I did my best to guess that this video was made in Canada. If that is the case, the country is not able to produce quality video that resembles the real life, as the quality of the video shows. I didn't know if the director had an idea of making a fake sequel to an existing movie.  The story is basically about an innocent woman who is sent to a hotel by a drug abuser, who is given the drug by an undercover cop. The drug addict gets to work for him and gets her job to do drug work, and is shown how to get a drug in a small box with a box of sand, so the drug addict and his accomplice gets it into his luggage. The video is so bad that it shows pictures of the drug addicts house, and the woman with the drug and drug addict in a box on the floor with his hands in his pocket. The film is just about as bad as the last few "Fictional" movies that have been made. It's like being told "don't sleep in your head", and "don´t put out your head". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In the title of the trailer it has been said that this movie is about life, but I'm not sure. I am an ex-Jedi in my career and I know what happens when you're not there, and it seems as if you were supposed to be the best person. This film is about the life of a man who is on an 11 year probation and he finds his life has deteriorated to the point of being in terrible condition...  And what the hell was this supposed to tell me? That it was a film about life or how a man becomes suicidal... That is how you would expect.  Well, if you're a fan of the movie, then, if they don't have any good jokes, I'm wasting your time. The jokes were pretty bad, but the storyline was pretty stupid and stupid. I didn't really care for the ending, because if you liked the movie and the film, you'll see it anyway.  This movie wasn't even that good, but this is really a horrible movie. I tried to finish it and I'm only slightly interested in this movie. It was the only way to get this movie off my plate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. The acting was so bad that it was laughable. There are some moments of hilarity but that could only save the movie because of the special effects. A lot of characters had to go off-screen. Most of the time it was really annoying. This is an example of the stupidity of the cast. You have to know that I did not even know they are coming to this movie but they were having their lives sucked off with a microphone so that I couldn't follow them. You must read the IMDb before you see it, don't waste your time. It was really painful to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I wasn't even going to the movie when I watched it and thought I was watching something that was entertaining. I didn't expect my 3/10 to be laughed at the plot; I think I'd have laughed at a movie like this one in the same place or even if I'd been watching it in some of its previous versions. I had to really sit through the whole movie because it just really got to the point of starting off really bad. And it just got worse and worse. It wasn't just the music; it also got really stupid. And I think this director would get more work if he was directing an actual movie like "The Big Story", or even "The Amazing Spiderman".  The actor was OK, just not good enough, and really not good for a film of this sort. The music was also a bad.  The scene that really got me is when the actors decide whether they're going to go to prison, and they all decide to have it. I guess this is a film about a bunch of men, who are all in prison, with two girls and one kid. After the jailer gets out of prison, they are able to leave and go free. The girl, the girl who is the jail guard, says, "I'm going to be in prison." The guy who is in jail says, in a loud voice, "Are you all sure?  No, you're sure? I'm going with them!" and the men in jail start crying. When the girls run off, the men run away from jail, and the jail guards and the girl start arguing about how much they are willing to have for the inmates. When she gets in their prison, she is forced to pay her prison guard to let them out, which seems to be the end of it. She decides to go somewhere else, which is where she thinks she'll get a good reward. The guard thinks that he'd like to go, and he agrees, so he goes to the motel to go with her. The girls soon decide that it's too slow to go there, and after a few weeks, they've left the state where she was and the motel. They have a big fight about this, and finally find out a new place.   There is no story, not a plot, really. It's just boring. There is not a good soundtrack, and there's a couple of very bad songs. The movie ends after about
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never liked this movie and find it very disappointing. I feel like this movie was designed to make a statement about religion, when it doesn't, it's just boring and awful. I've watched more than 20 times, but I haven't been able to finish any of them. What I found was really interesting was the "religious" tag on the title. How many of those "sounds" actually are actually religious? I guess most of them are religious, in fact. There's also a bunch of other crap that is included in the movie. I'm sorry, but most people who saw this movie thought it was a Christian movie, and were therefore bored with it. This is a disappointing movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked "The Good Life" for it's one and only original ending. In this movie, the first movie where we learn that this woman (Mrs. Blacker) wasn't very good at all, and it was only the first time you really understand she's a liar. In the previous movie, we have seen her lying, lying, and lying. As usual, the people around her are mean and cruel, and even the ladies who make her life seem interesting (Liza) are mean about her. I had to sit through three movies in order to finish this movie.  The ending is not so funny, not like the original movie. The movie starts on a very stupid plot, and is the movie that shows her to be a poor liar. Her acting is bad, but there's nothing really worthwhile about the movie. She looks like she's acting for the acting of the film, not acting for her own life. She just seemed like a real liar, but the rest of the time she just lies to everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had so much fun watching this movie. But after watching it again, it is just so bad. I am so sick of the whole thing. I hope there is some way to redeem it. I tried. But it is so bad I can barely find the words. In the beginning I said they were trying to be funny. The film begins with some hilarious moments. The first movie starts in the beginning with a montage of images, like the whole time you see this. You have to watch it twice before you can laugh. At the start I said it was cute, the film starts with a funny moment where they are all hanging out of a tree.  But by the end, they finally are in the room, and they do it in one sitting. At one point, they are in bed. In this last scene, it looks like they are going to bed. Just look at the first scene.  Now after the last scene you are in a room with their hands and legs sticking in a drawer and there are still pictures of a person in the closet on the floor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never had anything to do with this movie, even the way it is presented, but I had to admit that I really didn't like it. It really does seem to be a film that's just trying to have it all, but unfortunately it just didn't. I was so bored with it that I left a note for it, and at the end I found the only positive review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I don't care what "The Sixth Man" is about. The only thing I'd be interested in is the story of how the hell is that person. In the book, the setting is almost entirely European, there's no sex, and everything has to be strictly enforced. In this movie, everything has been totally imposed on the character, and even the people that are supposed to be the closest friends are so stupid it's obvious that this should have been a little bit easier.  However, this is not an example of bad movies, but still one of the worst movies I've read. I'm sure it was made for a specific person who wanted to be in a movie with the opposite ending. If you want to see a movie that is totally awful, a film that you just cannot stand by to watch without seeing the ending, even if it's at some moments, is "The Seventh Man". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the same old show, but worse. This show was about a family vacation. It wasn't very believable. There was no suspense, and it had a plot that felt like a plot line.  This show also was kinda cheesy, and there were a lot of lines that were really bad. The special effects were very poor, and the cinematography wasn't even well animated. There were some funny jokes.  In the end, it felt like it was just a big joke. There wasn't much value on having fun watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really sick of this movie. I don't even want to comment on it but the way that the director wrote it is so sad and there is so little suspense and none of the actors seem to have any emotion at all. I really hope that this movie can get a decent ending after watching it but it isn't. I hope that they are gonna to make another one but I hope it doesn't get even this bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure which one is the worst thing this movie has to do, but I have to be honest I really do not have to give my opinion. I'm about half-inclusive, and my first impression when I started watching was that this movie was extremely awful. I was looking for something that actually didn't suck and that looked like it was gonna be terrible, but my girlfriend thought it was good. So she really got into it and was interested in it. It was an hourlong film that I didn't really enjoy. I don't understand why people would go out on it, but i think this movie is really bad for a lot of the people who like horror movies. I just can't sit by anything that was so bad. The story is pretty stupid, the premise is silly, and the people in the movie don't look at all cute! But what is bad for them was also good for them! I don 't even want to see this movie, it really has to be used as a plot device. It doesn't seem to be a good horror movie either, but that's not too much a problem. It just leaves you wishing you were sick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the first few episodes. I loved most of the movie, and was so disappointed that I couldn't find any real interest whatsoever. I just wanted to hear more of the story! What a big waste of time, what a bad film...  So, I just got up and decided I was going to watch this movie, in the hopes of getting something better than the bad one. This movie is absolutely awful. There are no action scenes to the point, not even the "real life" scene. No scenes for the characters, no scenes of the characters and the actors. There is a huge, over-the-drain feel to this movie that made me lose my interest so much that I cannot even watch it anymore. Even if I wanted to go to the park, and stay behind, I couldn´t find anything. I couldn`t even find a place to sit, or even buy a bottle to buy it and get home. It just wasn´t as good as the first one, and as I watched it, I could hardly find out what was happening in it. So, even if it is one of the worst movies I ever watched, my score on this movie is very low. I give this movie two stars out of ten, and I would not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really want to say that this movie was bad. Even for a really low budget movie, the scenes are awful. I don't think that this was a really good movie. I really think that it's not, in fact, really about a "film". It is just a way to keep people from coming up to see this movie. As a general horror movie, I thought it was very predictable, but it had some moments that were so horrible that I could never fully understand why the person was talking. This movie is so stupid. There's no real plot, and I thought the ending had no real meaning to the story. And then I felt like I had to put in my pocket, because I didn't want to watch another movie for the rest of my life. The ending is totally stupid. I've seen plenty of horror movies, and they are good, but they don't have the ability to convey an emotion. This is just another case of bad horror movies. It's the same for movies like "Dark Shadows" and "The Ring". The only thing that keeps this movie down is the fact that this is so bad. If there is a remake of this movie, there should be some money in the box for it. I hate it so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely pathetic. Even though it has a very good story, the ending doesn't quite follow the rest of the film. Even the ending is so badly acted that it makes the movie seem unwatchful. The main reason why this movie needs such a high rating is because it plays out like a bunch of cheap jokes about a buncha of bums. It has a few funny bits but they don't quite last for the whole movie. The lead actor in this film was obviously bad, but he is very funny, as well as very stupid. I would recommend skipping it and going into another movie to see it because it has no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, what happened to me was a very long and hard review. Some say that it was the worst movie ever made. I was one of them. The story is very thin and boring, the characters are not good or funny and the casting are stupid. And this is all because they made the movie.  It is only one person out there who thought it was good. But this has only one guy who is worth of acting. There is nothing to say in it except "I'm a writer" and the other person who thought he was a good actor was a loser. I just hope that there was somebody in the cast who did not realize what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so frustrated and so annoyed. I think it's just as bad as I thought it was. I'm even sad because I liked it and thought the film was funny, funny, and even had some good laughs. Then I see the end credits of this movie. It was very unsatisfying and disappointing. It is hard to watch when it's the ending and when you have to sit through the movie. But I'm sure this movie will eventually be better. This movie was disappointing for me and the other members of my family because we were so happy to have seen the movie! I'm sorry for the good laughs that were given me, but I wasn't sure if they are true to the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could never really be considered as a film. It could be easily dismissed as a parody. And the direction was so bad. I think that this movie was probably an attempt by people who just couldn't find good movies to make.  What I recommend to anybody interested in the cults of the 'Warpath' cult is watch 'My Piggy'. This movie had some of the worst acting that has ever been produced for Hollywood. The acting is bad but the music, while good, is good. The specialties who are in the cast are bad but they weren't able to act like the real life personalities.  However, it is a very good movie, at the end, with a very shallow ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes place around the first day of the film festival in Japan. That is it. What happened when I saw the movie?  I know the movie is terrible, but there are so many inconsistencies. I don't like the story. The acting is not good. The camera is bad, the lighting is bad. The soundtrack is awful. There are no funny dialogs, and the music is not well done. The movie is so bad that it can be easily dismissed, but still I'm watching it and I can't think any of the things I've read above. The only thing I can recommend this movie is that it is not a bad. I know it's not a good movie, but it has more charm than many other movies in the same situation. I was surprised that the film made more money than I expected it would. It is nothing but a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is a case of mistaken information. It was either one person or the other at the center of the story, but in the end I think both parties were involved, at least one person did get a ticket and the other did not. The story is about an over-time-life-style crime movie starring two really stupid, over-the-top-characters. I could have done better. But unfortunately, the story was so bad that the movie itself is not very good.   One of the film's main themes is "Why people can't remember us?" It is also a story of racism; there are also so many of the people who made the film being racist, and they obviously had no real interest in this movie.  The plot begins with a woman walking down the street, naked and wearing a high-end piece of clothing, when she turns around to find a new phone that she can buy, and she proceeds to a seedy motel, in a secluded area. As she looks at the phone, the hotel clerk sees her as a naked, but no one gives her a chance to get in the bathroom with her. She does then and gets into a fight with the hotel owner. It is a completely absurd and unbelievable scene, but at least you knew what was happening. I don't understand why these people are racist.  There were two guys who played the movie, and I think the story is so stupid that it could have had better ideas. I guess this movie could have been better.  I was never interested in movies like this, so I did not see this one when it came out. I am not interested in this kind of thing either, so much is the other side of the movie that makes me feel sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As one of the original film's director, the movie had a promising premise, but it never got past the first 20 minutes. When the movie reached the end of the first quarter, it seemed as though I was a part of the cast. The movie was about the same story but with the same cast. I felt like I was stuck in a bad, low-budget film and had to make the movie so I never watched it.  This is bad and pointless. I think it could be a little better at 30 minutes but this movie is a complete waste of time. If you have any interest in film at all, then watch it for the sake of an experience. It doesn't even have a title, but if you want to see a film in an educational fashion, then this movie doesn't come close to a film that actually taught the viewer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would really wish the film hadn't done that much of that. This film is so bad it's hilarious in its basic and predictable, boring and just the opposite of the film I found this film. It just a dull mess and nothing but some cheap acting, cheap plot, and a disappointing ending. It's just disappointing to see a film that has the guts to write such a lousy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an adult. I can't even see this stupid movie anymore, and I'm very angry. The main thing about it is that they didn't give the time to go back to Canada to go to a movie college. But after I finally made it through my video tape and movie was available, I'm glad it's not in the end. This movie was made with money from a guy in Canada and the other guy made it overseas. I don't like Canadian movies, and this movie really is a bunch of garbage. I just don't want my time and my life to be wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very upset that this movie was only released in 1990. It was so bad and I was embarrassed by it and it seemed like a bad film to me. I think it could have been funnier than what the movies of the '80's and 90's had been. This has been such a bad "film" that I can't even see why it was made. If you want to watch a good film then watch a film. This film just made me want to vomit. And I'd like to see some of the other movies they did so that they made funny and funny. This movie just made it look like a joke. I really had to try to stop the tape, but eventually I gave it a chance to make my own. It took several hours to get it out. I did so knowing that it wasn't going to end. There is a lot of bad stuff in this film. The main plot and dialog is the worst. The whole film should have been left for its own to finish its own tape. The worst thing about this movie is that it never ends. It should never end, even in the final version of it it. It is just a waste of money. If they had made a good version of this film that would have at least made me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of films like this, but the only one I liked was "Wicked" which was actually very good and well-made. I can not find out what the others mean by this movie. I think it was a comedy-within film, and I think that was about one of the better jokes. There were about 30 to 50 people who were in the film. I didn't find out why they were trying to kill them off... the main reason they were killing them off was that they wanted to die because they were taking their eyes out. That's it. No matter how good this movie was, it just wasn't funny.  There were a few good moments, but overall this is an extremely bad movie.  The acting was bad, the acting was very bad. There is a new one coming out about this movie and I hope we will see some new film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie many times and I'm not impressed with it but it's a total trash. It's so bad that I can't recommend it for anyone who ever wanted to see this film. The acting was pretty good and the cinematography was OK, but the story of "Risidoni" was so bad it hurt my brain. I wasn't able to even sit in front of the video tape because I couldn't even recognize the characters on the TV. This is the second incarnation of the cult. I'm sorry, but that's what i've always known. But this is not good enough for a DVD. You've got to see the first one first before you go crazy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In some of the comments above I am able to find my own opinion.  "On the surface there is great interest in the story but this film simply fails to deliver it. As I can see it is not a real "film" but more like a film where the story is merely a sub-text for a plot. I have to believe that this film is not an original film and that it has no real purpose.  It is the very worst film I have seen in years. The ending is pretty much predictable but the final action fails to provide a satisfactory ending. It could have been better in a film directed by an original director but it is just that awful and as I write this it really hurts for those involved in the film.   There is also a very large question about how the film's story is structured. As my friend wrote it "there is a lot of mystery about the plot so I do not see any "real story" to the film in the end. I think this is simply a movie designed to be a film that has no idea of being a real film. It lacks a few good actors but no one who can act as well as the acting in the scenes.  I think it is most annoying when it has the other plot element of the story. The movie fails to actually make sense but has its own set of problems.  If you like a very poor film, then you will find yourself a long time spent, but at least, you won't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no doubt that this is a terrible film, the music is bad, the story is badly written, the acting is weak and the acting has just not that sparkled. It is probably my first time coming to South Africa, and I thought I was going to see the movie again, but not much more than when I was here to see it in the cinema in Nanaeo. It was all bad and no surprise, but I managed to overcome this one by using my cell phone to make sure that it was the correct video version. Unfortunately it didn't make it into the world, so no pictures are in this version. The only thing I can comment on is that I would like to see a few good movies in South Africa that have a great story. I have some films in my memory that have these great stories, but nothing like this. I think the people who make this film should be ashamed of themselves. They should keep their fingers to chin and have a decent job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is absolutely awful.  The "real life is a long story that should have been much shorter. I was very surprised to read the last review that I got.  I feel like a member of the "moodies" so much so I do not watch anymore. I will miss my life in this way, not wanting to sleep in such a dangerous movie that is so bad and full of stupid people. I hope the end is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like watching movies. I also like watching films. I've enjoyed the films. My favorite movie is the "Mooch" movie.  This movie is bad. It's bad because I like to like funny movies. And I like real problems in real life.   This is terrible. It has nothing to do with the other good movies I like.  It's also terrible because it has nothing about people like me. I like people who are real people.  I'm not trying to be funny. This movie just reminds me of being a kid. It doesn't have the punch, it's bad, and it's a really bad movie. It also doesn't make up for the good actors like Jake the Boob. I have a good family and they just don't seem to care about this movie. The most annoying part of this movie is because it's so full of jokes and it has a weird character, not that there was a funny person like that in reallife.  The only good part of it is a little ending. The part where Jake takes out his dad and is going to see his girlfriend and their friends. When he gets to the hotel, he's about to go down the stairs and fight with them, which is hilarious. When Jake goes back to his dad, his father tries to shoot him and it doesn't take a long time to go, even with his son getting ready.  Jake does a great job in this movie though. I don't think it's an overly good movie because it really works. The movie really has a real bad ending. It makes no sense, too. And if you like the good movie "Moooch", the movie "Dirty Dog" is pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this show on "Sudden Sudden", I had to believe that the director should have left the movie behind. I thought I was dead.  I still thought I got a great feeling in my heart from this movie, because I really like the idea of a serial killer who goes around and murders people. I'm sure most people who have never seen this show will not find it entertaining and, therefore, cannot understand its message. They should give it one star rating.    I watched this movie for what I was wanting it to be. It's really terrible. I had high hopes to see the movie and was disappointed by this movie.  It is even worse than the movie it's own sequel. I want a different movie: It's too many hours and there are no scenes to make this movie work. The sequel is great fun and I wish I could say this was in the second movie. If you have a sense of self-loathing, beware of this movie and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My big frustration was that the plot in this movie is absolutely terrible.  If you like a good movie then you're likely to enjoy this movie as much as I did. The plot was pretty good, although I could barely believe the woman actually had more than 1 word to say.  When I finally decided to watch it I was confused as to why it would be so bad, so much bad is so bad.  It's like a Frankenstein movie. Some people seem to get into the same category of people who get into zombie movies, and some people get into this movie just to get drunk.  How this is supposed to be funny is only an excuse for the actors to be making fun of themselves. The characters are obviously bad, and the characters do a pretty terrible job in making these parts.  I'm really disappointed by it, and I was sad to see this movie leave my friends. I've never watched it and it never crossed my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this one is one of the worst I've ever seen. There are no good story for the film. The story is completely unnecessary, and I think the cast were completely incompetent.  So my advice: don't rent this movie. It's a waste of time and money to waste the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film several times, and there's nothing to be said. It's simply bad and bad. I've watched it twice, with the worst scenes and worst acting. There are a lot of stupid scenes, and it's not only that the actors are terrible. They could have made a better movie. But there was absolutely no redeeming quality here, so just bad. The film was very unsatisfying, and nothing to enjoy, but there are just so few parts in the film that makes the film worth watching. I'm not sure if this is an original or some new film, but it could be. I don't know what the name of the film is, but if there were more good ones out there for someone to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although it contains two very interesting plot lines and some funny moments, this movie fails to contain a decent storyline. There were no plot developments (as in the previous movie) and there was nothing funny. The movie was so bad that I really did not care.  My thoughts on this movie were so hard, I cannot even begin to rate it. The fact that it is based on the original story is very bad and makes it extremely annoying. It would be better if the movie was a remake of the film. In my opinion this movie should have been at least three or four years old. This is a bad attempt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had so much fun with this movie. I thought it was absolutely pathetic. I am sure it was the worst movie I have ever seen. It is completely disappointing to me that this movie was so bad. I would've liked it if it had been as good as the first one, and I didn't even give it five out 10, out of 10. I'd like to see something that was just OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You will understand what I am talking. There is no good action scenes in this movie. The bad part is the acting. The girl was in such an awkward position and very boring to see. The guy's father had an emotional connection with the girl. When they were in a bad situation, he lost his cool and he didn't get her way to be happy with anyone. The whole film was so boring and made no sense to the character. The fact that the girl is a high school student and that the movie is a parody of a teenage drama made me laugh and weep. I'm sure the director who directed this movie was trying to go for maximum effect but failed.  The funny part is that the director and the writer have no idea about how to do a movie. If you watch this movie as a movie of high school students, you'll see all kinds of problems that will hurt a person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know, it's like a real person- a big group of teenagers that are all like robots. A plot, that's boring, a couple of characters, and not much, but there are a couple interesting characters. Just don't bother. If you like the original, you can do it, but don't expect much, and don't even have much of a plot.  What's the fun? There's nothing interesting! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You would think there is a great thing in the world. But if you saw this movie, it would really suck because they made it about two hours late at night. The actors had terrible acting and didn't do much good. The script was pretty good though. You could tell that the actors had a really rough time getting the script right. But I must say, I give this movie a 1 out of 10 in terms of stupidity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, and the storyline is a completely nonsensical, and it's an overlong movie.  I am a fan of the books, but this movie isn't for me.  My advice is to not watch this movie, unless you are a really scared person. It isn't a scary movie, at least, as a horror movie, but it has all the mawkings of those who try to do evil in the world.  The end is weak, but the beginning of the movie was good.  If you like horror, enjoy horror films, and you don't mind the ending. The rest of the film is an embarrassment to everyone. The worst horror movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid film. Why the hell did this movie make it to start off in such a high-powered manner? The plot is pretty dull and the dialog is pretty stupid. It isn't a big action-thriller, but it's pretty boring. The acting is bad, the acting is very silly, and the acting isn't that interesting. I don't understand why they made this movie. The characters and the plot are pretty stupid, and they aren't even good. I also felt like watching this one at night when I'd be drunk. I'd really have to see a movie with better acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few minutes before a scheduled screening of a movie was begun at the Theater of Pochrome, one of those cheesy filmlets of "Citizen Kane" type, which are not intended to be too good for the film. There was no more than about five minutes in before the show began to start and I was left wondering what they were doing. By the time I left the theater, the movie was a complete failure. The film's direction was very poor and the dialog was very bad and there were no good jokes at all. The movie's acting wasn't that good or was pretty good. The cast was very poorly trained and seemed to be an ordinary cast and no jokes were funny. The acting was not good and the editing was terrible. There were no decent comedy-making scenes and I hope this movie was never released. The cinematography was terrible and there was nothing in this film that was interesting. It would be best if this movie had been released before the end of the year, because even when this was released, it could still hold its own. But even though it's probably not the best movie ever made, I'd rate it as an average film that only barely resembles a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my second time watching this movie. I think it should be a better movie. It would have been a better story to tell. But alas, this is not. It is awful. In short, the storyline is so absurd that I could not get into it. The special effects were terrible, the dialog was really bad, and the acting was really poor. But if you like this type of horror film then you should give it a 7, but i don't think that for every bad movie there is a good one. The only reason I give it 9 is because I want you to know that it is good to go straight to the garbage box after seeing it. There is no room for a positive review about bad movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The video was OK, if it had a funny video to make, and even had a few funny moments to make it a decent film. But for the time the movie was an absolute waste of time. One plot line could have been even better. If you watch it again, you might not like it, but the funny line and the ending just ruined the whole movie. The funny line would have been a good joke.  The plot is so stupid and the characters are so stupid. I was a huge fan of the movie, but it was so bad that it left me wishing for more of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when I was about to watch "The House of Drusy" in 2005. I could barely understand what he was talking to me at that time. Now, I've seen the first 4 or 5 movies on DVD. And this movie is the worst one I've ever seen. It is stupid, and it is boring. It was funny and interesting, but it was so disappointing. I wanted to laugh, but I don't know what that means. I was just a little bit annoyed and frustrated by it. It just does not match the quality of the films in the other 2 movies I have seen, so I really hope there is something else out there to fix this! It should never have been done, but that's good for you. But now, this movie really needs a new and different approach. It needs a lot of work, and I hope it will be put out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hoped to see this for the film's release and was surprised that it wasn't. The plot is quite ridiculous and there's nothing real about it. Most of the action sequences seem to be simply a result of an unfortunate director who just wanted to finish the movie.  The film itself is also a bore of no surprise considering the fact that director Michael Ironside is a bit notorious for his terrible comedies. This movie should never have been released as it was just two years after the release of "Kiss of Revenge". Even worse, it's only one half of the five films "The Perfect Crime". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit my first reaction to this film was, "wow, it looks like the old 'Silence of the Death.'" And I'm pretty sure that my reaction was correct. But I don't know what the filmmakers mean by that, and I think that's the most important fact about this film. The story is about a pair of teenagers, and their lives are being made over, and they get involved in an unlikely but strangely hilarious scheme. I suppose the people at this film company were trying to make this film more interesting than it really was; it just sounds like some kid's fantasy fantasy, and no one actually believed this.  But the filmmakers really don't want to get into that fantasy. They seem to think that making a lot of money off of this movie is cool, and the way they're trying to get some silly things done seems pretty ridiculous.  Even worse, I think the movie is so bad that it's hard to relate to any other film, and it makes it impossible to listen to, even in the voice of a good actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see why people like this film, because it's so depressing and depressing, but it's not so sad to watch it. In fact, I find it worse than the original film. I'd even go so far as to point out the fact that I could see that the original "Gadducci" is actually funny. Also, the acting is so bad that I can only recommend it if you plan to rent it to a friend, a roommate, or a stranger.  I would recommend the original, but, if you do so, don't go to "Gang" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the best version of the Disney sequel that has ever been put together. I saw this film in the bargain I found it for the film that came out. They have a story line that is only a part of the sequel that was in the original. I know they were only one line for two of the characters but they were the same story line for both of those. I mean even the one guy gets out the right way. The way the two story lines are set up in the sequel, they are so contrived and unbelievable it is unbelievable and hard to comprehend. Just a few lines in the movie that I've watched would be pretty good if they were given the full credit. Even the one line that was about a guy in a black jacket was totally bad. They could have at least gotten their money back. They shouldn't be given the credit they got because it would have just made me sad. I think a lot of people want it. The story line was so disappointing it just seemed like one of those films you don't care about. Some of the other people in this film also don't understand how it is supposed to end and just want to see more. I don't know why I can't just see the movie. I really don't even care whether they make a sequel out of this movie. It really should be a sequel. I guess that most people would just assume this was a one of Disney sequel they made to get money, it probably didn't matter to them. But the plot was terrible. The actors don't get a lot right and don't act to make the movies good either. There are only two of them in the entire film and it just isn't a good film. A real Disney sequel is better than a cheap, cheesy, stupid-looking version. It's just another terrible sequel.  I can tell you the exact story line in this one, which is not just a line but has three main characters and a story of a bunch of things, all of which is just the same line. They just don't follow it through the end of the movie, they didn't get enough story lines. The only one and it wasn't in any way funny, the one with the black jacket guy was probably the best I have seen from Disney so far. It would be better to use this one as a trash movie. The characters are just about the same as they are in the other Disney sequel. If you just had the three
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It wasn't like I expected my daughter to be there when I saw this. I was surprised that she was at a big party and that it wasn't a film. I don't want my daughter being in this film and I don\'t know why I think it was supposed to be like this. The first time I saw it was in the theater. I didn't even realize how bad it was and decided to watch it again. I'm sorry to have my daughter watch this awful movie! I think I\'ll never watch this movie again! It doesn't look like a work. The acting isn't good and the cinematography is bad! It was really bad! I wish my daughter was gone already. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the same thing as the ones in the '90's, the two films I have been waiting to see more of. There is no plot, no story. The characters are, like most of the ones of the '80's, boring and there is a very slow pace in making them. I'm sure the creators made the original film because they were bored with making a slow-moving film and wanted to make a film that could be filmed in a slow time.  The film was the worst film I have ever seen. It is probably the most stupid movie I have seen in the history of film. The fact that the directors put the camera in the house and it is literally moving on rails (if you know what that means) is absolutely laughable. The producers of this film obviously want to make money, but they have to pay for it. The way the film plays out could have made for a better film, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, my review is not entirely bad, it does have some redeeming moments (particularly in the introduction to the story). The opening scene of the movie looks pretty funny, as usual, but I have a problem. The camera is not good, the acting is bad, the script is bad and the acting sucks. In fact, even the little bit that looks good in this movie was quite pathetic, and I'm not surprised that it lasted so long. It really isn't worth seeing this movie, but if you're a diehard fan of the series, this movie really should be one of the first things you watch before you commit yourself to watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad because it was really bad. The only good movie was when I watched this movie because it allowed me to understand what happened on the plane and what happened during the aftermath. In the end the characters were not believable or were unrealistic. The story is really bad and I believe the director should have his movie deleted. I think this movie was made to look stupid. I recommend taking it out of the whole thing and having it printed out and re-pack. The plot wasn't even believable and would have made better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking at this movie in a new movie and I couldn't quite believe how terrible it was. I can't even recommend this bad movie. They are all so cheesy and unbelievable that I cannot see them anymore and I am still thinking about them and I'm thinking about all of the other movies in this movie.  This movie is SO BORONLY written and made and I was so angry with how terrible they were. It was the most depressing film I have ever seen! I only managed to finish it because I saw my girlfriend was in the movie so hard I couldn"t tear her out! And that's about all I can say. I don't think it's any way worse than the "Cadge" in the 70's. They were good in those movies too.  But I think this movie was so badly written and how unfair it is for all of us to have to pay the price of our hard-earned movie tickets. I was very upset that this movie just got released and I still didn't have time to go to it again so I just watched it in its final days. I think I will never find out what the original plan was with this movie and the other part is a bunch of fake dialog that they wanted to make the film as a "BOOSTER MOVIE" just to get a higher rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting some good film in the beginning but sadly it wasn't. I hope this movie has been removed from the DVD catalog. If anyone can see it in the theatre or DVD it'll be worth some money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to read more reviews when I first saw this movie on DVD, but sadly, I wasn't that lucky. I didn't even read the film and thought it would be an interesting and well-rounded film to watch. I had my doubts. I was expecting the film to be great. However, I was not that lucky, which just means I should have done the first time. I read the movie. I did the'spine on the film' for a friend, and I went ahead and watched the film. The spine was way too long for a scene to be shown. The acting is bad. The film was so bad it's scary, it's so sad, it really bothers me. It was unbelievable that you'd have to read my review before reading a positive review about one good movie: "   A good movie is hard to say a positive about. The movie is pretty, but not a great film, but it has its charm. I guess that is the way.  I can easily forgive the actors. They all were fine. But there were too few of them. They are just a couple of good actors.  It was a shame how this film fell into such a bad place. I don't think it's a complete horror film because it's not a horror film, and it didn't come out at the time I wanted it to. This movie is just an extended sequel to the original. I think that if you are to see this movie in the DVD, you might be surprised to find something decent. But I'm sure that a lot of good was done, because I could only find one good film out of the three I was tired of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can I say? The idea of this movie is to produce a horror movie that only a few people like to watch. There are, however, enough people to watch this film and we have a bunch of people who hate horror movies and the very sad fact that we were watching this movie alone (the only thing that makes me sick). The fact that this movie made it to the top 10 in the best horror films of all time should not be taken care of. We should call this movie a "cringe horror" movie and this movie does not belong to any of the genres. This movie had absolutely no idea that it was supposed to be a horror film. The reason that I think that it is a horror story is because I don't have any idea what kind of a horror is. There is something that must have been done in a way that I thought to have been made and I have nothing clue to what it is.  I cannot even get in the end of the film and, despite my expectations, I cannot understand what happened to be. I am extremely ashamed to admit that my mind is not so clear. The movie is about the most stupid thing I ever watched. It is not even scary. It's just awful, absolutely terrible and totally pointless. You should not rent it, buy it, or watch it. There should not even be one of your 3-day weekend break between December and Christmas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie after reading the reviews, and was a little skeptical. What's funny about it is that I've read about this movie's origins as a movie about a couple in the 80's, and they are so stupid as it's a "wet disaster" I couldn't even begin to care what it is. This film is just flat-footed and boring. It was really supposed to be an homage to the late 80's. I think the producers wanted to be a comedy but couldn't find any humor in it. It has so many glaring holes that it just wasn't funny.  The ending has one of the worst acting I've ever seen, I'm not sure if it was supposed to have a sequel. The acting is also too thin and bad. There are so many holes in the story, especially the last minute when we get to know about the couple and the dog. I was supposed looking for a good movie because this movie has many plot holes and a lot of bad actors. But there's only one good story in this movie.  What is also bad about the story is that it's only a joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film on Blu-ray and was disappointed. I do not buy this movie as it is way too bad. I only see one positive review about it, the one that says it is a film about the movie was positive, so it made it up. I am sure everyone would never see this movie if they are watching it in 3D! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never expected much from this movie. But what was funny was seeing the scenes and having the people in it. I'm not sure how this was created but what is interesting is that the main character is only a woman who has recently started smoking... what did she ever do with that guy? The film was absolutely bad. I have never seen this film again and the only time I will watch another film will be when I have already been disappointed. I recommend it for kids who want to learn nothing, and also for people who are not familiar with the film's genre. I would never rent it unless I knew that I couldn't pass my entire train to the station in LA. It had some good moments but it was so bad that it was stupid. There was too much blood, too much gore, too little gore and too bad it made me laugh, too bad!  I have to admit that the movie is definitely not for kids, even if you are not a hardcore humping or drug addict. I can see that there are too many swear words in the movie. If you want to watch something that has been taken seriously, then stick away from this bad movie. I think that some people are too scared to laugh but that's where I get scared from. The way I was hoping to make this film was a funny comedy but it wasn't for me because I didn't know what was happening. Don't waste your time and give yourself an excuse to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 60 minutes of this film was not good. Then after 10 minutes I gave it up and moved on. After that, I gave this whole thing a second chance in the first place, and now I am really annoyed. I mean, really, the whole thing just wasn't funny at all. I am sure that it is a pretty stupid movie. I know that my sister's a good director, so the movie was well below the standard of a comedy movie. Just awful. And a little more! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I thought that it was way too short, with way too many jokes. I think that the only funny person in this movie was the little girl who is a little girl. The other funny person was the girl who says she is a mama, and gets all the things that people ask her to do. There are two or three of these jokes that are not funny. Also, there are some of the actors. They were really cheap to make. I saw them in the other movie too, but you can tell that they were much worse than that in this one. It wasn't a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had expected that this film would be good. But it is a total mess. It could be hilarious and good, if there was one of the greatest actors of all time, and it didn't have any of the best lines either. I thought the film was good at some moments. But that's a pity considering how much work it took to get the movie out. I didn't like it. It was a pity of a film not just the greatest horror movie ever made but one that just has the worst, if not the worst. I'd like to see a sequel. I've just seen the original horror films and they are good. Don't take your "lucky day" and put on "The Amity Park Massacre". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would recommend some more good comedy films. But if you can't find a good film, this one certainly won't impress you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed "Star Wars: The Return of the Princess" as a kid and wanted to know what the hell is it doing. I got into it right away, as I was the only child that wanted to see it. There was some very nice story lines in it, but the storyline was so bad that I was not interested in anything else. The movie was not so good because I found the movie itself very boring and there wasn't much to do besides see when a new movie was coming out (I got the movie two months ago and didn't even know which movies were coming out), I decided to watch it. However, what saved me was that I couldn't get into the sex scene (I had seen it on one of the other shows that week). Also, the ending had been boring, and I didn't like the ending and I found that one of my friends wanted to watch the scene and he went ahead and started watching it.  I'm not sure if there is a good movie: it's just so bad it doesn't make the grade. I didn 'un-review' because I thought it would be good if I kept looking for it and even though I didn several times I couldn' stand it alone, I wanted to make sure. I would've gotten the movie and I wanted the movie to last for the entire duration of the movie. I couldn's get used to this sort of movie because my friends were laughing with me at the scene, but once I saw it, I felt there was something wrong about it. I know they are laughing because I wanted more laughs. I think it's one of those'sex movies' being used to make money, but there is nothing funny about it (if you were trying to be funny at a sex movie you would have to laugh anyway). If you are a huge fan of the original 'Star Wars' movies, you might like it, just not like it as a movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot believe that such a small film can actually be made. I am surprised that such little script could make the first 20 minutes. They do a good job in a few places, but that's about it. The cinematography is nothing interesting, and the voice cast has nothing special. Some of the dialog is very poor and the movie is bad on every possible aspect. The dialogue isn't even funny! A plot is bad. The characters are awful! All the characters are stupid!  What happened to me when I watched it? A guy who was playing an actress? I don't think it's too late to ask. A guy with a fake big nose?  I'm sorry! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie where i have fallen asleep from the last time I was watching the first one.   After my first viewing I was happy to see this one again, even though it wasn't as good as the second one, but it wasn´s still the worst movie i have seen in awhile. The acting is very poor, the story is bad, and the acting is bad.  I cannot recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not funny, not good, and was completely unnecessary. I understand people who were interested in the book were interested, but this movie was just a slap in the face. It could have been made to make fun, but instead, it just seemed to be the most pointless, possibly the worst movie ever made, EVER. I'd really like to know if the director actually paid their rent, though. I really hate the name "The Adventures of Tom Stiller" and I'm really hoping that this is the only movie that will make more money. It was pretty boring, and I didn't enjoy it, but I'll probably get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I remember, this movie has the worst storyline I have seen. It wasn't a movie that really got me into to the movie. If you like horror movies, you'll like this movie, but you'll be bored if you are expecting anything from it. If this movie was meant to be scary, it could have been much better. The storyline is very weak, and you probably won't be able to even sit through it if you want. The movie has a few moments that are entertaining, but they are only brief. There are even worse when it comes time for the chase sequence. They made the movie a few years ago, and if they had just started making this movie now, they wouldn't have made a good sequel. And when it is over, you find yourself falling in love with the characters and wanting to get back into the chase scene. But, if you like a horror movie, you will probably get bored just after the chase is over.  I don't recommend this movie. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not worth seeing if you're just checking out for the second movie in the series, because it won't even qualify as a remake, but if you can, it may be worth it. I found this movie a very weak sequel that was only worth of a second viewing. If that is your only choice, get a different movie: you'll enjoy it much more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an unbalanced, confusing plot and a terrible story.  And so much as I enjoyed this movie I was bored to never finish it.  But it was too long and not really enjoyable for me to finish it since it was full of awful acting.  I think the director must have really tried to be funny, rather than make funny scenes, like a couple of the other movies of the year. It was very low budget and seemed to lack a sense of humor to match the movie.  The acting was especially bad and there were even a couple jokes that were just not funny, like the hilarious gag involving the "Punching Mom" and the one about "Dying the Child". It must have been really stupid.  There is absolutely no real plot except a very brief scene at the end of the movie where the wife of the character gets in a car with a lot of people and she is so upset she gets in the car and begins to drive herself crazy. It could have been better made but it really sucked.  Overall the movie is too bad to be enjoyable but not a great one and the acting was too cheap and the camera wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film. I was a little bit surprised to see the ending. I could have imagined the film had been so bad that I didn't even recognize it. It was really sad to see this one, and I didn�t realize that I was watching it with an hour of my time in the show room, and at times it seemed like it was on the very low end.  I also find it odd to see a movie that's so bad, and yet I cannot fault it for any of the things it's supposed to contain. Its a lot of basic problems with film editing; but I'm also surprised to find out how little attention this one has received. I can't figure out why one of the actors who is supposed to be the lead, and the other guy who is in his second role, has not appeared in any previous films. They both were in movies in the past, and this movie is not one of them.  The director is a very bad actor, as well as the two other people who are supposed to get involved in the film. This movie is only interesting when you have something good to say about it, or if it has something to say. I wouldn't recommend watching it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was bad! The plot is pretty unbelievable and the editing, effects, and production is bad as well. I don't think it is going to have the chance of becoming cult film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a very bad movie - I have seen it all over. It's very boring, the acting is poor and the story is pathetic. It seems that the director and screenwriters have chosen the wrong actor for their own film. And the acting seems to be very lacking and very wooden. I'm not saying the acting, but there were so many instances where I thought the acting was weak. And even when I thought they had acted the way they needed to act, they weren't able to do it in any way. Also, the script, which is totally awful, had some decent moments - I thought that the writers had really done their job. But the movie doesn't work so well when you actually watch it - it just turns into a complete mess. I didn't even get the ending. The ending wasn't really about the character of "Karelyn" who was pregnant and had to be taken care of. They just acted like people that had to die or something. And so was the story. I know that it was a film, but it seemed to be a bad film for a lot of money to spend. It had a very strong storyline - a long story about a young boy who gets beaten up by an angry, evil person. I thought I could see some happy ending and some drama - but it just got boring. I don't understand how people in movies like this get caught off.  The only good thing about it was that it had a good, albeit brief, ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a pretty bad! I don't know why the movie got so low rating. It was just sad!  What the film was supposed to be. And I can't tell why the producers at HBO should have cast in the acting section. But the only thing worse than that is the movie director. It seems the producers of this movie had done the movie before. They just wasted time making this crappy movie. This is about a lot of money to spend on a movie. It is too bad for the cast and the script, which are lacking in any kind of quality. And the cast of the actors are bad, but this movie is about as bad as they could come out. I don not know why I am watching this movie. I think it would just be boring. And that's what it was all about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some interesting dialogs but not much. This film isn't that interesting. Also I have to comment on a bad film. It has a bad ending with a girl who kills everyone else. And then a man who kills every other character in the film (like the girl who was in the last few minutes) kills the guy who was supposed to be the villain.  I have nothing to say about this film. I can only comment on the good dialogs, not really. This is a very, very bad film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know, or do my best on-paper previews, to be critical about these movies. I have seen them from the beginning and I'm sure these things are a lot of money to throw away. And this is why, because you know they aren't good.  My two friends are also complaining that this is not a good movie, and I disagree.  I don't know why Hollywood people are making this film and I don`t know why they make it. If you are interested in watching this movie, look at the comments on this one, because they are not good. It's full of bad stuff that nobody should take seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a 20 year old movie in the worst I've seen, and I've never played before. The film is stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I had been a big fan of many of the previous ones. When this one arrived, I couldn't tell if it was a series of books or a movie; it just seemed like it was the one movie about "the magic of the mind", so I saw it in a theatre with friends who weren't too big of it. One of them was a bit disappointed, but the rest of them seemed to like it and even thought it was good. They were probably better than the first movie, which I didn't get all of the books. If you decide to see it again, please don't! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bit of a stretch for such a poor movie to be a big hit. The main story isn't what I expected. It starts with an evil alien looking demon in the back of a movie theatre, then a guy who murders everyone who crosses this guy's path to the big town of America and everyone's way to get back to a nice hotel room with a decent view. Then a guy gets shot and dies in a hotel, that looks very bad. Then this guy turns into an animal, and that goes on to murder everyone who has the same blood on the blood, killing the one who kills him. Then after that the guy who killed the animal turns into a demon, killing everyone who followed him, then the demon dies. He kills everyone with the bullet in the neck and his blood splattered on their neck. Then his body and his body becomes stone.   And I thought the movie was good, though the ending was a bit annoying.  Some of the movie's dialog was good. But I was hoping for some of the lines. Some of my thoughts after watching this movie were wondering if the guy was an evil-like alien or if he was a man who was a psychopath or even one of a demon like the demon from the first film. The demon is definitely evil. There's a strong sense of malice toward this demon in a way, but the viewer is left with the impression that he's really just a guy in a small town who wants to be alone. I just wish this guy didn't do such things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot have possibly seen this movie and I will not see it because I am so poor in the movie.  I can have said that I never saw this movie because I have seen it so many times. But the only way to tell who is the writer and who is not is impossible. What was a great moment when I watched the video and got the movie and saw a funny thing that went along with the ending. I had to walk through and find the video again because I cannot believe that the film is this bad. I am sorry to have wasted the time I had been watching this movie. I hope my wife does the next time they get to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you had any hope left with this film, please let it go. It has to be a man making a video game, but it could also be a computer game that's been corrupted by some kind of virus. This isn't quite what I predicted when I checked it out. There are several things wrong with the plot. There is no indication of a person who could be evil or even capable of taking a lot of abuse as it seems the movie does. Even as it happens it's too long. Even the most skilled and experienced detective might prefer not to act that way, but instead a typical action movie would be.  The ending is pretty poor and disappointing.  I am sorry, but I think I can only recommend one or two of the films it is interesting to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is an interesting point of the movie's premise. In this "movie" he and the other person(he is female) is a couple. They go on a vacation and during their vacation they are interrupted by a police investigation. In the beginning it is clear they have broken the law. They are stopped by a couple of police officers and she decides to go to the police station to try and make a plea. Later she returns to her house. What happens next isn't that exciting, but the movie ends with her having some terrible sex scene and she is also arrested on the way to the station.  I thought the movie ended at around 13 hours in length but that's not enough to say the movie is good, as it is, but there are no more.  It's just another awful film about nothing. The characters were too boring to me. I would avoid this film just because they are interesting, but if you are a fan of "Lucky Joe" and the sequel it would be a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the film is so bad that I can't even say I have seen the movie. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. This film contains no dialog and no plot to go with the movie it was based on. The movie lacks a story, a plot and it has nothing to show for the main character. The only thing I can say that I have liked in this movie was the acting. However, that has been done very well in all the other movies he made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In case you have seen this in the past or even have watched it now, you will understand the full story. In this video it has the same thing as some of the other recent movies, but worse. The acting is terrible, the story is pathetic, and the storyline is incoherent. What's interesting is that the ending is so unbelievable that it has a real effect on the audience and that the movie ends in such a confusing way that you get lost. Even if you do get to the end of the movie, you're still supposed to be able to guess what is happening.  Even if the story ends in the end, you'll understand that the plot is unbelievable and the ending leaves you with nothing, and you will probably never really care about what is true, and that is why you think this movie was the worst film of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film I would recommend to spend the $12.00 to rent the whole thing because there are only two scenes that are related to the rest of the film. The other thing is that you have to pay more for the original films because you don't get the same full DVD set with no DVD case. This film is so bad that it's hard to understand where it's supposed to be. There are a few plot holes that I actually find funny because they're in actual movies. One was when the director insisted that the characters would have to get the car so they could get their car, and there was that when the driver gets to a gas station and is arrested that they didn't get a good movie. The fact that they drove through the traffic on a highway makes the whole movie seem silly. The film is stupid enough that I had to see it in the video store and that I didn't know how I would react to it. But I do hope that the directors will learn from their mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen the previews from "The Last Days Of" a few months ago. The plot is somewhat disappointing and I just couldn't see anything in the film. I thought it would be interesting to see some of the stuff that the writer and actor have done. I think they really needed to write the films they were writing in. They should have gone back to their basics of the movie making. What the hell did they do? It should have been like this movie - a very disappointing ending.   The first twenty minutes of the film are about how they all end up in different directions.  The plot and dialog is terrible and the acting is simply terrible. I don't recommend watching it unless you like really stupid, satirical comedy and/or well acted movies with a lot of laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like this film. It is absolutely awful. I found the story of the film to be so stupid. It just says the following things. In case of a child's mother, the story takes place and the mother goes to the hospital to give birth to the child. She doesn't actually die and it appears to have the child's parents thinking the baby is dead. There are no realistic characterizations. There is absolutely no emotion. The acting is poor, the acting is stupid, the direction is poor and the music is terrible. I would recommend this film to a bad horror movie: 1. It's about a dead kid named Eileen who is on her mother's back after a terrible accident, who's child falls into a coma with no ability to speak, no ability even to breathe and no ability or control how she moves or does. 2. The child's father is in a coma and Eileen is in the hospital for the entire film. She is treated with anaesthesia. The nurse gives her to the "experts" - a nurse with a doctor - and they do not do a scan of her. 3. The girl is put into a small room and the nurse tells the doctor, "The girl was having an unpleasant dream." 4. A nurse and the doctor are in the next room with Eileen's family and it is said that it's about how a mother sleeps with a child and not something that has to do with the family.  The movie starts out really good, but it starts out rather dumb, which is annoying. I thought the movie had some redeeming qualities of it, such as the fact that it is a horror movie, the film had some good laughs and it had a real heart-to-gusta-boss-and-carter-in-the-body funny bit. Unfortunately, this movie sucked that too much of all of its true charm. The music in the film was absolutely terrible. It was very depressing, which made me think that the production was so poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd have expected a much better movie than an awful parody of an "Little Stranger" film, which is the only reason I gave this movie a rating, considering it to be an original "Babu Babu" (which didn't feature any special features that are similar to the previous one). But this was not the movie. The first line of the script reads:  I thought this was the film. I thought it was pretty terrible. I really hoped to like this movie but I didn't really enjoy it because the "Little stranger" was terrible.  But the director (Poole, the main writer of the film) claims he was inspired by a good film he is currently looking at. The only problem I have is that he didn't make a sequel. And I didn' really like this film, it was just OK and boring. I don't want to hear this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been looking at a copy of this film on DVD and I found it very funny, but to my own knowledge it is very bad. I've tried to watch this but it has proved to be terribly awful. In any way, the movie is a little bit funny, and I could think the actor might have at least some flair. But the acting is awful, I just want to be able to see the cast laugh without the character's mouth moving, just like a bunch of teenagers. They look like they would be able, if they were actors, to laugh.  I'm really surprised this movie didn't get more nominations for the Comedy Central Achievement Awards, as I have heard they have done some interesting and interesting films like "Couch Candy" and "The House Of Sand", and it seems the director isn't to be an actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is another poor movie. It is not a movie but an advertising vehicle for a nightclub on the strip of Los Angeles. The movie is a little confusing and there is no one important character. The ending was a little slow and predictable and there are quite a few attempts at suspense. That's about it. I have watched this movie so many times. I had to find out why the end was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very basic and there are no real surprises to the story. The film starts on a plot that is predictable but not interesting, there's a lot of pointless miniseries thrown up in. They're basically just repeats of the previous ones.  But at the end, I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've to say, this movie has absolutely no plot whatsoever to the characters in the whole series. As I said, the story is just not enough to take you into the world of the book, or even the world beyond the book. I have to say that I had never heard of this movie before seeing it. In the book the author and the author had each one of the plot characters (which are pretty simple). The character in the book was basically the person to the world that was in the movie. In this movie, the character to the book is simply the person in the world. That's about all of the character that had all the characters. I don't know what the hell is going on in the story to the movie and to me this movie doesn't have any plot at all. The movie is just bad. This is not a movie that can be counted to any successful movie. I think it would be a better movie to watch if it were really a sequel to one of two other popular books.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some interesting things in this film, and a few good ones, but mostly these are not the movies' best ideas. What is interesting, in fact, is that these three movies can't even come close to actually the stories in the books.  The book does not have a character named Madin (and the book was apparently his name).  The film also does not give us some details about what Madin was doing while on his crusade to bring back the witches in the town. It is unclear whether he was in a room in the castle he lived in.  I have to agree with the reviewers who liked the book, but what happens in the book is that none of the characters are really involved.  There is a pretty good scene where the sorceress who is Madin's assistant is talking to her and Madin when she and Madine (with a sword in her hands) is running to the castle. Then Madin comes to his hotel to pay a visit with a "friend". But we never actually meet that friend, since they are already in the hotel. And instead of Madin going with them, he goes to the sorceresses and buys the room for them to rent it. After doing that, we get to see the sorcerers going to their room to see Madine. But when we return from the hotel to see his friends and the witch, they decide not to leave the castle and leave to go into the castle to get some food.  This does not happen, and then Madin kills his father and sister instead of killing them. The first step into a bloodbath of blood was after the sorceges, but a blood war between two armies would require blood to be shed.  Then a bunch of guys (whose names are not given) come to the sorcerer's room and kill them. Then they kill Madine and his brother, and Madina starts to bleed his brother and his mother.  It is not really clear whether it was Madin or the two sorcerers, or whether it is a random, and random battle between them. I had to imagine something.  However, I must note that one of the good lines in the movie was when Madin came into the village and attacked his brother so he made him eat some of his food. This actually happened because the peasants, who had to defend themselves against the villagers' attempts to kill them, had to sacrifice their lives to save them.  So, not only did
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, it's not quite a "slasher film" despite the title. Also, when there are an interesting character, I expect it to make the film as suspenseful as it would have been in a good thriller. I can't say that the lead character in this movie is funny or even a person to watch for a minute. The acting is a big disappointment, especially the acting. The most concerning character in the movie is the female lead, the only woman in this film who wears a lot of black. While it is pretty obvious that she's not a prostitute, she never tells anyone about her past (she's very good at hiding it) and never shows her face to anyone. The male lead of the plot turns out to be a very sad person (as I guess he's really sad).  The film is obviously very bad, but I'm sure the director had good ideas when making it. He might just be a terrible screenwriter, but if he tries to make an interesting film, maybe he'll get a kick in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is about two minutes of horror. It's very weak on its plot, and the characters are terrible. However, that's not a bad thing if you're in a horror genre, but it's hard to watch if you like horror. If you enjoy a good horror movie and love horror, stay away from this movie.   Don't go out of your time to pay for this movie: if you do find an hour of horror for free, then go out and enjoy the horror.  If you're a horror lover, you will be sorry. It contains one of the worst things I've seen in years. I would recommend you read the plot synopsis and watch the movie for a long time. Avoid the movie and don't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing redeeming in this movie. The most important aspect of this movie is the "Happening" storyline that portrays a group of teenagers trapped in the "frozen" city. In the previous season, the character were in the very early stages of development, and we don't see a progression in them after the last season. This is because all the events in the beginning of the film are very confusing and there is no way for us to understand what is happening at the end of the plot. The events are all the same as the ones in the previous seasons, including the very silly ending. The ending, although it is supposed to be a hopeful after, is a long section of "woo woo woo woo goo" that starts out much the same way as a "woot" ending.  Also, the characters' mouths are different, and their mouths are all in the same position. If you want to watch this movie with a pair of ears, then the movie is very bad for you. This movie is not only bad for other people because it is a complete lack of entertainment. The characters are very flat, and don't interact with each other on any basis. Also, even the special effects are bad because there is nothing that really makes the characters appear alive. I can't really understand why they were allowed to act so violently and have people falling from a cliff. If they are able to get out of this plot, I wonder why they weren't able to act more like themselves. Also the characters are totally unrealistic. It is obvious that the characters have "honey" and "love" but don't act like that in the slightest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of a classic American movie: a bunch of women get into a car and get into their car at a gas station; then you wonder why the hell did they get into the car. This is the quintest American movie ever made, the worst thing I ever saw! The movie is so bad I actually laughed and even more disgusted with it. The girls are totally flat out to get into cars without actually getting there, it's obvious how messed up the country could have come together and let women and their car's come together in one place. The movie starts out alright, then the women get in a car for nothing and the men think it is too much and the women and men go for it; then the men go ahead and call their friends about it. Of course they do it but it turns out to be a complete nightmare. Then finally there is the car of the women's and their friends and they decide to rent it, and the car turns out like a bad car with a very small window. The whole plot is about this. The guys are trying to rob a woman so the women has to keep from getting involved with it and then have to go with another woman to get a car. But the women is annoyed and tries to take the guy off. Then they run into their cars and try to take a car from the parking lot and have the guys come to the parking place where the women wanted to get and go, and then the woman tries to get in their car... then they decide they want to try to have a car stolen, and that is where the plot starts. It turns out for a long time since the whole plot was there, so I decided to rent another movie so I can finish it and have a great movie with some decent actors, like Robert Wagner. But then I'm really surprised that the first two shots I watched before I actually finished it so I had to go all out on it. This movie is a total disaster. The women get to go in their apartments to live there, and they get in there, but the apartments are empty. I don't know why because I saw it in the theater and the movie was only about one minute long, so this should have been enough to take away from the whole thing and not cause any trouble. At the time I didn't have it in, but I was going to like it. Maybe if I had seen the whole movie before watching it again, I would understand its meaning
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is a waste of money. its just not a good movie for this price. its really terrible. i would watch it if i liked bad movies. its not even scary. it doesnt even seem like a film. this is one of those films that u have to pay to see for a whole minute. u just want to see some funny action, some stupid action that doesnt make it seem interesting, nothing that has anything to do with the plot, no character, no interesting characters, no funny and interesting stories, nothing good with the story, no dialog, no good dialog. the whole movie is really awful, and i recommend watching this movie only if you want to feel like you had nothing to do. if u like the first one of your favorite movies is really bad, try the one that is really interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was this bad movie as all other movies of the 90s. The only good thing was some nice scenes in the movie. The story was so bad that I was shocked at how the characters' stories never actually got there. The movie was so predictable that it should've made it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not have any redeeming qualities besides the fact that the characters of all of the people involved in this movie get caught up and die or whatever else happens in the end.  I cannot recommend this movie because it is an absolute waste of time. The only thing I can say to suggest it as a good movie is that you have to watch this movie alone for the first time and be able to tell how stupid it is. I cannot find a good way to watch it without feeling like it was so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good movie i found was an American movie made in Hollywood. I had a laugh to see this one. It was so bad I couldn't even buy it. And then I saw it on TV. It wasn't even funny. I couldn do anything at all. It's absolutely awful.  I really hate this guy. He's the guy that I just hate because I can't stand it. I never heard anyone in Hollywood talk about this movie and let's get it out of my mind. This guy is so stupid. It should've died. It sucked! I've seen the movie. But it's only made me laugh and cry and get a lot of mawkers out of me. I hate it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is that it is so bad. There are no good people in this movie and even worse, the story is about a dysfunctional, dysfunctional, overpaid couple that ends in the movie. They all act in an extremely unpleasant manner and I can't see the point of this movie. It's about an abusive father-daughter relationship and the mother is on her last chance to be a successful, intelligent person in the world. But that is done, the movie is no good, and the ending is utterly unsatisfactory. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. I'm surprised it never got any attention and I'm sure it never actually made any impact on anyone, but it's just so predictable. There are no laughs, no horror, and no tension. And I know it's not a film, but that's what the title implies. How you can even call it a film is one question.  The movie is very unsatisfying and boring and there are no real characters or situations to get the blood flowing in me. I find this film to be extremely pointless and I think that it needs to be taken away from the public to make it more interesting and less predictable. And if you don't enjoy it, it's really just bad for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few words:  There are a few good moments and the most annoying characters (I would rank this as the last good horror movie ever made, even after 10 years of sequels). But it seems that none of the sequels have any relevance to the story and they are simply a waste of money. I have seen some reviews of the original films as well as others that have seen the original sequel, but these seem to be the same as if they have not been. I just saw this as an insult to the horror genre.   I am not a horror fan but it really was just an insult. The first scene is an insult and the sequel is just a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can not even begin to explain what a bad, boring movie this film was. It's not only a bad-movie but also a poor choice in a comedy series. If you haven't read the book, the plot and plot were pretty good. The ending of the movie is predictable and not original. The storyline is very predictable and really boring. The main character in the movie was the little girl that wants to be a magician. The problem is that the main character was an average little girl with an average magic level. That is all I said. What's more annoying than all the scenes of the protagonist and the other characters? They're all annoying and boring.  It's just a waste of time for a young boy to watch. The movie has a chance to shine in the beginning but it's too bad. If this was a bad joke or a bad parody of a bad Japanese movie, I would have laughed at it, and I wouldn't have laughed in the last episode of the series. I think it is a real pity. If the writer/director of this film is capable of making a good movie, they would never have done this movie and the series wouldn't be as bad as it is. This movie should be a serious film. It shouldn't be a "so bad" movie but it should be serious. It should be about a "fun" movie, not a "bad movie" like this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is quite the opposite of the best that it could be. Most of the scenes in the movie are very cliché, and I never laughed. The writing is very unfunny and has very little punch to it. I was surprised that the producers tried to put some sort of twist on it. The music sounds awful, and even the soundtrack sounds bad.  The soundtrack has nothing special. This movie is an absolutely terrible film with nothing in it except a few little funny parts that are pretty funny, and the ending is completely nonsensical.  But it was so bad that the movie could have been so much better. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and only made it so fun when the movie has been completely ruined by the first scene.  It could easily been a comedy. In retrospect I think it would have been more entertaining to see the movie in a video shop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can barely agree that this movie was an amusing 'naughty little comedy'. But that was only the end of it. This movie was really just a 'joke' for everyone, which I have to say about everything. It was not funny, it wasn't funny at all, and it certainly wasn't amusing to the general viewer. It just a lot of nonsense that seemed to be intended to be funny, but failed to get the message out. It wasn't as funny as most of the other comedy films out there. But there were plenty of funny jokes that made it not worth a second glance, or even a third one. Also, although I loved and loved The Simpsons, it's a shame that the show made only one of the top-five comedy comedy shows. I was surprised that it was even possible to make fun of the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You tell me it's a bad film: A lot of film-goers find this film to be enjoyable. I have to agree with them and feel bad for saying that. I believe it's one of the worst films I've ever seen, and this is not my choice of movie for anyone. It's bad enough that it's so bad that it could be easily laughed off. I really thought the film was that terrible, but I was able to laugh after watching it. I was hoping for a better film, but unfortunately it wasn't. I'd have to wait and see the movie to find out what it really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes place in two weeks as I've come to think of it. But, you won't be able to sit for more than 15 minutes. And that's about half of what the whole movie takes. The first 20 minutes of the movie are pretty bad, if you're not familiar with the show and/or the TV series. After that, I decided that it's bad enough to be considered a horror film, but not good enough to deserve a rating. The acting is bad enough, and the acting is OK, but the story is pretty poor. The plot is so bad that I didn't even want to finish it. I mean, I had so much invested in this show that I was willing to read it all through, even if I didn. But I read through the end and I had to write off the book before I had a chance. The story is okay, but bad. The characters are weak and unsympathetic, and they're not believable. Even when I was listening to the song, the narrator sounded a fool. In a good movie, the characters are believable, even though the writer is too hard to take seriously. A good movie is, but if the characters aren't good, the movie doesn't merit one rating.  The story isn't a horror at all, but I can't have any enjoyment out of it so I'll keep watching it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a chance to review it because it is funny and really pretty bad. I don't have to say that they should be laughed at, it was obvious. They are so bad I'm not sure they made it past 10 times or the whole season. I'm a fan of the show, but that kind of show needs to be an enjoyable experience and not a sitcom. So I think the writers should have used this same plot to make a sitcom, not like a piece of bad film. And I can't imagine how they'd be laughing at such a poor film. It's so bad that I could only call it a comedy, not the show of a comedy that has jokes. I didn't like it until I was in tears. What a disappointment! I have to remember the show from the TV show that made it's debut in 2005, I think that show is still good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are several comments to make when reviewing this movie. There is nothing good, there is nothing bad, and there is absolutely nothing worth watching. A pity.  A sad time indeed, and what is the point of this film? It's simply a waste of time, and it's disappointing to see a film that is so bad it didn't have the strength to have a proper movie. If you have nothing to say, you're going to be very sad.  The worst of all time, but I'm not the one to give that level of entertainment, and you should be fine for a 10-minute film. I just want to get the movie out of the hands and into the home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to watch this movie and take it seriously. The story is so stupid that it's hard to tell if any of the acting was done before. I hope it never comes to the screen. A story of a woman who had all her life, money and everything in place, while her family were murdered in front of her face. That's about all the acting I've ever seen. I was glad that there wasn't a 'DANCE sequel' or a 'Bridest of the Universe sequel' for that and this movie. I cannot even watch it without feeling like a bit of pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the movie that everyone was expecting when the trailer came out on Friday nights. The movie wasn't even a year old, and it just had no plot, plot or plot twists. It's pretty hard to take the plot seriously in the movie and not make you laugh. I laughed out loud, and I just wonder if I actually liked the movie. The cinematography was poor. The acting was bad too.  If you haven't been watching films lately, this may be your worst movie yet. You can't understand the emotion and feelings in it, but you may like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first five minutes of the movie are okay, at least, the rest of the film is excellent. But the beginning and the end is bad. The dialog is boring, predictable, and badly paced. The end is only about a mile long, and it would have been interesting to see a plot with a plot, and character development. The final score is an unmitigated disaster. The ending is stupid.   4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I think I was wrong about how I thought "I thought" that film. I think the movie starts with a man who wants to make a movie. I thought he was about a hero who was in a lot of movies. The idea is the person wanted to make "My Hero is back!" because of a story.  The ending is that the man who is in the hero's shoes decides to get rid of the hero and has the power to destroy the city of the city he lives in, but he can't because he's not as strong as the hero, and the hero is in his shoes.  This is another piece of crap that has absolutely zero credibility. I was thinking this was a comedy movie because I saw this on TV.  A man has to make an idea, but his life really isn't about having an idea. He needs to think.   There is a lot more to this movie than I would expect. In addition to the acting and camera, the writing is awful. There is too much bad writing in a film, and I think it should be taken as seriously as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even have any story. It's all about nothing. The ending doesn't help matters! It just gets all of the same horrible, awful qualities that other movies have. I mean the plot is predictable. The characters are predictable, and the dialogue is not realistic. The acting is not funny. The dialog is flat, and so it's boring! And I don't even care about the acting. It just really just a disappointment.  It's an old idea, and it doesn't really work. Maybe a director had a way to make it better. But it really sucked hard, and I think the other people involved were not able to put it through. It seems like it was just a movie, and not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film for half an hour and had to get out of the movie before I even could finish the movie. The plot was horrible and the acting was so bad, I was scared to death by it. But the movie wasn't bad enough for the cast. When they actually got together, they looked absolutely terrible, they weren't that good, and I hope they don't get any more films to say they can write a positive review about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it is my first time watching this movie as I've watched so many of them. I had to look for what it was. Some were good, some were bad, and I cannot believe the person who thought this movie was funny. The people who knew the movie and did not watch it seriously should be ashamed of themselves. I could only guess they have never read the book, because I would not expect that to be true.  I know some people have seen this movie before, and have seen the movie, but the movie is so bad, so bad that I didn't care about my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand that it is a "film" and most of the time I enjoy this film. That being the case of the acting, the story, and the direction, this film is utterly disappointing. But when I look at it in my mind, I realize that it's only a few minutes longer than the film. So I have to give it a low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch this movie because I heard that it was one of the best things I've ever seen. But it's so bad it is so bad that it's actually funny. The script is completely incoherent and the ending is weak. The acting is bad. And the story is so poor it's predictable.  It is also a problem with this movie's budget.  And most of those comments are wrong. They are just an example of a bad film:  The ending is a plot that goes all over the place. There is no closure. Nothing about the story. There's no sense of a conclusion. It's hard to watch because of a poor plot and a bad director.  My other review about the movie: (1) this is so weak it could be easily made into an entertaining movie for a bunch of guys like me. (2) this movie has no real suspense. If a movie's main goal is to make you laugh, you will never, ever, laugh. If its main goal, is to give you goosebumps, then you will NEVER, ever.   (3) the music has too many cheesy songs. The soundtrack is also bad. The songs in the movie have no real meaning. I think this is a movie that would be an instant bore. A few comments I have to add:  1. a few people have called me a "jerk", and I think that could be done as a reference for a gag. I have never laughed so much in my life. I laughed when I listened to this film. It wasn't a very funny movie, just a very, very bad film.  2. I found this movie in a commercial for a movie called "Culteers", which is very,very, very poorly produced, and also one that has some good ideas. I know that this movie is based on a cartoon by this guy, and he is the writer of the cartoon. I can easily tell what his intentions are.  3. It seems like this movie was made to get some money from the writer and an ad company to make a profit, in order to get a kick back. It really sucks how it's made in this way, and you can't see any of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a short preview of the film, the film starts off badly as if it were an "B-movie", and I think that's a pretty accurate description. There are the usual Hollywood clichés (as if this is the first of them), a little bit of suspense (some of the dialog was really good), but nothing is ever suspense-filled (I'm not a spy, nor was I, but some of the plotlines seemed to be somewhat too predictable), and most of the films take place in a hotel or the hotel staff, not a hotel's owner. But hey, that's the movie so it was.  I really expected the film to have some twists and turn it into a funny comedy, but it never did.  The film starts out with a decent, if somewhat dusted-up, thriller. Then it goes in a strange direction - it's about a little girl (whose name is Hilda) trying to get into the hotel, then getting in the hotel manager's pants and leaving her in his hotel room. But the ending (it's not that I know what the ending is) doesn't work. What happens after she's in the room? No one knows?  Then it gets into an apartment, and the film takes a weird turn when the characters go out on a trip to the hotel and the hotel's manager is there, which is very awkward. The film ends up a little too long, and there are too many long cut scenes. I would prefer to see a longer version of this movie. But what can this be expected to be? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't see a thing that could make me feel anything so bad. There are enough movies that I would like to watch that would make my feel good, and one has to be about the best movies ever made, and this is a poor one. But even worse.  Also, the whole movie seems to be lacking any humor, although there is an enjoyable scene in the beginning and the whole cast is quite silly. Also the actress doesn't seem to be good and at all capable of acting.  I understand how it was made, but the fact that it is a film, and the fact of it being a video, do not make me more hopeful. The fact that he is so much worse than the best of his film makes me sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just went and watched this movie. I'm not so interested. This is a typical horror film. Just bad. And that's it. I guess if you are a horror film-guy, you might be OK. But, don't be a horror-guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on the website as a sign that Hollywood is finally falling for some of the bad actors. The plot is pretty much un-real and the ending is very stupid, if you watch it and the only thing that could make this movie seem interesting is an ending that would have made the film itself somewhat more interesting. I'd like to see the script to see what happened to be in the ending. This film isn't funny at all. I think it would make a really lousy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was expecting better but was not. I had never heard of this movie before. I am the only one that is interested. I just don't care how many people hate it, as I have. I don't even care if I have to say they are bad or not. My favorite movie ever was "Stupid People", which was a beautiful, heartfelt and funny film. The only reason I liked "Starda", because it was funny. I guess that was the reason why the film was in my back. I really did not want to have this movie to me. I could not even hear one of these stories. If I made it to me I would have had more enjoyment than sitting in the car waiting to drive on. I would give myself an hour and half of wasted time to spend waiting for the movie to begin. I think it's too bad to even make a movie like that. It really should have been a "Vibra's Journey", a great, heart-wrenching film that everyone loves. I've never heard one of those stories in a film before, but I think this movie just ruined it for everyone. Even though it is not as good as a good movie in the original, it just keeps repeating the same story and leaving the viewer bored. That's how this movie was designed. Not only the main characters are bad, but the people on the street are even more annoying than you would expect. I understand why this movie is so bad. The camera work is bad, the directing is terrible, the editing is bad. All of the good elements that are in this film are just bad, with a couple of very simple mistakes.  The film starts out very well. A cute family is having fun as neighbors, but a few days later I saw something that was completely unbelievable. I didn't care about these people, not even the kid who is supposed to be in it. It made me sad to have friends who are interested in the plot and the way these people are living, but it just gets worse and worse the closer to the end. The ending was just a pathetic plot and it has no ending. The characters are all pretty uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I was sitting on the tube to see this film, it was my first time watching for the first time. Although I have seen many movies on the internet, none of them have really made me appreciate that this movie was a bad film. I was looking for the other one I watched and thought it was funny, and I laughed. It turns out to be really stupid, and it's a long film. There is a lack of laughs. The film starts off with the obvious joke that I have never seen before. It seems to be a gag, but it is really horrible, and there is no payoff. I will admit that I watched it for the same reason as the other, because I thought it would be funny. I think it's stupid because it's predictable. I mean you've just watched the first few scenes. I don't know why, but I think the joke was so good, there is a lot of funny jokes, but they're pretty predictable.  So, this is a bad joke, it's only funny when you realize you're laughing at the joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Big, Big, BIG" is about to make the worst comedy ever.  In fact, this movie is so bad it could barely get published. I could not see a single movie this bad. It is like a bunch of crap from the 60's, and this movie just started a new trend. The main theme is that a few guys were having fun in their lives, and it turns out that they accidentally broke into each others' life in a car accident, and they are in jail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a little too long to have the power of a movie, but it is not too long and the dialog is actually funny. It is sad because they have to waste so much time on it. And the ending is completely pointless. The ending is very long and if you look at the beginning, it doesn't last long. The endings are totally predictable and pointless and even the end is a bit too long. And there are no endings.  I've seen it before but I don't understand how it is so bad. I do agree that this is a bad film, but I'm sure that it has more potential to be interesting than just sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is predictable, the story is unbelievable and the acting is laughable. I can't imagine anything worse than the plot and actors. The acting was especially bad and I didn't understand why the actors were chosen to be in the film, but I'm sure there wasn't an effort to make the story any more realistic. The ending isn't very good but it has some kind of emotional significance. That's really all I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So far I am a film critic, that's why I made this movie. I do not watch films! My boyfriend is a director and he made the "The Matrix" video, so it is true.  Also, I am not a member of the film school at the university of Utah. I can't get that on the Internet. I'm a little embarrassed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was obviously put together at the studios back on the strength of the studio that this kind of film is made of. The film features a lot of bad acting and dialog and a complete lack of humor and even worse, some of the most boring and stupid scenes that have been shown in a film since I was much younger than I was. The plot is absolutely pathetic, and I can even say that the ending really is stupid. What is funny? A story of a man in his own house who has sex with his friends (an incredibly stupid scene) that leads him to be murdered? That seems as if it was really sad.  The plot and dialog are obviously pointless and there is no real story to be told, even when this is supposed to be a "story" on this movie. This is in a lot to say and the movie is terrible from the point of view of the person, but even that is not really a bad. Still, it's just a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three main characters, and I think most of them are played by the same guy, the only one who was not played by Sean Penn was the other guy in the last one. There are no characters who are not played in the same way. The plot is so bad, the acting is so poor and so predictable it's almost like a porno movie.  It turns out to be kind of funny when it first started but it never really grows on.  All of the performances are terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to have a stop now as soon as I finish watching this movie. The first hour of the movie is good, and it has some great scenes. But the rest is bad. I'm sure all of the other actors in this film did something amazing. But it is just not there.  I don't know if they wanted to be a bad director, or if the people involved with this project are so stupid, but the way the movies are structured is just lame. They're a lot like a few other horror flicks that the Vulture is trying to make fun of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this movie, I was expecting my favorite movie of the year. I was surprised that it didn't make the list.  The acting is bad, the acting is awful, and the characters are not interesting to listen to.  I found this movie annoying and very hard to understand, especially the ending. The movie is a bad choice for a young male to watch. I'm disappointed that it was a good movie for a tween to see.  If you like horror or action, the way it plays out is predictable and very stupid.  This movie isn't for young kids. Avoid this movie if you have an 11 year old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film in theaters when I was in the theatre in California (not all). I did not like it and didn't believe this movie was worth it. I saw the other day that it wasn't even worth the rental price. I wish they could make a sequel to this bad movie. I think it was just plain bad. It looked so terrible, with the old-fashioned, over-the-top-of-the game Hollywood looks, that it didn't seem like there was anything to get in there. I didn't like it as a single item. There were many people in the audience who thought it was pretty good, but most of them just looked at the movie and ignored the movie. This movie could have been a big hit in Hollywood if they made it and it would just look good, because it was in a great place. The cast should have made some improvements. I don't believe that people should pay for movies, but if they did, I'd probably just give them the money and skip the movie altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some funny jokes in this but none of them are funny. I am not sure why this movie is so important to this movie and why do people think it is so cool. Its just another cheap sequel that takes the idea of the original movies and ruins this great concept. I hope the writers will try and make the sequel better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of this film (I made the original one). And after a few months of watching it, I can barely make sense of it, not even though it has a very good soundtrack.  I have to agree with those people who have commented, "that is a really bad movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply horrible - the storyline is horrible and the acting is bad - even if you liked the first movie it wouldn't be worth a second watch. The storyline isn't the best in the world, although it isn't bad at all - but the acting isn't good either and the cinematography has a really bad quality to go with it.  As for the actors, I would be shocked if they were really acting as it appears, the acting seems to be somewhat realistic but the rest is not good either.  I really liked the original script and the story was okay, the characters are interesting and I get that it has been done - I'm looking for the director and the other actors that are good.  But for all of us, please be careful about what you watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got into watching it again. It is a terrible, slow, boring, and totally predictable. I had to go in to the bathroom to get a fresh clean one because the toilet was broken. There was a girl sitting in the bathroom and I don't know if she's still in the water. It's also got a sex scene that looks like it was made by a bunch of French hippies in the 50's. I don a lot of porn movies, but that isn't even the worst movie I've seen. It really doesn't have any redeeming features... and I'm not sure if it's the same person who's in the film. I'm a big fan of The Matrix... and this is that show's weakest link... what can you say about her sex scene? I've been waiting for a sequel. I can't get this movie out of my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie made no lasting impression on me. The plot is unbelievable, the dialog is awful, the acting is extremely stupid and the editing is very poor. It doesn't help that the director and the casting are not that good. If you are expecting a good film, you will be disappointed. In fact, I might have got bored with the film after watching it and only after looking at my husband, a friend from the movie, we can agree on this one. If I could recommend, for the sake of watching something that actually is interesting or good, a movie like this one may not be quite so bad. But that's what it is, at least.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd been on one of my favourite sitcoms at my school and found that the main character wasn't quite as competent as the other main character on the show. I was very disappointed that the pilot was actually good. I thought that the actors who seemed to be capable of much better characters were in actual scenes (I really liked this pilot, but the pilot wasn't so good in general scenes). I don't know if any of the actors in this movie were good, but what's funny about those actors' voices?!  The ending seems somewhat unbelievable, as if the show is actually about a TV show and the characters are actually actually real people.  Still, it wasn't that bad. It wasn't too bad. There was a couple of parts in the movie that looked like they were part of the show, but not too bad, and it really seemed like it was a plot device.  It was like they made a sequel to the show that I wish they would do.  I'm not sure if the TV shows that were based off of this are good, because the pilot shows are actually a lot better, but this one had a few of them. Some of the characters were pretty good, and I guess I'll get bored of those, because I have seen so many of these kinds of movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In what way did this film do me as a filmmaker? It was an attempt to prove that there is some truth to the "bulldozing" controversy, and that people do not buy or even believe the claims of the anti-vaccination parents, but the results are no longer than mediocre. I mean, if you really want to see a movie about a movie - perhaps a documentary - with some serious allegations in it, you should at least be willing of the opportunity. You might want to look at this movie as a documentary and a piece of history, but for all that it is an empty movie and a bad, meaningless film.  The actors are bad, they don't act. This film is so bad, so bad I would never recommend it to anyone. I'm not sure if it would ever be a "real" movie.  There are a few interesting characters in the film. There are characters who I would definitely agree would be better as "real life" characters. I don't care what happens to them, but my heart says they are the sort of people that live in a sort of real world, and if they do things that would happen in the real world they would live in peace. However, there are people who are very unhappy with such characters. In the end, I was disappointed that this film was so bad and I couldn't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found the movie to be utterly and completely bad - I mean absolutely bad - it's just like a bad 'Star Wars' movie. It is also very bad to begin with the plot. It isn't until there is nothing else to do, and then there are few parts that are entertaining (although that's not saying the movie is a fun film) and just the ending seems to be totally contrived, which is why I think the movie could have been better suited for a TV series. Also the story about the children - their parents - really gets to the point where the film feels like it's a series of excuses, which I think that it should have been cut up for this type of film. It would have been much better if there were enough stories to make up for the film. The ending - it has a lot of really lame moments, and it's pretty hard to follow the characters who are actually doing the right thing. Also I would have had to think about the main theme of the movie: what exactly is wrong with children? They are getting so much wrong, and this is clearly explained when the narrator makes the movie and it makes up some points about the concept, but it's really boring and really there are no real revelations that were intended in the movie. I think this movie has some of the worst acting of the 'StarWars' series, and that's why it is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of the movies I've seen.  There's nothing redeeming about the movie. It's supposed to be the "ultimate" movie. I guess it is. But there is nothing redeemable about it. It shows the "hunkers" acting on "haze" just like they would a movie. The movie has absolutely no dialogue whatsoever. If you get into a fight, you never see the characters actually talk. The actors aren't acting, the directors aren't directing, and the cinematography is completely terrible. I don't know why this movie is so bad, and I don�t know what it's about. The story is terrible and the acting isn't good. It wasn't until I had seen the pilot episode that I realized that this movie was bad. But then I was surprised that it was good.  This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I know what I've been saying. The only good thing about it is that it's an incredibly stupid film. That's good, if you�ll enjoy it, but you'll have to waste time. I've had a really good movie on one and it was very good. There's also some interesting dialog. I just can't believe that I have to say it. I can�t recommend it because of its low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can agree with everyone else out there that this movie was not very interesting or even interesting. I can really see what the other reviewers have said so far, so I'm going in.  But here I'm having to laugh!  What is the point of this film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of lazy writing and boring story sequences that are hard to follow. The story is very poor and there are no funny jokes or funny scenes. There is little humor in this movie and there is little entertainment. Some of the acting is poor as the characters are predictable and not funny or funny. The characters are also very clichéd and the humor is very bad. Even for a horror movie, I would not recommend this one as a 3/10.  The acting is bad, the scenes are bad, and the acting has bad taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was excited to see this film when I read the negative review. I was hoping that there was some positive review for this movie. It was really a complete waste of time. I wasn't even bothered by the music in the video. The whole thing could be made up of the scenes from the other movies that they had put in. But don't take any of their words for granted. It looks as if it was an adult film. I don't think that's too high of a praise for those who just don't want to waste time on this crap. I give this film two stars out for having the worst acting in a very bad movie. The acting is about the worst of the poor movies out there, but what happens to the good? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping this would go straight out and give me an answer like it's been used elsewhere so i'd find out a positive review about it.  A whole lot of the action in this movie is very stupid. The dialog is very simplistic and there's no time for dialog. It's also not very interesting. There's nothing to the dialog either. The movie ends abruptly and there are no surprises. I've seen better movies in my career. And it's really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of people out there who know the real name of this movie. So I'm guessing the most likely person to be aware of this name is an asshole. I do like the fact that this movie got it's name, and some of the jokes it made. But most of the rest of the stuff is the same as the original. What's the point? Well, I think this is a very, um, weak movie. I'll admit I laughed at the last one I saw. I had to pull it off the shelf so that I didn't have it on.  But I know it's funny. There are a few really good jokes, but they're not funny. They just make you sad. The movie has one redeeming feature though, which is that it's hilarious to watch for a few minutes, and then have the guy say that you don't like it.   I think there are a couple of people who would like it, but I won't tell them. It isn't really a comedy, but a really poor movie with no real plot, and no real ending. I won pick a 10, and it wasn't even good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on the 10th anniversary of my wife's wedding. I loved it to my wife for a short time. Now it's a long time and it's time to watch something bad with a director. I'll start watching this movie over again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie twice before. There was never any plot or acting, even in the early part of the movie. Then in the new version, it's still really bad, but I think that it's got some improvement. The director changed. I'm not sure why he changed, but it sure did take off some of the bad parts, and a better version of the script. That is the one you want, but there are so few parts that it wouldn't work. In the last one, I found a huge portion of the dialogue. The actors' voices weren't at all good, and the acting was terrible. Some of the dialog and acting were weak, especially the one that ended with "the dead guy," I found the script and acting utterly lacking. Some parts of the film were better than the original version, but most of them were just not good enough to stand up in a film. Also, it was so long between the scenes that it seemed to be impossible to determine where they were. The movie had some of its own funny moments, but a lot of the scenes were simply pointless, with no real ending. I just did not want this to be an "comedy" movie, but the original one is much better than this. There are some funny elements. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even imagine why this movie went to the top of the list. There were a couple of good moments, and the acting was good, but the acting wasn't that good. The only thing that made the movie worthwhile was that there wasn't any action in the movie. I don't know why, but it could be because the actor's really good. So, the only question I had to ask was if they really had an idea about how to make it. So... this movie is one of the worst movies of all time, not only because the acting is bad, but because there's no suspense, there's absolutely no idea of how to suspend the movie, or how to keep it from ending. There aren't any clues as to how to stop this movie in a way, and don't get into the end-of-the-movie drama. This movie didn't help me much, since I hadn't seen any other movie that was actually made in this world, but i still think it's one of my least favorite movies ever. I hope this doesn't happen again... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was fun to watch, but this movie was just not fun. There were no funny scenes or funny jokes. The story could be interesting if it actually happened. But the acting was poor, and the acting and dialog were terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A remake of The Last Movie, a remake of a horrible sequel of an "Shakot Me With Your Mouth".  In the original "Shaky" the original movie "Shaka" was the first person to be infected by an alien parasite on the surface of the moon. Since the new version we will see that the alien parasite was once an ordinary human (the movie takes place on Earth in the late 1980's). It has apparently been put back together in the new sequel "Shash" which does not have any real relevance to the plot.  Also the alien is called "Shalk", an abbreviation of "Shanka" which stands for "Shack". It is an alien from outer space who is to go for a short ride with the main character "Kara" (who is a Japanese TV soap opera actor, presumably in the early 1970's). He and the alien are to "reach back to the moon" on the Moon where they are in.  The movie is simply another remake of the original and the director has made a bad imitation of a terrible movie. This movie has nothing to give it a credibility and is not to be taken seriously as a serious film. The movie was supposed to be a comedy and even got some funny lines in the beginning, but the ending is disappointing. If the alien had not been so terrible and the movie was not made as an over-the-counter comedy it would have been an absolute disappointment. The fact that the Alien was in space and was able to do a flying drill shows why the movie has such a low rating. I believe the actor's name was just for the comedic element of the movie, and his role was never important. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie is not only horrible, but a failure of any type. I was very unhappy at the fact that it seemed to be so long. I have never played games that seemed so dull for a full hour. There was just so much bad jokes. A very sad movie was the only one that I gave out. I mean it was hard to watch but there were some good laughs. The acting was OK, but there was nothing funny. The music was not good either. The characters were not good. There wasn't a very funny character nor was there anything funny to relate to the film. I think this movie was just an excuse to make the money. I guess it's not a good movie for anyone. I can't believe the filmmakers would even make a positive review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film there is an awful scene involving a bunch of people trying to kill an entire bunch of fire ants. The best that I can find is the line at the end and the "mowing" part. But the rest of the film is just plain bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like it because I can't find the name of the original director, but my opinion is it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I get it because it is so lame and predictable that I can only imagine that the writer has a sense of humor and wants to take the joke. I'm not saying this directly, but it's something so bad that I wanted to see it as it made me laugh very hard, but I didn't. It was so bad I didn 'eck off' my life and rent a good movie for cheap, but this is so bad it hurts my eyes. I give the writer credit to his hard-work and to the fact that he is a well-known writer but he didn't deliver me a good screenplay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical, unapparent story. There's no story to the film. The film is very short and no plot is explained. This means no one could relate to the story. The ending, which is supposed to be a plot, is actually not. The story is based on the story of the movie. The movie is terrible. The camera effects look good and the actors don't have good looks, even for a soap opera. One of the acting roles was, as you can see now, played by a guy who had a major role in an original movie (Rufus Jones).  Overall, this movie is just a bad soap opera, not an original film. What's the difference between watching a movie about a soap actor who was a guy to watch, or about a movie which is about a man who doesn't act properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be a comedy about a family on a ranch with a bunch of cattle. But it turned into a comedy of very uninteresting stereotypes and an ugly plot that seemed to be out of place.  There was no dialog in this movie, but the main character was definitely the one who cared about the cows. I couldn't even find the words he used. Also the fact that he was only in his first movie. It seemed to take place in the middle of a long vacation. There is absolutely no comedy going on in the movie, and it would be nice to have the cow's life on this movie to continue. This movie could probably be made for a few minutes, but it would just be the same as the first one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie when I was reading some reviews online about it on the IMDb site and I was very disappointed. As an actor, it was very odd. What it should have done was made one of many of Hollywood's worst movies. It's not even remotely funny to watch and it's not really scary. It starts off so fast, very fast and goes on in very fast fashion without any sense of plot. The characters are so predictable, and nothing interesting comes out of it. I really would have to watch it again and laugh until it stops. The other point of note was the casting of Jessica Alba. I think it's interesting to note that she's not an actor and just a normal actress, not a great one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie not at all enjoyable, it is a very weak story. The only good thing about this film was the characters. It just happened that nobody really cared about it. What a waste of time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why this film. This is one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. You're told of the film's incredible plot, plot, and story. But don't listen to this film's plot, which is simply an unoriginal story told in the book that has nothing to do with the film. The film is also bad as a story it lacks one plot element, namely an ending, which I believe the filmmakers should have left out of the book. Also, the acting was pretty silly. It should have gone straight to video if they hadn't filmed the movie in that way, and the cinematography in the film is OK, but it lacked some things that were important to the story.  This film has some very odd characters. Most of them were stereotypical stereotypes of a typical American white-haired person, but the ones that are less stereotypical are the ones who had to die at some point, and that's what the story is about. Some of them seemed to act "normal" at times, but that's not important. The ones that weren't in the story were the ones like the ones in the "Shine" series. The lead character, Michael Ryan is a very stereotypical character. The character "Maria" is the one who had "a major role in the movie" and then dies in a horrible death. We never hear her cries in the novel, and there are times where she cries in another direction, which we never do. There were no real emotion to the film in this movie, not even in the end of the movie.   There are some interesting lines in the ending. I believe that the movie was a bad film for the book, not a good film for other reasons. Although, the film did its job and made me laugh, it could have been better. There is nothing positive to be found in this film whatsoever, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a year, I can see why I was getting this movie: The plot is a waste of money, the ending is annoying and the acting is bad. I like I was given some of the good moments in the movie, like the part where a group of friends gets into a lot of drugs with the director. It just shows who is the worst person you have ever seen.   There are a few moments in a few spots that are mildly funny. But the rest of it is awful. The ending is so weak it is annoying to watch. I'm not sure if this movie will have its place in the "10 Best" list (for lack of a better movie), or if the director will ever write a negative movie review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a sad time in the history of American film and TV, with all the terrible and terrible movies and TV shows and other productions. So sad. This movie is not only bad but also the worst in the American film-making history. I've seen this one on some of my late college campuses in the past few years and I just cannot find any of the other comments in the forums.  What's the point of all this? The first three quarters I've been reading (and I'm not going through all 3 quarters) is to get the movie to get out of its own. The last quarter I have seen has been a movie that completely destroys the quality of American films (i.e. American television shows, etc.). It also gets into the movie business, which is about a lot of money for a film, and it is about the most money anyone can have for a movie.  The movie was really bad in the sense that it was totally unfair to the film-makers who made it and the other actors who did it. The first person to emerge was the movie director. He was a movie director, but I thought he was the worst of American movie-making. His film was so bad it could be forgotten about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie two stars out of 10. I didn't like this movie because it had a ridiculous plot. The story was weak, but that's not a big problem. I was worried about the direction and the acting, but in a few of the scenes I really appreciated the acting. I also had to agree with the director and producers that there wasn't enough to make the movie entertaining, especially in the beginning. If you're looking for a "The Dark Knight" movie, you might as well stop looking. It wasn't well acted, and if you love movies then, you'll find a good one. But if you can't stand the dialog then you might want to have a "Killer" sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the cast, but the acting wasn really bad. There was some good casting, a couple of good scenes, but there were just awful moments. I felt like I'd been sitting through a movie that sucked the life out of me.  There were so many problems with the story, the acting, and the direction. I didn't get the feeling that it had any impact on anyone else.  Overall, this movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen, in my opinion. I give this one two stars out because, though I don't know what the cast is, the characters themselves were interesting. I just didn't know how to get into this movie. If you were going to spend $300 dollars at a movie, I'd recommend spending $10 bucks, but only if you liked "The Dark Nevil". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just had me questioning whether it is the best horror movie ever made and the worst horror movie, this is not worth watching at all. You're a bit scared of what you see. The acting is bad. The gore was terrible and some of the lines seemed to have been put together, or seemed as if they had just one part of a line. The ending was the weakest part of the movie. The end is the worst ending to ever made. The special effects are unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never laughed so much in such a movie. The acting is bad, the storyline and the characters are not interesting, and I cannot figure out what is happening. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish the actor would quit doing it because it was so dull, and boring! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It seems like this movie is for kids, and when I got older and was in my mid teens, it seemed like a good movie to watch. I thought I was in for some good movies and I liked some of them, but this movie was bad. The movie was so bad it seemed even worse than the original one I gave the name. I wasn't surprised that the original director was so busy that he didn't write much about the original movie. I did wonder why the original film had fans so angry with it.  It is pretty obvious what the point of this film was. The story is weak and the characters were bad, but I found it interesting. I didn't feel like it was about kids. It just isn't worth watching.  The actors were too silly. They were silly when they got old. They aren't good enough to be in movies.  I think that it was one of a really bad movie. Not one to enjoy, but just bad is about all the other crap movies. The only good thing about the movie was that it got around one and a half of the first movie in the plot and got the second one through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. It was supposed to be for a comedy and it's supposed to have a few funny moments. It's just a little too long and it should not be funny but it's not too funny. A few people who weren't familiar with the previous two shows should check this one out for awhile, if they are even mildly interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie fails in all the important areas that made this one good film. The acting is bad, the music is terrible and the acting is weak. It's not worth watching.  The best thing about the movie is how much fun it had to have, because you have an idea of who the characters are and how they feel about each other. This is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting that they'd do some of these like with this film, but I wasn't. I had high hopes. I was hoping for an original "HOLI" film with a good plot and good actors. Alas, this movie was pretty crappy. The story is the same as "Halloween" and most of the cast do not even get to any of their scenes in the film. I don't think it's supposed to be a horror film at all, and what's the point? Well, I guess I'm just giving this movie a chance.  But let me tell you one good thing about it... when it comes out on DVD, don't buy it. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it is still one of the worst movies I've seen since I was 15. It was about time, considering how bad it is, and how long it has been, but at least I was able to see some of the films in the video store. The plot is pretty weak, but the actors don't look good, and the ending is OK. I found it much easier to sit through the film than to watch it and write a negative negative review. The casting of the two leads is OK, if you need to know a bit about the characters. But the acting was bad and if you don't know the characters or know them, you might just be left without the sense of empathy. Also, a character called the "Old Lady" is in the beginning of the film and gets killed by an invisible demon. But you can never find out the details. The only thing I didn't like was how the "old Lady" felt. She had no emotion, no feeling. I didnno other emotion. She was a little bit scared, but she was terrified for the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script is really bad, the acting is not good, the story is not funny or interesting. I'm really sick of all these people.  All my thoughts point out how bad this movie was. The story is basically just a bunch of three actors who try to go on the opposite side of everyone else, and then get tangled with each other, and finally gets into a situation that can't be explained. The script isn't anything special or interesting, the characters are weak, and the dialog is just bad and annoying. But if you get the plot, enjoy it, the good dialog are there. but you should probably not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have really come to regret this movie. My first reaction to the first 20 minutes of this movie was that this is an awful movie. After watching it again and again and finally starting to get into it, it seems that I am going to regret it again. I mean that I really do like this movie, but I really don't want to waste any time watching it. The story is a generic horror movie. The girls don't seem to interact well, with the exception of Sarah (I think she gets the best lines. But her character is the most ridiculous and over-the-the -body of the film ever) and her character who seems to be a loving person, in fact. The acting is simply awful, with bad-acting/bad characters who look like they are not in the best situations at all and don't really have anything to do with each other characters, in the end. This movie really needs to go away. The plot is basically just a few loose strings, some of which are actually funny. Of course I've seen it twice, and the actors aren't funny, but it still seems to work. It does not take all of the time. But it is still very bad. In the end I am thankful to my girlfriend who is a big movie buff and knows how to make funny movies. She never got tired of this one. She also knew that this movie wasn't a good movie, and gave me an idea for a funny movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm only having trouble finding any good review. It's just not good. I've seen some of those films before, and some that had more than a good ending. It was so bad. I don't know if they have a director to teach or just a person who can take out the whole thing. But I would hope that one day they would try a second time, because if it's such a bad thing, then I would want them to try to make it better. It wasn't really a mystery, it was just a bunch of people who are too stupid to try and put it together. The ending was pretty good. At least they didn't take the opportunity to make a good movie. Some of the scenes were too long. At the end there are three scenes that don't quite make sense, but other scenes are good, like the introduction scene. The people should be able to do better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like the movie. The characters were just really bad. The dialog was totally stupid. It made me cringe when I heard the dialog. I'm a guy who has nothing in common with the characters but that's not a big surprise. Even the ending is stupidly stupid. The director should be ashamed to come out of the genre. If it was made in school or even a drama school, I wouldn't even recommend it. It would be no way to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand this is just a few minutes and I don't even have any idea why it was in this movie. I know that it's one of the first movies from the 70's, but it's too early to say that they were in love at the same time as this one. It has a great title, but the music isn't even that good and the acting was not that good. It was a pity in the early 70's when the actors and writers had good material. I think that the writers did the best they could with their effort. They were not to blame for this movie, as some of the cast were very good, and some of them were very talented. They just made the movie worse by making it so bad.  It's been 20 years, but who can tell us that it was that bad? It would be much easier if the creators tried to make some nice stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In retrospect, I was surprised at the final version. I think the production company is one of the worst places to create a fake video.  If the director was to be a producer, he should make better video! He should use better editing tools and he should write a positive review about the movie: 1  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is so bad. I'm surprised that it didn't get any attention. The acting is flat and unbelievable. I've seen this in many times. There are probably some movies you've seen so many of that you know the only one that has gotten some decent work. And, even worse, it's not funny. I was very tired of watching it. I found myself going in to watch it so I was bored. I really hate it. The main character is an idiot. There was some interesting moments, and the acting is OK, but this movie could have been better. I just wish it could have gotten some of the humor it had. The point is that, for those of us who like funny, it wasn't for the fans. It was for the people who think nothing of movies, and that are the only people who enjoy this movie. I think if you want to laugh, you should get a second chance. This movie has no redeeming quality. It would be funnier if it actually had any comedy. If it had any humor, you'd be sad less. It is just a way to ruin your day, and it just wastes a lot of money. It's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie and I find it to be the worst of the three. I found the first two "real" movies (I found the two that were based on the original and other ones that were made after the "real life" movie) to be better than this movie. This movie is just another trash heap, an absolute waste of time, and it has absolutely no idea how to make it a comedy. What a disappointment. The only funny part of the movie is when the real life actor comes to Hollywood, apparently to see the film. I don't know why, but I find the movie to be an advertisement for a movie with no plot, and the director seems to be in a panic and tries to get in the face of his own stupidity.  The best way to kill this movie is having a fire extinguisher, so it's impossible to breathe. I'm going to tell you, even if you have a fireman, I would definitely recommend you to get a real fire extinguator. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that it is a bad film. What was the point of creating the movie? I think it was to kill off all the female characters. There is absolutely no idea in it that any of them are even good or decent ladies. I don't think that any girls can be good that way. They all are just boring. Some of them were funny, but other of them just plain boring. The girls are just weak and uninspiring. This is awful, but I think that the director was probably very scared and probably scared it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was shocked. I am still a fan of "Cinderella." I loved the "Civinomancy," a great musical drama. "Civilia" is even less impressive, but "Cappinomancer" is worse than that.  This movie's not even a horror movie at all; it is just an interesting piece of junk. I just got tired of watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this show a few months ago, I really liked it for the humor and acting. But unfortunately this movie wasn't as funny as I thought it was. The acting was bad, the story was just bland and boring, and the whole thing seemed to be so predictable that it really bore me. Even though the movie started off ok, it fell completely apart by the end. This movie has the worst ratings I have ever seen out of a movie on Netflix, with the worst rating of 5/10 in the state of Texas.  If you are one of those that believe there are going to be funny dialog in this movie, then you will lose that interest after this film.  But I know there are plenty of people out there who do find humor in it. I think that's only fine if they really enjoy this show. The movie needs to be taken straight to the ground so that people can enjoy it. The film isn't that good, and people will lose interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My reaction is how terrible it is. I have the same reaction to it that you would expect from the first "film" that I've seen. I want the film to lose any appeal as it is, and I hate all things made this way. A man can't be that bad. I'm still getting the same same feeling now that I thought of all those movies when I was watching it.  I can forgive some of the movies, but those films are so bad. They are like a car with the old car paint, and a little girl with hair dyed in the front and she's sitting in the middle of a long, long night of disappointment. They aren't even good, but they are so awful, that I really want to throw the car into the street and go through the drive, just to see them. If I didn't like the car, there would be no point to seeing the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is weak, the acting is very bad, the pace of the plot is too fast for any time, and the action scenes are too easy to get a decent one in.  However, I must say this movie had good action sequences. I must have watched it on the DVD, but my only suggestion is that the directors should send them to the studios for their time. I can't say this bad movie is a bad sequel, because it has a good premise, but it's not a good sequel. I just wish these people would take some of the time they wasted to make the film better. I really want to see more of their talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised by the last words. I was also surprised by how some of the quotes are. I'm just plain sad. This movie is about nothing. There's a little thing that's pretty funny, but I don't know whether they're going to repeat that. But in order to avoid spoilers, I'll have to start watching the same way I used to see these actors at their end. You could also just go by them.  There are so many mistakes in this movie as well as I'm sure there will be more than I can make out. The film started off promising but had the first movie on it already.  This movie was not one to be taken seriously. But if you're in the middle of a lot of things in this world, you need to have a break from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm surprised to see such an insane comparison that I could only find on IMDb. This movie fails to make any semblance of an entertainment. This was the end in the most painful way I've ever experienced in my life, so I can't say I have been better than a year ago. It wasn't much better than an ordinary bad movie, and I'd probably even put it in the category of bad movies (though, I have seen better). A lot of the scenes were the sort of "wah! I was drunk!" kind of scenes. In any case, I didn't like it and I never look for the good ones. The acting was bad and the dialog was terrible. Some of the lines were funny, but the ones that are just so corny and unrealistic are just OK. The plot seemed pretty typical of all kinds of movies, and they couldn't make up any of their parts.  I'm not sure if this is a horror movie, or if it is a comedy. The only thing I can say about the film is that it's a complete failure of interest for its own sake. I don't have to see this again, but I'll definitely check it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has the worst acting of any film I have ever seen. I was looking at it, hoping to find some good reviews. I did. And I'm still looking. It's just awful, and it never gets old. I'm sorry, I really have no idea what it is.  I am sure the filmmakers had no idea. I guess it was just plain bad. The characters were weak and there wasn't any real plot. And all the special effects in the film were absolutely horrible! The music, too. It wasn't music at all. The only good thing about it was the scenery. But after all, it was supposed to be a film. I would never think a movie of this kind was made. It was a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the old "Bury's Day", and that is my one big reason why I am writing this review. But this movie is much worse. The plot is bad and the characters are bad. The soundtrack isn't even good and is simply bad. There is no good soundtrack. There isn't any good music or even good dialog. The acting is bad, and I have to say that I didn't know who it was, and that makes me even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie begins on a pretty, and completely predictable, but very stupid. The story is pretty stupid, but not as cheesy as some of the other horror films out there. The other good thing is that the acting is good, but that's not the best. The only thing that makes this movie bad is the acting, and the fact that it takes place in a real-life setting is the only thing makes it not a movie. It isn't funny, and it doesn't seem to really be scary. You don't get the sense of a plot, and you don't really get the vibe of an impending, scary story, but you get the feeling that you've seen too many horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a shame in film history. A movie which could have been filmed at the end of the 20th century was given a special edition in the late 70's. This movie was never made to release. In fact, there was only a single print of the original version. It is so bad that I was hoping that the remake would improve it.  There is also a copy of the film that is supposed to have been made in a museum. There are several scenes of the movie that were supposed to be filmed in Hollywood. It turns out that all these actors and actresses and crew members that appear in the movie were really dead or even did not exist at all.  The entire plot of the plot is an uninteresting one and a poor adaptation of a movie that could have made much worse in the original. The plot was based on a series of "mature" films from Europe and America. Those films made the movies worse and were quite serious and scary; this movie is not one of them. It has a plot but it was not one that a mature movie should even have.  What is funny about this movie, is that it is so lame that it makes anyone afraid to see it. The whole premise of the title is to be a comedy. It does not seem like any comedy to me, and even if you can watch it, it would be pretty dull. The film has more of a slap-down tone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first 15 minutes of the film, I was really angry. This is not just an average film, it's just completely boring. The cast and the dialog are not good and the acting is poor. The plot is not good either and there are even some clichéd lines thrown in the plot.  There are no decent scenes at all, except the main character, which is never shown. The movie just repeats a few old jokes that are already dated. A simple story about a bunch of people who's dying in their lives and trying to find the time to be a better person. How can someone that wants to be better still let their children lose so much and be miserable?  I was extremely unhappy with the movie. The best part of the movie was when they were walking away from the cemetery and the priest said that there is nothing to do, that's when we all get depressed. I would never recommend this movie as a film, but it's OK to laugh about it if you're laughing about how bad the movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like to hear a man complain about a movie: don't listen to my whining (this movie is about a sex movie with an annoying girl). This movie is the worst film I've ever seen, ever. The acting is bad, the story is bad. I do not understand the premise, the premise is bad...  All in all this bad movie - and it is only a problem for me if I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot say that this movie is one of the worst movies ever put to the screen. I watched this movie on Youtube on a 3.4 channel.  When I got to the last scene, I sat in the theater and watched the whole thing. I was thinking what was wrong with the scene. The last scene with the man is not at all realistic. I cannot believe that the writers that made this movie even bothered about making it to begin with. It is like the writer was put together an idea to finish this movie and then decided to try making it.  So, when I look at this movie, I'm not going to say that it's great, because it does not really make any sense and the ending is ridiculous. This movie doesn't make any clear connection between the characters. There's nothing that feels like a movie at all. It's just a bad, bad, terrible movie. And the director is obviously trying to avoid all of it. I recommend a better version of this movie: the first movie was far better than this one. In fact, I recommend watching that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has the best names for the characters. I have to say that one of the actors, "David Mitchell" has looked and acting like a man, not a teenager. Other acting like "David Wills" would look and acting as if they were young adults, and the characters are very stupid, and even their characters are not the smartest in the world.  You can't take any of the characters seriously.   Don't watch this movie. It's one of those "Daryss" movies where everything has a meaning, but none really matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible, I found the whole thing rather ridiculous. In one area I found myself laughing. I found it hilarious that the actor in this movie is going to be in his career again. It's just a total waste of time. There is no idea what to do with a sequel to a bad film. The only thing that I think makes it worthwhile is the ending. What was once funny to me was now I find myself laughing at the ending... but only for some of the parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a recent review I received this movie. In a small film theater I had seen this movie before I had read it. I wasn't even a fan of it. This movie seemed to have been written and directed by the same team of producers who are currently directing the movie "The Hunger Games".  It was a very confusing and confusing movie and the writing seemed extremely confusing with every other piece of the story. The whole time I thought I was watching it I felt like I had two minds working with me.  It seemed like it had a few elements in place to make it somewhat believable.  The whole plot seemed to start to drift apart as the movie ended around the same time it was about to finish. I think I was in the middle of the movie. The ending didn't work.  I don't even care if I had any rating rating. The movie is about as bad as the Hunger Games sequel. The only reason I give this movie is that it is one of the worst things I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been so disappointed by a bad film! It is sad that this one has only won awards for being the best film at the time.  I am not sure if the author of this film is aware of the true meaning of the movie. This film needs to be banned for everyone involved in this movie. It is about a small village that has been looted of some gold. The village is not big enough to provide a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was designed to be a little slapstick comedy. Instead of a slapstick movie, it turns into a real death match. This movie could not take itself seriously. And it was designed as a low budget. The script is so bad it's not funny at all. The ending doesn't make sense. It's awful. The story is poor. The characters are so awful they don't come close. But this is a movie meant to be an overkill type comedy, and it's that kind of fun anyway. Avoid it if you have no respect for this movie. The plot is so poor it's no good if the characters are interesting. It would have had some funny moments if they got close to the characters. The movie would be better if they could get close to some of the characters and the script was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first hour of the film is a disappointment; the rest of it is very good. There are lots of horrible scenes, and the ending is very stupid. But the second hour makes the film better. There's a new actor who hasn't been in this film before. The story takes place in a forest somewhere, and one of the men (who happens to be a farmer, apparently) tries to get his wife in for a second time, despite the fact that she's pregnant. He is killed in an accident, and then, for some reason, he gets murdered. The film follows his wife (and the farmer's son, but he is never identified by name). We finally find out that the farmer is dead, and his son is distraught. So the story begins again, and begins to become stupid. It could have been better with an interesting person, and some good dialog. It just loses any credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were the stars at the start, but the plot was completely lacking, too many unnecessary locations (and they were only used to give the ending of the movie) and didn't get much attention.   So many of the story lines were pointless and the acting was laughable.  And the ending wasn't original, but it did give me hope.  I'm sorry for being able to watch this film for so long and hope I never saw it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has two things going for it; the first being the name of the lead actor (not too bad) and the second being the lack of good ideas about a movie. So the film starts with a seemingly interesting plot. The other problem is the plot.  The plot is very predictable, with an unnecessarily complicated subplot in a car accident that involves the old lady that is the driving, the driver and a woman named Mrs. Lacy. Once we get to the plot, it starts to get predictable.  While the first movie starts with the name Dr. A. A., the second movie starts out with the title Dr. B., which has the problem of being incomprehensible. Once they have gotten to the second plot, they get to a third plot that starts with Dr. C. C., which is a bit better. That's not the main problem. The problem is with the end-credits. In the previous movie, we've seen the first half of the movie, which is good. The end-joke movie starts off with the character Dr. Lacey being killed, and her husband takes her in his arms and drags her into an alley. (I think the first title is "She was a little girl").  The next thing is that there's an ex-wife, named Lacey.  Then there's a guy named Eddie (also called "Mr. A" on the website, the name I've found), who is the father of Lacey's family.  This leads us to the beginning of the next movie, and everything gets complicated when they get into a car crash. A man named Mr. A gets into an accident that goes very far in the wrong direction of killing Dr. D., a policeman called Mr. B. who is with a friend named Mr D. In this movie, there is a scene where a car crashes into a subway that turns into an explosion. It turns out that the car drifts under there is Mrs. E. Lushin, who is in the midst of an abortion operation. You will see Lacey and the doctor and Mr. C's friend drive her to the subway that explodes when she is in it, and everyone is screaming at her for not wanting to have her help. That is also the only scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot in the movie. It's the scene where she and the ex-husband are in the next room. Lancy is trying
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just doesn't work. I can hardly find a positive review about the movie. I was not very interested in this film, and so I watch it in two days and didn't even bother to watch it again. I think it is just a very bad movie, but what does this mean? Well...  I don't see what it could be, and I think that the acting seems very weak. I also think that it is a very low budget movie, and some of the scenes in the film seem to have been quite boring, and there are times where I just couldn't even find the words that they were saying. The film is also lacking in the quality of the movie that was intended, and a lot of the dialog and the dialog is so bad that I found myself having trouble listening to it. But I think the good part of it was that there is still a lot to the film. Some of the actors really did good. But it didn't help me at all. There is some good work in this movie, that's for sure. I don\'t believe that the story is totally screwed up, or that the movie is so serious that it could affect a person's life. I hope the story of this film was good in the beginning, and that this movie never truly became a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a complete waste of time. No story and not even some special effects of the main characters. This movie is about the main character (Bobby the singer of "the group") and a bunch of guys who think they are special to "the movie" (the gang).  You will have to believe this character is special and get his soul ready for the end.  This movie was supposed to be about a romantic love story of the female lead singer, a woman who has had trouble in finding herself in many ways because she has a boyfriend (and has no interest in men and not really in the film) and gets into an intense relationship with a guy who has known her for years and is in a real relationship with the girl (Bobs).  There is a very weak, but very shallow plot. There is no romance of any kind, no romance is there and no story is there. It just has a story of some guy who is an evil villain. What else is the story?  A lot of things seem to be making this movie not worth of its own. But I guess the makers had a good idea of how to make something so bad. This is the worst film I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I read the plot. I was skeptical. I thought they were really interesting, not that a lot of them had very interesting characters and I thought the casting was OK but just don't like it. There were very few interesting and interesting things in the movie. What really matters was that we never, for the whole duration, got to find out who the lead character was. He was so boring. I could never quite find out what the hell was going on with this guy. It was the beginning of a bad sequel, I guess that is where I get my heart of the movie is. I really wanted to stop making these movies, I think I'd probably watch the original and watch it. But don't go out of your nose just yet. It isn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So we finally decided to give it a try. It was about the same performance to the earlier movies, so the story and a script had some of the same feel, but the direction and performance is so bad that it was almost laughable. There were two great sequences (one about the final days of the war and the one about the last time the Germans attacked the city), but the others were pretty pointless and made the movie less than one half hour long. I laughed, as I saw how weak the acting was, I laughed. It's no surprise that people who are going to watch this are people like me.  It was far from worth my time, and I don't think I'll ever finish it, but it's a shame that we wasted it. I guess it is just a bunch of bad propaganda, and we should have stayed away from it. The other one was a horror movie of no merit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, when I saw this movie, I was annoyed. I don't know how to even start explaining this movie. The only thing I can point out is that there are many reasons why this movie sucks. Its characters, the plot, the acting, the sound, the camera work, the production values, etc. It all sucks. The best part about this movie is that I can see how this movie makes a lot of money, but I donth give it any respect.  I really want to put a positive review about bad movies:  Well this movie really sucks! I could probably tell you why it was a bad choice, but there are some things, such as an extra shot and the end scenes. Also, I would like to say that I was able to see some of the other movies I've seen that were a pretty good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I'm reading this review I can tell by the words "unfazed" that the director was involved in this movie. I'm also aware that it's been in the same period (since 1970) and has remained. In that sense it is almost an unwritten, or even more unreadable, version of the classic "Wah-Hah" movies.  I was hoping it was just a poorly constructed movie. There's not even a script. A few days into the movie I was left wondering why this movie was being made so fast. Some of the scenes could have been better filmed. There was a few things that were obvious, like the opening scene where a couple is sitting together, looking at the baby. When the "honey" has a baby, it's just a couple in a room looking at one another couple. The same sort of scenes appear in "Death of Mary" and "Cinderella" too. The only other reason I can think about was the lack of a female character with a strong and distinctive personality. I'd prefer to see one of the other main characters in this film, like Jean Reno (who was just part of the cast), as the primary female character.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a 4 out 10 rating, even though I laughed to watch the first time I saw it, which I did in my life. This movie doesn't work as a comedy, but there is plenty of stupid jokes that you can chuckle at. The humor is weak, and most of the jokes are not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had the potential to be so interesting. I found it a little hard to accept that the characters were acting with each other. At times, the action was good. The dialog were very bad. What were they? Two of them? If they were two good actors who both really liked each other, who would have liked them to act with each others?  The other problem was that it wasn't obvious enough that these two actors were in fact acting with one another.  And the movie doesn't really contain any interesting plot or plot.   There is some decent entertainment in the movie. Some of the dialog are interesting but not nearly interesting. It was hard to really understand that the lead girl would be the same person in the whole world.  The characters don't really have all that much depth, though.  So, I guess I'll just let my friends out in the meantime and not even bother watching the movie unless I want to. The movie is so bad it would ruin any time spent watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film so many times, but most of the time I thought it was too shallow to be an interesting film. However, it is very interesting, at least for an occasional viewing, to see some of the cast on-screen and get to know a bit of the characters, particularly, the lead actor.  I was wondering what the hell this movie was about. It's really sad that the show lasted on so long.  The film starts with a lot of plot holes, a very superficial one at that. They're there to have a bit less substance, and so, I'm not going to give any extra credit to the movie, as it relies too heavily on a really weak premise.  They are going all over the place, but at least I can see what the people are thinking about at the end. They are acting with characters that are much less interesting than the cast. The most important thing about the film is that there's only one really good person in the cast, and that person is not in this movie to save.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director was not very careful with this film, but it seems as though the actors were playing their parts as well as most of the dialogs.  The story was good enough, but unfortunately the ending failed to last.  Overall the movie is not a bad, but the film is not funny, it's not good, it just plain bad. The actors are a bit funny, and the camera is not good. If you don't really care for this film then don't watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty good when it first aired on PBS. But now it is getting a lot worse. The whole point of the story is the "haunting" of the child who is in the care of a young man. The acting is pretty bad but most of the dialog is OK. The character is also pretty stupid and there is a scene where we watch the man go on his way through a car. But most of all, it should have gone to the end at least by an hour and a half. And finally, the acting is bad. I don't know why people thought they'd like this movie.  This was a terrible movie to watch in any of its genre. A movie that had never aired anywhere and hasn't been rated by the media?  I'd be interested in finding some real good film that doesn't have to be rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, I'm guessing, was about a very fake "film" about the life of a single mother of eight children. They have never had a marriage, they have never even moved out of their house. It's all fake, but the point is that this movie would be better suited to a young girl like mine. I was hoping they would have made a better film in a way like 'The Wild Life's Death' since it was supposedly a comedy about a single mom who lives in a city full of abandoned children. I'm pretty sure they were making a sequel of a horror movie. The point is to keep the people who are actually alive alive alive, not so their own lives and in fact, I guess a year after their lives. I guess people like me just watching these movies thinking that there is a lot more to say about them than there is. The whole film is filled with bad acting. The most annoying part is that there were so many of the characters who were dead and their mouths were talking. I couldn't stop the movie. I really hate movies like this. They're not only bad, but very unrealistic and boring. I don't even care how realistic it is, I just hate it for what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure you could see something much worse than this. I had to sit through two hours of it in the theater. It was the least interesting and dull movie of my life that I've ever seen. I did not really like this movie because I thought it was completely inept.  Even if you liked this movie, and I thought that it was good, it had absolutely no real potential to become a film to be taken seriously. You've got to laugh with the whole plot, I think.  The script is just plain awful. The characters were simply awful and the acting was really bad. The actors were simply terrible. You just got bored and frustrated by it all. You get sick and disgusted by it, and don't want to see it anymore.  If you just want to be bored, and enjoy a movie, skip it off the shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had many people telling me how horrible this movie was. I couldn't believe them. I mean I couldn think the way to get an idea about what was about this movie had been completely lost to the original cast of the original "Star Wars" trilogy. It's completely embarrassing to even watch the movie.  It's hard to believe the movie would have been made in 1983 to celebrate the 40 year anniversary of the Star Wars. I was never able to find a full review of the "Star Trek" series. I've seen the DVD, but that movie was only on TV and it had absolutely zero relevance to the rest of the world.  I cannot believe the director would think that this would be the definitive version of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie's bad acting, and bad editing, can sometimes seem pretty funny, like some of the TV shows that I used to watch, like "The Last Kiss" and "Wuther's World". But this movie was not the same in the real sense. There are no dramatic ending and almost no suspense. I never felt like there was any suspense whatsoever, and I never found anything. Some scenes in the film were cute, but too long and not enough. It's obvious that this film is supposed to be about a relationship that has ended, but the ending is so predictable that it would have been an interesting comedy if they'd done the opposite. And there are many things about the characters that are not realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film yesterday. What was bad? The plot? The direction? The acting? What was wrong?  I can't really give it an 'F', but that's okay, because the plot wasn't that bad, it had its fair share, and the movie itself could be so, but that didn't help either! The movie was so terrible, I wish I could find out how to actually make it better.  This film is so bad, but I would watch it anyway if I were a fan of it, but it's just so bad. It was so bad that I wish to see some of the other films in the "Worst Films Ever" list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first watched this film when I was 13. I didn't really expect much. I guess I was too young to know what it was going to be. I did expect to be entertained but, instead, the movie was about a bunch of guys that would probably be a little bored. Also, there are no girls who are interested in the story. I'm not going to watch this again, so let me add it to the list so that no one thinks twice about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing I liked about the first movie, in a negative sense.  But I'm glad that the first one was so bad, the second one was better. It was just not funny. If you enjoyed the first film, then this might be the film for you. But if you can't get enjoyment out of it, the film is not for you!  I'm not sure I'll ever enjoy this movie, so my advice is: steer clear of it for your own sake.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm appalled to see any movie with a plot to promote a 'Hook' movie starring Tom Corby, whose character was supposed to be the protagonist of the movie. That's not good for anyone. In fact, this was a bad film. That was just not enjoyable watching this, but the fact that the movie had this kind of storyline, i.e. 'The Bigger Mother', I'm sure it was meant to be a movie about a female leader (again) in an 'Mick' movie. Not one with an 'Gentlemen' ending, but a 'Mimbo' movie with sex, kidnapping, and torture (also that's exactly what the main character is).  The plot was obviously rushed, and I don't even understand why Tom CorBY and Jean Michelle are involved in this movie, but that's not the case of 'HOOK'. It's just a shame, because Tom CorBy and Jean would never even get the opportunity to be involved in the real-life thriller genre of movies. In the end, this is bad for anybody who didn't think of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a short time and in a long time, I was a bit skeptical. I was about as skeptical as the first time was. The movie had many problems. The story was unbelievable. It was absolutely ridiculous to take it seriously. There were no plot lines and it is too long. The actors were bad. The acting was terrible. I think the director who made this movie is a disgrace. He should have tried to fix it. The ending is the worst part of the movie. The only thing that I found at all interesting was the ending. I would have to avoid looking at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film fails in any way. The acting is OK, but the acting seems to have lost its soul. This is one of many of these kind of films. Not only does it not make me think that a person could care for the same sort of movies, but that is clearly how the acting is structured.  I just think the acting was bad. I just wish it didn't have any redeeming qualities. Maybe the actors are good, but I have not seen one good movie with any acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Outback Of An Age" is, at first, an extremely bad film. The plot is pretty predictable, and the action is lacking. But the actors, especially one of the top two leads, are awful. By all standards, this film has to be the worst movie of all time. They don't even look good, but they're all ridiculously over the top and make the movie look like a dastily-design, cheesy, trashy-looking piece of junk, and very poor by comparison with a lot of other action movies. The whole story is pretty bad, but the worst in the category is "Dark Blood". It was my second-best movie, after my first was the original "Blood".  In the context of this film, I actually prefer "Blood" because the plot is less predictable and there are more ways to change the story. "Blood", is like the sequel "Blood 2". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that the director made it. I have to say I saw this in Australia when I went to see it on TV and was very disappointed. I didn't really like it so I left it back on its original CD and never heard it again. Some reviewers have praised it for being a great film, but they didn't. My conclusion is, if you have nothing else to do with this film, don't watch it. It's really just a horrible piece of work that has nothing to offer, in a country where it is usually treated as a masterpiece. If you want to watch it and pretend to follow it, even if you are one of the most devoted of film fans, beware. You will probably be bored if you go through the whole film and are still trying to follow along, or you'll find yourself bored. I really wish I could have given it a free copy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst ever i have ever seen in my life. the first part was great, then it got even worse and it never gets better. The acting is awful and the storyline is weak and the dialog is bad. I give this movie a 1 star. The other 2 stars are not bad either, the only one I would rank is a 4 out 10. The last star is a 2 out 10 as is this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has a lot of problems. First of all, what did you guys expect? That was the first question to ask when the first trailer was released. Well, I guess you get to know the answers.  The film takes about 40 minutes to complete. If you do not read the "making of" story - the opening scene shows what a bad story the first movie was. A man in an office who looks like a man-on-a-phone (his character wears a white, hatless, black hat) is a member of the town's police, because he's looking for his missing daughter. However, his wife is looking for her daughter and she's got the son of the guy, the only son of his daughter's family who's also interested in a car with a big engine. The main character is the local woman who wants to find the son's brother - which is something like a "giant car". You know, in other words, you know that the local family is the kind of family that will throw a man's life away.  Also, the acting is bad as hell. I get that a lot. The voice acting is just OK, the dialog was not too bad - just the fact that it is supposed to be about the main character's life, and that there is no real indication that the film is "real" life - this is a real life. I know, I mean life. Of course, this is not the first film I've seen. I've never read this film so my opinion about the film - although I've read several reviews of it. If I saw it again, I would be less amused.  There are also some jokes that have to be played off.  I don't know why they thought the story was realistic and "real", because it's not about a child falling into an old man's arms. It is about a family who has never cared.   "The first trailer shows the character's face when he walks into the house, so you get a look at the man's face. It's sad to see the man in his 60's, but there is something unpleasant to him, because you get the feeling that he is not doing this in an effort to save his family, but rather, it is in fact in order to win, and you can see in your heart that he's in it's worst need.  You just want to see a character having no reason to do
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing "The Little Mermaid" at the airport when I was little. This movie wasn't even worth seeing, it was like a toy from some toy shop. I was a kid at the time, and I wasn't expecting to find anything decent, I was expecting to be bored. I don't know why people would think a movie made for kids, this is the same type of toy that the toy store stores in Japan have made. This is the most stupid toy I have ever seen. And no matter how much I watched it, my brain never knew that it was actually a toy. I never have been able to get the movie out of my head. And it shows that Disney doesn't understand that this movie has nothing to do with the toy company. It shows that these movies are only about making money and not about entertaining themselves. I remember one time, when I went to see a movie in the theater, I thought it was about a movie for children. The story was about about a child named "Munchy" who was a good kid who didn't want to go into the real world. The movie told a little story about Munchy and how she got a friend to help her. The girl would get bored, and the girl that she would meet with would go out of the city. The kid would take Munch and the friend back to the city, and they would drive Munch to the place Munch was just in town. The only thing Munch said about this story was that she was about to try to go to the "real" world. If it were a story about a girl, she would have gone off and never lived in the real real world and then she would probably get hurt. However, Munch is not in the "Big" world, she's a "fairy" fairy who spends her life in a little cottage. And that's where I really believe Munch went off to and ended up getting killed. I'm not sure why Disney would think it was a girl fairy who died off. They had good parents, the girl was smart, she knew what was going to happen to her and she didn't even care. They just make it up in order to make Munch seem like a real life girl, which is absolutely ridiculous. They try to make her a good girl, but in the next scene they say Munch's mother didn't really want to be a girl. Munch comes in the room
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was very bad as it was of a teen movie. The story lines were too stupid and there were many ridiculous moments. This movie was the least interesting movie I've ever seen. I was surprised when I finally saw it after reading the reviews, and so the first thing I do is watch it. It is full of pointless dialog and the acting is bad, so I decided to watch it again because it seemed interesting at the beginning and didn't last long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was wrong with this movie was the bad director. It should have ended with the director to make a better movie, but I didn't think that would work. The story was bad and the acting was just bad. There was too many jokes about a fake war going on in China and there wasn't enough jokes about the US attack on Iraq. The funny moments were not so funny. I think that the whole show needs to be reworked, but if you like a laugh in your heart, don't go to this one. It's not worth getting into an evening with this bad movie. The music wasn't good at all. I didn´n´t like it as much as some other reviewers had done. There should have been some songs sung at the beginning of the movie. But unfortunately this show was only an hour long and it was the end.  If you like funny movies, you can't watch this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to like this movie, but it wasn't. I laughed at how terrible it is. This is the worst I have ever seen in movies. It's absolutely awful and if you want to see a movie that has to take a lot of money to make, I would think you might be in for a few days. A few days have already passed and I've managed to kill a few time. What a waste of money, but I found this movie good. There were some good parts and the writing wasn't bad at all. There was a scene with a kid in the room (she's about 8) who seemed to be a little bit more interesting than the rest of the cast. But I cannot say, for it's not all bad. There's nothing worth trying to say, the dialog is poor.  The story is bad and the characters are just OK.  I cannot recommend this movie as a horror film, even though it has a small chance to be funny. It was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot goes from bad to worse... the acting is weak, the camera is bad, the acting doesn't work, the music and music doesn't matter... the ending will always be stupid and disappointing. The funny funny scenes and some of the good moments are, but when it becomes too serious, the movie begins to lose interest. There is no point in this movie... I think the director is more important than the actors in this one. I hope that the next one will make good movies, and that he will get the best of the best scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see why people are seeing this movie as an "scary" film, but this is actually only the least funny, and most disturbing of the movies out there. I would be interested to see the true film, as they are very, very, extremely unpleasant to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a movie buff like me, and like me the sequel is the best one ever made. But the sequel was so bad it only left you a little bit left. I would recommend that you spend your entire time on the sequel, but instead this film was only 4 minutes short. If you don't mind this, see it for the sake of nostalgia. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An unassuming and unenteiined movie is about the most depressing movie I've seen since "Gang" 2. The director had to be so careful with his filming that I almost laughed. The ending is so utterly unbelievable that even I find myself crying. The acting in the film is bad. A man is stabbed in the middle of a night and everyone around is in tears and the camera is in the background constantly looking for something. I don't think this movie had the potential to be any good at all, and I don\'t even think that it should have been directed by one person.  I only hope that the guy who made this film gets burned up and finds out that he messed up the script. If it wasn't, then I think there should be a video of it somewhere on the internet somewhere. There is nothing to say, really, except that it contains so many terrible stereotypes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical movie: a guy comes to an elevator to meet a friend whom he has to talk to after he was killed in a car accident. The elevator guy asks "How could they be so cool? It should be a movie!  That's all there is. A lot of other details about the accident that happened and what happened to the elevator guy...it's basically just there. You get the basic facts, then the movie starts, and then there are a few things I can see from the film...the elevator guy didn't see the elevator when he was in his own elevator, he didn't know he was going down, he and the other guy were talking to the other elevator guy, there's some vague characters talking in this movie, it's not really good to have anyone talking, there is a story that's all on the top of a movie... it's a bad, but it looks like it was an accident to me. It's bad for the people who care about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After playing the first 2 movies in the first month, I decided to watch the sequel. The first was terrible, but it was fun to see a sequel that I had never seen before. The sequel is so bad that I am not even sure what the idea is supposed to be. They are also not very good actors. They can't use any real emotion. There is nothing to show you in the sequel, the characters are so flat and boring. I understand that they've been given an idea that it is a remake of a classic movie, but that would still make the first movies of the original seem so much better.  They are very bad, and don't try to appeal to anyone who has not seen these movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie for one of my birthday events and I swear it was awful. It was a lot of garbage and I didn't think anyone could even get to bed with it. I was in my room and watched it, so I had a laugh about the whole thing and I wanted to go home to sleep. I had never seen the movie before and now I understand why. I didn´t understand this whole thing. It starts like a train train ride that everyone is going to be in the middle of the ride and when you stop, the air will smell like the rain that is in the train. Then it smells like a toilet that everyone was stuck on and the toilet smells like an old toilet. People can think the toilet is good, the car doesn´t smell like that, but if you stick on it like this movie, it smells worse.  I'm a guy who has never seen a movie before. I never read books about how to get into movies. I have nothing else. I just wanted to get my husband and kids into it and got into the horror movie genre and that's what I did. I bought this movie because I found it on video. I found this movie on video a few months ago and it's even worse than the original one. I would buy the original copy of it and never again.  If this movie isn´t one of the garbage movies out there you have to be very careful. The film itself is about the characters and they are all horrible stereotypes. In fact, the whole movie starts about the "Punching My Face" and the story begins with a middle aged man. The "Punches" is about a bunch of teens who just start punching themselves. Some of them are good, but they don't understand why they are punching each other. They don't realize how desperate the man is to punch them because it's the only thing that seems to be working.  Some of the characters are stupid, but their actions are never funny. I´ve always been a fan of the genre and I have seen this kind of movies since I was 10. I think it is one of those people who´s just plain stupid. If they want a shock-horror movie, they should just use a shock gag and try to make the characters laugh. A good horror film is one that keeps you from laughing about yourself and keeps you off. This movie has none of the qualities of a good horror movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story behind this movie is a mish, and I do love it. But, you know, it was supposed to be a comedy. The dialog is pretty much cheesy and the ending is pretty stupid, but it doesn't get you too much. I was a major fan of the original, and the remake is not only bad, but also very shallow and flat.  The movie is just plain bad, and it should never be released. This was obviously made by some of the same people who worked on the first one. And yes, it is a very low-budget movie. But it is also funny to see that director has a taste for movies.  What else? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching many of the series over the last few years and found the series very unpubby. I have yet to see a movie that actually captures the show's spirit. I'm sure there's more to it then you could see in a few episodes and movies. The most glaring and stupid thing I've ever seen in any of the shows is the scene in which a character's life gets interrupted by a train. (Note: It wasn't like a film) There's too little to say about this scene, the movie itself is very boring and very forgetful, the characters are flat and boring, and the dialog is extremely stupid. I don't expect you'll care for me, but I can only recommend it to anyone who thinks the show is good and has time to waste.  The acting is not bad, the acting is decent, the special effects are bad, but it's not a series to watch and enjoy. I think it should be rated one of the worst horror fests ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about the worst film I've seen. And that's just the start. The rest of the film is absolutely awful. It's too sad and depressing to listen to music like "Sugar, Sugar, Sugar". The ending isn't much better than the ending of "Crisis". I know the ending was stupid, but they don't know what to do with such a film. I also believe the acting is very bad. I'm guessing this director has learned how to make films that are not interesting and not too depressing. His main job in this film is making movies that are full of clichéd jokes and bad acting that aren't entertaining at all. In short, I would definitely recommend skipping this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all the films, it should be a big, bright, beautiful film. Unfortunately, it's not. It's just a horrible, awful, self-indulgent thriller with a plot that's just as predictable as a soap opera. The movie never really recovers from the depressing atmosphere of the film. The acting was OK, though not too great, but the story was just terrible. I didn't care for the plot and the actors. They were boring and had no clue what to do in their characters. The characters were nothing special, though the acting was good. A couple of minor supporting characters appeared in the film, but it wasn't a movie worth it.  The soundtrack is OK, but not too catchy. There wasn't enough music to bring something to this film, considering it had a fairly decent cast of actors. I think the movie could have been a much more interesting film if it had just one good actor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm very critical of it, because it's so bad and a bad thing to be made. I'm also a fan of the show, but the movie itself didn't exactly come alive. I was very disappointed with the end. In fact, I even made it for myself, just to see if it could work. And it wasn't. I felt like this movie wasn't going to work, especially because I didn't see that there was an ending, and I couldn't see the credits section showing the credit-off.  If you're looking for an hour of horror or horror, a short is more than adequate. If you don't see this movie, then I guess you'll probably think it's too long. This movie does not stand for itself, but I guess it's worth checking out if you're into that sort of horror series, like "Guts" or "The House of Pops" or anything else. There is obviously a very different feel to it, but that doesn't help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really laughed at the lack of an even that most of the story seems to have been based on some kind of a story that would make the book not worth it. Just like a big, fat joke.  The only positive thing I can find about the movie is the story line... oh, the other stars were all good except the two of them, and the rest were bad. I could have gotten bored watching those people, especially Ray DeBauff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like Ron's performance but it was so bad! The director didn't understand Ron's acting! That's really sad! You gotta be careful of it!!! It made me sad! I'd like to see Ron in another movie for the rest of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was this movie? It was not very good, and not even remotely good, at least the acting was good. But what is the plot? Who do you get in the end? Did I even like the characters? And did I really care about the storyline? I thought I was watching the film for the sole reason of getting to know what the movie really is about.  What a bad script? I don't know if I have ever really understood what it is about, but I have had so many other problems on my mind that I think it is going to be more than just an awful film. I don a long list of problems that this movie tries to solve. I can't go on and on at once. This movie is an attempt to take us to the extremes of all of the possible extreme situations, but instead of trying to take a viewer to the point where they truly understand their situation, the movie takes us to a place where we can have an argument over an even more pointless and meaningless conflict.  A bunch of people that you know nothing about. Who do I think is really getting me here? I have never seen them before, so I don three of those questions and I'll answer them.  The "victory" story here is that there is a person on the street that has been running a drug of which he and I have decided to sell to pay for some time. They then have some money to do and give to a guy with money to have sex with. "And then he gives me $1.000 of heroin" "And you know what he does?". It is a fake street and a man with an orange jacket and a bunch of guns that you have to kill.  Then one of the main characters from this movie gets killed because of the money that we bought from him. When the "victors" realize they are at the end, the first person with the orange jacket walks into a warehouse and kills them. If they don't have any weapons, it would have been a great deal of killing for them. It just seems like there is no purpose in killing these guys.  It would have helped if the plot was a different kind of story. It would be a good movie if it had a more dramatic ending.  But the ending is not only boring, but it's not even good. It is just too long. It's just one story, and it doesn't really help us to understand the characters. It
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to say i'm a sucker for this one, which is why i don't read reviews like this and the rest of the reviews don't matter. I just cannot get the movie out of my head, the bad acting, the poor writing, and the overall awful cast list for the actors and actors. It's hard to tell which actor was the main actor and which one was the stunt coordinator. It all comes to a full-on 'worst film' feeling, and this movie doesn't even have the guts to make it up to the final scene.  What it would be: a film based on a bad television movie about a stupid movie: you sit in your room and listen to the radio play all around you, hoping to get some sort of a plot.  The plot is a really bad version of a story of a gang of dastardly gangsters who wants to be gangster kings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first watched this film a few weeks before it was released on DVD. I'm not one of "film buffs" to complain, but it was just awful. I was shocked the same film was so good in the trailer. The story was boring and boring, the acting was bad, the camera wasn't good, the dialog was not funny, the characters were stupid, the story didn't have any story lines, it was very bad, it is pointless. I found it to be very uncomfortable to watch this film. I can't call it a bad film because it has a cute girl, and cute people make it cute, even though they're only cute in their cuteness and the direction is very dull and not entertaining. It needs to be done before there's no reason for people to go out to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I'm a sucker of an Michael Jackson biopic. The film is only about a minute longer than usual, and contains an absolutely uninteresting story. The plot is fairly thin, though that's all I'll give you. As for me, the movie is about two-dimensional and predictable, and this is where the problems arise. It has very few funny moments, and I don't know if the people who are playing it really want to. The story is extremely pretentious, with little if any real drama or plot twists. The fact that the film is so uninspired doesn't hurt. It's just bad.  This isn't even a decent film - it's an ill conceived, overly contrived, and completely unnecessary. The acting is so bad that I can't even give it any attention, but, if you're really desperate to see Michael Jackson's biopic, then take a good chance and watch Michael's interviews, because it's the best thing you'll ever see Michael do. The reason you have to get these interviews is because you want to see what Michael does, and you're probably better than the movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed that the script was made. The story was extremely contrived, and the characters were completely flat and lifeless, without any character development. The ending seems to follow along with the plot, which is supposed to be a sort of comedy. In fact, it isn't. It was interesting to see the characters in this movie, but that alone was not interesting enough to justify this flick. Overall, this was an absolute disappointment. This movie needs to be seen as a self-indentia film, not a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the show from a tape of the movie and after watching it, I was shocked. In the first episode, the show called itself "The World of Rock & Roll" on the label of a movie, "Rock & Roll".  This movie has one thing going for it, but it is not good at all. The music sounds bad, the plot is terrible, the dialog is very poor and the acting is terrible.  My point is that, despite being on a TV show, this movie will never go anywhere near as good as a movie that contains a real plot. If I wanted to watch this movie, I would have to find some video cassettes and rent one. I don't think you could even have a good ending in a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started off in a bad fashion. The acting was bad, the story had a few bits of decent suspense and there was nothing to even go by. Even the special effects were a bit poor.  The first hour of the film was a mixture of music, a few horror elements and some excellent acting that seemed to be the only highlight for me. However, at the end the movie had no redeeming feature and the only reason to buy it was that it was well-received. This would probably be a good movie if the story was good, but unfortunately it wasn't. There was nothing interesting, no suspense, and the story just wasn't worth watching.  I'm sure everyone would like this movie if they could spend the time to watch it. It was just an awful horror movie, a little bit of a horror movie at the same time, and a really bad movie with poor acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something good on the video in a good movie. I saw one film and I was afraid to be silent. "Stallion" was awful and I wish I could have gone for an alternate film. I found the movie on YouTube. I gave it to my friend because he is not a big actor but he was a fan of the film and he wanted to have it. I don't know if I'm correct to say he didn't get to finish "Stalls" and that is why I gave him the movie.  I hope to correct this: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care if you disagree with me, or if you think you're "right". There are two parts of this film: the "Bunch", and the "Hoovelberg". You're looking at the "the movie" and the other people who have taken the "wet" film as seriously and have a reputation.  They're trying to scare the heck out of the fans and their supporters. This has to be done one way, and not another. If you take this film seriously, that's like saying that you think that you're the only person who can do the Wet movie. You're like a little boy with a stupid and self-destructive and ego-driven friend that wants to kill everyone.  In addition, the character of "the Hooveler" is, in a way, a typical Hollywood archetypical person. It's a character who wants to be in charge of everything, with no real knowledge about how to behave in the world of work. They always want to be a "big hitter", so much, even if they are just a "humble" with a few million dollars.  The film is about a bunch of money-grabbing hucksters who are in search of an ever-growing and profitable business, but a big mistake for them, since they won't get anywhere with a billion, and so they're looking for "quick profits". "Heevelberg" is not even a documentary, and that's the way it's supposed to be, not really about a "film". They call this movie "The Hollywood Version" and "The Wets are in Love" but this is not really like a movie, either. You see a bunch (or so, of course, the "hoovelen" would like it to be) of some of the characters. It is about "Buck" and his love interest, and a bunch more of "Bees" who want to have sex and take over the "stare club". It starts with two guys who are just guys who have a big hunk of money. Then we have a woman who wants the "Big Bump", and a man who wants nothing else. The story begins and is so bad that the two leads are supposed to act as heroes--they are, in fact, the only decent characters.  This is very disappointing and bad. I gave this movie a low rating because I liked it. There
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish that there was an alternative. I would be upset if the producers wanted to make a sequel to this. This is really bad! I could barely get out of the screening I saw. I found myself just shaking my head and wondering if I'd even really even get out before I had been told. I really wonder how the hell was this movie made. I don't know if the original series was ever this bad or if the whole thing was one of those low budget films, or just one one guy. I find myself thinking that the directors involved in the whole series don't even want to try something new, just to get another one of their own.  The main theme is to have your head bashered with a pair of glasses so that you can keep track of where you've gotten to, because you can always guess how you're going.  A little time ago I watched some of the series for the first time and even thought that it was funny. The story was interesting, but I didn't like the story and I just couldn't stop laughing. But it wasn't funny, really it was very, well, and very dark, and just downright dark. A really great example of this was the ending which I cannot even tell you because it was so dark.  There is no indication that the ending actually happened and even the end is not funny. They don't mention that the other "victory" happened in the episode, which would have been funny.  I mean it's not that this is bad, the series is pretty good! Just look at the original show and tell me what the hell is that supposed to be? The series is just completely ridiculous, even the characters are boring. Even the characters were just terrible. And it's just completely terrible! I really wanted a movie with a little ending so that I could laugh at something else. I've seen this before. There was a great post in the comments of the movie: "The first episode was interesting and I liked it. I enjoyed it. But the sequel is the worst thing I've ever seen on TV. It is so bad that it just completely destroys all credibility in the entire series. If you watch it, the first mistake you find yourself with is the ending. The ending was absolutely awful and I was so bored with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie more than a dozen times. Every time I stopped watching it I tried to see if I could stay awake to enjoy it, but I couldn't. The acting is awful. The cinematography was bad. There were no decent characters. There are just stupid characters who just sit around saying nothing. And the movie starts with the first scene a guy gets drunk at a party and proceeds to chase his girlfriend after a night. But the movie is very boring and fails to build excitement.  Overall this movie is bad. This is an insult to the minds of those who care about making movies like this and want to see something that has never been seen before.  It should never ever get any attention from a film maker. This was the worst one I've seen from this year. It is like an episode of "CSI" to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that got the name of the worst ever made. It was so bad that it could barely work to be a comedy. But what can i say? it's just another movie that was bad. It has a plot and a plot about "love" and people that love them so much that it has the premise that one would be able to kill to love them. The plot is a huge pile of junk. I would have wasted my time watching this movie if i didn't. I can't even think that a guy who is actually a lover is allowed to kill someone who would love him. It is too painful to see. I have to say, the only thing that i can recommend this movie is if you have some spare time to kill yourself. It really is so bad, the film is a complete waste of time. The actors who did it are so poorly. There should have been a special video featuring a person in a gay or straight relationship that would be played by a woman. That way would have brought tears into my eyes. I know there are people who want to see such a movie, but I can only recommend this one because they would be so sad to see the scene I would never expect to see from other movies. If you have a really strong interest in seeing a film that features people who are happy with one another and that has their best interests, don't waste your time watching such a film. It's just an ugly waste of money. You will probably have a better movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been expecting to see this film when I started watching it at the end of the year, but I hadn't watched it and I didn't expect it to have any appeal. I didn´t even watch it on the DVD when it came out, so it took my money off.  The movie is full of the same annoying and contrived movies of the 80's. And there is no way for a movie to get more laughs than I did. I did not know that these actors are bad, but they were good for a short time and then disappeared. The acting is too bad to watch and watch, and the dialog is not good either.  I hope the actor, the director and the editor got some better movies in the future, and I wish I was one of them. I was hoping that this film had more charm when it was released because I liked the original one and I still like this film, but it looks and acts way too lazy. The end of this film was a complete bore, and there was no way to even watch something that is so bad, as it is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing that this film had was the idea. What happened to the plot. It seemed like this movie was intended to be a little comedy about a gang of teenagers who broke out and then ran away to get a life-sized credit card off the airline. That's pretty much a pretty boring idea. If you find yourself in the world, you're going to have to follow what happens. If your first reaction is just "wait!", you'll get a huge amount of satisfaction. But if your second reaction is "wait!", you'll be stuck. I didn't expect anything else to happen. But what about? What about the idea? What could they have done? Why didn't they talk about how it actually happened? I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just naive. But it was that very, very, awful movie. It didn't help that the movie was so short. There were no funny scenes. Some of the actors didn't even make the most of their scenes. They just seemed like they were coming out of nowhere. Some actors looked completely out of their realm. I thought that the best part of the movie is just the ending. That part was good. But, once they got to this part, it was a bad, very bad movie. There wasn't a movie about a person who's life's gone to shambles. This movie should've been made for teenagers who don't have much else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I found when i watched this movie was truly depressing... it really wasn't a great comedy. I have to assume that this movie is a poorly made movie due to the fact that it is simply an attempt to take advantage of a movie actor and not a really funny movie. This is especially disappointing when you're expecting something funny and that is exactly what this movie contains. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been looking for this movie for several years, and I have not found it. The only thing I have found is that this film has no real plot to it and it looks completely boring.  It's really an excuse to waste my time, even though I really had fun out of the movie. There are two stars in the movie (Bryan Feigen and Nick Brajowski), two sets of hair and two looks of a woman with one child, but the rest of the cast is totally disappointing. The whole film is just boring, and not even a good movie, it just doesn't seem like a film.  I am a huge fan of 'Kung Lo Katana' and even though this film is bad, I really do like it because it has been such a fun film, though it looks like it's just a bad excuse for a film, like the so called 'The People That Would Be Killed By Mr. Stone', or even worse.  This movie fails to stick to its original premise of the film, which is that it has no clear ending, and just leaves the viewer with no clue about what was happening on the screen. The movie has several different endings, but it's no mystery to me to say that they all had the same ending. Some of the ending was pretty obvious as it was being shown on TV. There is one ending which is a complete rip-off of the 'Grims' script and this ending really showed that nothing happened with the lead actors. The ending should have been much quicker to show what actually happened, rather than the ending that we never got to know. The other ending, which I had liked, had all the characters do something in one direction, and then they got in the real world to escape from the cliff of life.  The rest of 'Chalkirk' was alright, though, but there were many parts that I didn't particularly care for. The story itself is pretty stupid, though. There were several points of the story in the film where the lead actor played, and some of the other characters did good. However, the story was very poor as it flowed so slow that it left the viewer unable to care about what happened. Some people pointed out how the film lacked a good scene in the last scene and some were willing to give the movie an extra 2/3 stars for the ending. However this movie wasn't meant to be a film because the story doesn't revolve
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise, while interesting, is not engaging and the storyline is a bore. That's not my fault, the other five or ten thousand movies have much better. They're not even better than the one I found on the other site... this one just falls from the point I made, to say "a bad movie". You can't escape from that place and it doesn't even make sense, just as bad as that show I gave it. The movie will take away most of your interest before the end.  Don't waste your time. Avoid it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My parents thought this movie was so cool. It just has so many of the things that it should not have taken for granted. It was not one of my favourites, but I did have to laugh at it to the point where it felt like it could be funny.  I didn't know what this movie had to be at the time and thought it was so lame, even though it wasn't an entirely bad movie. It never was a funny movie, the way it plays out feels so lame and it never felt like a comedy. The movie really doesn't work in a sense that it was funny. It should have been done better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been listening to these comments for years and they just won't stop laughing at this. It's not even funny, it's awful. The acting isn't even funny. It looks more like a cartoon than a film. What I've learned in this movie is that I really don't believe any of the people involved in this thing are actually funny, the actors aren't even good, the dialog is awful, and the whole idea of a movie is laughable.   And there are a few good things about this movie, but they don't make up for the bad acting, the bad dialog, and terrible acting. It also doesn't make sense. You have to be a serious film-buff to enjoy this, but I'm really tired by it and just don't want it to be my second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I'm seeing is a movie featuring a bunch of people eating the trash to get the money for a movie. Some scenes were so bad they looked like "a bunch of guys eating garbage." There's no money to be given to this movie, the only thing I found interesting was the fact that it has to have the same background characters as the actors. I mean they're in the same town, the same room, the very same hotel, the exact same hotel rooms, and the same hotel staff! They should be in the hotels at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so frustrated. A film like this doesn't even have a premise. You see a group of teenagers, they don't know what to do with them. If they were just teenagers, why would they put together with the family? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit I was a sucker of this film, it was just a big piece of trash, and the girls were pretty cute. I know that they aren't really like a modern film, but they don't need to be glorified, and I do think it's a bit of a shame that they can't even look like a glamorous movie. They looked like little girls with no fancy clothing or anything. They were cute, but not sexy. The girls were supposed to be hot, but don't believe me. What a shame! I was so unhappy with the girls when I was watching this. I had to see this film for its "fun". I couldn't believe that it would be a problem in it. I mean that the girls are okay, the boys weren't even good. But it was such a huge problem in the movie that I didn't know if they were really attractive or not. They weren't cute, and if you were into women of the film, then you would get tired watching them. I was very disheartened. You can watch it if you like and don't mind what it is doing. But that's not how you do when watching a film. If you want to see something that has not got you into a mood, and makes you laugh, don't waste your time. You won't get any enjoyment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something else wrong with this movie. You know what I'm saying. Nothing else makes sense. There are no logical reasons to make this movie: one character is an idiot, another one's a genius, but there are no believable reasons. I can't find any more out that these people who could make sense are in this film.  I mean, there are people who will say that it's funny. And I guess there is some sort of comedy in the movie, and I don't understand why that people would think that. But there is no real reason to. The whole film is a really, very unpleasant and awful film, even though it has a lot of funny jokes.  And there is absolutely no story whatsoever. This movie is simply a lot worse than what I saw in American Movies, because it doesn't really take any story that you know is about to have a satisfying ending. In the real world, you have to watch it in the middle of the movie to know that the movie is boring and is so slow it has no real ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the movie again. I'm still, but it's not like I remember the film being. It's not funny, but there is no substance at all.  There is one decent character in the film. Then the movie starts out to get bogged down by the script, there is a whole plot twist that it doesn't make sense, and there is even a slight change in the end.  In the end I was annoyed and annoyed. If you want a movie that is not entertaining, but with some funny jokes, or a nice movie with some decent acting, then this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to guess this is a sequel of the original, but the plot is different. It's not as great as the first movie, but I won't be able to watch more of it. I have a feeling that it's just the worst thing ever I've seen. It is so bad that I don't want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie while I was eating my breakfast. The only good thing was that the movie had not been put to this type of torture. What did they do? This is the worst movie of the movie, and I doubt I will ever watch it again. And don't let the writer of this movie fool you. You're never going to be able to trust this guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed that I was one of the 10 in this line of entertainment. But I have not read the previous 10 because it is not a good movie, it does make it funny to have seen the characters and think of them as ridiculous, I have seen people saying that they are in the same state as the Simpsons to which they actually aren't. In the first 10, there were a couple of good moments, but the last one was not. The fact that it was only 10 was also a bad thing. It is the worst sequel I have ever seen since I had been in college. I don't expect anything else from the show to be better, it's just like one long movie of bad jokes. I just wanted to get out the bad part and never see it again, but it took so long for me to get to see the last 10. The characters of the shows are pretty good, some good characters, but I could have given more of them. There are only a few jokes that were funny, and I was surprised they got the job of being the final, but as a fan, I don not have anything good to say. If you just want to see a good show, I would recommend you see the first 6 in the show, which is a pretty good comedy. If your only one of them, I really recommend watching this one instead of the show that was in the second line of the series.  I don?t even think anyone likes this one, and you might have to if you just have to see it. Otherwise, you would probably like this one to go and get the Simpsons show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was first introduced to this film I was really annoyed. There was no story to the movie. There are no dialogs. It was all about being a vampire, and a vampire hunter, and I wasn't able to take it seriously.  I was so bored with this movie. I couldn't stop laughing. It didn't even go by the end and I didn't see it on the shelf. When I finally saw it again in 2002, I was furious that it was so bad. The acting is flat, and the gore is so bad that it's unbelievable, and there were no funny lines. I'm not kidding about it, and don't take the credit for the good acting of this film.  The good part of this movie was having a few good moments. However, these moments were not as funny as they would have been in the film. I'll rate this movie as poor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "BETTER" is one of the worst movies ever made. And I'm not sure who this person was or who he was. There is no story, the actors are boring and the plot is not interesting. I found it amusing that I thought the person who was in charge of this project had died.  "Kabar" is a film based on a movie from the 1950s. I thought it was funny to be in this movie because I have seen the real "Kabbar" movie. They are really old and have a weird name to explain a very interesting movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film on 4/23/1996 - I believe that was about one year old - and I thought I was an idiot. It was extremely difficult, the dialogs were awful, the camera was bad, and the scenery was bad. I had one hour left to review it. I did not know that this film was a disaster because it actually was quite interesting, but the fact of the matter was that it was bad from start to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie through a series of re-watch movies that I bought on DVD for some of the original DVD releases. I couldn't find any way to start the story, so I chose to rent the movie. I'm not sure if any one of the movies in this series is actually good or not. There's simply no way to even tell the story. I was disappointed by this movie and the actors on it, but it is so bad that you really have to avoid it, and I don't think I'm going to like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had expected a good movie, and I thought it was a fine movie. But, the plot and acting were very lacking and the ending is pretty sad. I was really disappointed, I can't say I didn't like this movie, but what happened after this terrible ending? Well I can say I liked the first movie, so I won't go on and ruin it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this movie was based on some very good real life events. The plot was not that interesting. The actors were not good. Some people didn't like what it did with them, so that made me think I was making the movie a better film. So it isn't surprising that I would think so much about this movie, considering it had the first 10 minutes of me watching it. The film wasn't like a "mature film" and it felt too dull to be funny. What's interesting is that it didn't have any real plot! It was a mix of fake footage, which is normally done in films. The fake footage was so dull and boring that it had a real effect on me. I don't know if there's any film directors or writers that would have been able to make a decent movie about these events, but I'm guessing that they didn't understand what they were doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is an illogical piece of art. The movie does have some of the best scenes in the film - the first is a fairly interesting scene of a man (the first time it is shown) getting into an argument over a prostitute. That would have been a much-better film, but it's the weakest in the entire movie. Also, some of those in the movie are good-looking, and I didn't recognize those women in the other scene, although they're a bit more than regular-looking. Also that scene is very bad-like a scene involving a fire engine, so a person on fire is blown away by a fire truck.  Overall, I recommend not taking this movie: it's a little too complicated, and you can't appreciate it. It starts to drive you to have your brain ready to throw a car in the trash, but that doesn't happen with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Wimper" is one of those films that are so much awful that you can't even pronounce it. What a movie to watch is that? That's how I watched it. In truth, I was bored the whole time. It was so bad that the first two minutes were hard to remember. It is one thing I wanted to get into my brain as soon as I saw it, even though I saw some of the other movies of it. I had to sit off and take it for 10 minutes to get my bearings, then I saw the third scene, and that's all I remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this movie as a young kid (if you ever think that about any teen who reads books about how it's gonna be, you'd like to see them in a horror movie!). I had my parents watch this film on video at my uncle's place, and I thought it sucked so badly! I had a friend who was the director of the movie (not in fact) and she totally ruined me for a few minutes in the first 10 minutes or so. When she told me about how bad it is, I said she was an artist, that she was either bad or a good actor, and that it was pointless to listen to what she told. Her acting was so terrible that I'd actually prefer to read the film if they made a sequel; if anyone says "that's a shame", I don't even care!   The problem with it is not so much my friend's talent, but rather the fact that it is so bad! As I said, I wasn't that scared to begin with it and liked it. That's how it is. You either get bored, like a movie or one time, like this, or you get bored and just go for the laughs. I didn't really enjoy it, but I did enjoy what I got out of it.  If you want to find this movie for a laugh, I can't recommend it, as I would feel it just as boring as anything! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of stupidity and no enjoyment. It seems like this is the only way to go. But even after this I have to admit that I don't have an idea that this movie would have been a good film. I just wanted it to be a bore, so that I could see it on my own. The ending is so weak that it gives you absolutely no sense of how good this movie was or how poor it was. The whole thing is just a weak imitation of a bad western film with a shallow story line that fails to connect with the story. It looks like it's one person's movie. I cannot recommend this film as a film. There are some interesting parts in the movie, but don't see the ending or the ending. I would recommend it for a cheap bargain, but even so, it does not qualify as one. The DVD has a nice bonus feature about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best movie of this bunch of darlings this year was probably this "Eggert" from "The Last Picture," but this one, even though it was funny, and somewhat pretentious, seemed to be too much. Also, despite the fact that the whole movie was a straight-to-video-format exercise, the acting wasn't even funny. The best part of this film was the song. It just failed to follow any standard Hollywood standards for acting.  What I've heard is that this is a remake of "Happy Birthday To The World," with the same kind of plot and script but in a different way. I've also heard that some of the old shots of these early comedies are "too funny" to be even a comedy movie. I'd have to agree with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband and I were sitting in the same room and we just didn't get on with it, I thought the other family that is in the house was going to enjoy it more, not the same way that I did when it was released in 1989.  When this movie came out in the 1990, I was so disappointed I wouldn't want to spend more money on it. The main characters are pretty useless, the main actors I liked were the ones that were in the other one. That's all there is to it.  The funny actor who played the main character is no better than a guy who is playing a prostitute on the street, which made him in a porn movie.  If you watch this for your kids, beware of it because it's pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm the sort of person who really wants to see a good movie. A good movie: a good story, good acting, some good jokes and a couple of good moments, but, at the very least, it fails to deliver that. It fails to take you beyond the end of the movie. It's not a good film because it's just a piece of trash. It would take you out of the loop for an hour, a half of an hour. It really should be a good comedy about a great movie - just an ordinary piece of film! If you want a good laugh, go check out the "Mimos" and see the new "Jungle House" which were released a few weeks later this year. I'm a big fan of those two and even think that the rest of the "mimos"( movies would be better. But, in all, I can't recommend this film as a comedy. It is just an average piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sick of those movies, this one just don't do it for a long time. The only thing that's redeeming me is the character of the main character. The character isn't good. The story is okay. There are some funny moments (like the opening scene in a restaurant) but that's about all. I also can't believe that the writer is talented enough to write even one good movie (even worse than the one I gave him for his "great" movie, "Life & Liberty"). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie, with its painfully shallow dialog and terrible acting, is only good in parts. The plot is so bad it's almost guaranteed to be stupid. The characters were probably created in the 70's. Who actually killed the women? That one! The worst thing in this movie is the fact that this movie portrays a married couple. It doesn't go anywhere near the other horror films, because that would be way too easy to compare. They get to the point that the women are in their relationships in their early 30's, and there's an entire story, with several questions left to be answered. There are no more, no more. But that's not a bad thing, it's something terrible that could have been made. There is just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few, but the first one is the most important. It was a pretty interesting film, but I didn't like it for a second. The film is the least interesting film I have seen since the beginning of the film's popularity. I can't even find the film in the end. I mean, what the heck? The ending is about 40 minutes. The plot is weak and the acting isn't even good. The whole film is so bad that it feels like a slap in the face. But, considering that there were so many times I have listened to the film on repeat watch it twice... I have to give it a poor grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't like this movie...it's just a poorly-acted remake of a horrible sequel which seems to be a remake of the horror cultist cult film of the late 1980's. And the main reason I didn't like it was because I hadn't bothered to read it in the original book, which I could have sworn would be interesting.  It's hard to think of a film with a plot that is actually boring and predictable. There were some good parts, but I had trouble finding the other important elements. The plot seems to contain all the basic elements of the plot - "the killer", "the creature", "blood", and "the death". I think I'd be lying if I didn\'t believe it. The film's premise is pretty simple - a guy gets killed, but he finds a way to get out of the cellar, and then he leaves a trail of blood in front of the body he had left. The scene doesn't seem to have much interest, but the characters seem to be interested only in finding out what happened to their victim. The killer seems to follow a path of blood, so no one seems to believe they are responsible.  The monster is shown running around for some time, and finally he shoots up to a pile of blood at the cellar that he built himself with some kind of welding rod. The "blood" that gets sprayed up is actually an explosive dust cloud that was just released by a breeze.  A good scene, but a terrible movie nonetheless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of those who got involved in the first version of "Dirty Dogs" as a fan of the first one. This was never supposed to be a remake of the original, and instead I found out that the original version is a pretty good, but its sequel lacked a clear story and direction. And I was very disappointed in the "Darkness" version. Its a complete disaster of a film which just simply says it's about a gang of vampires, but in the end its so bad, it's not funny or funny, but it's depressing and unpleasant. If I didn't watch it in one person's hands, I would have skipped one and been left to wonder how it all ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I read the reviews. This is the worst movie i have ever seen. Even though the movie looks good, it doesn't come close to the actual storyline, which was quite similar to the real movie. I don't know why I wasted 20 minutes of my life watching this movie, but I guess it was because of my own interest.  It was obvious in the beginning and was a bad script. The plot wasn't well written and I got bored about the ending and I thought the ending was a little boring. I just wanted to see something that actually made me care more.  But that's not all bad. I really liked the film because I knew the ending before I saw it. I did my best and worst for this movie and I didn't like it.  Overall, I don'€t think this movie was bad. It wasn't a very good film and it wasn't that good for those who like movies. I liked the concept of the movie, even if it wasn´s too obvious for others, but if you like it, you might get bored. I think it´s because the plot wasn´t the best movie.  I don´t think it's a movie that could be made up for an action thriller. It simply wasn't as good as the original, so I don"t think a movie like this can be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm very interested in this show. The story is about a group of guys who break into their house and steal a bunch of treasure. They end up in the house and that group decides to fight.  The story itself is about the guys who have agreed to the fight because they think there's a big treasure in the wall and that there's going to be a goldmine on their side and they go in to fight to have the gold mine and they end up winning. The guys in the show get killed but at the end, the whole thing ends up being a bunch fight where everyone in the cast is killed except one guy (who ended up on an island island and is very hard on anyone). What a disappointing ending. The show seems to be trying to draw the viewer in a romantic relationship in the world and I can't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An almost unimportant story from a bad and not good movie: a couple who is married (that has already married the father of the father's ex-wife and his daughter, and thus is estranged from the family) meet to discuss the girl's feelings about the father.  They meet in a bar; the father is in control and the girl is in jail, and the father says he can help the girl.  This movie fails miserably. It just has a very bad premise. Nothing is even moving on the movie, it just is boring, and there is just nothing to keep the viewer entertained. I will never watch this film.  I think it would be even worse if it was a movie which was good on a basis of good acting and good story. The acting has no substance to it. I don't understand what was meant by the girl wanting to get into this relationship. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be funny and funny but the director was clearly having difficulty making it into a comedy. This movie had some excellent animation (good on the one good point of the movie) but the story, though, had been fairly funny at the time, and even had some of the funniest dialog scenes in the movie. The movie was full of sex-play, but the acting was laughable. The main character is a boy who falls into an apartment with a strange man named Fred. The two take on a man named "Wonstan" who gets drunk and dies. The end is that Fred dies in front of Wonstan's father, then Wonst's son gets drunk on the way to the funeral and Fred dies at the funeral.  I give this movie 2 out of 10 out of 5 stars because the script was pretty good, but not so interesting. The funny guy is an idiot, and his life is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read some reviews claiming that this film has the "classic, non-animated style" - an obvious example of something that is impossible to be rated. As someone who has learned that there's an endless list of pointless films out there, I think I'm sick of these sort of films. Even when I see an interesting movie, I inevitably find the same level of performance that they tried to shoot it with.  For example, this film made no attempt to hide it at all. The cinematric track is an unnecessary attempt to justify the film in a way that the director doesn't have to. The storyline is completely unnecessary and there's no real attempt to provide any depth.  The story is so boring that it could easily be put together with some excellent video editing, a couple of good performances, or some good commentary. I'm convinced that the film's producer is an idiot, but what could they expect from one of their "new genre" films? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies of the year. I know it's a lot of money, but it could have been better. Some of the actors are good, but that is not enough to make me watch it.  A bad movie about a guy that wants a girl. He doesn't know how he could get a girl for a prostitute. In the beginning he talks to a stripper, the stripper asks "hey, when do I get you".  I'm a guy. I was supposed to be funny. This is the worst movie of the years. I can't imagine how anyone could possibly enjoy it. I just think I got bored and wanted to get out of my seat so I could go home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is supposed to be a satirical horror movie, and I thought that I had better movies. I couldn't find anything that was funny about this movie, but one thing I remembered it made sense. The first thing I noticed was how the music sounded like "I'm OK, Pretty Good, So Good" on a first listen. This movie also has the worst casting I've ever seen, even though I know it's an interesting film. The acting is terrible, the direction is bad, and it's too loud, especially the scene where the movie starts out very loud and goes on with a very loud silence in the middle.  I guess I'm an old movie director, and this movie needs to be so bad, not even that it's quite offensive, it's just flat-out awful. This could have been a really good film for the film industry, but in my opinion it just doesn't measure up. I mean, even so this movie wasn't very funny, and if I was a kid I wouldn't be into it, so there's nothing for me to ever get into it. The only thing I get is "pretty good" (which I like because it makes me laugh, which I always enjoy) but even that isn't enough for a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like an 80 minute movie with a story that has nothing to do with the characters. In fact, it's like a movie about a gang of men who break up their relationship because of a gambling scam. Nothing to do but break it up. It starts off like a soap opera (where it was a really good soap opera, I know), but I was really embarrassed watching it. What a pity. I was a little shocked when I turned the tape on and saw the ending. It had a very uncomfortable ending that wasn't even funny. I had to sit through the whole movie. And the worst of it is that the movie actually wasn't supposed to be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only say it was one of those movies that would never survive my interest in watching it. I have to admit that I had just as much an interest for the first two hours of this film as for the last 20 hours, and that they were so bad. I cannot even say that my interest for any of the previous films made by the original cast of "Die Hard" had anything to do with this movie.  The plot was really weak, I didn't really care for a lot of the character development and the acting. I just got bored waiting for more of it. The ending is just... well, it didn't matter. It was just really weak.  But, this movie was not made to be a comedy, so it was supposed to be scary, and then I was bored waiting to see what the next movie would be. The idea behind it was a very, very low-budget action film, and it was not funny. It is really boring. I can't say it's a good movie. It should've been at least a 2/2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know what the hell this movie was. I didn`t care what it was about. I think it was full of crap. What is a good movie about? That was awful and I think that anyone who had any interest to watch it would just give up. I could barely stomach watching it in its entirety. I gave it a one-star review, but I don`t think it could have been better than 1. It was so bad, and so stupid, that I felt like it had to be dragged to the end of the movie just to have some interest or to say, "What is it with all these jokes?  If this was one of my 10, I would be giving it 5 out of 10 and telling people to avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like what "Star Wars" has done, but this movie is a complete disaster... I am a big fan of the "Star Trek" series, but it is this film that has a plot that is unbelievable, disappointing, and boring. In short, this film had an average and bad script but also was very good at the beginning and made the movie memorable with a good storyline. I felt the movie could have been better in the beginning, but ultimately it is just plain bad. The acting was not too bad, but the scene within the movie was lacking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are lots of reasons why this movie sucked, and the first movie is no good.  It had a weak ending, and bad dialog, and that's what we're talking about. If it was supposed to be a horror film, it would have been good. I didn't like it, but it was not enough. It was like the most expensive movie ever, and didn't really get a decent chance to be interesting.  The plot was pretty decent, but was the ending so poor? It was hard to remember what happened when it was over.  That's not too bad, because it's still good, and there's some cute moments, but the dialog is pretty lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to try to understand some of the history of Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and the Nazi regime in the early 1990's, you're going to be wrong.  This film fails badly at all, with the worst acting/camera work I've ever seen. The acting is so bad that I have difficulty in understanding why the German government would be willing to allow Nazi agents into their country. This movie is full of stupidity. It is absolutely and unapologetically offensive. I found myself laughing at the story where they were going to make this movie to help keep the Jewish community safe. They just wanted to make it more funny, but they did. The plot has so much wrong it's unbelievable that it's even a funny movie. You'd have to imagine how horrible this is for the people in the government and the Jews, but unfortunately it is not even funny. I didn't even care for the acting. I just find it a little too stupid to care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes place in the "Pistro" series but that series is best known for its action and violence; this film fails to be the action series because it doesn't follow the same formula as the other Pistro series, so no wonder it doesn a bad job as an action film. As I said, the plot isn't much; the story takes place at the airport; the ending is stupid and unrealistic. There was some of some of my friends on IMDb who actually gave up on it because they thought it was a bad show.  It's too bad for this series because, like the TV series, it has got the talent to make up for the shortcomings of this show and has an outstanding cast, but even the cast is good, with only one decent actor (Taron) and one good story line. What a waste of money! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot itself is pretty good, the director is decent, but that is not necessarily about its character. He gets into the middle of a bunch of hangers who get into trouble with the others and he never really gets comfortable with his own group of hangeries.  The movie starts off pretty well, but as the plot keeps progressing, the pace slows down. By the time I finish watching the movie, I felt like I was waiting to end the movie.  A bad movie!  I don't recommend it, but it does have potential to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An example of the very poor quality of this film is the acting. The story is boring, the characters are the same, the dialog is poor, the music is bad.  But the actors are good. The dialog is good, the direction is OK but it's just like the movies they have made.  Other actors like the acting teacher are good, and the lead is interesting but the rest are just horrible.  The other problems are the character of the actors, like the little girl, the bad guy is not so interesting, but the lead actor is so bad. There is nothing interesting and nothing interesting about him.  There are too many pointless plot lines and unnecessary story points. The ending is stupid and it breaks the very long story.  Overall this has a bad rating because it's only 1 minute long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the theatre at the movie club. I'm still a member of the club, but after watching this movie I was unable to watch it. I was in fact going to see my sister the next morning. I didn't like the way it was going. I got all the way to sick by my uncle after seeing this. I tried to stay away from it so that I could be part of the event, but unfortunately couldn't. When my sister brought it to me I was convinced it would not hurt so much, because it was a comedy that had nothing to do with the actual situation. I could just have laughed.  I was also afraid that I would lose my sister. I also had to avoid making the movie with him because he was so disrespectful. It was not funny, at all, in fact. It just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was a really bad film. There are some good bits to this movie.  For example the opening scene at an all-male party at a party with lots of girls. There's only one line that could be so funny, and the entire movie could not be better. The movie also relies on the fact that all the girls in the movie are wearing high boots and heels and all the guys in the film are wearing sneakers.  I really don't understand how this film was made. There wasn't enough humor in the video to make the movie funny. I don't see how anybody could possibly make this movie and the girls I know have good personalities. I think the producer of the movie is a bad actor who had never made anything but a bad comedy.  The funny line was when the main character, Jacky, played by "George Bailey", says something about the bad movie. There were two shots that left you thinking that it was some sort of sequel. They were all way too loud to hear.  Overall, I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was released on November 12, 1992, and ran for a few months before that. It had a few interesting ideas (such as the movie's title, "Shenzhen,") and a few good ideas (but mostly about the acting), but unfortunately the movie was very bad. It was a terrible piece of work to say the least. You can't even hear the end credits in the movie, so there's no idea of getting a DVD out of it.  My opinion about the movie is that it was simply bad, and if you like horror movies, this movie isn't for you. The only way to enjoy it would be to watch it for the thrills, but you'll probably miss the thrash-y nature of it, and probably will enjoy it for its low-budget and boring story. You won't find a single good review about it. This movie should not have been made to go out into circulation. It should never have been allowed to go to Blu-ray, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know there's probably been a lot of people saying this.  This is so bad it takes some of the magic of a film.  In fact, when I watched it I thought the same thing that a lot people say about it.   The first thing you notice is that it contains some of those same questions that always were in a script-written movie: Why did the main characters have the same last name in the first scenes of the film, why do the characters act so weird in the last scene and why do they act so strangely? Where was the beginning? Where did the ending? Why did they go to the hotel and why did they talk? Who was their father? And what their mother? What the hell was the name of the restaurant that they visited? And who their father's family? There's more questions than those questions. The movie has some pretty good jokes but don't buy them.  There's no plot and there's no good music, either. There's only the dialogue and the characters. This is awful. And if you are a film buff, you have to watch it in the movies anyway, but you'd be better off taking a break and getting away from it, even if it's only 7 hours long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 3/4/5 of the film was decent at best. I can't see the whole film. The voice-overs are pretty stupid and there aren't many funny scenes.  The last 3/5 film is a little bit better than the original, and I have to agree that the story isn't very funny. The best part of the movie is about a guy with a broken head. He wears a bandy black wig with glasses. It isn't funny. And even though the acting was pretty funny, that was overused. There were some funny moments, but even those aren't worth watching.  I guess it's the worst film I've ever seen. I don't recommend this one to anyone. It's bad for everyone involved involved, especially kids. If you really have an eye on film, watch it and give yourself a few hours at least. It might be cheaper than $15 and if you do a lot of work, it's definitely cheaper than a movie with a cast that could be used to make a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the early days of internet video sharing and the first few years of digital video sharing that made a real breakthrough. The producers of this flick failed to grasp the basics of this modern phenomenon and this was perhaps the first flaw. A movie about vampires can't be anything else. That's not too bad, because it is a film that's not about vampires, but it should be about movies about other things. One wonders if the producers tried to make a good movie without the horror element (that's how you get a good script!) and made this awful version of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is one of the few horror films in existence. There's some good elements, but most of it is terrible. I can understand how everyone thinks this film is so great, since they really believe it to be a scary film. But in a lot of ways it's not. I'd like to think it's more of a horror film, and more of an experience. And some of the jokes are really awful, even if you're a horror buff like I am. The acting is bad as well, and the script is bad. But all of these things, if you look at it and enjoy it, will only have you falling for it.  It does a fair amount of work, but it's a little too slow for a horror movie to be more than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. There is just so bad it's hard to find a decent review about it.  The characters are all totally stupid, and the direction is really not worth. I wish I was able to sit through the whole thing. The way the actors are acting is so bad that you don't really expect to get anything out of it. I have nothing left to say about the acting.  What can they say about such a poor movie? They are not funny or good, but they are not so bad to watch that you want to think about. If you're a guy like this guy, please see it for the sake of being entertained, but don't. It's like a movie about a crappy movie: it's just not worth seeing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been so disappointed in this movie, I cannot even find a single good review about it. I read the reviews that have a good review of the movie, and my opinion of this movie was not good. It is a complete failure. This movie isn't for you, it is for money, it's bad for the money. You have to take your own pick. I didn't see that this movie would be good. I had to see the film in a theater in Hollywood, and I thought it looked so bad! I can't even comment on a good movie: I mean, it wasn't even good for the actor, but the cinematography was good. But I could see it's funny.  I cannot recommend this movie because I don't know if it would get the money back. I'd recommend this bad movie for a small budget movie that has a funny plot and has interesting characters. I just cannot find any good review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i remember watching this when i was young, it was so out of shape as it was. And it wasn't for lack of an excellent writer. But it wasn`s for lack in the director and actors. If you have nothing else, don`t try it. If anything at all, you just skip this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that matters in this movie is the bad camera work and the bad storyline. This movie simply does not make any sense. I do not know what they are trying to do. If you like movies, you will not be pleased. I give this movie a negative rating, which is a bad 4 out of 10, but a better one would have been 'The Man With One Gun' or 'Pilot In The Air'. The fact that there is a lot of female characters is not even close to the 'The Gun'. It is not a good movie, and should be used as a low-budget comedy or an horror film and not a true horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main villain in this movie has been played by the actor of Al Paca. However, the other one has been portrayed by his son, who has never had his own name. The acting is not up to par with the quality of the original script and the action scenes are not good. Also, the animation has never matched the original art. Although, I was very surprised that I had to listen to a movie which I wasn't allowed to watch, as I'm a big fan of it. I'm not sure what the point is of this movie.  I was hoping to like it, but I found it very uninteresting and disappointing. I can forgive it for being one of the few horror films which still has some quality of its own. It was interesting to see the other movie. I just didn't find anything worthwhile to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I read the book, I realized that the book was the worst movie ever made.  The plot is so bad. How can they even make a movie about the war? They should have put a little extra effort in to making the book interesting.  Also, the characters are so, so stupid, that I'm not going to have them watch the TV shows they are in.  They're like a couple who went to sleep, and then saw a movie where they are trapped in a war in the world.   I hope it never will happen again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've not heard this movie since. It is so bad. I've seen a lot of bad movie's out there, but this is worse than the most of them. I don't know if the movie is good or not, but I donno. It starts out with a bunch of weird people. But none of them are particularly good actors or actors, the first one is actually pretty good. I did laugh after watching these two movies. It's too long. What did they say? It starts with an hour and thirty minutes of film.   This movie starts out having a good idea. It turns out to be totally stupid and is poorly acted. The story, though interesting, is just really bad. You're not going to find a story about a good man and his girlfriend, you're not gonna find a good movie about a decent movie.  If you're looking for a good film, you don't need to watch this movie, but if you want a good romantic drama to watch, you won't find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a film buff, I mean, I'm a film nerd. I like horror, so I always enjoy horror. I am also a bit of a horror fan, so naturally I was hoping that this movie would be a horror film, but alas, I was wrong. This movie was just a bunch of low-budget slasher movies, none of them have that special effects and none of these guys are good at horror. None of them had real characters and nothing could be explained about the characters.  But this movie had some good bits. There were some decent dialog, but for all that, it seemed to be more of a parody of horror than a horror story. There was also a couple of nice moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was stupid. I was shocked that none of the girls involved actually had any experience at home or had worked as a teacher. There were so many actors that I had difficulty making out what they said. I think it was really obvious. I didn't want to listen to a story line or read the plot. I just didn't know what it was and I got bored. I did think a lot of those actors and I was surprised that I didn´t recognize them. I am not in a place where I think I have good relationships with women. I do think that it is very dangerous. It is very disturbing that the girls have made such a huge mistake for not wanting to be in the class, for just saying it wasn´t a movie and that they really had an interest in showing it. They obviously wanted to show the girls. I guess it must be for the money. The whole time that we were in in there, it looked like they were doing this just to be a sadistic joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Wake up" is very, very bad. The first hour is about a bunch of teenagers that have gotten to know one another from their school and the other members of the town that's supposed to be their home. By way of background, all the teens are friends with each other. When they arrive they each get to know each other better than they think. The teen girl who walks in the beginning of the film with a huge hat on her head and talks to the other teenagers. There's no direction that tells the teenagers anything about the new girls that are coming, so I thought it was pretty clear that they were just friends and friends that were going to be friends, and there's no way to make it clear that the girls are coming to them to be "friends" with the girls they are going to meet. One interesting scene is the end of the movie. As the teens get drunk and lose their courage, they start making trouble with the adults, because the adults are inebriated. In a desperate attempt to get the adults in a row, they take over their drinks and start a fire. The teens start acting like wild animals and begin making havoc in the town. The movie ends in that most of them get killed or are killed by the adults. When the kids and the adults go their sleep, the teens decide to sleep together. The adults take over in their sleeping bags, so they won't get used to the idea of sleeping in the same bed. There are no further scenes. As a result, you don't know who the adults were or where they went after they had finished eating. The end sequence is basically just the end.  All in all, this movie is a very bad parody of the people that are making it. The story is so badly written and the direction and story is completely ridiculous. There is no purpose to make this movie, it's just a bunch and half-naked teens that want to get laid out and then meet new girls who are all completely new to them. When it finally comes around, you just watch this movie and not enjoy it because the ending doesn't give you any real direction for where the teens go and what the teenagers' do.  This movie is also terribly depressing. It is painfully obvious that the movie is not intended to be a funny film. The way it tells you that teenagers will be friends with a bunch then you get the same feeling if you ever decide to actually be friends for your
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have really been frustrated with this movie as it is over at least 2.5 hours. I can't even figure out how to get it out of it.  I just hope someone is stupid enough to not believe it. What the fuck. I'm thinking that the director is a very insecure person, or just plain stupid. I mean, they had to come up with an idea about how to make this movie, even if they wanted to make an interesting movie, and I don't have any idea how to do that.  What I am about to say is that they were getting all the shots wrong. The whole movie is about being in the middle of a shoot, and you sit around having to watch it as you get into this mess. Then you have to sit on top of the pool as your feet leave the pool. You watch the end of it in your brain, and wonder how the hell they did this, so you can finally get it into your head. Then they shoot your feet out of the water, the pool is overbusted, and your face becomes as hard as a rock.  Then the pool gets filled with water and says that it is hot, and the pool sinks down, and there is absolutely no air. If you watch it again, it turns into a flood and goes into your stomach. That is when you die of water. Then there is a fucking fire.  If you have a sense of an hour of pure entertainment for a really poor movie: a man that can't handle the acting, and if they are stupid enough, you should see a really bad movie. But if you like to be silly, you'll enjoy it just enough to waste hours of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible attempt at a "plot" on the name of a TV show. The plot is weak and not enough. There are no real suspense, the ending is anticlimaxed and disappointing. The acting is terrible as well, with the only two actors (a male and female) who have the slightest talent, the former seems to have gone straight out of his head. The actors and the voice-overs are totally forgettable, and the soundtrack is just bad, as if a video player is making a soundtrack for a video game. The voice-over was so bad it was actually very bad, and I would be extremely unhappy if you actually listened to it. And I was annoyed that it actually was a Japanese TV show, since the title and the name was Japanese.  I really wish they could use the original Japanese TV series from the early 70s, which had a more interesting and interesting storyline than this one. It may not be worth paying for, but a Japanese video series is a good one if you can have it, and it is not a good show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in the late 1990's but did not really like it. I thought it was just a little too long, but I think that it could have been a really interesting film. But it seemed so strange. I suppose that someone might not even have watched it in the theatre, because of the bizarre and unrealistic way the story develops. I'm still curious about the main character of the film. She is an extremely annoying little girl and a huge whiny whore. In addition to this, she is also very bad at all the things she's done in the film, particularly in her relationships with the other guys. When she was given an assignment, she apparently forgot all about this.  When she gets a little break, she goes straight to the beach. She arrives there, but she doesn't seem to want to go back to her former job. She's very bored and unhappy with it. It turns out that she and the other two guys she's working with are having an affair.  There is a huge section in the story, where her boyfriend is, apparently, a member of the Church of the Light. And one of the characters in this film is a priest. I think he's a very strange fellow. She always wears the clothes of the congregation.  But in another scene, the priest is talking with her and one of them (the guy she's in love with, apparently) is telling her something about how she got in love, how she's involved in the Church.  The priest comes to them and tries to persuade them to accept the Church's teaching. He's the one who convinces her and then lets her and the priest into a ceremony, which he refuses to attend and gives them two different locations, where he is told to go by.  He and the person he's really in love to make a secret love triangle. It ends up that the priest decides to take some of the other girl's children with him, and then, in the middle of the night, he visits the priest, who he finds is a nice person. I guess that he's not really in an affair with the priest. The rest of the plot is about the priest going to an annual Catholic festival and then going to a couple of other places. And then there's a large scene where she gets off one of her lovers, and he's supposed to go with them to a nightclub which he goes to but not actually goes.  A big problem is the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking for a film: "The Perfect Stranger" is a fairly simple horror-film with very little originality. There's some very brief scenes involving a very strange group of three female leads. The film has two girls that are supposed to be one of the main characters.  The female leads aren't very creepy or smart and the movie starts out with them looking at a big, ugly pile of rotting corpses on the side of a lake. They're about two minutes into the film and, in a very odd film, you really think you have two girls at the top of your little box. You think you're about the one who talks to the girl with the huge nose in a film. It wasn't until after I've had seen this film that I realized there's not much left to say about it. As an example of this, look at the last two minutes of "The Great White House" - they have a couple of girls with their hair and hair, sitting around in the room, talking about how it's all going to get to hell, and, well, they're totally obsessed. It's absolutely awful, very low-budget, and the film isn't even funny. I've seen it a few times and they've given me some pretty good things. But it's hard to sit in one of your seats to enjoy it.  I've watched this film, but I wasn't able to sit on a seat to enjoy this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, I'm going to be very upset with it. I can't even see the end credits. The story and the story is not interesting at all. They are just like an old American movie: the ending is so lame. When you think of it, you probably think of the same thing, because it's about a bunch of stupid people who get on stage playing, a couple of bad movie actors and the girl who wants to have sex with their ex-boyfriend... it all comes down to that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original one I bought, the first sequel, was good. The sequel had its own time and was only good for a couple of weeks. The original film was good but too short to be a sequel. The follow-up sequel is far worse.  It was hard to find any good jokes in the original, but there were. I did find a lot of humour in the sequels. The one I liked was, "You'll never sleep like that", and I laughed when I got it. The funny joke was "You're gonna die of course ya", and a couple more jokes. I still think that people will be annoyed at this.  I really didn't get too upset about this sequel, and the original one was okay, but it's way too short for a sequel to take its own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The One True Lover" is a horror movie about a woman who is falling in love with a creepy old man who thinks he's the perfect husband. He is an old movie, but this is only the second movie that I've seen so far.  The only good thing about this movie is that the girl is very attractive and beautiful, even when she isn't on sex.  I don't think I'll ever enjoy this movie, and I don´t care to watch it for anyone, so I gave this movie a negative rating and a low 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film twice over, and that's not the half of it! It's got a lot of rubbish in it, the acting is bad, the dialogue and editing is bad. The acting is OK, though none of it really matters.  The special effects of the movie is pretty good, though some dialog in it isn't quite believable. There are too many scenes in it and there are too few scenes. There aren't enough scenes in the film and too few of them. And I have to warn people, the actors aren't actors, but they're not bad either. But when it comes to acting and dialog, it's all in the wrong.  You can't afford to watch this film. It is in a league with a pretty bad film with a good story, and poor acting, so watch the whole thing, even if you like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. I've seen no other film of its kind in my life. This movie is no longer funny or entertaining. It's just gross, gross, and really not worth a 100-minute film to watch. This is the only one bad movie I've ever seen, but I've already given this one credit.  The script is predictable and fails to make any sense of this movie. I feel like I could've been in the room to see this. It may be worth to see again, but it won't be. It really is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Real World War" (1995) is the worst movie ever made. Some good moments, and some interesting moments, but most of it is flat and boring. If anything, it has to be a pretty horrible flick for anyone to watch it.  This movie is a bad, awful movie for all kinds of reasons, and it is only a good movie to watch for one of the TV shows that came out during the War in Vietnam. I cannot even recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for a really good film to see in their home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really bad film about a stupid, awful film that I found extremely depressing and disappointing, I didn't like it at all, it got me down for the first 4 minutes or so. It's like a bunch of stupid self-defence films. If you watch it without seeing the plot, you would be absolutely depressed. This is such a stupid script that is unbelievably bad, there are no dialog, there is no story, it's pointless. What a plot is it? I'm an idiot. If the plot was good, they would have made a great movie. I don't think it's possible to think of anything else that is even remotely funny. I think this was an accident of a talent that was put together because they wanted a sequel, but since it is not only a sequel and there is a sequel with two sequels, I'm not surprised they let the director make it. If I was the idiot I would have laughed at this as they laughed and laughed, and I'm sure the directors and writers were laughing with me as they were laughing and laughing with them. They had no clue about how serious they could get. I'm a real idiot, not even joking, I think a lot of people in the country and elsewhere are laughing at this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The basic premise is that the two of the characters are in the same room as their respective spouses.  There is a lot of sex between the characters and no mention of anything else in the movie. It's a weird story line but doesn't much more than an insult. The plot is weak but not terrible, and if you want a comedy at all it isn't even funny. It has an over-the-top atmosphere and bad acting that doesn't exactly fit the situation. If you're a guy and like it, maybe you'll be okay but you won't really enjoy it.   If you are expecting to see more of a comedy film that you like, maybe your expectations will be too much. There are some good parts of the movie, but it has a lot to lose. The ending is pretty predictable and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of "Fever Man", and I used to watch it every week. I loved it for the same reason it is a hilarious film: it's a long movie, very predictable, and very slow. What was bad for the film was the fact that it was poorly paced. I don't want to waste time, but I didn't care for any of the plot and I'd never bothered to watch this movie. I think it's an interesting subject for a lot of us who don't have a good movie to watch. It's the movie with a "CUT THAT'S" attitude! It's so shallow, there's no character development! I've never heard of this before, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was very bad on its own, and the writer should have sent it to the "Witsney" gang. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I got into this film as one of the worst of my entire "unforgetful" horror films, and I finally find out that I don't have any idea who it is. Also, there is a very long wind storm after the climax. When you know your name is one of four guys that are responsible for this movie, you have to try and survive the next storm, even though the guys are extremely good. The ending is fairly predictable, but I'm sure the writer is guilty. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a decent interest to read this and didn't like it. I really wanted to give it a good rating, but sadly, I didn't. It had the whole plot of "Gunga" (the one where the wife and mother meet a couple of prostitutes in the night. A very dull and unsymbolic plot. I don't care if anyone sees this, it's not good for anyone.  Anyway, what a disappointment! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are plenty of reasons why this film fails to become an original, but none of them matter to this movie. I've seen more than 30 times since this movie was released, and I think that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film is so bad that it makes people cringe and cringe and the viewer thinks they can do anything right. This is an action/dramination film that could have been easily adapted to a film like "Rango". However, it should have been done by a studio or director who knew what they were doing, and who knew how to make action films. A terrible film.  The movie was very bad on one level - the acting and camera. I never knew the acting was this bad but it is. The cinematography was very poor, and there were many holes in the story line and it took about as long as it needed to, I think. But overall, I found the movie to be very bad. I did not like the way this film is acting out with a poor acting, which was especially bad at some of the scenes. It just seemed as if the movie had a slight, yet very small joke.  I think the story was badly done by the producers. I'm a long time fan of this movie, but it was just too bad for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has been bad. i mean it's a little disappointing, but i really liked this movie because its not one of the worst movies.  all the dialog is terrible. the acting is a little dull, and there are no funny moments. this movie is just a bad joke! don't take it for granted, the guy who came out with this movie didn't think it was worth watching.  a few things to note about this movie. 1. they aren't making it for the sake of making it, but they ARE making it. 2. the music is bad, and all the time you hear a song will get annoying. 3. i don't think the director is really trying to make something. 4. the lead actor seems like an actor, but he has to change his attitude constantly.  the plot is bad. its too long, and if you get bored it won't work at all. i recommend you take the DVD of this movie, because its a fun rip-off.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film's main theme is really just the existence of a single, gigantic rock monster, and the rest of the movie is nothing but an over-the-clotched, pretense-like thriller with no real plot, that makes me wonder why it got made. The ending is so lame that I even gave it 10 out 10.  It's really the worst horror movie ever made, and I can't say that I'd even bothered to rent it, but I'm sure the people who are actually interested will find some interest in it anyway.  A real shame, considering the fact that it was made to celebrate a movie about the very rarest thing - a rock monster - that actually has its own ending! The movie had a few decent bits of action in the first half of the film, but it lacked some very decent scenes and acting. And some of the characters are good, but they're just a bit boring, too. I can see a lot of movies like this and say they're funny, but these ones just do not seem to be fun.  If you want to look at a movie with a low, cheesy budget, don't even rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie for so many years, and I finally decided to rent it. So, this was not going to be an instant classic.  This is the worst movie ever I have ever seen, ever, and no one I know has ever seen is better than this movie. The story is terrible and it is hard to watch. The script is not funny, the camera is bad, and the soundtrack is not even good. The acting is so bad it is impossible to understand the characters' thoughts. And the acting is bad and really painful. I had never seen a movie with such awful acting before, so I had to really sit in front of the theatre to see it. I really feel like having to get on my hands and knees and try to get through some of this stuff. The movie is so poor it could never get a good rating in any area. If you have seen this movie, please skip it, and only see it if it's a 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a piece of garbage. It was poorly scripted and didn't have any story line. The story is not enough to make the viewer interested, and it is so predictable that there is nothing to see in this film. There is nothing that will interest you. The film is the most disappointing film of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are only three or four parts that are worth watching to see the movie. If you are a fan of one of "Shenzenberg" films, or even a movie whose sole reason to be considered an interesting film is that it has been given the name "The Nine Great Fractions." In other words, you get a little of an idea of the concept that is supposed to be the core of the film. In other, the whole premise is the same as in a "The Matrix" where the "Matrix" is presented from behind and in front. Also, there are very few decent "jokes" in this film. However, most of the "joke" jokes are bad.   And the acting is bad. A couple of good-looking faces with good looks are wasted by this actor. One of them is played by some sort of person who is supposed for a role in a soap opera.  A man is supposed in the role of a "sister" but you can easily figure out that it is just an impulsive, rude person.  I could have seen this film as a joke but it could have been better.  There is really nothing in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the movie has progressed it looks to be a comedy and I was hoping to find something humorous and funny to go with it. It is nothing more than a very boring, self-indulgent film that plays out like the soap opera on which it's predecessor are made. In the end I found a new comedy on the other side of the movie and I laughed while watching it. The characters are pretty lame and I wish there was some humor to go back to the film. I'm sorry, I gave this a 4 out of 10 but I wasn't that hard on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was the big mistake in a life. After hearing the story and the storyline, I was expecting to be so excited to see this movie. I was disappointed, because I wasn't really anticipating anything. I just hoped that the film would at least be interesting. I think the filmmakers were completely unable to make the movie interesting, even if it were an hour and a half. As an adult, I want to know how badly this movie is flawed. I really don't want to watch this movie and I hate it's sequel. But I do have to make my movie like a movie. It isn't entertaining and it should have been better. It made me feel stupid and also made me think I was getting sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Aliens" is a long-ishiring, possibly pretentious and probably unappreciated horror film, but that's not what was about the main story. In the first act, I was taken in through one of the first scenes. This seems to be true at the beginning and at the end, but at the very end the movie starts having problems. The plot seems very weak. If you're not part of a group of humans with a mind and an ego, and especially if you're in a group with a good personality and are willing to share your life with others, I would recommend "Punches" over "Alists". There's nothing else to say about it except that it's boring and pretentious. This movie is about an ordinary person (or even an average) who gets caught in something they're not even interested in and then become a victim of a serial killer, which means it'll be a long movie.  It's not worth watching if you like horror or horror, but if you want to be entertained then don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of the music videos of this movie and I think it would have been better than an 80 minute, long-for-the-sober music video, if that would ever have been made. But unfortunately, it's not the best thing of all time. They're not even close to the video game's soundtrack, so their music is less entertaining and less memorable. Also, the lyrics are pretty, and are just pointless, so they aren't very catchy. The music is quite bad.  The whole thing, I'm sorry, really, it just sucks, but I don't want to hear more of these terrible music videos. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end the movie takes 2 years off, but we still have to see the plot unfold. We get to see it in the second movie. In the last scene we get to know the character. But when we get the scene where he has to leave the world to get a new job and how the previous people left their way in a good way. The ending seems to be too slow and predictable. How does it finish? Is it the end of an endless story that has nothing to show us, or something else?  This is the movie of the first year, so I'm a little disappointed. I thought that a lot of money had been spent on the making of this movie. It would have been interesting if they made a sequel or a follow-up. And there are people who think that a sequel is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie. It is a horrible excuse for a movie to become a full time production. It was a pretty interesting game with this premise. Unfortunately it was the only movie that didn't have an ending. It seemed like a plot of some sort of film from a tv show to a movie, where the movie director tried to take this game to the whole world as a movie instead of making a movie like a movie involving a guy chasing a girl. I can't really say if it was meant to be a movie though because the movie is really just a movie about a movie being a movie! I really think that there is a difference between a movie that is a movie and a movie made up as a film and a film that is an actual movie. So I guess it should be a different movie.  This movie isn't like the original game where I played and made my way through the whole movie and played through the game, as I actually did. I didn't know that I played in the first game until I watched it for the first time. This movie wasn't like a story of me being on my way to the next day where I had to win the game and it wasn't an ending of my own game. I never got to see the next morning when the game was over. I think I remember it being more like a "play time" movie than the original. The game was a short movie about 30 minutes of bad jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even remotely an original work. It's more of a generic "comedic" style film. I couldn't find the film's punchline funny or even close to the original. I think they made the film so bad that it could've been taken out by a high school student, if a student would have been so bored. I really didn't like this movie in any way, even if it were an original one. It is one of the worst comedy films I've seen in years. And while the main characters are good, the acting is bad, there isn't one decent laugh. There's just so much of it in the movie that it falls on you like a bad piece of toilet paper. The only thing good about the movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of fans love this movie. It's an excuse for a mediocre cast. But I'm not one of them. This movie is actually so bad that I'd recommend that it be put into a better movie. Also, the first half of this movie is a complete waste of time. A whole lot of dialog is wasted. The dialog can sometimes be annoying. The direction is not up-to-the-level, and the characters are all bad. They don't look like they are funny, nor realistic. And, although the storyline is interesting, the acting isn't good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some nice moments. But the rest are bad. It's not a great horror film, but it does not try to be funny, and it's not funny. It is painfully disappointing. It just doesn't work, even by modern standards, to be effective. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the first of the horror movies that are all about as bad as they get. There is a plot, but there is no real plot.  The film has a very superficial cast. If you want to see a good story, the way is probably a way to avoid the film. The acting is also bad, with a very low acting cast (who is, in a horror film, the best). The gore has a slight resemblance to the movie's earlier, so we should have learned that from the early scenes of the original "Horror Asylum", but in the newer films, where the gore is more prominent, it is completely out of place and completely uninteresting. There are some interesting bits, like the ending. But, even for most horror movies, the gore always gets underwhelming. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even close to being as bad as it is. I'm only one person who sees this film and think to me that it's good. It really isn't that bad, not by any means, but the lack of suspense is disappointing and makes me dislike the idea of being a movie that drags out nothing, even though there is an interesting concept.  It's just plain bad. I do believe that it does have some potential, but it doesn't really see how it could turn out to be worth watching. Also, the fact that I'm a big fan of the series, this film just isn't good for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst of many I've ever watched in my life. I'm only going through two, so I can't comment on it.  What a disappointing movie! It looks like a film for some reason. It contains so many wrong info. The story is bad, the acting is bad and the cinematography is bad. But there are some good scenes, some of the acting was fine, but the acting isn't so good. The girl is good, but there are a lot of stupid scenes and a lot too shallow to take seriously. I can guarantee I never saw anyone in the movie before, and I couldn't care less if I had to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can really see how the writers put this together. I would be amazed if they were allowed to make a movie out of it. If they were not, I would definitely have to take the film out of my hands. It's just that awful!  I had a bit of pity for this movie after being in it for so long. I really liked all the movies because I enjoyed those movies.  This movie has just the absolute WORST actors in this film. It should be an extra effort to kill the actors to see how badly they could do it.  I would like to see the actors try to make better movies, with this one at least having any charm whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I cannot believe that a movie had more than one minute of dialogue. I tried to think about something else, and I think the only thing about this movie was that it could not follow. There is not one, not one decent character. It's like the way you will never watch. I am so sorry to the movie reviewer. The movie will be shown on the cable channel, and that is about the only reason this movie could ever be made. If you want to see a movie that has nothing to do with the world, like "Mausoleum", or "The Black Hole", or any other other bad movie, then you may want to watch "The Hangover". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie was the fact that it had the great name of the book to take it seriously. However, the movie suffers from a lot of stupid ideas. Most of them were put forward by the creators of the movie (as much as I'd like to have it). The story is so badly constructed that it was impossible to understand the story. Even the end and the credits are not good at all. I was very upset when I heard that the whole movie is in the name of a good book, and that the movie is so bad that I couldn't even get through the end. However I still enjoyed the "jungle", because it is very funny, especially the characters' reactions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be really low-budget, but i'm sure it was a bit worse than I anticipated. It's not even close, it was bad. It doesn't even have the decency that makes the first one of the few better comedy comedies out of a lot of garbage movies. There is no funny or interesting thing in this movie. I mean I think this movie could probably be a great film, but just the whole premise was kind of weak, and there wasn't any real connection between the characters. If you're looking for a funny and funny movie, and you like watching your own life, then go to this movie instead of the other one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I thought it was one way too slow. The script is pretty weak and the acting is pretty awful, it's just the way it wants to be a film. But you still feel like there is a little bit of magic. I'm sure the acting in this movie isn't bad, but I'm just a little scared of the whole thing.  The movie is supposed to be about a group of people who get killed, and then the main character comes back to life to explain how they did everything. You may find this movie annoying, but it could also be interesting if you like a lot of comedy or even just one comedy. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a little piece of theater and gets bored or if you liked some movie to show to your friends. It just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film on Wednesday and I thought it sucked, not even a bit, but this is one of the worst movies I've seen since this was a horror flick of the decade, and I don't know if it has ever been better or more entertaining, not counting Scream. This is a film you would normally expect to be the weakest of the bunch. It is also so bad because it's so bad that it's not scary, even though it is about as scary as it possibly could be, and the camera work is so bad. I'm sure the producers thought they would make a movie that was not scary like Scream, but they didn't. I can barely finish watching this, even with the fact that it was good, and it was only a few minutes before I began laughing at the ending. I hope this is never made again and we can see what awful it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie while my child was sleeping. I kept watching this movie as it rammed through. It was terrible, I didn't understand the plot. I had to go off and think about it. I did so and after I had finished watching it, I realized I was completely under the influence. When I came back, I was horrified to hear my child screaming. I don't know if they're really a family, but what's the point? I'd rather have my child put to sleep than watched this movie. It really should have been a PG-13 movie. I just didn't like the story and characters. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This movie is an example of bad, low-budget movies. They really don't deserve to be on this level, so they're dangerous. Don't give them money. They may come up with good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea this was so bad. The story is so bad that you have to give the little plot element it was worth. I found it to be really bad and the acting was just awful. I don't know if I'm correct. In fact I think the actors in the movie were good. I can see they would have to act much better than it.  The dialogue is stupid and the ending is really lame.  I have to say that I wasn't really thrilled with this film. I'm only 9 months older. It wasn't worth the money I had put in. I'd have liked a movie that was better than this. I just don't think it's worth even in life for most of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. It was actually funny when I thought it was funny. And this movie is so terrible and it has no plot. There were a few good moments like the opening sequence and the ending sequence is very bad. This movie really was just an overrated "dramedy" that seemed to take on the idea of "the next big thing". But even the ending is extremely disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who loves movies and knows what a movie is - if not that a film's just a collection of bad choices and bad ideas - then it's for you.  This movie isn't just bad, it's an over the top comedy with no real story, no real character development or anything else - that's why I think the director was an acting teacher (in a country school for most) and this is why he had to write the screenplay, because he was teaching something about acting in a country of foreign students (in fact he has never been in the country and only has 1 degree of English) but he's not one to do well with acting so clearly, and this leads into a very shallow storyline that doesn't allow you to follow the plot - I can't understand why it's only one of three or five episodes and a plot doesn't make it into the TV show - at least, it should have been one of at least nine episodes.  The ending is so stupid, as it starts with a ridiculous character who doesn't care what happens - of course she wants the hero to die - oh, yeah she wants her to die, she's in love with the hero - what does she do - she wants to watch him die so that her love will win the day? - what's the story about?  I just laughed for this bad movie.  I also wish the actress didn't have a voice for a special character in this film - it would have been much better to have some kind of special character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad I almost cried. I was so upset I actually cried twice! I guess this was made for some sort of "unlikely" audience. The worst thing of all was that the "fictional" premise was actually a "real" existence. You don't need to believe a fake writer to make a film about a fictional person, the only thing that comes to mind in that scenario is the "real-life reality". If that's a bad thing, why doesn't they have produced a better film? That's how movies get made! If you're a fan of a movie this is a bad film!! I had to look at a few other ones like the "A Man Named Hazel" which is a better movie than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie to be so bad that I didn't even enjoy it. It seems the movie was not that funny when I first watched it, so I was a little bit wary. I was even thinking if it was really worth seeing this movie, and it was such a disappointment to see the movie finally released after only one day. This movie was so bad it wasn't worth seeing, and I thought my entire life was over when it was released. It really is a bad choice, even for a cheap film to rent. I really didn't want to rent it, and instead I just kept it for my own enjoyment and just a small bit of time to distract me from my real life. So I will never go on it, as it is just a waste of time. I don't think I could really have been sad over this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to make any comment on the acting, but I will give a negative one. When I was sitting in my room listening to this movie, my ears were filled with silence, and the only thing I had ever been hearing besides a sound, was the humming, the sirens, the loud buzz, and, the voices, all mixed together. There are even some lines that have a sound effect, like the beginning, where a guy is talking, and he has a bunch of "D"s and "E"s. But after watching it I was actually, in my best category, a bit disturbed by it. I could tell there were some parts that weren't completely obvious, and there was a bad actor in the movie, but overall, it just didn't make any sense whatsoever. It's not that the movie is bad, but it lacks credibility and it seems to be an attempt to glorify a bad genre of television. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give the director credit for not writing the script that made this movie a bad and stupid mistake. It is not a good movie, but it is not as funny as the reviews have made it out to be. I would have rated it as one half of a bad horror film or a zombie film. And yet it is full of so many awful and stupid jokes that I would never enjoy. Even when the movie is interesting it becomes boring, not just because it is so awful it wears out the viewer. A bad horror movie is not good and a bad zombie movie is pretty fun, but not a funny movie. Also a bad action movie: A horror film was never funny enough to be scary when it first came out. But a zombie movie has more potential to scare the crowd than an action movie does.  I have one word to say,  "CODEL" is the worst movie I've ever seen. It was the worst film I have ever seen in my life. It just doesn't have any suspense. It's just so bad. It has no room for humor and no room to make the characters funny or interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So we have this thing. This thing sucks for a lot of people. It's not a great film and it just has to be boring. It has an obvious, obvious ending, and I'm sure the director is good at making funny things. But this is still not the best film I've seen in this year, probably.  So a problem is that I don't have a decent answer for why this movie is bad. The answer I give it is that "this movie is just really bad, it really sucks".  It's really bad because there's too much time spent on plot, too many pointless and pointless characters, too long ending, too much pointless dialog, too bad jokes, and too much money for the ending.   If you have an itch to see it, I'd recommend not watching it unless you want to see something a few hours later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of time. It's a bad piece of work, and I think it should be more than a 3 hour film. The characters are a little unbelievable, and the editing is very bad. You know what happens when you want to break up? What happens when there is nothing to break? It's sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film. It has so many things that it tries to create and then use for the next movie. One thing I do not like is that the movie doesn't really tell the story of the characters. And it has so few action scenes and nothing really special in the whole film. Also, it has a bunch of stupid acting. I think it needs to be a sequel to some other movie. I also hate this movie because it's the worst film I've seen in years. But it really doesn't mean that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be one of the worst films I have seen in years. It's boring and I hate the people that make it. This has been bad since the first one, but I haven't touched this one yet. I'm not sure why this is the first film in the series? It's so bad, I just think it's funny. I've been looking for something better and so much better. It just seemed like a bunch of people who didn't know how to kill. I watched it and laughed. I don't understand why the director and writer put this crap together. The director and actor aren't even good. I want them to go away from their projects. This movie needs to be put down immediately. Don't look at the good parts, because this is a really bad movie. I could have put it in my back somewhere and just used it as a result of a bad film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first episode before reading a negative comment on one of the comments on another. The first story on this movie is not good enough to recommend, it is bad in the sense of being the worst movie ever ever made. Also, the ending of the story is very predictable, and the plot goes through the very boring plot, which is very weak and has little substance at all. If you like the fact that this movie has a female protagonist (Gia Evans), you'll probably not like it when they run through the entire movie without getting any real plot of their own. (And this is one thing that bothers me.) If you are a fan of the show, the movie is bad for you, if you like it to be funny and enjoy it, watch it to enjoy it. And there is not enough of a story to care for at all, it's just plain bad. There are also many people who are angry about the movie because it is poorly done. They are not intelligent, and have no interest in the show.  This movie is even less interesting than most of the other movies that have similar plots. And the actors are also bad, and no one who wants to see their own lives, especially the one who acts with an innocent and innocent nature. I would not recommend watching this movie, but if you liked the show and think there is a good chance to catch some good story, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have seen in the past decade. It was just an average bad movie that lacked a sense of suspense and plot. The acting is the weakest part of this movie. The story is not even interesting to anybody. There was nothing funny and interesting to the story. The movie had no suspense and it seemed to be out-of-order. The best way to enjoy this movie is not to watch it but to keep it out of the theater. If you do this movie, and that is not enough, you will lose your respect as a friend and a brother of a friend who has been put through this in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An hour and a half of an film of an obvious porn flick for the horror film genre, but also a full-on brainless zombie movie: "Culture!" is a comedy about a series of horror films about zombies who have to get through some nasty zombie films like "Death City" and "Death Zone" in order to get out of their infection. The zombie genre is pretty straight forward, as you'd expect, but this one is just one of those that do a complete lack of creative ideas.  And don't expect a credit card. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First thing I noticed after the movie began, was the ending and the plot, the story is very thin and predictable, but there is a lot of holes in the plot. For one thing, the plot and the characters are too stupid, with a very hard-hitting humor, but not even a gag. It turns into an actual plot, not a comedy or a fantasy like the one used in "Happy Tree", with its almost comedic-heavy ending. There is no funny laughter here, even if there is to be. I know that a movie like that is a comedy, but the only joke the characters get in the end is to act very stupid. The funny and stupid humor of "Happy tree" is not funny, but it's just sad and painful to watch. It wasn't funny until the last minute.  There is a very serious problem here, if you don't mind the ending. I mean, I saw it twice, so what are you two guys saying? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i saw the plot, i'm a fan of this show so far, but not that bad. But it seems to have fallen into a bad habit for the fact that it looks like a very obvious homage of 1950's 'Iron Man' and there are few other people who would find this ridiculous. I understand that people might want to see the movie as an homage, but you can't, because it's not, it's terrible and the acting is awful!  If the movie was so good it would have been a great comedy, but there is something strange about it and its terrible acting. There should have been some kind of a comedy that can take the plot and make it more fun. That would have happened if it was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not even interested in this film to get into the debate on whether it's "better than a movie". The first problem is that, this is only a short, 20 minute film. It seems to follow a very, um, long story. It's a "light" film, not a film, and you have the same problems as I do. It makes no sense of being a film. In fact, I can't even tell the difference between films. It doesn't really help that it's an average film, but it's not funny. There are some scenes, like the scenes at the beginning of the film, which are actually a part of the movie, so they are all the same when you watch the scenes in the "real" movie.  I can tell by watching the movie that the acting is bad, and I cannot believe that the director was competent enough to make a decent script. I can not believe that one of the actors is good, and all the other "wisest" actors are bad. If there was any sort of indication of "plot" in the film that could make me believe it was "better", I would have watched it all through. There's a whole lot of nothing in it and nothing to say that it was a "real film".  It's completely pointless, and as a result, I cannot even give it four or five out-star stars.   The film is not interesting, and the ending is not funny, but I've seen it and there are some of the most terrible scenes I've ever seen. You just don't really get involved in the story.  The one good thing about this movie is that there are several of the people in it, including the guys who are on the opposite of the main characters. This is the very low-budget film for a low budget, but that's not a good film. I feel that it does a decent job in making people laugh and feel bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so disappointing to me that I will never watch it. The plot is boring, the acting was bad, the editing was bad. But what I have to say about it is it is just that bad. The fact that it was filmed in Los Angeles gives it a slight chance to be funny, but it wasn't. The film was also poorly edited, and it is obviously terrible. Its also painfully depressing and the acting is bad.  I give this film one star rating, but don't watch it unless you really want to cry. It just doesn't have the ability to make you care about anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to agree with everyone that this movie is a waste of money, there is a lot of room in the room, the cinematography seems to be lacking, the writing seems to suck a little more air than the people expect. If you want to watch this film, don't! It's not good at all!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film for 3 minutes and felt like I was being cheated.  I am not sure which direction was to be taken. In any other case this film was a waste of time! What a waste it is, because this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. In the end you're left to realize that it is no good! It was probably a bad film but I give it the highest rating of 5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find that this film was just a bit too long, which I can't find much more out of. Of course, I do appreciate that this movie isn't a zombie-film parody of the original, and that there were no zombies or zombies to show up. I had seen the first film before it was released, and it was not all that exciting. But it would have been cool to see some people in the movies before, and now, it is too hard to look at even one person in the film. I don't really understand the premise. The plot is too short and is not at all interesting. And the ending is pretty stupid, with the same story line repeating and the same ending. I can only assume that this was one film that made it's way out from the beginning. I was expecting it to be a good movie, and even though it isn't good, it really deserves to die for a time. But unfortunately it's too bad to be good. I didn't expect it to have any redeeming qualities, but it did at least some. Unfortunately it is not one that has anything to say of a zombie film, like most horror movies. I do hope that the people in this movie can do something better. But just the wrong kind of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A young American writer (for my, this is the film that gets me crying and most likely will be remembered by my father.) writes about a young boy who wants to kill a girl.  This is not the first I have ever seen, but I was in the room with the boy for a long time, and after a few minutes, the boy's girlfriend tells me that she didn't understand why the man was saying so much.  The film was bad. The acting was bad, the cinematography was bad and the script was bad in any manner.  If I were to review this movie, I would recommend it to everyone and say it's got some badness for a horror movie but it's not worth spending time on it. I don't understand this movie's impact on the viewer's psyche. I have seen this movie several times, and it never makes me laugh, and I think the movie is just too long. I guess there's a way to kill off this movie without making too big of a difference. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not like to recommend this film, because I found the story so unbelievable! I would have liked to see a movie like this with a strong, complex story that didn't care what the actors did and who is left, and there would be a great story if the actors and crew were good actors, and this movie didn't deliver on it. I didn't like it because I felt the cast was terrible, I felt like the actors were just playing the scenes, the dialog was awful, the direction was awful... and even the scenes were really bad. The acting was pretty good for some of the characters, and the cinematography was good, but the characters weren't good and the movie's story couldn't be anything serious.  And the director was very bad, but this has to be an example of how bad the industry is at directing, directing, creating, and in the end, trying to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no redeeming quality in this movie; it's boring. I wouldn't even recommend this movie to anyone who likes a little fun-filled movie; the director would be embarrassed. The cinematography is so bad that it feels like some old horror movie, or even an 'Diner's Tale' from the first-century fantasy novel.  The plot's so predictable, boring and hard to grasp; the acting is so poor, that I'd be a fool to want to see more of it.  I think this movie might have been made for a purpose, but that never seems to matter in its content. What would be the point? Well, this movie is just terrible. It's disappointing in its worst possible scenario, but it does its best job of being predictable and boring.  It's a pretty bad movie, but the idea of "having sex" is too much. I don't care for that, even in the first few years of marriage. The film is simply unappreciable in its own way; it shouldn't be made anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I came to see this movie I was looking at my own, the only way I could see it was the trailer for this film which was very good. I don't have to say that it was good for the movie, it just was bad. This film was awful. It had a VERY bad feel to it and seemed to be a real waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is badly acted and bad in the script. The acting is bad on the whole. I found the acting to be very bad. However, I still have high hopes for the plot and the story. What can you say about it? I'm hoping that the writers would try to get back to the script instead of making a movie just for the sake of it. The movie starts out promising. Then I find it is full of bad writing and bad acting. I am hoping that they would try and try to make it better but unfortunately I'm not convinced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first impression of the film was that it was one of three, the other two movies had far better plot. I found that I was much less interested in the rest of the two movies than I was in this one, and they were both very dull, not exciting, not funny. I really liked the sequel, because I felt like the original was an interesting concept with some serious substance to it. But in the other movies, the plot got worse, the characters got less interesting and less convincing, and the film itself was not much of a film.  This was obviously the worst movie I've seen in a long time, but it's interesting to see that these three movies have not aged well, and that I had absolutely no idea how to care about them. I tried to find some of the other films, and I found the plot to be interesting and the characters were interesting, though lacking what they lacked in the first two.  I don't understand why this movie is being played out for a year, and whether they are actually making it or merely pretending, this is a very depressing movie. If they are making it, it's not the best thriller you've ever seen. It seems like a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the premise here and I think most people do agree with it, but for those who didn't, this film is an exercise in futility. I know a good movie for the first time is like "The Perfect Drug".  There are no dialogues, no plot, no story, no character development. It's just a simple piece of film with one plot and no special effects. The film is painfully predictable and boring.  The film was so bad that it made me want to rent an hour and a half. But before watching this movie I'd never even been able to finish watching it because my brain was working on it. I have no idea how it works, and I don't think it works that well.  This movie is about three people who have just one problem. Two of them are a heroin addict, the other a prostitute. This is the end of a 10 year old film that would have been released if it weren't for a horror film. It didn't matter if the people in the movie were acting or not acting. It just looked bad, and it looked good, but bad things happen to people all the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit, I liked some of the dialog in this movie. And, on the other hand, it's not a horror film to be taken seriously. This movie fails at all in its pretense of being a horror movie. If I had to sum it up in a sentence, "this is an utter failure of an horror film!" I would be at least an 8.   It's not really a film, but it's scary, so I don't really know if it was one of the two "fun-scary movies" like "The Crow", or the sequel. If so, you're in the same position as me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is bad and there is nothing to see. This movie would be made to be a film of soap soap and slippers. It's bad on acting and there are many of the slippers from "The Hangmans". The movie has no plot and there aren't even a character.  The end is predictable and there's no plot to speak of. This is probably the worst movie of all time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an attempt to take something down, which was bad enough in this case.  The movie had a very lame opening sequence which made it so bad that it was very easy to lose interest in the story and even more so that the plot was predictable. There were some really good ideas in the plot. Unfortunately, there were a lot of bad ideas. I think it needs to be seen as a sequel. It could not have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised to hear that the director thought the director could have done this. I had never heard about a good movie like this, so I was extremely embarrassed to watch this one. It has an awful plot and awful special effects that don't make the viewer think that there's anything to do. In retrospect, I would have loved to see more of the movie. In the end, it was disappointing for me. The movie is not worth watching. The acting is not good and the special effects are annoying. If you want a good story, make a movie that's about a family affair in a small town in Alabama that has some serious action and doesn't try to be too corny, but you'll find it in "Razzar". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason this movie is so interesting is the fact that it is about a kid with his father...that's not good.  I thought watching this was supposed to be an all-ages movie. I was disappointed when I was told that it was a teen-aged movie...just about teens.  The point of this movie was that the director got bored and didn't have a clue about what he could do with his children. The acting is bad. The plot was not good, and the ending was so bad. You get tired really fast. And this movie really is a huge waste of money.   If you want a teen movie: watch it for your own enjoyment, but do not see the original, original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TM) movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was just bad! I couldn't find the time to watch this film!  It starts off nice, and at some point it becomes a very boring and very stupid film. There are a few funny bits here and there are some funny ideas of some bad movies, but it's not too funny. When you finally get into the main storyline, it becomes painfully obvious. This film isn't even really a horror film, it's a comedy that has absolutely nothing to do with a horror movie, and it starts off with a lot of cheap jokes and nothing to make up for the ending. There is absolutely no way to take this film seriously when it comes to serious effects like suicide or murder. This has no redeeming quality whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame really how few of the first 90 pictures we got are remembered. This film was not the worst film I've ever seen, and perhaps more like this one, but not at all an entertaining film. I've even found a copy of it in the bins, and I can tell you it is the worst horror film I have ever seen. In the end, I gave it to my father, who he has not watched because he has so much entertainment with movies. The plot was about some kids having a bad fight with each other girl, and they decide to stop the fight so everyone will stop fighting. I think I would have given it two stars, but I'm sure the movie could be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in the first preview of "WOW" and even in my eyes I was not able to enjoy this movie. I was looking for a good movie to watch but alas, it was just a bad effort that failed on all fronts. I would like to give some credit to the directors of the movie but I can only tell you how bad it is. I don't know why they were so afraid to put a bad ending with an actor like Jeremy Dolan but they did it. I mean, you can say, "I saw this when it was in the preview" and you wouldn't want to have anything else to talk about. Just watching this movie, and if you're like me, you will never enjoy the movie.    If you like a movie with an entertaining storyline that is somewhat predictable, but not funny, watch this movie if you are interested in watching something that is full of bad acting and poorly written/edited. The acting is terrible. This movie is terrible, bad, and not funny.  This movie just keeps repeating the same kind of movie again and again. I can't recommend this movie as it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. If you are one of those who like to laugh and get the funny out of it, then watch this for enjoyment but don't do anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a shame-worthy movie, although I found the story very entertaining. The plot was a huge letdown for the movie. I was upset that it wasn't in fact a remake of "The Seven Cities Of Heaven" I thought I would have enjoyed it more. I could not find any enjoyment at all in it. The story is so stupid and it's supposed to be scary. There's no story. It's just a short episode about a family reunion that takes place in a remote town. The family has to leave their home for the wedding. The two characters spend the time getting ready to rent the same room for the same price.  This movie was very bad for me. I gave the rating a 2 out of 10, but the movie doesn't deserve such a rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time and was like "I'm not going to be part of this movie" I really don't like this movie, I mean it's just so badly written and the ending is so sad it's annoying... I wish I didn't have to see this movie and I never will! I was going to watch it again and after I watched it I was embarrassed by it, and I have just given up on it...I can't go to sleep after seeing it again. I would never watch this movie again if i want to see something else that is worth seeing. I will never say this again!!: the ending isn't funny, it's depressing and the director of this film is a complete jerk...I am ashamed to say I gave it my only one stars rating because I liked the director, not because I hate this movie but I didn´s hate it, just because it is so bad!!! I really liked to see more of my favorite films, but this movie is terrible, I would give it no stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, a remake of the original, is a horrible disappointment. I cannot recommend this movie unless you're a die-hard fan of the film! It is very bad! This movie is NOT an insult to fans of the series. It is just a horrible imitation of the show. I found this movie extremely disappointing and the fact that I was able to enjoy it without watching it was the result of me liking it! I feel like a half-wit watching this! I understand the original show had many good episodes, but please understand that the remake is bad! Don't waste your time watching this horrible-looking movie. Avoid it if you like the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been watching this movie since it came out and was very sick to the point of dizzying me out so I was sitting in the bathroom in a little room with my roommate. I don't know how anyone got this movie. The movie seemed to be an extension of the book and only got some of the scenes and scenes that were actually in the book. And I couldn't even read the book that was used as the basis for the book, or read the movie's ending. As I sat in this room, I finally got the film out and I didn't like it. I laughed when I saw the first line in the movie and it was very, very, and totally stupid. I thought that this movie was really, really stupid. And the characters were so stupid that they didn't recognize that they were just an extension and there were a lot of problems that had nothing to do with the characters' characters. In the end, the movie could have been a nice film. It just really bad, and a little dull. The book was good and I don against it but it didn't really have much appeal. But even if I had liked the book it was just not this movie's, that's my opinion. The characters aren't in the same book and the movie doesn't have much to do. There was some cute dialog in the movies. There were two funny scenes where the main character had a break down in the relationship of a woman. I saw them in the film but couldn't really tell what was going on but the fact that they went through the break down and everything seemed to happen just as a result of nothing. I was very disappointed because this movie wasn't even a good movie at the beginning. I would rate this movie about 2 or 3 out of 10. It was really very bad. It seemed to rise out of nowhere and then it had a lot more of problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a classic example of a bad remake of a "Mad, or Die!", directed by the Canadian director Eric Heiman. I guess this is the second "Mad", this one is the worst. It has no story. It is full of pointless gore; even the camera is broken. It does have a story, but the story is not original. And while the acting is good, it was very, very bad. The acting is awful, too. I won't even bother mentioning the story. I've seen this movie in the Canadian movie magazine, it says it was based on a short movie about a movie that was about the "Mad". It isn't even "really about" the movie but a "movie" of a short film. You won't like it.  There is a good story, you'll enjoy it but there is nothing original and the ending is very, in fact, stupid.  The good part of this movie was the very brief, brief, and silly movie. The other part was the story was original (and stupid) but this movie is about the bad version of a horror movie and its supposed "Mad!". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just an over-explanning for a great film, I think it has been done in a dozen or so films. The only real positive review was "the funny funny movie: the movie doesn't seem to make it funny. Also, the only good scene is a fight scene between two guys. This movie just got bad from the movie's ending." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past. It is absolutely pointless to even have to watch it. It fails to make any interesting question or question about the nature of the Earth, or how it was formed in the first, second, and third centuries of this existence, or even how this new world is supposed to work, to be very exciting and so, of course, not happening to occur. It also makes the viewer wonder why the writer even exists. The premise is just simply a bunch of nonsense and the ending is even worse than the beginning.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get drunk with it. And no one would care about having to pay for this. It's only a joke after what the writer has made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not have been surprised if i saw this film. I can't say this movie was that bad or that it didn't have a decent plot. But I cannot say that this movie stands for itself. There was nothing good about it. If you're looking for a movie, don't waste your time and look at it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I said, I do not believe the movie was good, it just lacked substance, which is something that all so many movies in this age struggle with.  But I guess it's a good movie because you get to see some of the other things that were in the movie. I guess that's not just a movie; it's also a bunch of old men who are not in their current prime. This movie isn't really good on any of the stages. They are dressed like the women of the film are; I can't tell if they are good or bad. I can only guess. I'll try to add to the review, so that people who think they are going to be into the movie may want to avoid it, but if you really want to see something that's decent, then go. I was honestly a little bit surprised that the script was so bad. The story line was pretty good and although the actors were good they had serious problems with their characters.  The dialog was really not that good, because the guys in the scene, especially, weren't good actors. They seemed to think they were being truthful, but they weren't.  What really was wrong is that they don't make any sense, but for me this movie has nothing that matters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing in this movie. It was never funny and it never made sense. A very poor movie. I give this movie two stars because I thought the actors in the movie were good. A couple of acting players don't have any clue or passion and even the lead actor, I thought he was funny, had a sense of humor, but the lead simply gave the same old jokes to the other actors. The main focus of the movie is about the bad dialog. It is bad for acting, which I have always liked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to see the other 3 movies in the store. I'm going to guess this one is the worst one of them all! The main focus on this movie is sex in this movie. The sex scene starts with a couple in a bedroom, and then is moved to the bathroom, and the scene goes on.  The sex scenes are simply the same as the last two.  In the last scene you get some of the sex scene, but the sex is pretty tame and there aren't any funny things happening. And the final scene is pretty funny, but it should not have been made. There are a lot of stupid scenes in this film, and I would suggest giving this movie a B+ rating.  I really should give this movie the one 20 minutes it needs to make it good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this film is a complete disaster. I'd be surprised to see the actors and the sets. They are pretty good. There were the acting actors were really bad. Also, there were a lot of things in the sets that didn't make sense. The most annoying aspect is the movie was a major mess. The soundtrack wasn't good either, either. I'm not a music critic and I think that the soundtrack was bad. The cinematography was awful as well. You can probably just skip the movie if you want to see it. Don't even rent it, unless you're looking for the best of the bunch. If you rent it and want to watch it again, you're probably wasting money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know you have been here for months or so, but I was one of those that went in the film at 8. The acting wasn't good, but the storyline was not so strong. I know I should be embarrassed to see this so bad. The movie's not really bad, but at least it's not too good. I don't even know what a sequel would be, if it was just a sequel. I think I'll have to see something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film were really good, this would be good, but sadly it is bad. A poorly acted, over-dramed, overrated, cheesy film of a horror film should never have been made. The film features an over-inflated ending, and a pretty girl with blonde hair and hair-covered face, and the ending is bad to the viewer. And the acting of the girl, for instance, is terrible. And, most importantly, I have never seen a scary film in which women are portrayed as evil monsters with "bloody eyes" in a zombie movie! What's wrong with this film? I guess nobody likes it, because it's not very well made. It's not even funny, it really is just awful.  And, oh, what a guy was thinking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical about this film, and so was the other reviewer. I was scared to believe it had an interesting plot. I didn't like it, but I was hoping it had something to offer. Unfortunately, it lacked all interest of either of the two actors. I'm afraid to admit that I didn\'t like the film, but the other reviewers did. But I was given the chance to go see the film while I did my research. Unfortunately the film has no redeeming features, or good acting whatsoever. It wasn't even shown on camera, the camera was used only occasionally for close-up shots to the actors. But there were some interesting scenes. I don\'t know whether they were supposed to be real, but they look like they were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful! It was obviously a waste of time and money to put this movie into the shelves. I'm a huge fan of the original series so I was annoyed with the new version as well. It was obvious that this sequel should be more intelligent and serious than the original movie. In hindsight I didn't even care about the story line and it seemed like an episode. The only good thing about it was the fact that the first two episodes were so funny and they were also hilarious. Unfortunately the writers and producers screwed up their own plans.  The only redeeming thing about this movie was the characters and the humor. Otherwise it was an awful joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a really awful movie, that is bad for any true fans of the true "Batman" movies. I really laughed at the ending of the movie. The ending is quite ridiculous and I think even more unbelievable considering that it was a movie with an 80% chance of being successful. The acting is very bad, if not as good as all the movies they are made, there was a very bad story line, and some of the lines were extremely predictable. All of the characters are stupid and have some seriously stupid voices. There wasn't any witty one. This movie is extremely bad for anyone interested in this kind of movie. A movie with a 70% chance to be good must never happen, at least in this particular situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first line I read, the narrator (and acting coach) seems to think that the "perfect" music is to be the same for all music.  What a total disaster. Not only is it very un-directional - and at times absurdly confusing - it can't even survive the simplest of rhyme. There is no idea of a plot; just as one could only assume a more-than-obtrudated-looking "music" video to be, there is no clue what a musical number is to actually contain a musical phrase. In fact, the singer appears to be making this video to have no songs - no music lyrics, no sound effects.  But, the most disappointing aspect of this movie is the lack of any sort of music. The music is nothing but music; just a mix of noisy, uncoordinated, and pretentious, random, pop songs. The only musical part of the movie was a brief selection of songs that appeared on the Internet as late as 2002. The singer, the actor, the director, and the writer all seem to be aware of the fact that there were songs to be omitted, but they chose not to record them.    There is nothing else for the music, but everything is just a very bad joke, and it has the feeling of being too long. The movie starts out with a pretty interesting premise. A man, a man with a long, drawn-down-road life, walks into a very expensive bar to be raped, presumably because a client is there. We're told that the police are on the lookout for him, because it's such a big hit. We then see how the man's life is pretty rough, and that he's also got a problem with his girlfriend (the beautiful actress) so he spends a lot of time looking for a woman to help him. It's not even that funny. We don't even recognize that the movie is a horror-comedy - something has been done to the point of almost appearing to be a horror movie. One of the first scenes shows the scene in a nightclub, with a very heavy police presence outside, and two women in the club waiting for a man to walk through the door to meet one of the cops. They're in the dark - presumably to hide their bodies from the public, and they're apparently carrying weapons. We see the police arrive at the scene, and apparently to be there, but we don't know
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I have seen it before I am about the last time, I was expecting a big one-shot and the first five minutes would be better than the first few minutes of the movie. Alas, I don't see the slightest interest of anyone to see this movie. I did my own research on the concept and how the story is presented. That's what happened. I found the plot was very predictable and not that interesting, but the action was very dull and predictable and there were a lot of problems with the script. I can't tell how the director got a second job and why the casting wasn't better. This movie was an idea that someone at the hotel happened to want to make a movie about "The Mocking" movie and they made it a reality and it was terrible. It is a story that could never have been made. The plot is poor, the acting is weak, the editing is bad, and the characters are boring and unsympathetic. This is a movie that could be made only for a few hours and if it's a real film then that's fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed this show when it was released in 1990, but now it's awful. The dialogs are a complete failure. I am very disappointed in the fact that this show has been released. I wish I could have seen a show like that as a teenaged girl. I was a teenager and thought my mother had done me wrong.  If I could only watch this show again, I would just go to sleep. I wouldn't even have to see a movie like this again if I hadn't seen the show on the late 1980s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really was shocked at the really horrible acting of the actors. You have a lot of time to sit and watch if you want to see an acting that has nothing to go with your time. And so there is nothing to do in this film except an actor playing the part of a dumb, selfish, and self-centered, individual.   The acting was not good, the script was not, and the direction was bad. I am sad to have to listen to all those annoying dialogs.  Also, the special was a lot worse than I thought it was. This is the kind of movie that people are used to watch and like so much. It should not be made into a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is only two minutes after the first hour, it's time for a good old-fashioned horror film to finally make this terrible trash-film. It's not a good film at all... but not really terrible, just a bad old-school horror film. I'm sick from the ending. I mean the only thing that saved this movie from it was the way it is written, and I believe the writer is a good guy, but there are no redeeming qualities in this movie.  This film should not be in a high school class, it should only be in high school. This movie should be used for a high-school semester, and in a full-on-academia high-level class (school) environment... maybe they would do a better job in such a environment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie twice and it wasn't funny or funny. There are three characters in this movie. If you're interested in watching the trailer, it's not too much to say.  There are no real story and there are no characters that are funny. This movie is really dumb. It is just plain bad. I was hoping that it was a one of those "Cameratic", low budget films, and maybe I thought it was just plain, but it didn't really come of that. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I wish it could have gotten better. The best one of these movies is the one about the film of "The Great American Route". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the biggest laugh in the movie. I couldn't believe the director of this movie would make a movie about a couple that's been married for a long time and is currently in their mid-forties. There are too many twists and contradictions in this movie. The movie does have a decent plot, but I wish it could have used more surprises. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I did however recommend it to someone who just likes a good old love story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i had to watch the movie again because i thought i knew what the plot was and I had to put this review down because it didn't sit well with me. I can't believe it was only 3/4 stars. I had a chance to finish the movie but it still didn't end when i wanted to. I think the director just needed to do something else to get out of the room to have something to do. It's so boring! I think I could have made it funnier but it wasn't funny, not funny at all. I've watched this movie twice and was frustrated by the acting. I didn't understand why this had to be in such a small space and not a larger screen like the other movies i watched. There is so little room for the acting but the jokes are terrible. The only thing I got interested about was the lack of direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot line is so stupid it's hard to find out the funny parts.  After all, the hero is supposed to be a man, who doesn't necessarily know what's going on in his life, and you never find out.  Of course, the other male characters are good and they have some good dialog. They're just not used well. The plot isn't funny.   Some of the people in the film look like themselves. The director didn't care about what he was doing. It is very disappointing because of all of the good people that he has made. The only thing I found interesting was the ending.  This film does nothing to show itself or what it has to show. It's just sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone is asking why I thought it was a bad film:  I thought that the movie had a decent story. But I was unable to comprehend any of the story. I didn't even really care for this movie except to listen to the soundtrack, and the ending really took me off. I'm still trying to get it off my mind. I'd like to see something better. If you want to see more about the movie, you might have to get this movie. It was truly a pathetic piece of work, and I wish to have nothing to do with it. It doesn't take you away from your life, so I understand that. But if you have nothing else to do, the movie isn't worth a lot of money, and you won't waste your time looking at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the only movie I'd like to get. It should have been one of two. The plot is predictable but very shallow and stupid. There are no real tension or tension in the characters. The girls are supposed to be pretty sexy, but I don't think the girls are sexy at all. I also don't like how much the girls talk, because it just seems like they're all in their own little bubbles and nothing is in relation to each other. The sex scenes are boring and no real acting. The camera is bad, the soundtrack is bad and the camera is generally bad. The soundtrack is okay, but the voice actors don't act properly. The whole plot is a major disappointment.  The fact is that this movie is the worst film I've seen in a long time. I'd give it an 8 because there were only 4 stars who were good. It was really painful and disappointing.    I gave this movie a 7 because I did like it, but it could have been a 10. There is no tension in this movie. And it is obviously pointless and doesn't do anything else in the world. This movie is just another trash movie. I would have rated it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My big problem with this is this movie is simply bad. I was surprised to see it in one of the preview tapes. There was nothing to compare to the original movie. The plot was bad, and the acting was poor. The soundtrack is awful, and most of the dialog is not good. The acting is not as good as the original film and the special effects are just awful, they were better in the original than the original. The voice is too weak and the editing is awful. The movie also made a lot of stupid people and I hate people that don't like this movie.  What it is about is like watching an old porn movie. Its not like watching a bad porn movie and doing something that's interesting. Its just bad.  The best analogy to this is something from a bad 80's film where you are stuck in the middle of a movie that looks like it's not getting any real enjoyment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really awful. It was so hard to look at the film. It really reminded me of "Wooley's Revenge" which was a stupid movie. There were no scenes. The characters were stupid, and their dialogue was extremely stupid. Even though I had the DVD, I never watched it and I never saw the DVD again. The actors were also bad, but it was pretty amusing when they were playing in this film.   Some of the actors are pretty good, but the ones that seemed to be the main characters are the ones on the first 10 minutes. So we're stuck with this and there's no way out of the gate, but I can see why I would want the film to end sooner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is boring and stupid. the only good thing about it was the ending was a good one. the plot is too predictable and the whole movie could not have been filmed better. if you like this kind of movie then watch it because nothing else will ever have that same 'cloaked' look as it had. the acting was so bad the other actors were good. the soundtrack was stupid and the acting were poor. so don't waste your time watching this stupid film. it is not worth watching. don't watch it and don't give it any money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a local club with my friends and loved it. The story was so bad that I was scared and even more scared. The ending was not that interesting and did not make me laugh. The acting was awful too and the dialog was so stupid and slow. I just could not find a single funny moment except maybe one line that could have been directed. I think the director/the writer of the movie was poor and could not really care. I have heard people talk about it and complain how it is so bad. They were just complaining to me. I knew it wasn't like that but it wasn´s just like that movie when I saw it. I would never recommend this movie. I only have to recommend it to anyone who wants to see an empty movie. It really wasn't as good as a video tape because I was only in it one hour and a half and it was so terrible that I had trouble remembering what it was. I didn't like the ending and the movie really had a few funny moments. I don't recommend it but I think there is a possibility that it can make some money. It is really bad and I hope the writer can get some money so that it doesn't have any relevance anymore. I definitely did not like it and if they want to make some quick bucks they will. I hope that they can get the money and get the film released somewhere. I wish they could keep it on their shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Rapey" has gotten the worst reviews so far.  First thing I notice was the video. I had to close the movie. After that I had difficulty getting to the actual location in order to enjoy the film. I tried for days but it wasn't a good movie anyway. It's just awful. The actors don't even act or act well. The acting is bad and so bad that I can't imagine why they didn't get a decent credit for it. The story is so bad and the ending is bad.  One thing about this movie is that you can't understand what it actually says until the film ends. After it's done you'll never stop thinking about it and will never get into it. I think that was a good idea for the people who make this film. Just kidding.   But there's nothing to say that the movie itself is terrible. I'm not sure what's in it to say. The film just has a few plot twists. I can barely guess what it is and what it isn't, but at least it's OK at least. The characters aren't good. I just don't understand the story and the plot is terrible anyway. I have no idea what makes this movie so bad. I've seen several movies that are bad, but this one is so horrible I couldn't even finish watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's true! What's the point of it all, that this movie is nothing more than the first episode of a cartoon, a very sad picture, and there's a great deal of fake characters, and not even a plot! This is the worst picture ever made on earth. If you want to try out a great cartoon from Disney, look at Snowy, Goofy, or the Little Raccoon; or even the Sombody and Boober's, and the T-shirt twins. Those two movies were good in their respective areas.  The plot is so weak and flat, so bad that the animation in this movie looks more like a cartoon than anything else. That's a shame! It should be the end of the story, because it does have an ending, I don't think it will come soon. I also don't want to waste my time watching this because I like it, but I cannot even get to see it. It's sad that this film is so bad, but still I'd like to see the next movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am ashamed of the young boy that made this movie. My brother laughed and told me it was awful. I never saw this movie again, and that was a big mistake. I didn't like it anyway. I just gave my brother and mine some advice. Don't see this movie unless you want to see the worst of movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I finally saw this film, I decided I needed to write about it. I saw it after a friend showed me it and I laughed. This film wasn't funny at all. The jokes were just not funny. Some of the jokes were not funny, and I found the movie a complete waste of my time. If you like me, and like funny movies, you will find the rest of the movie on your own. I thought that I was only watching it for some of the people who watched it to have an experience. I was not going to see it again and this movie is not funny anymore. I found some of my favorite actors from the movie like Robert Smirsky and Jack Black, but the rest fell apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't see a movie like this! You can laugh at those who call themselves "Singer's Stone" or have your opinion, but this isn't funny at all. The acting is awful and the acting is terrible! It's absolutely disgusting! It is just plain awful! Don't pay attention, don't read the comments about the comments below, the movie is bad, and I'm not going to say it. The actors are good, but the movie doesn't have enough talent to make the movie any better than an anti-Christian film. They are just plain bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an outrageously contrived piece of work. The plot and the characters are so bad that they are difficult to follow and the movie's special effects are so poor they are laughable. Also the acting is terrible and the dialog is awful with even worse than a dumber movie. But all the other parts are interesting. It is interesting to note that this is the most expensive movie of the bunch of people I've seen in the past decade. I can barely recognize the movie, let alone the DVD copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was surprised to find the movie of "Ghost World" at Amazon, but I thought the reviews were quite funny.  It was the worst movie I've ever seen. The dialogue in the film was not good and the acting was pretty bad. I even got a copy of it and was dismayested because I had been expecting it to be the worst film on Amazon. This was far from the worst, but for my wife and kids (who are used to a horror movie and will definitely kill when they see it), it looked more like a horror film than most horror films. It was only a bad remake of the book that was supposed to make a horror book. I know that I'm not going to be able to rent it, but it was a pretty terrible horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked all of the songs on the album, but the rest of the music had little good songwriting and there wasn't anything of interest whatsoever. I don't believe that the music has anything interesting to say but the story of the movie wasn't very interesting and I found myself completely bored with it. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the fact that I laughed at the fact of the film. I can't believe the actor/writer was in this movie and he obviously has a very limited talent to go on and act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am shocked this movie is made this far, but I cannot say I wasn't scared by it. I've seen the same awful acting on other versions of it. In this one the acting was laughable, the editing was bad, and the direction was laughable. I think this was made by the guy who tried to make it a sequel of one of his other movies.  I'm disappointed, and disgusted. I had a very good review for a bad film:  The best thing about this movie was how hard it takes, how hard the story is, and how difficult it is to watch. The worst thing about it was the ending. It's not even a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first thought that this was a pretty low budget movie with one bad (as in the original), but as I was watching it I felt as the plot was predictable. I think it was the weakest film I have ever watched. It wasn't well written or even scripted, and the acting was so bad I found myself getting bored by it. I don't know why I thought it was a bad film in the past, but it certainly didn't help me enjoy the movie nor did it ever make me feel good. I know if you liked the original "Jolly Roger" you would be able to enjoy it, but if you want to see a version that has some funny scenes (like the scene where Mike Fleming was throwing a gun to the camera and laughing), then watch the remake.  I'm glad I saw it after its release. I didn't enjoy it that much because the movie is such a bad imitation of itself. The only good thing about the original was that it was fun to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, it had gotten lost in the way of its own comedic charm. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't want to talk about this movie. I understand it's a pretty interesting movie, but I am a movie critic, so I'm not going to talk.  In the movie the characters are all sort of dead, the people get killed, and they have all of the characters they know.  I guess there's something to be done about this, but that's a little too far.  But seriously, I really did think it was a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot goes on without the appropriate preparation and editing. The characters are not realistic at all and the direction is so bad it doesn't come close enough to make a story believable. A story is not long and one character is introduced, then another character is killed by the plot and the third character is created. What a comedy? It has the makings of some "happy ending" movies. What an insult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some good reviews on there, but I still can't see why anybody would be so upset. I don't get the point. The movie itself is pretty good. I like the songs but they were so bad. Also, the acting is terrible. I guess I've read enough to make sense. Also the movie started out OK, but then it got a little sad. I was hoping to get some enjoyment out of it, and not necessarily get the worst part of this movie. I wasn't even really bothered by the movie itself but I just wish there was more of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not sure what the reason was to see this film. I read about this film in the TV guide and thought it might be funny. I thought it was so silly I gave it two stars. The director and the actors make this movie about a camp where a girl is sexually harassed and the girls decide to put him in the prison cell. This movie is not well directed and really it is stupid. I do not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a piece of garbage. The acting and plot were good, and there were some good points. But, this movie falls foul of the fact that the show is not a historical drama. Also, the director made it clear that the story was a fantasy. This was bad because they could not follow all the historical and cultural facts. We can't afford to pay attention to such historical and linguistic details.  The only thing that really made this movie worth watching was the dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made to cater to what was happening in the times, i. Being politically incorrect, it didn't do much more than make the movies look funny. And that's not too bad. But the worst part about this film is it's just a really bad way to watch a film. It never really showed the idea or message behind the movie. That is why you could have used a lot of money on a trailer like this one.  This film was made only to get a decent paycheck. It didn't really capture the idea that movies are being made to tell a story about a political story.  The direction is terrible and the writing is pretty bad. There wasn't enough to justify a sequel. The way it was structured could have been a decent movie, but it really didn't work. I'd suggest going for a different movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this film on the first day of my child's life, and I didn't care.  I didn be able to follow it properly, because this is the kind of movie I have watched many times, and now I'm sick of it. I give this movie two stars out for being only two. I also find that the director is acting quite badly. You can't sit through a movie like this and let the film's impact on you grow.    Please watch this film, and try to figure out how it was made. Otherwise, avoid any more of the sort of movies that don't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 60 minutes of this film are a complete mess. This is an incredibly stupid film. How can anyone possibly be so ignorant? Why would anyone think that a person can make it in such a way? What were the two questions that I just read? Well, if you answered "1. 'Is there an ending?'  Then you have an answer: 'Yes, it's there.' If you answered '2. No one has been allowed to do this in my lifetime?' Then you know what I have to do. There is a guy in a black room who can do that one hellish job perfectly. That's not a real person's job, is it? It could be in a movie for an entertainment movie. I hope the director tries to salvage something of the film by trying to make it funny, but he completely doesn't understand how funny it could be. I just didn't understand it all at all.  It is very stupid and has to be remembered and laughed at for being so stupid. In the end it is really not a comedy but a horror film, and I am disappointed that it didn't have more money to make an attempt. The film should have been canceled so that I could see it again, because even the director had some talent in its own film making. I give this movie two stars because it's so bad and so stupid, but if you really want one, don't watch it. You should really not even bother if they are not funny at all, but don't listen into a movie if it's just about a horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i was wondering whether i should watch this or not, but there is so much to be scared out of this movie. I don't know how they were going with the plot. I know it has some decent animation (at least) and some really silly jokes (I know it would have some humour). But what I didn't realize was that they could be so easily mocked. I just didn't see the point of this. If you're a "comedic comedian" who does funny, you know it's gonna get very funny when it comes to its final act.  It would have been better for the other comedian/comedic directors of their movies to be in this world-view. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has little humor or charm. the girls are acting like sloven and demented with their personalities. you are reminded of the same girl as in "Beauty Behind You". the lead female star is about 30 years old and it should be known that this girl has not had any experience with younger women. she does the same thing on "Beautiful Behind You" and "Grown Up" where she's acting like a person that her husband told her to be nice and that she was being mean and nasty. i can tell she's a real person but i hope she has learned how to act like a proper person. i also hope the lead actress is not the one who's been on her career for 20 years. the only person she should try and learn from is the guy who won the lottery when he was just 30. she should learn that she can be a normal girl and do her own job.  the funny part of the movie is that the other girls are wearing their hair tight, but the other women in the cast don't get their makeup done until the movie starts. then they are thrown into the action scenes without anything to do. I have to assume that these girls are having plastic surgery done or maybe something like that is taking place in their lives and they want to become "regular" and in the real world. the women should not be able to do that. the movie could really be a movie that would make you angry or even angry for awhile and cause a lot of hate for a woman. you just watch these girls and let yourself get annoyed and get upset. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An action movie that tells a story with one plot line after another. I gave this movie two stars and a story line that was less than satisfactory. The acting was terrible, and the action scenes were nothing more than annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to see this movie for free after watching it. I paid off my credit card and bought it and gave it to my friends who loved it. When I saw the movie, I was really sad. I'm not a big film buff like many of my friends so much. I didn't even like the actors involved, and the plot is just the same as a "Watched Movie" from a kid's house. They were so stupid and boring and the female lead is so dull and unfunny. I found it funny when I saw a film after seeing it, and I hope I didn a few times and that was enough for my friends to like the movie. They should not have to care about the fact that this movie is so bad, because they're just plain awful. This was supposed to be a film to be released in December, and it isn't just a film. It is an effort to get money from a lot of people. They shouldn't be working anymore. I think this movie should have been a movie that was only made to generate money and promote a movie, not to be used for a commercial. I really hope they never worked on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I can tell, this movie is a bad remake of the same movie that I thought would have been better. And even the special effects aren't as good as the one in the original. It's not worth checking out either, but you might find it amusing to see how this one fumbled through the film's production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this film while watching it on TV in the same way as everyone else. I was extremely disinterested in the plot. My expectations were based on the material and the direction was so predictable and stupid that I was afraid to say anything about it. As an indie film director this film was laughable. The only time I found the script funny was when the girls played in the dance scene in the film.  This film is so bad, I find it hard to watch, even with the subtitles. The acting is so poor, that I am worried that they might not be able to act as well as the girls. The cinematography in the music video is awful. The music soundtrack is not that good and does not take the viewer into a fun mood. The plot was so poor I had a feeling that the writer was having difficulty writing the script and the director's directing was bad.  I could see another remake, perhaps even a better version. But this is not a good film. There is nothing in it that makes anyone feel much better. I hope that the cast will get some love to the story and the cast and the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In some of the interviews I saw, this movie was pretty good.  It's hard to say that this movie wasn't bad. It is a pretty bad sequel to the original.  The plot was horrible and the acting was bad.  I watched this film and was not thrilled with it, I just saw a few minutes of the film before the end. I really prefer what is from the original, not from this version.   I was one of the people who really liked the original version of this film. I liked the fact that it had a few funny moments, but this film did not offer any funny moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's sad to see a movie that's so boring! It's a bad effort in trying to make something interesting out of the script and poor camera work. The characters are not original nor even the cast do anything good for the acting. The movie contains too many silly jokes that made no effort to create a believable story! It would have been better if there was a plot and the film was interesting. This is not a comedy, but a piece of pure trash that was obviously not worth its life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is a really disappointing movie. The story is so poorly constructed and the actors didn't close all the dialog with the actors. It doesn't make sense at all, no acting, no plot, no character development. What was the point of this movie? It was the fact that all the people in this movie are not well known or even that much interested. It is just a film made by a bunch of guys who didn't have an idea how to make a movie that would interest the rest of the world.  I'm sorry, but I wasted my time watching this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is actually kinda funny, I give that a 10. The script is terrible, some of the jokes are funny but the acting has got a bad taste of the actor. The whole cast has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, it doesn't have any humor, or any acting. I don't even think it was made for a laugh, the script is awful and it has an awful acting part. The best part is the ending which is pretty predictable and it ends with the most awful ending I have ever seen in a film. There is so many of these types of films coming out these days that you think it might be funny or even amusing, and the funny ones are so stupid, i couldn't believe in any of them anymore, but i thought it was gonna be like this one. So if you like this film, keep looking for the stupid ending and try not to let yourself laugh. This film had more than enough blood on its feet to finish off the plot and it got a second shot when the movie ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read my books, and got excited to go to see this movie. What a disappointment! There is really nothing to enjoy, except for the first 3 or 4 minutes of the film, when the first movie was completed! I was very unhappy with it.  I really did hope there was a nice ending, but it wasn't. I was just hoping that it was all over before the end credits began, and that this movie would finally, finally, finish in a complete, satisfying way, by having all characters left alive! But there is no real ending. What could have been the end, except that the film is already over? This movie just sucked away from me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really sad. I was expecting to find a movie that actually made me laugh. This movie is the lowest of the bunch. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, I can only compare it with the worst Japanese movie ever made. I have nothing to do with this movie, the movie is not good, no funny jokes in it or no funny endings. If i had not been so angry this movie would have been hilarious. The movie is so bad that I wish the director would get in the next round before making it.  I'm just plain laughing at this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was doing my version of "The Movie: My House by George Costans," I was expecting some movie that was going to be good. This movie was nothing but a bad one.  I expected to see this movie as a "Demented". I saw the first few episodes of "House by George" and "House By George" because they both had the capability to do good things. I was surprised that they had not done well in this movie. I saw nothing but bad, and I believe that if they didn't do a good job, they won't get to the next stage.  This movie just failed miserably and I think it was made for a low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at the first few scenes of the movie. There were no realistic scenes to speak of. The movie could have been much better. There was no suspense whatsoever and it really didn't make any sense in the story line. A lot of the characters were unrealistic and did not make any interesting stories. I do not want to see this film. This is bad from the script to the director to the story and the acting to the script, but it looks a little better in the end.  I had to read the other film and find the ending. I'm not sure why this movie was made, the other one was better, but I hope the original one is still on the web. I don't like this film and I am glad it's over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be an insult to the entire genre. Some of the actors' appearances look odd. Most of the action sequences are bad, with the exception of the ones that made me smile. I don't expect any of the other actors to be good or even at all, but they don't show themselves in a good way. They don't act well, and their lines are hard to follow.  This movie is very frustrating and could never be truly enjoyed. Don't waste your time watching this bad movie unless you're going to spend all your time on it. You have to see it to believe the director's promises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand what this movie is about, because it is so stupid and it only has a vague concept. Its a comedy of sorts and not a comedy.  I feel like I just watched this film again because it was so bad. If you see it for any reason, you should not see this film. It's not funny enough and it's not good enough. It was about the funniest thing I've ever seen. I think it would be a lot less funny to watch this film if you're a movie fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is that it takes you 2 hours and 30 seconds to get to the "real" movie of The Tale of the Nome, and then the movie goes on and there's an impulsive ending, that is the film itself. So if I had to rate this movie as bad as a bad version of a bad Hollywood movie I would be rated one for the most boring Hollywood movie of the year. It is a pity, and I think the movie suffers from the fact that the film was the very worst movie in a series of all time. Also it is also quite poor in a romantic comedy genre. Also I didn't care for the end of the movie; if you liked it then I can understand why the director would be so bored. I mean, what was the idea? It was just like any other romantic movie; it was like any kind of movie a guy would go to. Even I was thinking about this movie because I loved the original movie of My Love Is True, but after reading the movie I have found out that the movie does not have any romantic elements whatsoever. And, in fact, if you've watched the movie then the end is simply too long, and there are no romantic elements and there is no romantic ending. The end is not funny, and the story is boring; it just sort of a boring story. I'd give it 1 star for a B-movie that has nothing but romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even see a single one of these movies in the theaters. This is nothing but a pathetic excuse for a movie-making enterprise that makes stupid jokes about a film that, frankly, is an insult to everyone. I don't think I could even believe it was meant to be an adult film, and certainly not a comedy, and there were no good laughs about it. The movie starts on the scene when Mr. Charles Reddington (the actor) stops off on an elevator with his chauffeur, who is on his way to the train station on his own way to New York. He drives a horse into an elevator that is in the elevator shaft, and stops in his track. After he has his driver on the floor, Mr. Reddington proceeds to the subway and runs into a car with his own chauffeurs.  It is obvious that this is a rip-off of a movie in which the original one is from the 'Dirty Dirty 'D' Dirty 2', but this film is so bad that I didn't even notice it. Even when I do that, I find it very hard to watch the film. Even after watching it, I couldn't stomach watching it.   The film has several absurdities. You might even consider it a kind of 'comparison' of 'The Jungle Fighter'. It's obvious that, while these characters are all really good, Mr.'s. (name) is no longer acting like a great actor. That's how bad the movie is!  It's also sad that, even though the movie was released before the 'Naughty', 'D-D' and 'Laughing' films, Mr's. character is still very present. Of course, I don`t mind the 'Lusty' and `Dirty' movies, but even the 'Sixty' movies seem to take on the same level. This film seems to have little interest in actually being a comedy. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It would be interesting to see what he has to do to get this movie to a 'comboo' effect.  The 'Disco and Laughs' movies are so silly that the director doesn't even care about making 'D--D' a 'laughing' film.  If you decide to rent this movie, don't even go to the video store. Then, if you rent it, don`s have to remember to remember the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of the movie, I think the actors did a decent job, but the lack of chemistry was just too bad. The ending was stupid, and the end was very disappointing.  The movie was good on a few of points, but when they said a couple of lines in this movie they were so bad, it wasn't worth a second glance.  They made it clear that the movie had no plot, no story, and no characters. The plot was very predictable and nothing could be truly understood. The characters were annoying, and their characters were extremely flat. This is a movie that made me think I was an idiot.  When I watched this movie, it was probably the worst movie I've seen so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a movie buff (or even just a really pretentious one), don't watch "The Return Of The The OLD Hollywood" because it's boring and predictable. I'd never seen this before but I read the reviews and saw what I liked about it from someone else. The acting is so awful that even if you watch it in a theater with some good acting it's hard to take it seriously. The plot was weak and I didn't understand why they decided to make it. The story was so weak that I didn"t want to go out and tell friends to see it. I think I was the only one left. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In addition to this fact, I'm also a huge fan of a bunch of good horror movies and some good ones. They all have a deep and terrible theme and they're all funny, but there is nothing funny or enjoyable whatsoever. In addition, the story is so bad that it's hard to even watch without the viewer thinking that they're being tricked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was about a really good movie in the first place. But the sequel is a huge let down. It should have been a really interesting movie, and I was looking for a great movie, but it wasn't, and it's just a waste of time. It just has too many too much pointless jokes, too much bad jokes, and the plot is not that great. If you like people to laugh, this movie is for you only.  It really is a horrible film. It's just not a good movie. I would recommend watching the first one and get the sequel in a better movie, because they are better than the original sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought this was an original story at first. I wasn't sure how I would have reacted to it, but I did. So it's obvious that it was not the best story ever told or the most realistic film. What else are you saying?  This film is really weak. A lot of people don't get it, just because they are "too naive". A lot have become "too trusting".  But as a horror writer I find it very hard to create a believable horror story that doesn't shock people. I get tired very quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this movie on the HBO network because it was a series of movies to me I found it a bit strange considering it was the first title I watched. I thought I'd be happy if I didn't have my life on the line. I really should've stopped watching it, but alas, there I was.  I think there's a lot of really bad movies out there, but I think this is one of them. The main thing about this film is that it's just a bad excuse for a movie. I can't figure out why people think this movie is funny. It's like a plot and not a movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on the DVD, and I had a headache after seeing it. I gave it 3. This movie is about the same as the first one, but it's worse. The acting is awful, and the direction is bad. I don't care for a second chance to watch this movie. It was really bad, but the DVD release is pretty good. If you are going to watch a movie with the cast you can probably guess that you are about to find a very nasty movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you were planning to have the last of the "Big Two" movies: an action movie, don't do it. This movie is boring, and extremely boring. There are two characters, a man and a woman (two women in a suit) who are on the way to some important business (this does NOT mean that these people will get rich). The plot is so bad that it is hard to follow even though it comes from the "The One Thing" show. The fact that the actors are on it with their bare hands is absolutely ridiculous.  There is so little money that this movie could conceivably have earned. It's also hard to watch (i mean it is not even as good as "Big One") which is the reason why I did not see this movie. The film has a lot of nudity and sex, and even nudity and porn at the beginning of the movie. Some people have sex in the next scene, but don't mention it in the book.   The film is only a little less than half the size of the original film. And so there's no suspense. There's also no suspense either.  But it is entertaining to say that this is the first movie I've ever seen on the book that has so much bad acting that it's even worse than "Big Three". And if you are looking for a movie that's not as good then, you might want it.  The movie could have been done by someone at a good university, and in the end it isn't that bad at all. The acting in the movie is OK, but it's not good.  It really does not belong to a movie series, nor is it a good movie. It just needs to be put away before one of the actors is bored. I don't even think this is a good film, it's just a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I can tell you is that this movie is the "crippy" film that everyone thinks is a good thing. I mean, that's the best I can say. The girls are all pretty good looking and the guys are OK, but there's not enough of a plot to justify this movie.  Also, the acting is pretty terrible, and the director is obviously a total asshole, which makes the movie pointless.  If you want to see some serious action film with some girls who actually like girls, I recommend this movie, but the fact that it's so bad does not warrant any serious consideration. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about the best bad movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but I'm so glad it wasn't made. I have to start with my life.  And for my own personal reasons, I'm hoping this movie will be the first ever movie to go off. I mean, really, we all love "Mr. Bean" but, the fact that this movie is so bad is just a little too bad. Let's be positive. This is a terrible movie. And I'm wishing it never becomes more popular. I wish it's over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie by chance, and, I was interested to know more about the movie. I watched the last two minutes of the movie, and was appalled by how awful it was. It was as though you'd just watched it, and you'd be totally confused if you were expecting a movie that was good. I mean, it's not like any of them that were in the 90's or even 90's, so what's wrong with it? Well, I've always wanted to see this movie. And it was, surprisingly, very well known. I read the comments from the Internet about it.  There are some comments that say "Haha! What a movie! No one who has seen this movie could not even have understood it." Well, the movie doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems to be about the worst of the all time, but it is actually better than the ones that have preceded it. I saw this in my home theater when I was 13. I mean, they made it for older people, which I didn't understand. Some people may have seen it from their point of view. Still, I do not like this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. It is not even a good movie to watch alone. If you want to watch it, buy it, rent it for a couple hours, and then get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie on television, I thought it was hilarious! I was wrong! I'd be surprised if you hadn't been told by the "film" producers that this film had only one or two lines. But what I didn't know was that the only one of those lines was the line, "This is my first time. I'm afraid I'm going to get into my own shoes!" So when I saw this flick, I was appalled. And I'm hoping that my fellow viewers are still able to tell me that this movie is funny when I tell them that it's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with this stupid, yet ridiculous and overblown, storyline. Once the "Molecule Trusses" were dropped, I guess the plot would have been enough for me to have figured it out - however, that would be the only way it would be possible to give me an idea. What a horrible plot! In one of the other parts I found the story was fairly interesting - the fact that he went to the mall for revenge - that I can never understand why the mall owners are so stupid. That's also been a big mistake - even though I enjoyed the movie very much, I could not stomach the story line. A lot of bad acting, bad dialog, bad lines, bad music, bad voice - I found myself crying at the end about all the bad things. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When the opening credits begins, we have the film's director, who tells us how we're going to see the film. And we see the opening title. It is not until that title is revealed that we can even begin to imagine the film - that film is not even really about us. The film's plot is pretty vague - we aren't told how much the protagonists have in common with each other. But let's get some characters. They're all fictional characters, we aren against ourselves, we hate each other, and we don't know them. We don't even know who wears their hair. The only character in the film that has the slightest resemblance to the people we see in our own lives. Of all of these people, only one can be identified in a positive way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was annoyed at how I thought this movie was about showing "kids" to be able to work on other jobs. It isn't like a comedy to be a comedy, but it is too sad to be funny. It shows that there is an obvious lack of interest in the children who are brought up in these situations and it shows that the people who think "we're all like them" are in fact making a mockery of themselves by creating such a pointless movies. I'm sure the kids who are born to the "perfect" family are happy to go to work, as such a dull and boring film would be. This film is way too weak and simply misses the point of being a movie. And by the way, the kids are all very annoying in their scenes. And I had to watch it again. I mean, "Why don't you see your friends?" was the response I had for this film. This one was bad, not even better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My poor movie. What a bad choice this one to be. A plot of a couple's vacation vacation and an unexpected discovery by a ghost. The ghost then kills the woman and gets some of the rest of the party killed along with the rest. Of course the killer is named "Dalimu". Well the movie seemed good for the kids to see. I thought the movie was a little more than an oldie. The only way it could have been better was to switch the plot. I think that this movie was not for the kid that is not a kid. I didn't like the fact that the whole movie is about a ghost that looks like it looks like a creepy house with a couple of dogs. That's just not how it plays out. I don't think they want to offend the kid out of sheer humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's an excuse for not getting an older movie. It's just like an 80's movie, with a bunch of young actors that are just getting old to this movie and they can't go anywhere in life. What they are thinking about is obviously the movie of this movie. That's all you get. A couple of good parts, but this movie really should have been made for a younger movie. Don't do this unless you want a really interesting movie and a really good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty predictable, although I expected it to have some interesting scenes. I guess the director was trying to take the film off from the time that it was being filmed, and got a lot of interesting scenes that weren't totally predictable. I had to really pay attention to the scenes. But that's not what the movie is about. The dialog was terrible and the acting was terrible. The music was also bad, and there were some songs that don't have any meaning, and I think this movie could have been better than a movie that would even have an interesting ending. The movie also made it a lot worse than a film made by a school of acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was first starting my career, my movie career was pretty short. After a few years, I decided to try something different to have some fun. I went to see some of the other movies out in the late 1990s and decided that I was going to watch all of them. I soon realized that I wasn't going to see one of the movies. This movie was terrible.  I didn't really see the point of the movie. The whole story was a total waste of time.  This movie didn't make any sense, but what about when the show first aired?  I really think it was just an effort to get you to feel good. The only thing about the movie that was truly good was that the ending actually worked. In the beginning, it made me feel guilty, and so I laughed and laughed. If you're looking for a way to feel guilty for a movie, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like a bad film, I think you have to like Michael Myers. If you think that this is the best version of an insane film in existence, then your life is over. This is a bad flick of horror film, for the only reason I'm giving it this title is because it is "the" top-five grossest slasher in history. I'm going to warn you that this bad flick is NOT a horror film. This film is, in a word, not good at all.  This is an excuse for those who have made it a very, very, terrible film, and I think the only way to truly enjoy this is to rent it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a one-star review:  The movie begins with a middle-sized woman in an apartment. It is supposed to be about a man who goes to a house with the wife and child. And then a man has a gun drawn on his chest, and the wife comes in and begins to ask him about his brother's death. And his brother dies. Then the man goes to see his father, and he has this strange conversation with the landlord and his wife. This is in a movie with no dialogue, no direction, no actors, no scenery, no even a single character. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it just sounds stupid. If you are into "The Wild Things" or "Naughty Girls" or some kind of movie that has a female actor playing a man in a sex movie, then you have to get something better.  If you want a guy who's got nothing going on with his wife, then get something that is more realistic and less stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a lot of people do think of the fact that this movie is about a family run by a guy who has a son (who is like a little teenager).  The movie starts out with the most ridiculous dialogue. He uses a gun, which looks like something to a guy like a kid. The dialogs are not very interesting, the direction is bad, and the storyline is really not all that interesting. But, to be fair, it is probably a funny movie because it is about families in general, but that has got the same kind of comedic element.  My thoughts on the whole movie is that it is just another way to give a family of bums the idea of getting married. I don't think anyone has a big problem with the fact of this movie, but I do think that some people might get more enjoyment from watching it.  But in addition to the fact it is a dumb way to glorify a family that doesn't really have the capability for making love, it also doesn't have the ability to deliver a good ending. That's a little harsh, but what was I thinking? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to find out of it because of the wonderful "Million Dollar Dog" in the first review. I was expecting to find something that was truly funny and didn't see it. I got it. But I can't be sad about it anymore. This movie is not funny. It's not funny, it's not even funny. I'm sure there's only one good part in the movie, the only people involved with this movie are those who want it to be funny. A few people at the party and one person at the hotel are so annoying they don't even have to even go out to the casino to see the movie. I've seen a few of these parties before, but never had an idea they were acting for entertainment. You won't be surprised if you find out that the party is about two guys trying to find a prostitute. But it was never like that, even though I think the party was full of people who were good people, especially after this movie ended they seemed to have more money than a regular casino. If they were good and could hide it with a couple of good things and good jokes, they'd have a "funny movie". If they didn't laugh and make funny jokes when they won't win or are on a team, they wouldn't even get any money. A couple of the people in the party are good people (I'm not talking about the "the good" people), but these guys are acting in their jobs and acting like they're really good people. If you enjoy a movie like this, a movie called "the Million Dollar Dog", then you're going to get bored. It would be a bad if they were laughing about a funny movie and weren't serious about making it funny. If there's a good movie then you have to be bored, because it's really, really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's alright to be angry over a bad film: this is only the third bad movie I've found. But this is also one of the worst I've ever found (if there was one good one...). And the acting... oh my god. The acting was so bad I wanted to cry, even more so I wanted this movie to be bad. And what does this mean? This is only a movie about a guy, who is a racist. It's about a kid. That's what it is.   But it is still pretty entertaining and I wouldn't have been disappointed. However, I'm not sure why this film was so lousy. A couple of reviewers have said the movie was a "classic" of the genre. But that isn't my opinion; the movie is about a "funny" movie: it's a comedy about a racist guy, that is just for the laughs. If it doesn't make you laugh, it's not a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have ever seen this movie, or seen the video, please do not buy it, and I wish you hadn't seen it. The film was poorly designed and had a few good jokes but the whole film felt incredibly corny and utterly uninteresting. I didn't care for this flick because it wasn't very funny but it didn't really help that there was not much going on. I would have liked it to have a little more humour to this film and something less cheesy and over-the-top.  I also find it difficult to watch and judge this movie without having played it. If you are an avid anime-fan or any fan of the animated series, then, go watch it, but don't watch it for a laugh. It wasn't all that funny and it didn not really have a lot of good jokes. What I'd recommend, however, is a quick glance at the movie and say "what the hell was that?" instead of thinking about the movie itself. I have never found a good movie about an anime series, even if I've seen it in the live-and-play stage. If something is supposed to be a very funny movie, then maybe that's part of its appeal but it isn't exactly funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is absolutely no excuse for this awful film to be given the title "The Devil's Out of Sin" (which is a fairly accurate title). Not a movie to be taken seriously, or even to be shown on cable or video, but the title alone justifies the movie. There is a clear attempt to glorify the movie's "spark" or "mysteriality". It's just a "big, dumb, mean, mean movie about an old man, a big, fat, mean dog, a stupid old man...the movie is just OK, and nothing more. This movie has nothing to do with the Bible, or with the occult, or any of the "darker" or more occultist movies. As I said, this is NOT a good movie. It's not about the occult; it's just about old man having sex with an old woman. It doesn't even represent a "horror movie", and it has no plot. It is simply a "show" of a sad old man in a sad, old way, with a crappy movie director, and no plot to speak of. The only thing that makes it special is a man who has an ex-girlfriend who has not been able to commit a sexual act with a guy who had "made" him come into his bedroom (because he was naked). A horrible movie. If you have an eye, you might be interested in the "Drama" but it does not reflect any good movie material. If anyone wants to have a great movie, please let it make up for the lack of interest. This is NOT about a movie, but about a sad man having an ex girlfriend who can't get past his past troubles with the poor, sad guy. He has a really big, dumb old dog that he sleeps with every day, and he cannot even get his girlfriend to agree to being able to use his body for sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an extremely bad film, and I don't think this would be a bad film. For example, the whole plot is pretty shallow, and there are some scenes that could be funny, but they aren't funny, the cinematography isn't good, and the acting is bad. However, I think the script is pretty good. I think it needs to be rated 1, or even 2, for the very bad movies out there that aren't rated 4.  There is no way to make this movie a funny movie. If you want to see a movie that's funny, watch Pulmin' Tale, or Ghost Song, or a comedy, then go and see Pulmin', or Ghost song, or see this one.   Don't get this movie. It's full of so much wrong stuff. It is just like the people who make movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have anything against someone who thinks "I must have an answer to the answer this movie.  If you have seen this movie, you will never be able to understand anything. It is not funny! It is just pathetic! It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. If you watch this movie and try to understand something, then you'll feel like a monster who does not give a damn about your life, even if it's something that you really want.  So I'm glad I can watch it again, but I don´s wish I could escape. It's not just about the characters, but about the whole movie. I donʅt think there's anything to say, that's the bottom line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can count this as one of the least good horror movies ever made. As a result of it, this movie is ranked so low that it can hardly be counted. And, that's the same for the TV show, which is ranked at the same spot. It's absolutely pathetic and, on the face of it -- a bad film -- to be sure it has nothing to offer. There are worse, in a way, than a movie: a horror movie that has nothing and not to leave anything to the viewer to decide. That's what it does for most horror films, and what it's not for a movie made at the end of the day, a thriller that has a lot to offer, if you want to enjoy something that's not just a long slow bore. A horror is meant to be scary, if only a lot, but that's more like a low-grade horror movie. I don't know if this is actually a horror film, or if it was made in a school of fire. If it is, I hope the person who made it would get fired. This is absolutely disgusting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie comes out, there is no surprise for how bad it is. The characters are weak, the dialog is awful, the camera is bad, the plot is boring, and the camera work is terrible.  I really had to put in my hard hat for a third of this movie.  The actors, for the most part of the time, look pathetic and weak. I think that the writer has been completely blinded to what is supposed to be a successful movie. I don't expect to be able to say that this movie is good, but the camera was bad and bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie in the video store and it was probably the only film I saw. The acting was bad. The camera was bad, the acting was worst. The voice work and acting was laughable and the story was just so, so poor.  If you watch this movie and it's your first time watching an otherwise well written script, don't buy it. Avoid it if you're serious about trying to find the best movies possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film I was ever attracted to was one I found in the box at my school.  This film was very slow and predictable, not very creative and not very funny. This film failed because the director didn't give the actors enough time to develop their characters and get the best script. The two actors, in case of Elizabeth McConvey and Adam Baker, were supposed to be interesting and fun; they were neither. They were simply annoying.  When the sequel came out, I was confused and upset to say, "yes, but there are two other actors involved in this film.  If you are looking for a film that has some fun, don't waste your time and watch this film unless you really like it.  It could not only be a terrible film, but it is also a pretty dumb joke that could come out of a bad film. There are few things in this movie that could be funny, but a film with some good jokes could easily have used them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a classic disaster piece. I don't even remember the time it was. I'm not sure what the plot was, but I can imagine the main idea. A family of a husband and wife are battling with the neighbors. When one neighbor threatens them, the husband is threatened. The wife is threatened by the same neighbor. After a couple of years of marriage, it becomes clear that husband and girlfriend are unable to cope. The husband, desperate for revenge, threatens the wife by using a wooden box as a weapon. The box fails to catch him and kills her. A couple of days later, the neighbors break up the husband and his wife's child. A woman named Lola tells the husband that she won't stand in his way. Her husband goes back to a nearby club where he meets with the women from the movie.  I cannot even think about the final episode, and it ended up being the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. It is absolutely awful. I've seen the original "Twin" and I couldn't even begin to like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst things I've seen from my life. Its story is terrible and the whole movie is so bad that it could only be made to be a good movie.  I was looking for some good movie to watch, and this one wasn't one of them. This movie contains some of the greatest acting in the world. Unfortunately this movie is not only the worst movie but also the worst acting I have ever seen, even with the acting.  Also, I've not heard this person before. The guy was one of my students who worked at the movie school and he said he got this movie because he thought it was an interesting movie and didn't want to miss out on it.  Other than his comment, I thought this movie was a bad piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard of this movie before, and I'm disappointed in it. There's no story, no plot, no action, no special effects, it just repeats the same boring story, with no suspense, suspense, no real plot. Just what's there to get out of this film? The idea of this is so preposterous that I'd even laugh at it. I don't even think that anyone could be able to have any respect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've seen in almost every single year since I saw it. I cannot believe that this is the first movie in a long time.  It is the least interesting movie I have ever seen. I feel like it was made as a low-budget film to get a lot of money and to make it look fun, it was just awful. There is no suspense, no story, no action, no plot, and no way to get the real story out. I find it much, much worse than the "Buffy" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never seen this before but the only review I found before I got it on. Its not a bad remake but there are a few inconsistencies, a lack of good acting and the only good thing I can see in it is the ending. A bit of good though is the acting (though the acting in this film is not funny). I've always read a lot of crap and I find it amusing that one movie I saw, which was "Cannon's Perish", is so bad that the reviews on this site often refer to it as a comedy. I think the same thing about it when someone is writing about it and I'm not laughing at the way the person says it.  The only good part of it is that it really works for a cheap movie - a piece of trash. But that's not too good for a movie, and it's not the best thing there is.  It doesn't take on the same meaning as the original and you can't blame the people who made it. It just makes you want to skip the movie and not bother watching it. This is just an idea that someone has just put their minds down on a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just bad, and I don't think there are many other good things about it. It's a little disappointing for a movie to be so bad. It has some of the best acting in the world, but it has so many horrible lines, I couldn't believe it would have been possible. And it has some unbelievable special effects. The whole movie could have been better. It just sucks to be the first time a movie made with special effects is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very upset to learn that this film was one of the best Hollywood films at the time. Of all the Hollywood films that were rated higher than this one, this was the worst one. It was only one of three or four. The other two had much more punch to it.   The actors were terrible. It made me sick. I laughed for a lot of the dialogue and none of the actors were well acted.  The movie doesn't have a story - it is one of these movies made so that it is simply a bunch of actors getting shoved around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to laugh. It was so bad. A bad movie is the only good thing about this crappy film. Its a shame that it didn't get the second.  Its just about as bad as the first one. This film has nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst ever. The only time you'll need to watch this movie is when you have to pay for it. If you don't, you'll never like this movie. It's not good enough to warrant watching, and it doesn't even really make much money, since you're not supposed to care about your wallet, but it's not as interesting. In short, the acting is bad. The plot is bad, and the acting looks bad, but you don to see the film anyway.  The ending is pretty dull and pointless, and even worse off than the beginning. When you finish watching it, you should probably never even realize what happened. It could make you a bit more depressed.  If you find yourself watching this movie, try to get the movie alone, and don't waste money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot believe they have so many reviews about this movie. I think it has got to be the most bad piece of crap that has been made since 1970. If you don't have any idea what it is about, you should read my review. It is about two things that are bad. First, it has the same name (Beverley) in the first 10 years, and then again in the second 10 years. This name should not be used on a TV show anymore. But they have used it anyway. If that's not enough, what about the name of the movie? I mean if you want to be offended, just watch this movie in the film school video store, or a movie house.  Second, you don´t need to hear the story to understand it. If people like this movie, they should just spend the time going through the movie and watch the show again, which would be better for them than watching the show with the kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting seems OK, if that's a good movie, then, I guess not. Some of the action is interesting, and I would have liked to see more action from some of the characters, but most of the "acts" are boring and just don't make much sense. The story is pretty simplistic, and there is an over-abridged and absurd storyline that keeps me watching the movie for no reason.  Also, a really stupid actor named Riddick and I really don't like him. If you have nothing else, watch it for one night and you'll probably find some laughs.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows the story of "Shrimp" who is sent out to a desert island to find a treasure, but unfortunately ends up getting killed in a sandpit, so he has to fly back to the surface to find another treasure which he is told he'll find the day before he's due.  This is the second or third film of the series so no one's expecting that they will go well. It's been seven years since they've started producing films since the previous series was on, and now they're having trouble getting into the studio to make another one.  It's a shame about the quality of these films they're made because I have seen the "Shrimps" series at home. As a result of their low budget they made a lot of films that were good. And this series fails to deliver a good sequel to the series.  They can't blame it on the people who made the original series because they're still making movies with better equipment and have plenty of money to throw at the screen. I really hope that they'll get a decent treatment at the box offices, because I was hoping they'd come out with a decent sequel to a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to see this film while in Japan on holiday in Japan, and I was very disappointed by it. I'm a huge movie fan, but this film really sucked me out. I had about 10 or 15 hours into it, and the movie ended up missing most of my brain, I didn't know how to spell the next few lines, and some of the dialog wasn't even in English! I really didn't like the characters, I just thought that the director did a really bad job. I know why some people say it was okay to see these "adult" films, but just don't want to watch them! The movies just don´t have a sense, and they´re stupidly boring to see! They could have done a better job than making stupid movies like "Bitter" where everyone is naked, but instead of doing something that is totally absurd, they made "Bitty". It isn´t even funny, and it seems like they´d like to keep making it!  The only thing about this film that could be explained is that it's about a "freak-in-jail" movie made by a bunch of "jurges" in a film studio. Why was it made? I have never been interested in movies like this, they just aren't good! And it doesn´t feel like any "adult", "Gravelling" films! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible, if you liked a horror-filled, blood-and-skewl-filled thriller, then this movie is to be taken seriously. But for me, this movie was just the first movie I had ever seen and I was extremely bored with it.  I can understand why people don't like horror movies like this. However, if that's not what you want, then you might enjoy it. You should avoid these kinds of movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    How does this sequel happen? This sequel fails in every respect. In my opinion it is the worst film I have ever seen. The movie is so bad I cannot even call it "good". I really think this sequel would be considered bad if the same actors and the people who made the original trilogy is involved. This is not a good movie, and I would not even consider for a decent tribute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is actually quite good, but there's not even any music to get into a groove. There's a whole lot of bad songs, and I'd probably like to see a movie that was actually a musical accompaniment to some sort of art. I'd like to try something that would just take it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really bad. Its boring, and the acting is very bad. The main reason I have seen this movie is because I thought the film is good, but this is the worst film I have ever seen.  This is what you get when you look for a movie that is supposed to be interesting but never is. It is an odd mix of old movies that don't really gel with the modern genre, and a bunch of amateur acting. That, plus it takes advantage of the really good actor (Gadrian-Hernandez) and a couple of really bad ones (Gaddin and Tango-Tango) as well as an overrated supporting cast (Dasherede). I think this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I'm not sure how I'll ever get to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure if there is anything funny to speak about this movie: its funny to say that some people are still expecting to be entertained by the very low budget. And I can say with confidence that the actors and the direction are good enough to get some laughs out of this movie. But the overall effect is quite unfunny. I think that the director/producer of this film should be ashamed and embarrassed to see himself.  It's just one of many examples of the Hollywood industry's obsession for making movies, and they do it very seriously. They want to go in to this. It has nothing going for them. No funny in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is not a serious satire about how stupid it is, maybe this is better than the rest of the films made before it. The main thing about this movie was it being predictable and boring, and the fact that the majority of it wasn't funny. The humor really lies in the fact the story is about how some people just think they have no idea what it is.   There are no real scenes, except the one in the bathroom during a scene (when the other guy asks how he could do it.  It is obvious to me that you don't get to see a whole scene, and it also is unnecessary.  The fact is that it's just about as boring as the rest and there are just a lot of unnecessary characters. I do not know why this is an even worse film than the other ones but I cannot find out. There's no way the makers of this one wanted to get this off. It might just be a remake of the first one, so just a quick review about the other one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The video and music seems to have been drawn from some old Italian films. There is a distinct lack of real music in this little video, although some of the voice-overs are entertaining to listen to. (There is an image of the same character, on a beach, with a bunch of dead, lying around.  The movie starts off very badly - some of its lines and some of them are very silly, such as the one where the characters get into a car with three young men, to have a car ride, and then have to stop and have sex with them.  What a pity.  Some of the old Italian movies also featured a similar plot, but this movie lacks that plot too.  Also the music in the video is pretty awful. There are several bad actors and there are some pretty good ones, like Michael Sibgard and the man who made this movie, James Stewart. But you should probably avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had a funny script at the beginning, but I'm guessing there's a lot of material that it hasn't used.  There is so many little things that the characters get through this quickly, that there is no room to build, and the movie is so bad that it's just so silly. I'm not sure whether the acting is good or the acting bad, or if the acting was good or bad, but it's certainly a bad film to watch.  I can't imagine what it could have been like to live in the 1950's and have the same sort of attitude. I can honestly say I was surprised that the film didn't get to go through the end of filming. It was interesting to see an actor that could act, but did I really think there was a reason why it wasn't given any credit for its acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely disappointing as a romantic comedy. This movie just seemed like something a little too ridiculous. The ending leaves you feeling cheated. But it was nice to watch.  Overall, it was just the sort of 'funny comedy' you want, but in a fantasy world, you don't get the satisfaction. The end is about too heavy, and even in the ending, I thought the ending was a little disappointing, considering the ending.  I wasn't able to go and stay in a movie, but if you want to watch this movie, I suggest you do not waste time watching it. I would never recommend it for your friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Big Fish" (also known as "Biggly") is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would never recommend to see this movie. It is really bad and the director is probably a psychopath.   So the plot is simply one part of a stupid plot that's about nothing and another part is just stupid. I also think the cinematography in the film is bad, and the acting is bad. It would be a good movie if the acting was funny and the writing was good. But in this, it just sucks.  I don't like this movie, even though I liked the two other "Bigs" films. I really think if you like a "Bigh" movie, a good one with a lot of laughs, a nice plot, and a good ending, you'll love this movie because there is nothing else. And don't bother about this movie if it's for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have been reading for years now how bad a film was. it is true that it was not so bad it was only a small portion of the movie and it looked good and it was a disappointment. I wish for more from the movie. i am going to watch it and write a negative critique about it as a person that was reading the book and thought it sucked. the main characters were not portrayed well and i don't understand why this is the same thing as an book about ghost stories. the book contains some plot, it has some dialog, it does not have the ability to create a great story about the book. i don not understand what this was supposed to be about. if you want a good story then you will read the book, but this is an awful book. the only good thing is it was one movie about a ghost's ghost and the story and plot. i want a horror movie and one person to make a good movie about it. i wish to see a movie that actually does something good. this is just awful, horrible. i recommend not to see this movie and definitely don't want to rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to learn that this movie had such a bad reputation. I thought the director would have a great career, and I was thrilled to see that it was a very small film! I mean, I have seen plenty of mediocre, but not great films. There is no direction or direction to any of the movie. There are some cute clips and moments, but it's just so bad it's hard to watch. It's just not good. It is just so silly that I was shocked to see such a crappy film. The reason I laughed when I came out of the theater. The actor, the director and the cinematuses didn't care for any of these actors. I think the director, the cinemastes, and the director have to understand the differences between a good movie and a bad one. If you don't get frustrated, then you may be a total idiot. I know you hate them when you first saw them because you thought they were cool. The film is just an insult to the human brain and you will never enjoy them anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the late great Jack Ryan movies of the '70's. That was an epic sci-fi action film that never existed in the modern world. But in '80's it was pretty plain and dull.  In '85 Jack Ryan appeared in a number of films. But this movie was a complete disappointment.  The plot is not good and the actors are not good. But don't waste your time watching this movie.  But, then I heard about this in a radio station about the first year of my summer vacation.  What did they think? That this was a comedy?  The ending had me thinking about how much money people could get for the fake movie it was playing. How many people have to kill each other?  It was so hard to believe.  I knew it was an awful movie because I read this when I was about to go to this one in Vegas and it didn't seem like a funny movie. It was too short and not even a comedy. But after all, I cannot say the acting is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts to get dull almost right up until the beginning of the last film.  It's a horror-comedy in the truest sense but with a lot of silly gimmicks thrown in. They seem to make you sick and the story is poor and the acting is bad.  The only thing that can redeem this movie is the plot. The story is about a group of people who get into a zombie cult, and when they go to the town to see a cult leader to "open up a movie" for an audience, they get killed, and the movie ends up a bunch of headless apes.  There's no funny dialog, no funny lines, no decent fight scenes, and no good action scenes. You're just bored for the most part.   Overall, the movie is an absolute waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although, if you can be lucky in reading this review, there will be one happy surprise. This movie is badly scripted, very poor acting, and surprisingly, this movie fails to take in its audience. You might be shocked if you were expecting a full on-screen comedy.  I won't be laughing with any character actors, or even with the film itself, but watching it makes you feel like a loser. I just wish that this movie was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a disaster in the way it has been. I was expecting something good, even some of the special effects. It is so lacking in detail and is so confusing. The acting is terrible, the cinematography is pathetic and the plot is terrible. The main character is the only person I can find. But he is dead so his body isn't there. He has no feelings for anybody. He is really nothing. I feel sorry for him. It's a really poor film, and I want my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of problems with this movie. The first problem is that the people are shown as evil monsters. That would explain the main problem. The second problem is the lack of tension.  This movie is boring to watch, not suspenseful and most of all, there are no suspense.   If you want to see a horror movie, watch one that has some plot and no suspense!  The first part is the introduction of a boy who has problems with the bullies who were his friends.  The second part is about the main bad guy who steals the book containing a treasure that he owns. It's like a roller coaster.  Then there is the scene with the teacher (I'm a kid, so my opinions here are not that big.  There's also the main point, which I'm a little ashamed to admit, where a guy goes into his school to find the treasure and then tries to go on the roller coaster to get the treasure again. That was bad. The story and the plot are totally flat and the ending is just the least suspenseous.  I can't recommend this bad movie anymore. The only one I could recommend is for horror fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about three days of hell for all of the people who have seen it. The whole story is about the old lady (Jane) who gives birth to her daughter (Laura) and the child with a dead body (Rebecca) as part of her husband's funeral rites.  I found the story extremely confusing. The film is about a black widow who is killed by her husband and then she sets out to kill the old guy. The plot is about her daughter, Laura. But the director is making us watch the old man to die and then he gets the baby girl to go back in the coffin and starts to kill his daughter. He does it again and then is dead himself. I had never seen a movie so badly done. Even worse than my high-school film 'Little Miss Sunshine'.  I would have to buy this movie to my friends and they wouldn't even like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning of this movie, the actors seemed to be getting some good things done. You get to know what each of them have in their life and I guess that their life is very predictable. But now after the start, when the characters are trying to get out of their relationships that have lasted for so long, you start to realize that none of them really get anything done. This movie, unfortunately, is just another wasted of time.  I really thought this movie was really bad at first, considering it is only 2 hours of time from the film's origin and even at that point I thought the film had a decent plot. But when the film comes to its final stop it really seems very slow. The acting is pretty bad and some of the characters in the movie are really awful, but i'm sure that's the main point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the impression that this was an intentionally pretentious film.  So many times, and so many stupid stunts, I just couldn't believe that I would ever get to see this, the first movie I was ever seen. After my initial viewing of this movie, I was wondering, "Why is it this way?". I couldn't answer my question, and I proceeded to watch it again. My first thought was that it was the film's director's fault. But later I realized that it wasn't that the film was intentionally pretendous, but simply a bad attempt at a parody. I guess the director just couldn`t get this movie off, and this movie would be a major blow to the viewer. If you have any interest in a parody, but don't have patience for a "funny" comedy, you will have to watch this again, because I think it's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just so bad that it's only funny. And I feel like I need to take it somewhere. If the movie is any good, it'd probably be a funny show. There were a few funny moments (that's not the case here.) The main theme of this movie was 'what can you do with a movie that includes a guy who has an IQ of 10 (which is a low-life). The ending isn't good. This movie would be a hit for the money.  I'll admit that this movie could be funny. But it wasn't funny. Not because they didn't try, but because they were trying to keep the score a low, because this movie is so bad it actually makes you sick. I can't recommend this movie. It was just an embarrassment. I had to get a lot of money to see it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor remake of "The Little Blue Room" should probably never have been made. But, it has done fine. And that's not too bad. But there's something terribly disturbing about it. I can't even watch this film when I'm feeling good. A very bad remake of a very bad film: that's how I saw the first one. I am still a huge fan of the original one, but after seeing this remake, I didn't find much fun. The dialog is extremely bad and there is absolutely no comedy or light comedy. The only two funny scenes are when "Fahrenheit" (a TV series) is in the movie. And there's a few amusing scenes with a couple of "wacky" characters (a small dog and a small fish). However, I still enjoyed this movie because the jokes were interesting. But after seeing the remake, it looks like an action film with a bad ending.  It's not just a bad remake. It's much worse. But don't waste your time. Stick to the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably my worst horror flick of the decade, although I have read all the reviews.  I can't say what the film was about.  There were only three or four things at the time I was watching it. I've read the reviews on my blog that mention the following problems: (1) the plot line was not the original story; 2) the soundtrack sounded not even close to the original sound; and 3) the acting.  If you decide to rent this movie for a low budget, don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is simply bad - a mix of two major themes - sex, revenge, and revenge - that's what it is all about. The characters were never given a chance to flesh out characters.  There were some interesting characters - one is that there's been some very odd and unrealistic scenes.   Other than the main actors, there was a lot of bad acting. The lead actor was a very predictable, unsympathetic character who just seemed to be there. And the lead actor wasn't given a decent role in the film.  What was a good movie: a romantic, emotional movie that wasn't a film, that was just an interesting look at a sad, sad movie - which is why it failed to catch on at all.  The film had a lot to show off - there were a lot, and didn't do anything to make the movie a good film. The ending leaves you wishing for a sequel, and it's only in the middle of the film that the movie starts to get its worth.  This movie really doesn't qualify as a film - a lot is left out in the story, which is completely pointless. It's an average film, with no plot, no ending, and no ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen "Powersume" a few years ago, and that film has been just as bad as its sequel. The story is not a good one, and the characters are too wooden. The acting is terrible. There are also a lot of odd scenes that are hard to understand. The film is about a teenager who is trying to get his life back, so he tries to make a life on the road as a taxi driver. But then he has a bizarre accident. He hits a stop sign, and his friend, Ray, is in the taxi. So, the young guy is forced to spend some time on the street, but his friend refuses to let him off and he has to pay for a few nights, so it's a good idea to try. When he starts his job, it turns into a very stupid comedy that has no real ending. It's very hard to follow this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was extremely disappointing. It's about time that I was able to sit down and watch it, which I did, and it was about time for me to sit through one of the movies. But there's still an interesting little story behind it. The fact that we know the "director" of this film is a relative of my (a former wife's friend, who was very good, like my daughter). So, if I could go and watch the other, "Lil'Muse" documentary, I'd probably be less likely to think about that.  There was absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film that made it worthwhile. It wasn't even funny. There was nothing funny to the movie. The plot, the acting, and the editing were terrible, and this movie wasn't very interesting. The acting in it was very bad, and even though they didn't make the jokes funny enough, I couldn't find the acting to the characters and vice versa. The ending is so bad that it should never have been shown on cable TV. I wish I could see this film again, even if it was cheaper to make. I would definitely recommend another of its peers, the "Menge" documentary. It would be good if it could have filmed a decent version of "NUTRISI". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film with friends on Wednesday morning, and just as I was starting to watch it, I had difficulty falling asleep from it. It was the movie that had so much charm and appeal that it should be on television. However, after seeing it again yesterday, it's no longer funny at all. As far as I can tell, the story is pretty pathetic. Even the end credits had nothing to do with the film itself. The acting is bad, too much stalling. The story and dialog is not much of interest. There are so many holes in the story that it's hard to follow even the basic dialog and there are so few things happening in the film that it simply can't make up for its many shortfalls. There were many times in the movie when it seemed like it didn't matter that the film had some good parts, and some bad ones did.  It's not worth watching on its own, but I do hope that the next one is at least better than the awful original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I can relate the story of the film a bit better. It seems like there is a conflict in the main character. The movie seems to be a mixture of other genres and films, like horror, horror-comedy, horror comedy and horror-action movies. It also is also extremely long and contains the same plot that would be expected to be in a horror film. The story seems to start up as something like a horror-movie but quickly goes downhill into horror-comed movies. When the film has the first movie finish, it turns into a horror horror movie with just the old horror-spoof-me and horror films, and this all happens in a rather slow way. The plot seems to go somewhere else. I think it was made before the first book was released and the film was only created for the movie to be considered a horror movie. As I say, the film had some interesting characters, but the characters in the movie are so stupid that they seem as if they are trying to make a horror genre out of a horror thriller. I feel like that was done for an idea. It was really a horror parody. The end of the movie is about a little kid who is an expert in science. He has some sort of "magical power", but he is also a bit hard to kill and he has some good magic abilities. I just couldn't see him in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an avid movie fan, I would like to comment on the bad taste of this one.  It's a huge disappointment. The plot was OK, but it wasn't interesting, and the actors weren't good. The story is pretty weak. I really enjoy the musical numbers, but the musical score doesn't work. I don't think that it was the best movie ever made. I do wish the writer of this movie a good day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so bad that I can't believe it exists...I mean the plot is bad and the acting is bad. This is the saddest movie I have ever seen, since I had one of the best acting in my life. What was about to begin my movie, was that the characters are all stupid and the plot was stupid and I was in my first movie too! I don't understand it now, but I would definitely say "Acea!" A few words to describe this movie are useless, since these characters are stupid, and the people that are in these characters. But the acting and the dialogue are good and the cinematography is bad...  I recommend getting out your 10 dollar movie card and watch this movie again. It was bad, and I wish you all bad actors that were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the picture from the bad movie and started to watch it. So I knew the plot. I thought it was way below the most ridiculous and pretentious movie imaginable. I knew it would not make it out of any other movie. I did not care for anything else. If you want to see a sequel that is not an insult to your intelligence or your intellect, you will see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is so bad, so bad I can't even begin to comment on it, but I have come to the conclusion that it must be a terrible movie! The cinematography is not up to the mark, the acting is awful, the story has nothing to do with the story of the film, and the dialog is awful. There were only one or two scenes that had a decent ending and the rest of the movie just dropped the plot. But hey, that is not a bad thing in my opinion, if it was made for a children's movie it would be fine. But for the fact that it is made for children, this movie has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It must be like the other movies made by Disney, but not in Disney's category. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen. I would not waste any space explaining why this was the worse movie. In the past few weeks I've watched this film repeatedly as I've remembered my initial thoughts. I've never seen it again and I don't plan on seeing it again. It starts with an attempt to get an idea in me. This movie is about the worst film I've ever had. The story is so bad and it does not even follow the plot. This is not a comedy. It is about a lot of really bad jokes, horrible stories, and terrible actors. It also starts off with an extremely bad ending. That's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the concept, but unfortunately the story was so bad, I only could get through half of it. The reason I gave it a 7 out of 10 is that if you watch it, it should have a decent ending, with some good scenes. The problem is that it doesn't really matter, since it plays out like an ordinary soap opera type drama about the love life of a poor guy.   The fact that this movie plays out so badly is obvious. The story was about an actor (I'm a guy, and it sounds like he was really nice, but he wasn't the star of the movie - I think the person on his right hand is. It sounds like his mother's, or the other lady on his left hand. The person on the other side was a complete idiot, not a bad actor, but I think he had a better idea.  That being said, this film really wasn't worth watching, and I'd avoid it if you really wanted to get into a good soap opera on the channel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film since it first came out, and it didn't go anywhere close to the original. There are a few scenes that were interesting, and a few bits of good character development. I think it was made worse than "Gunga" by this film. While the story of this film is a fairly interesting story, the plot leaves much to be unseen. I can imagine it being a fairly good movie if you could hold off looking at the plot, and didn't have to have a clue what the movie really was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a bunch of men who's been caught up by an odd man who goes around in a giant shadow to help them find a lost child. And then he has a new partner in an effort to win his partners back. As the plot continues, the other women have the same thing going for them in their relationships. And the women end up having the same thoughts and feelings.  I don't like this movie because it fails to take the original premise of "Boys vs Boys" to its own, and the fact that there's nothing to do with this story doesn't make it any better or more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do not believe that they are going to try to "fix" this project. There is too many scenes that are not "true to the true" to the characters that are in the film. The most egregious example is the scene in the beginning that takes place outside the main story of the movie (I think the whole point is that the story is not important enough to have been "told" by the characters and we can just assume the characters had a clue about what the story was supposed to be. The other example is a scene that takes up no real story about the film, the characters are all in their own minds, and so forth. I'm sorry for all those who don't like the film that comes out on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many parts of the story that just don't add up. It is an ordinary "wannish" romance-compsie that is utterly lacking in romance, action and emotion. I think the director was either embarrassed or unwilling to tackle the drama and take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no better words than a series of self-parodies that don't quite fit together. In some ways this is just the beginning of the movie, with the characterizations being directed by one of the very poor actors (not a bad one, but I don't remember them anyway). This movie really is an example of poor acting that can only make a good movie: the story is about a couple's son who is unhappy about their daughter (they are married in a sad and troubled way and don't think anything about the kids) and then the husband goes on vacation with some friends who are all unhappy about the fact that their daughter has no money and no job. The director tries to shoehorn him into some kind of drama, but this really doesn't work. The acting really doesn´t make sense, the dialog is bad, the character's acting is bad. All in all this, it just looks as if there is some kind a moral message about the family being unhappy and losing everything else. It isn't even possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I think it is one of the worst movies I have seen in years, so I watched it for one reason. I was curious to see why the cast of a bunch of guys who all knew how to act, but they couldn't act to get into this movie in real life (which I think is a great mistake), and it had that strange vibe that you knew it wasn't a straight-up story, but it made me want to tear up and laugh for the sheer absurdity. A few things were good, including some interesting dialogue; I really liked the chemistry between the cast; the acting was bad. But what was wrong with it? I would have been disappointed if it was even half the same as "A Man Called Crazy", and that it was a comedy. In this case, I don't think it was meant to be comedy, but a really lame, stupid, and stupid movie that shows a guy who just doesn't get it about how to behave.   This movie could have been made by a guy like me, or just made by some goofy movie director who had an idea about making a comedy or something less serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I get older, and I see more of these fandings. This movie is also a disappointment to my younger brother and he wanted to go for it for a while. I thought it was interesting though, because I can relate to the same person. It was hard to watch, I wasn't really able to tell what it was going to be about. It didn't come across like it could be. It wasn't even funny. I've seen a lot of movies, and nothing has made me laugh. This one isn't funny at all. If you want to see a rip of a movie, watch it if you are trying to learn how to think about the world. This is an example of a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a fan of the late 90's (not counting me) movies like "Candy" and "Raging Mom" and others, then you might be expecting some decent stuff. I did. But if you're a "Dirty Dog" kind of person, that's a whole different kind of movie. You are not supposed to like Dirty Dogs, or the movie was not meant to be funny. It is like a movie which is supposed to be scary but never is.  The characters of the plot seem to be so predictable. The acting is poor, the dialogue is bad, the acting is so bad, and the plot is so stupid. But this is not a true horror film, and I don't think most people would really care to see it as one.  I was hoping to be able to see more of this kind of film in the late 2000's, but unfortunately that doesn't happen. It really does seem like a "horror film", although it is funny at times.   I'm not even really interested in a "fun" film, so this movie could be good for some people to enjoy, and even if I was, I wouldn't really enjoy it. As a horror film fan, I can understand the appeal of it, and for some it is fun. But I can also understand how those kinds of films are supposed to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd agree to say that this film should have been made in the days of their most dangerous times, as I understand the most powerful men of all time have been dangerous.  There is no realistic story at all, and the "story" is just a bunch of nonsense. It is completely uninteresting, as everything happens in the film (and the viewer can only watch the film on his own), so the viewer is unable to comprehend it.  The characters are not good at all. The actors are bad, even in parts. And the special effect is weak.  As you can see, the film is quite terrible, but what matters the most is the movie itself. All in all, I found it extremely depressing to watch these people and their behavior. I give this film a 1 out of 10 because it is so bad that you just cannot even watch it. The movie should be made in a movie factory, preferably the location where they used to shoot the people they want, like a movie room where you and the special effects studio can shoot you to death.  I really did not like this film, but it seems like it is a very talented person that put this film together. It would have to be more convincing. It doesn't take much effort to make something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was a bit funny and funny, and it certainly had some good moments. Unfortunately, it wasn't funny at all. It was awful and the acting was awful, too. The characters were stupid. And I wanted to be the best actor ever, but not that could be said. They seemed to be trying to act like themselves, rather than like themselves. I never got the idea they were really smart or like them. And they seemed to act just like the characters they were playing in. I just got bored. I don't know how to say this has anything to do with the movie, but I did know that all the characters were acting like morons. What the hell was the point of making this movie? Some people here say it was made so people think it was funny, but really it doesn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In no way. I didn't like this movie, but it did get quite an interesting plot.  There were some parts that I couldn't comprehend, or didn't see how it could make a difference. What this movie should have done is made it an interesting movie.  This movie had some good scenes, but they weren't nearly enough to make up for the bad plot. And the acting was absolutely awful. I would have preferred it to have some interesting moments. But unfortunately, I think there was too many points to make for most of the actors to matter in this movie. (1.7/10) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really cannot understand how this project is supposed to be. I feel like they were going to make money off of the "Symphonic" theme and I just wanted to say "no one is going to find this movie. I think it is ridiculous. This movie will make me think that this is one of those movies that are made to be watched only to be shown at home by the idiot who would pay to rent a theater for this crappy piece of crap. I was very angry. What a bad flick! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked some of the first films that have been directed in the years, but this one proves to be too shallow. I really liked the first film of the trilogy, but if I'm reading this book as a film it just really disappointing. Also, I found the acting to be quite bad, but they had some good moments. I was hoping they would have gone to the theatre to give some audience a chance to get back to their senses. I'm a huge fan of the book, and a little disappointed by how it doesn't follow the book and the book really does follow the story. However, I still recommend it for those who are looking for a great movie, but not for those that want to get on with the plotlines.  I don't know what they did, but I can guess one of two. I hope they get their chance to see a sequel to this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie because it was not a cheesy movie, at least the ones that are. I was not bothered by the acting in this movie. The acting was so bad it's so hard to watch without the words. At least one decent movie was in here, though I didn't really like the story or the storyline. The movie is a joke to anybody.  This movie is really only about a guy's relationship with a woman. There were some nice bits of dialogue in the first half of the movie, and one interesting character was the guy's son. I can't find any of his friends, though there is a good movie. If you liked the movie the way the movie stands up, though, is probably because this movie is so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the film is so bad that I can never forgive a bad film. I do find it amusing that there are so few lines in the film, but most of the characters are so lame, the dialogue is terrible, and the movie is so lame that I think it must have been edited, for it looks bad when you see it. The only time I remember seeing this film was when I was in the airport and the cab was full of a bunch of people going in and out. I have watched it again, just once, and I don't recommend it unless it's part of a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is the same as the previous movie but there is no good movie plot. I believe that they had a copy of the original movie before they decided to remake it and they changed some things and the story of the movie is different from the original version. The plot was terrible and there was no real reason to make this movie. I have seen this movie in an actual movie, and I believe this movie is trash. I recommend to look at the original "The Return of the Living Fish" movie and not rent it, as the movie was very similar to the original, but I would recommend to watch it if you have an hour and a half to spare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many bad things in this movie and there is nothing redeeming. One of them is the very poor acting and that is what really kills me. I never even used the phone or anything to have fun with this movie. I didn't like the plot, the characters and even the characters. If you liked the original movie, you might be able to tolerate it but if you just watch it, you'll probably find yourself falling in and out and getting really bored with it. The movie does have some moments and they are alright, but what I got interested in is that there's no plot and the characters are so poorly treated. I gave it a 10 because of the way in which it is presented, but it's just so bad. I don't think it is an original American version of the Disney series, and I think that most Disney viewers aren't too into it. It's disappointing and that would be the case for most Disney movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a poor movie: a bunch of people are being beaten and made to pay for their lives by people and this has got me wondering. Well I'm surprised that i'm still alive. This movie needs to be cancelled, not even just because of how horrible it looks, but at least it did something, it was interesting and fun, and had something to teach you. There were some interesting scenes, but it was lacking the depth in it to make you feel more engaged with the story. I had to endure some of the scenes, like the chase, and the scene where the car was stuck on the side and you couldn't get out. Also, the scene with the girl who was taking a bath was absolutely awful! You'd think that a bathhouse would have a sign on the wall that says "You are broken!" But a bath house is nothing to be proud about. I was glad to get out and see the end. At least it didn't suck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to see this film after seeing it on the Internet and was pleasantly surprised to find out its existence. I could not even begin to see the movie until it got so low budget. What a disappointment! The movie starts out with a nice story, but it's just an insult on everyone's time to see and enjoy this film. And what happened while watching it? Oh god, not an opportunity for a second viewing. It is absolutely disgusting. I don't care if my wife and kids were satisfied or if my kids were happy. I know it's going to be hard to find a film to watch again. I couldn't even see it once, and that is the only person that has made me feel good. And I can't even watch it again without having a mind to give it to others, even in the way that it is presented, as it is a complete insult. I had to watch this again for it was good at what was before it was. I just wonder how many movies they could make of like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the review for this film, I was horrified. I was just as angry as I think most people have ever been in this movie. The director obviously got bored and tried to get some cute and romantic girls on the set. When it finally got too serious, his attempts to do something similar were laughable. The girl who appeared in the movie was obviously not as cute as I had been expecting; the other girl who I had seen before was more adorable and sexy.  The acting was bad as well, but there are many people in this film who just don't seem to have much conviction. The acting is bad, the cinematography is not as good as it is supposed to be. It was disappointing. I hope the studio gives the sequel to the next sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few decent moments.  In this movie, there are a lot of characters who are completely uninteresting to the viewer. It is apparent that the filmmakers didn't want to portray a decent person, and the whole idea of "the hero" is nearly meaningless. The plot line is very inconsistent and boring, the action scenes are terrible, and they lack a clear direction. I have seen it's sequel a few months ago, and I haven't seen it again. It's bad for anyone who wants a movie about a character that is supposed to be smart, funny, and likable, like Will Ferrel or Will Ferrell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's a very badly scripted movie, very very much unlike the classic movies of Hollywood, which is full of the witty humor of late Disney.  The characters are just so stupid they didn't really care who they were.  I've seen this movie for 2 weeks and I'm sick of the movie. I have to tell you this is the worst movie I have ever seen and this is what happens when you see a movie: 1. You hate it and 2. You laugh.  My only praise is the ending and the acting. The ending is very bad. I can't even imagine how people can take it and think that it made them happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am of the most depressed person on the planet. This movie made me want to die and die in a different time and place, never again. It is one of the worst things I've ever seen. It has no decent acting, and the story is boring, it is unbelievable and the people are annoying, and it really hurts my mental health. The end of this movie was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it really became a horror movie. It made me laugh. That's a really bad movie! It's unbelievable that the director of this one could do it so badly. If the director has to make a sequel then I'm sure he will do a better job. Maybe he'll make a horror sequel to a horror film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been bored more than I used to watch this awful flick. The plot is fairly obvious and, like a bad thriller, it is nothing more than cheap thrills.   In other words, it never gets boring or remotely entertaining.  The two leads (Himbert and Hines) are the weakest of the three (there's a couple of standouts, but most of the scenes are devoid of interest).  There is a little bit of irony in the ending of the film. Hines says he is responsible for everything, but he can't get over his self-imposed guilt and hesitance for a relationship with the girl. He says his good-hearted father was killed because his father had never been happy. His father had died because he was afraid of getting involved with the women he had loved and he had gotten involved with his wife's child.  I don't know if the actors in the film were unhappy, but I can't guess. If the people who are responsible for the film's development are unhappy or angry because of the ending, I can only guess.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about 2 mins long but there is barely any action at all. This movie doesn't belong to the 70's so there was no room for a movie like this. The movie has nothing to show except a man who has a secret plot to make love to people that are evil for him.  The plot is not believable and the dialogues are stupid and the story never goes anywhere and it is sad how it has to come to such a poor director who is so poor at directing.  There are too many horrible dialogs and the acting is bad, so the movie would be better if the director had more of the same talents. If the director is good at what he does he has a lot of potential to create great films like the 80's or even better films like this one. But sadly, he cannot use his talents to make this movie as good as he used to when he is in charge of directing. There is a small moment in the film where a man says, "Don't think of your son! Don't think my son!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You probably remember me reading a comment about how the movie was supposed to be a piece of horror from horror movies of the 90s, where you'd have seen people playing on a roller and just randomly throw all kinds of dice. In this movie, the plot is completely nonsensical and the characters are not even characters, we're never really bothered about them. You'd have to know that these people are all really in pain, and this whole movie could be interpreted as an advertisement for a cheap movie: it's not so good.  I mean, there's a scene where a kid is crying from a dream, and there's also a scene when a guy is standing by a mirror in a room somewhere and they're having nightmares.  This movie is really only a major problem if you just want to watch horror movies, because there is a lot of great horror movies from the 70s, and movies that have a lot more interesting plots, but if you don't, this movie is a complete waste of time, and that's why I didn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I've heard about this movie in years and it was always on my shelf. I saw it again today and I have to say I didn't like it! It just seemed like another "slum film" that's just not funny and doesn't go anywhere. This movie was really an insult to those who have seen some of the film and others. In this movie, there were no scenes with anyone in the film. The characters were just the same old men, the same guys. I never watched it again, but I read the comments that posted on the IMDb:  I don't know what was in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen several episodes of this series online and I'm going to be very cautious. I didn't like this movie in the first season of the show, but this film in no way made me sad. It was very bad. The plot was very disappointing and the characters didn't make the show as cute or funny as I remember they were. What really kills me is that it looks as though the show was made by one person who is extremely naive and who has never really made films he has made a career out of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't know why this movie is so popular in the UK - I've not seen it since and I just checked the IMDb for the 10 year anniversary, and I've still never seen it again. But it is so predictable that it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - I didn't even get used to the ending or the music and the dialogue. The director didn't care for any of the things I said - I just saw the movie for the first time and I couldn't even say it was funny or inspiring, even though the lead is funny and I laughed (as we were watching it) - and I only saw it once again for the third time, and at that point I was very bored with it - if I could listen to something else - I wouldn't mind, but even the first movie didn't have any humour or charm or anything to recommend it as a film. I also feel that this film was way too simplistic and that it was badly made - I think it is way too serious and that what was supposed to be a joke (as I said, "the ending") is totally pointless and boring. But the other parts aren't funny (as their point of the film is just a joke) and they do take a lot of effort to make them look good - and they don't make anything funny. I feel that there's not even an idea of a sequel, though I don't think it would be quite as good as its original.  It might have been better if the British media had made more effort to show the British TV channel that had filmed the original version of this movie. I don' think it could have gotten any better than this one - I remember some of the British tablarodies that were filmed by Vad, and if they were made it better they would probably make it much better. But they don'it that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have the worst ratings of any version of "Fever", a stinking trash piece of nonsense. The best version of it is simply a complete rip of the original film.  I know some guys who tried to bring this remake to the market, and tried to make a good copy of the film. Unfortunately, they did not know what a lot of the actors were thinking and were unable to do anything decent. The actors aren't well put in the story, the acting doesn't work, and the dialog is terrible.  There were a few points that made the movie interesting, like the old lady (who is, by far, my least favorite character), but the main bad point is that the whole film relies on the actors to make it believable.   The script is also bad for the plot, the dialogue is weak, and most of the movie is not original (some scenes were pretty funny, and others were even funny), but at least there were some scenes that were amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was badly filmed, bad editing, bad story, horrible acting, and bad special effects. What a movie is is supposed to be like? Well, it wasn't very good. I think it was a mixture of the original film with the DVD edition, and the DVD version has a different story and special effects that should have been left in the first place. The DVD version is pretty good, but it's a lot of other things that ruin it. The soundtrack is terrible. There's a great movie in a good movie, so if you watch it, don't watch this. If you like a story that takes place in the book, don�t waste your time.  If you�re into horror, donât even watch this movie, and most movies with monsters are good, so donâte just a horror movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one is actually the worst sequel I've ever seen in my life. The plot isn't there for the first time and the characters were totally horrible, the voice actors were good but I wasn't interested in any of the parts. The dialogues were weak and the ending was slow and stupid and the direction and acting were poor. I was interested in the original series but it was so bad that it didn't matter what I got into it. The whole plot was really about being a person who just had to kill his mom just so he'd be in a good position to commit adultery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this movie before, so I was curious to know what it was like. I'm guessing that this is what the name of the movie would have been had been. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, the story, and it was absolutely disappointing. I've known all the rules of the series, and this movie broke them. I can understand that some of my thoughts about the series are influenced by the series but in this movie, they were simply flat out wrong. I do believe that a lot of my friends who watch the series find it interesting, but they aren't interested. This is an absolute disaster and I wish the actors that worked were used to be, but that's all I can say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was amazed that I watched this movie in its first viewing in a movie theater. I was surprised that it was even listed in the "Hangst" category in the Movie Guide and the trailer on IMDb was only about $10. I am not kidding. I'm shocked that it has never been filmed before or even been released. But after viewing it, my opinion changed about the film: It wasn't even about a real movie. It wasn´t scary, but it wasn´re funny. I thought it was an attempt to make a joke in a way to get out a negative comment about the whole genre.  I know people have never seen this movie, and I suspect they may have never even heard of it, but if you watch it you will probably find yourself sick from it. I hope that these comments are all directed at the wrong movie: not the people who have been obsessed with the original, but also not the "Aldist". I can´t believe that they could be a comedy or even a horror film, but this is a complete lack of entertainment and enjoyment. I don´t care what you want to watch, just the awful, terrible, horrible, awful, awful movie they're trying to make for no good reason. The movie is one of a kind of horror film that has absolutely no story or story. It is merely a very stupid way to make money, and although I think it was actually pretty funny it isn´t so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been through this film a few years ago and the results are just awful. The story is simply pathetic. The dialog is flat and predictable, the acting is so bad that it should never be taken seriously. The cinematography seems to have nothing to do with the plot.  My hopes for the film are gone and I can't find the courage to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to see the last of the "The Good, The Bad, The Worse" and I laughed because this was the weakest thing in the "Lucky Bastard". The most disappointing movie of all time! The best one was the "Good, The Good, the Bad, the Even Bad"! If you knew nothing about the bad side of the series, this movie would be your best. If you thought of one good movie this would be "The Bad, Stupid, Even Dumb". The only one that was even remotely entertaining was the film "Pilot", which is hilarious. The funny line is "Nasty!" when your friend's dad comes to you and tries to get you to a good movie: 1. Take any movie: it could be a movie about a couple of idiots, and it could take you to an interesting movie. However, for a comedy, this is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is bad - there is only a small amount of plot. Very predictable and boring (for those who enjoy it). Very disturbing from an American perspective.  The acting is bad. All the characters are stereotypical, stupid and unapproposable. I don't think anyone outside of American or even close to American audiences will enjoy this movie - very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a former fan of a good movie.  It is not a good film, not a great film, and it was really hard to watch. I had never seen one film that made me like it, and I am not expecting this one to be an amazing film. The acting is bad, and some of the characters are too predictable, and the music is bad.  But I'm a big fan of this movie because I loved the show and have the original television series that has been on for more than 20 years.  I cannot believe that you'd have any faith that it was supposed to be a good sitcom.  If you are looking for a good comedy about a dumb, stupid guy, you have to have some faith that this is not the movie you are hoping for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to write a negative negative review of a bad film:  This was the bad version of the sequel with the sequel. I was hoping the sequel would improve. I can see what the sequel had to do if it was a sequel and not a sequel. This is the worst movie ever. I find it difficult to see the sequel as a sequel since it is just a bad version. This movie has been designed like a bad sequel to a bad remake of the original, and it has not grown as bad as the sequel did. There is not much to be seen of this movie, but it was very bad for anyone who is going to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dellicore" is an extremely bad film. It is the only film about an elderly movie maker with limited resources. I have to say, that I did not understand why this movie was not given the opportunity to finish filming, and I have a feeling this is just another bad film about a poor movie. I was expecting an entertainment film to be a real film, and sadly it was not. I did agree with the movie premise and the plot, but the movie just wasn't as interesting as it was. The story was pretty weak and the characters were totally bad. It just felt as though it was just another film about nothing. It was hard to follow and it would be good to see a film where there was something interesting to the characters. I'm not sure who made this film and I would never really be able to understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a lot of false statements in this movie. I think the actor was in some way responsible for the whole series. The story seems to be one set up, with the actor and the director writing about how the movie will ultimately end. The fact that the plot is so fake is extremely insulting, and it is clear that a lot happened for the movie to fall under. It was clearly supposed to have been one of the biggest films of the year, and there are many mistakes in this film. The ending, although pretty, looks more like a story of how to escape from the bad guys in the game, instead of the characters actually dying, and the fact that a few of the actors who played the main characters are very talented.  However, it was fun at times. This is the worst movie of the summer, and I hope that the producers put this behind them to make it a better movie. There are better movies I would like to see. This movie was so bad that I almost gave it a negative rating, but after all, it is a real film and a really good movie. It has gotten to the point of being a film that is not good enough to be in this genre. I don't think anyone will like it, because it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard of this movie but it had the most disturbing plot. I would never ever watch this movie again. It was awful. I laughed to the music of "Kungs" by the music director. It really sucked off two or three of the songs that were supposed to be in the music video. I did not find the "kungs", and the two "kunds" songs. If I heard the song "kuntra" I'd be really sad to see it in a video.  The "hahahm!" song on the song called "Fucking Dog". I didn't know who it was before it was in the video. The music had such an unpleasant feel. This is so bad it's better than a toilet bowl!  I didn\'t want to know if I really was dead, if I had, why didn't they send my body into the water? And now they just have "Kunshai" on the list, that's the song. I want to avoid all of these horrible things, and I couldn't see a movie called "Kuntra". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts a year after its original premiere. This is very disappointing. The film is badly acted and is very boring and not at all funny. The special effects were so bad that I laughed at the end. The actors do not portray very well or have anything to make their presence known. The plot is stupid, very stupid and the ending is quite bad. The character, the main character, has no life, no character development, no real growth, no interest, no conflict. The acting is bad but not bad at all. And the ending fails in most places, but the ending itself is funny and is the best I have ever seen of all the films I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not about a man who made it in a short time and didn't have much to do in the plot. The script is simply bad. I found this movie to be extremely disappointing, especially given the fact that it was released on DVD and that it had such a bad review. However, the movie is a remake of the film it's predecessor. As the two are similar in terms of story, plot, cinematography, and direction, they are both awful.  The two are very different in their approach to the film. In the first one, you get a glimpse of some decent acting and good characters, the plot is decent, and the story is good. The second one is much the same, but it is not nearly similar. The fact that the acting in the film is so bad is what makes the second film so good.  In the second one, they stick to the same story and the ending is a huge bummer, they try to shoe in all kinds of silly situations, there is nothing to justify this behavior.  Both are not enjoyable and I do not understand why this movie is so hard to watch. It would be nice to watch more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not worth watching but it is for people like me. I can't believe they're even trying to make this film. I don't even like it. I was sick at the ending. But what it is like is that I cannot remember anything about it. This movie is terrible and it should never get 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film once in the theatre of New York on Broadway and decided I'd like to see it again. Unfortunately, I think the movie is not as terrible as the original, but I do not have a good movie: no dialogue, no humor, no plot, no dialog, no special effects. The plot is also not well developed and is extremely annoying. But my thoughts are this movie fails for a couple of reasons. One of them is that the characters are so annoying and their personalities are so flat. I guess that would be best for a movie that had a good-looking cast. I'm not saying that these characters are evil or that they're not well-intended, but they are just annoying.   The movie is also boring, at times.  The plot also does not make much sense. I would like to have a better storyline, but in a few minutes it is too long.  I would also like to avoid this film if it came out at my school. The movie was about eight minutes long and I thought I was too tired.  There is so little fun in this movie and there are some nice moments in it, but this movie could be improved. I didn't have time to waste, I just wanted to catch some of its ideas. I found myself bored and the movie could not provide any sort of plot.  Some reviewers say the film is an old film.  But that would just be a lame excuse for a bad, dated, B-movie that can hardly stand the test of public interest. It is also disappointing that the film, which was filmed in New York and released in 1985, has a DVD that was made from the same movie. I suppose I should have made more effort to correct the plot and keep the film interesting, but instead I watched it again, hoping that I could find some clues and some of the film's greatness. I won't judge it as a bad film, but it certainly doesn't have to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script for this movie is stupid and pointless. And the dialog is really terrible. The main actors and actresses seem to always act stupidly. I really want to see this movie ruined, but it's not. It's really sad that it is so bad, and I couldn't stop watching it even if it was on live television. This movie was really boring, and very slow at times. The soundtrack was very disappointing and very bad. I didn't like this movie as a whole, and my life was made worse for the people who saw it. I just wish I would get some help. If you want to get some info on this movie, the best I found is that the main character is the actor, John Russell. You can watch this movie if you have a good memory from the old series, and the actors are interesting, but they don't act well or make good decisions. If it is not for you, you might just be wasting your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Shelter" is not really a horror film but it is more of a soap opera than anything else. In addition it is just plain boring, badly acted and worst of all from a script. This is not your typical horror series. It is a really bad movie from the point of being predictable, boring and very poor in the acting skills, to be a horror movie. I actually liked "The Van Helyens," a very good horror film, a great, action film with a few disturbing scenes, but if you like gore, it is OK, if you don't like it, it isn't.   The movie isn't too terrible and it is only a slight disappointment considering the movie itself is good. But it is a waste of money and does not go to the next level of horror, and it would be interesting to see a remake of the original that actually works.  The plot is good and there is no gore; this is not a horror but it does look pretty good. The actress, Jessica Williams (Natalie Winkel, who is most notable for acting in the movie, is no better) and Michael Caine (who is known for horror movies in his career and is known to be an actress but is this movie not very good) are both bad, even worse than the actress in "Sylia". It is disappointing to see that the actress, especially if she is in "The Von Von Von" and a well known actor like she is here, would be better. The acting is also bad, too. It's just about as bad as a film that I would expect a good horror movie to be.  I don't recommend watching this movie but if it is good, it should never be seen unless you have a brain and a lot of time to kill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read about this movie, and this was the movie that i dreaded. It was really stupid. I didn't understand that it was an accurate movie. The way it was presented was annoying, and the way it showed the story made it difficult to understand what it was going to happen. And it was sad when I learned how stupid this movie was. I was in tears when it was over. I have learned that it is hard to make a movie that has such an extreme lack of realism. The dialogue was unbelievable and the story seemed pointless. I also really dislike that he is the lead. It is not only the girl in the movie, but it is his voice actor. If there is a reason why he could have left it at home, I'd be glad to see it. But there is nothing else. The movie is also a bad sequel of a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm shocked that I actually watched this movie in the theatroon in Vancouver. The plot was bad and the acting was bad.  I think that the person who wrote this script should lose a job. And that would have been good.  The film was only one of a few horror flicks that I had to watch. It is definitely a bad film. I give it 1/2 out of 10. I know, but that is a low score.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for two days in a row. I thought it was a really bad movie, but it has this good acting. The acting is terrible, and the direction is bad. I had to change the direction so the ending would make me understand that they were in an advanced stage. I just wanted to see something that didn't make any sense. I was in tears every time I watched it.  What really happens when they begin to see the movie? If you watch it on your DVD, the only thing you can do is to look for a positive review about something bad movie. It's not like a film: it's boring, and it gets off with a lot of false hopes.  The plot was so bad, it just seemed like a story about some kid who was being bullied by some kid, and he was in fact getting his revenge. It really should have been made a story of a child who was bullied by a child, and revenge, which doesn't seem like a positive story. I watched the film on my DVD, and did a search of other movies. This film just got the worst reviews it had gotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was one of the worst I've seen. It has a plot line that's hard to understand, a plot that's not predictable, and it's not really a comedy. A bunch of people is murdered in their apartment, they have a group that's on the verge of killing them...and they're murdered by a bunch of men who think they'll be better off without a guy's permission. They're all so pathetic that they don't even care about the people that were killed in the apartment. And I can't help but wish they weren't filmed this. I think the people who make this film have got their hands chopped off in their pockets and just want to go and get more of their own money.   So don't watch this unless you want a cheap, worthless excuse to watch something that isn't really fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard this movie had any acting in it. It was a pity, and there's no good reason to have a bad one. I was very annoyed by the whole movie, and I think I was one of the people that had not really understood the film. It is a terrible piece of work that doesn't work.  I hope there's some one who thinks about how funny it could have been for him to have made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this is what was supposed to be. There is so much pointless, boring, and contrived editing and sound editing that I can hardly believe it had any real interest to begin with.  The characters were totally out of line with the audience, and most of them are pretty obvious and without the ability to act in a normal manner.  There are so many clichés that this movie is so bad I don't even care if the word is 'drama'.  I didn't know what it was and what it looked like when I watched this for the first time, but I do know why they did this. It was an obvious joke of an overblown and unrealistic, unapparent film. It really is an insult to everyone who made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really upset watching this one, because it really had nothing to offer. It seemed to be something like a small indie film of someone's own creation, with no real plot line, really. The acting was weak, and the plot seemed totally uninspired. I never really understood how much it could get into the movie, which made me think that maybe it's been around for 20 years! I remember seeing it when I was a kid (I was 11!) and it was never really like it. I kept telling myself that it really sucked and I didn't like it, but it could have been a funny movie at times. I'm not going to watch it to enjoy it, like so many of the other movies like "The Wildes" and "The Legend of the Snake's Eye" which were way better. This is like watching a movie about a bunch of idiots who are going to die in a fire fight because a fire started in their camp; nothing was fun except when they died; a sad end for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie made some decent ideas and managed to keep them in its grasp, but the overall execution was bad. It was never funny, not funny at all, and it just seemed like the writer was getting bored. And finally, most of the lines were awful, even after I'd seen them in the previous 10 days. That was a sign that this movie wasn't intended to be funny, but sadly it wasn't. This movie needs to be taken seriously to the extent that it would never be funny. That's not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely worthless, it has no story and it is nothing at all to the point of being interesting. I don't understand why this movie has been made. If you want to be entertained in the "Powers Of Freedom" movies, the ones made after the "Shiva" show, you will get bored. If it wants to be the same kind of comedy, the "King of The World" would have to have been filmed in 3D. There are no jokes to be found in this movie, no funny lines to be put in it. If people actually want to watch this movie then they have to find the funny of this movie and pay good money for a ticket to watch it. Unfortunately it's not going to be an action comedy and the best action comedy of the movie was "Mile's Dreams". This movie has nothing to do with the real life of the people who are fighting.  This is absolutely terrible and the show is very disappointing! I was hoping to see more "King Of The World", but unfortunately they're taking it so seriously. This movie isn't even worth paying for the DVD, even with the original version of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some interesting aspects of this movie. I guess that's a good thing for me, but it's a bad thing for anyone. I'm not trying to excuse this movie, but just because it's an interesting and amusing thing to see (and I can't get enough laughs out of it, the only time I have ever laughed in my life), I guess it's OK to do, if it's fun to watch. I have learned that most movies are so horrible and depressing. I've watched many of them. But if you're hoping for a good movie, don't look to this one. It's about a 30 minute movie about a bunch of teenagers who don't understand what they're doing, and want to be "normal" and "smart" and not become the next generation's top guys. It has the oddest ending of all the movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't even use a car as a reference to a bad film:  If you have a car and go on and drive on, you might be OK. However, if you buy a movie on video DVD from someone's local video store then you will lose all your respect and respect for anything that looks like a movie. You also get your respect for the time you used to watch it.  The movie is about a few things, but not really about anything.  I have had to listen to two separate versions of this movie. There are two versions of the movie. I'll admit that I didn't know if anyone else knew the true version. You get bored pretty fast after getting bored.   There is a really bad version of a movie called "The Hangman" in which the main characters are from a time period of time (the 1930s) that doesn't have any real life whatsoever. The rest of the cast looks really unbelievable and the acting is bad.  It is a complete failure, with only some funny and funny moments, but it is still terrible. You have to watch this movie just to get the idea that it is about nothing. I would rate this movie about one third of the worst movies ever made in the history of video distribution. It's just really bad, and there is no excuse to listen any of the songs except for the one song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be the worst movie of all time. It's like a bunch of old, dusty cars, with a lot of bad driving jokes. Don't buy this movie and you won't have a great movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I wrote, it's not a film. It was a film made in the mid forties. It is so bad that I can't believe it had the budget and cast to make it look that good. It has a terribly amateur acting, and there is no real suspense, just plain bad acting. The film is too long to be filmed in a full-time movie, and has the worst dialogue. There is one plot element that really got me thinking. The movie has a story line that involves the young boy and his brother. He is obsessed with her brother and she gives him the money to pay for his sex to her, then he comes back to their house to make love to her brother. That is the plot. It's not even a realistic sex scene! It is one person's mind that is obsessed. The way the boy looks, looks, and smells in their relationship is very strange. It doesn't even seem like it could happen. It gets so bad when the plot is predictable, and it is not scary.  The worst of this movie is probably the ending. The ending is about a love-to-pay for the love of an old-fashioned lady who's always wanted to find an old prostitute. That doesn't work. It also never happens, but that would be too hard to believe. The girl gets bored when she finds an old lady and he dumps her back in with the lady who gets into the relationship between the two and the movie ends in a lovefest in a bunch of sad old hippies. The hippie's girlfriend was never mentioned by the makers of this piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so bad that I didn't even care what to watch. The people who posted the comments for this movie, and I am still getting the urge to watch it, don't understand what it is about. It shows that they can't take an idea of wanting to be a part of a community, and so they just want to be isolated from the whole world. This is like a movie version of the "Sawyer" series. This was also the best of the two "Honey" movies I saw. This movie is just a really bad sequel of the first "HONEY" movie. They tried to add something in the beginning by giving the first movie a title and saying, "The first film is about you". You can see how the movie ended up, because it didn't have any story or plot about the first film. And the second film, which is actually a sequel of "HOE" is even worse. The ending is even more depressing than the first. In my opinion, this movie could have been called an example of "I WANT SANDY" in a high school. I don't think this is a movie to anybody. This has the potential to be used as a sex-compara "swim" that shows a young guy who isn't very smart, and gets to a girlfriend who is very smart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot believe this film to be a bad film. It is only a copy of the original in color, some dialogs and some music are the same. But the story is even worse than the original. It's just boring and awful, there's nothing interesting, the story and character are weak. The actors are good, but I didn't feel they are making a strong connection with the characters. I was hoping the film would be funnier than the first one because of all the comedy that has been put to the original, but it's not.  It just is bad and very uninteresting. The movie is just a copy, so don't waste your time if you have it, the first edition of this film is about 7.7 million from $9.99. If you liked the original "The House of Blue" please keep the copy and you'll have a great time watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember reading an review of this movie: it was crap, not even one of the best horror films since I was 11. What a pity. I'd probably rate it as a 1-2 out of 10 or something so poor. I don't want to go on and on about the movie. I'll just say that, yes, it is, it was not a good movie. But it was funny. It wasn't great at all in the movie, but I suppose there's more to go through the movie that was so bad. Maybe I'm reading too many reviews. It's been quite funny, and that was the whole movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a guy who loves video games and I am going to be offended by this movie. The only thing that I was surprised about is the fact that the story is the main part of the movie. Not the fact of the story, or the story itself. This movie could have been good at times, but in the end it was just a waste of time, and not a good movie. I would never go out of my money again if i had to watch another movie about a good story. I just hope the writers are able to put some more attention to the movie which doesn't rely on it's own story, and the actors are not good actors either, just bad for the movie and bad for acting. Don't waste your money, if you are like me, which I was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like the movie, but, I do have seen the movie several times. I have to say that I was never happy with it. Not the way the movie is presented or edited (this would be the worst movie of all time in Hollywood!), not the editing (this is the worst), not the ending (this was very brief), not even the soundtrack. And, finally, I had to say a few words of sympathy for this movie. I was about to watch it again, and I thought I'd be happier if they could improve this movie at all, but the movie would keep making me angry. I found the movie to be very insulting and rather stupid. In the future, I will see more movies that are better than this one, which is not the funniest movie I've ever seen. I also have to warn the people watching this movie from seeing it as a comedy. This is the kind of movie that makes people laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many people who have seen this film and I can assure they are at least somewhat satisfied. However, there is one thing I can't stand out of the equation. There is an element of irony that is perhaps a touch too high. That is how this film was made. It is a complete insult to the mind of every child that has ever been raised under this type of system, and it should be condemned as such. There are also two scenes that have been reworked from the original version. This is not the original "Cameos", it is simply a rework. The first scene in the opening scene shows a small Indian girl crying in agony. The next scene shows her father crying in his face as he looks at his daughter. Then a man in his blue coat, apparently with the woman who carried his daughter, is shown crying with remorse. That's the way it was to be. And there are those that would consider such as "bad films", but at least we can see that they can be reasonably done. However this movie could never be taken seriously. The main villain is in a form of self-regulative rage and he has no real reason to be so. He was put in prison for life and he needs to be punished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie since it was released and was annoyed by it for all the wrong reasons. I was very angry with it. It was very strange, and made me want to vomit and my stomach turned cold and cold. I didn't like it because it was so poorly staged. But it has to be an odd movie that has the most pathetic script I have ever seen. I am not a writer but still the best one in the movie. It should never have been made.  I think it would be better if this movie was a made to get one of the worst parts in a movie: one of its characters, the other one. But I think I was given a nice chance. I knew nothing about it, and I think that I would have known if it was a film of a bad film. It just has so much wrong with it and yet so much good. But don't buy the movie, the movie is very weak and has such a weak cast. It isn't the first time I heard of the person who was so great as a singer in this movie, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first of three of the best "Fantasy" films in the history of horror, so bad it's a pity. It seems to have been released in the same year as "Death Of A Great Lover" (a terrible sequel), but I'm sure if you knew what I'm about to reveal, you would know that. I'm going to try to make a good point of reference for this by stating one more example: The ending. The ending of this film had a very disturbing and unbelievable ending. Not much more than a 10 minutes long.  It was like watching a soap opera where the ending was just "a lot of nonsense" and they're off on the island when there's a car coming to their hotel and then they just drive away. I can't believe it was this film's director that was involved in this. That's my first word review for it, I'm ashamed and embarrassed to admit this horrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. It isn't funny, it isn't clever, it's not funny, and it's completely pointless. This movie has so many pointless and stupid jokes. I wish to see a movie that actually made a decent sense out of a life-and-death story that made little sense out. This is not a film that is funny and funny at all. This film could have been made much better by using better actors to direct it. This should have been at least a funny film, and possibly a good movie. If you actually enjoyed this movie, don't waste your time, even if you thought it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although there are at least one or two decent actors (Eileen Dawson and Steve Dorner), it still manages to suck some of the same blood right out of me. The film has been re-tooled into a form that could have made a good comedy. I'm surprised to see such a bad script being made from the same producers that made this previous film. The plot is so poorly conceived and the acting isn't nearly believable. The main storyline is a stereotypical one about a woman being in love with a handsome stranger with no real reason. The script is so lacking in what I usually expect to see in a romantic comedy. The only thing about this film that has any semblance of a story is the fact that the characters are in an arranged marriage and that their wives want to make the man and the woman, even the elderly man, happier than the man's children. Also the film is not funny. I've seen this film at least twice and I thought it was the worst "jizzer" film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend, my wife, and a friend of mine, did not like this movie. It's hard to even be surprised by it, considering the cast (the acting and special effects). This movie made me think I was watching an ad, or an ad for a bad porn movie. I had no idea this movie was supposed to be "the most interesting" movie about the whole world, so I did not expect any comedy from this movie either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie while working on a job and was just sick to death watching it and didn't like it for the following two months. I don't understand the point of this film. What happened to me was that the director told us that this would be a film about a family, and the ending is that the entire family is dead, except for the woman. There's absolutely no idea how it could have happened, the plot is pretty simple and boring, the acting is bad, and it's not that well scripted. I can't believe anyone would have this on their resume and it really should not be a "film" film. There is a lot of bad actors in this film, and you can't blame anyone for having seen this movie and tried to avoid it. I'm a huge fan of the TV shows and movies. I just think it's a bad excuse for anyone to see the movie. I've heard from a lot that this film is a film with a very bad ending. The director needs to really fix this thing. I understand what it was and is not, but it seems like he is just digging his own grave. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is only slightly entertaining. I've read all of the previous comments in this article, and this was simply a bad film. The only reason I can imagine the director could make it believable is that he has an innate sense of creating believable, or even funny, scenes.  I'm sick of "The Muppets" for a movie with a single (albeit ridiculous) laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have to say, at least the actor had decent acting.  This was pretty terrible. The acting was awful, and the humor is pretty poor. In a good movie, it's pretty good.  If you liked this, skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film, and thought it was awful. I'm a little bit surprised because it was so bad, but also I was hoping that it was going to be a pretty great film, after it was released. I wish there was something nice about this film. If you're not a fan of the classic comedy of 'Candy's Wedding', or 'Criminal Liars' or 'The Last Picture', you will probably find this film very disappointing. In fact, I was annoyed by the fact that the plot is so stupid and there is no sense whatsoever about how things go. It is also so bad that the film is so bad it is boring and there are so many pointless things that the filmmakers aren't even able to create, like a time when 'Cochrane' is going to come in and clean up his pants. And this is probably why, as a film fan, I'd prefer to see 'The Bride Of Crime' instead of 'Dare Devil's Way'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this movie, you might enjoy watching this movie and then wonder why it never got an official release. I've watched this film more than 10 times and this has nothing whatsoever to prove a point.  If that's your opinion, you may have trouble getting into the real-life of Eberts. This movie has no good plot or plot. It is the worst film of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete mess. I can't believe that someone would spend so much money to rent it to rent. It must have been made for an amusement purposes only to give money to the actors. If you go to rent, buy it for 2 bucks. If they made it to get to a decent movie, don't rent it for 3 bucks. You're going to find yourself a great, but you won't find the money to buy the DVD! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was pretty fun - it is very stupid that they don't want you to believe the ending. They also make the movie look so stupid that it is impossible for anyone to comprehend the meaning of the story. They don't bother to show their interest in the story for a moment and then we get a scene about one or two characters.  The story is weak and it takes no matter who you pick to tell you how it is or how it ends. The ending is about two people who decide to kill the rest of the "swarms" and when they do, they end up killing the rest.  A few sentences and you don't have a clue about what the whole story is. There are only 2 characters to pick and this is all they get to say - one is the main character and another is the henchmen.  When you have two main characters, you're left wondering why your story ends and why they are getting to the point where you need to kill off these people. It's too shallow to be believable and there is nothing to them to say. It also plays off the fact that this movie is about the main characters so much that it doesn't have any interest in other characters. The only thing that keeps this story interesting is that one of the people in the movie, who doesn't really seem to know how to get the job done, has a family that has no interest whatsoever in it and only keeps their name in the title because it has "special" people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is okay, it may be interesting at the moment but the end is very bad. I have a lot of the dialog, the acting, the direction, but the story is a little too thin to justify the idea.  The plot is so lacking in the details. There is not enough blood, there is not much gore, and the cinematography isn't good at all. There are a few funny moments (mostly from a couple of young men, who seem to be acting as if they had not seen this movie as a horror movie.) In the end, there's no way to justify this one-sentence horror flick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being on TV for years, I was expecting to get a film that looked like "A Few Remotes Of Life," and that would have done something great. And I was hoping that it would look like this one. It just looked terrible. The film had an excuse or a twist. And then there was a major story arc and a character actor from the first year of the movie was sent off, and it's not very apparent who the villain was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, it is terrible, the acting is laughable and the acting and dialog are terrible. I don't understand why someone would give this movie the "BEGIN" rating but this is still the worst film ever made. I think they tried to make the movie interesting but there are no good laughs in it. The main villain is a bad one, the other one a bad guy. I can't see any good in it except for the ending, which is hilarious. I understand people have tried to "make it interesting" and I understand this movie has some good elements but there is nothing to it.  I don´t understand what the person who made this movie says about it. This movie is not funny, it's not funny at all, it´s stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this before. I have never seen this movie before.  I'm going to go on a review of it. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I don't know why people thought that it was good, I can only guess that it is some sort of sick joke. I guess the reason why the people laughed at it is because they actually laughed at the whole idea of being a movie: there were some pretty bad jokes. The plot is pretty thin, although I do enjoy it when they are funny. If you are looking for some comedy, please don't buy this movie.  Also, the actor has a weird name, I think there was some kid somewhere who had more hair than the actor when he appeared.  The acting wasn't very good, the acting wasn' good, but the humor was pretty good.  And it's so hard to believe this movie is a bad parody. I had to laugh about it for the first 20 minutes. After it finished I had the most depressing feeling ever.  If you want a comedy, watch this and don't watch any of the sequel: "Cinestra's Revenge" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So here are some of the most stupid moments of this movie, some pretty lame acting and no real comedy.  However it does a little job of comedic tension to make the movie worthwhile, though it does get the job done.  Unfortunately the best part of this film is the story, which is about a bunch of dysfunctional losers who have problems with each other, and what happens when one of them turns into a "gangster". What happens then? The story is about the gangster being a bit tough, so he decides to join a new, better gangster to help him get revenge.  I would recommend this movie to the worst of all the "comedic" movies ever made. But please, do not buy it, it doesn't make any sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie just isn't good. I give this rating mainly because it contains so many annoying scenes that the movie must be seen in one-and-a-half-hours. I gave it a 2/10 rating because the film is only 2/3 minutes short and it is just plain boring.  The worst example of this movie is the first scene, which is probably the most ridiculous scene I've seen. A man is going to give a bottle of water to the woman he was with. That's the beginning. However, the movie fails to have any meaning and the story is completely lacking.  For the first 40 minutes, this movie starts to get interesting when it finally goes on. There's a scene in the movie where the man takes his mother and baby daughter to the shower and they're sitting in the room. He has an expensive bottle of vodka and he throws it in a pile. The girl is wearing a fancy gown and gets undressed. When the two of them enter the room, the woman throws a piece of cloth over the bathtub and gets out.  Then the man is naked and comes in the bath. He puts his wife in the shower. The woman then begins to cry and tries to get the man away from her.  He throws the lady in the toilet.  There's just one scene that is even better than the scene where the woman is having sex with the man. It has a creepy man who is naked while masturbating and masturbating on her and taking his finger in her pussy. You would think that he would do something to turn her into a rape monster. However he doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Cobber" was the first in this line of movies. The story was a bunch of nonsense, none of the details made sense, the plot and the characters were ridiculous and laughable. I was shocked to see the ending. I tried to imagine the writer and the director had a clue as to how to make this movie. But there's no explanation for this behavior. The whole movie is a little confusing and there's not really any plot.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone. And even if the plot was good enough, there are some horrible lines, like "Aarly Rental" and "Able Naughty" (not just the first scene, the whole movie). "Cobin" should be renamed "Cobs" and its characters should never ever be in the same movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened? I'm in shock watching this movie and wondering what the hell was going to happen. I have seen many times over the last few years, and the movie is always the same. The story is so bad and the characters and their dialog are not even good. There is no plot. There are no story. The character that most wants to be a "hero" in the movie has never been one. I think the character who wants to become a "scary" is a typical person.  The actor is just acting with little more depth or passion. I did get to see a great acting scene, and that was a shame, not a good scene.  I was expecting much better of the movie when I saw it.  But sadly, the movie was just what it was in a nutshell. It is just a weak movie that is not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was supposed to be a horror movie, as I believe it was before it was obvious to see how this movie sucked at all the audience and the director had forgotten what he actually made.  But instead it has morphed into a gore-film sequel with a lot of gratuitous sex and gore and gore for a cheap gag. I'm not even sure what was the reason for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a poor effort. I did agree that it could be entertaining, but it didn't have that. I think it was the worst film of the entire IFC Films series. There are no decent female actors and the plot is so lacking in details. The female actors aren't good enough and they don't act to the point of their abilities. The music is also bad as well. I didn't know it was out of high school, but I thought it was about an hour, maybe even 15 minutes. I cannot recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was skeptical when the original, as well as everyone else on this site, thought that this movie was going to be an interesting film. But it was disappointing. I'm not sure if this film was supposed to be very interesting, but what I would say, is that this film fails for two reasons. 1) It's badly scripted, and 2) It doesn't work. The ending is awful, and most of the cast is not very good. Some of the acting here is good, but there are far too many bits and they aren't shown in proper time. If you really like the original version, don't go. It's just another disappointment for us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a second grader, and my parents are really disappointed about it. I don't think you can put it down in any way, but I didn't like it to start. The ending is about a cop walking in the street with a bad guy, and this guy had sex with a chick. There are some good things. I think that the music is good, and a decent soundtrack for some. But these parts are completely lacking. There aren't enough laughs in this movie. And the main character doesn't even want to be in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this film at one movie club in Seattle. The acting was poor and the acting was bad. The movie had poor plot and acting. The characters were the most boring and bland and predictable. There were no redeeming features, not even the best of the 3 actors, and there were no memorable appearances.  When I was listening to the soundtrack, I thought that the movie was over-rated, especially the acting. There was no dramatic ending. There wasn't a real ending. If this movie was poorly made, I would call for the same money, no good movie.  There are many places to buy this film in Seattle, I know they exist, but none of them have ever been able to sell it on the shelves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I was on vacation this weekend, I saw this movie. It is full of so many of the worst clichés of the American film industry. I'm not kidding. They're horrible.  But then I was laughing. How could I laugh at the movie? I've seen some of them before, and this is the worst. It's not good for anyone, but not bad enough. Some of the dialog in the movie is not funny at all, but others aren't funny either. Just watch it for the awful ending.  Overall, the movie was terrible. I would have been embarrassed if I hadn't laughed at the ending. What is with a movie that never gets around? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I have written this review, I have to say, this movie is so terrible that I am afraid it will never get rated. This movie is absolutely terrible in the acting, photography, and even the artistry. I hope you can let me write this negative review so that it will make the movie more interesting. I did my first viewings of this movie, and I didn't like it anymore. I can't find out if it has been posted anywhere, and in the meantime, I think I can do that. I am a huge fan of Stephen Soderberg's films, and the rest of them were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An hour long movie which fails to make any sort of plot or suspense. Most of the movie was very boring and boring, the only interesting thing about it was the fact that it was filmed in Japan, the main thing that got me interested was the ending. Unfortunately this movie doesn't work like a normal film. It's not an accurate movie, it's not funny, it has no suspense, it doesn't much interest, it really just plain boring. It just plain sucks! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this film with my sister, and she was very sad about it. She had to leave before we could finish it, so we had to take it again. I was laughing at how they wasted the time writing it. It just wasn't funny. I found a very bad review about it on YouTube, but there is no other way. It was also funny, but not funny enough. I don't recommend watching this because there is a very decent film in there. It is also pretty bad at times. I am sorry to have seen it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of Star Trek, so I'm willing to watch and pay for it. That's not the reason I think the bad movie is bad, it's really a really bad movie, that's not a matter of opinion. It's about time, if it's not for me to be sad about the fact that this movie isn't funny, because they could have better jokes.  What is the movie about?  And the funny: it's about the guy who got the ship! No, the one who got this ship was not some great scientist, the other guy who had a great job of getting to land on the ship, or anyone else. I'm sorry, but I don't like these types of movies. I don´t even like these kind of movies, I always like a movie that's funny.  I think if I were an actor, I'd be really unhappy about this movie, and I'd definitely be angry at myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this film an eight, but it seemed too bad to be rated. The dialog is the same from the start. I gave it a two-and-a-half-plus rating because I wanted to give it an eight. But I also gave it one. It's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the premise, a teenager with a secret, gets his girlfriend into his room (the girl).  It's not all bad, there is one section that is good, and there is another section that isn't. The acting in the first half is good (Nina Danyo, the hot blonde girl) and the dialog in the second half is just plain bad (Misha Galian, the gay girl). After the film finished, the girl tries to force him to kiss her and he tells her it's not OK. Then she starts to cry and it's one of the worst things he can do in a film.  This movie is so bad it can't be taken seriously. It has the same problem as all the films made in the mid 90's. You have to believe me and other films, films are all good.  You will want to see this movie if it is to be rated more than as an 8, and even then it is so badly timed and poorly written, it has a long time to go through, and you should expect more of a sequel of this one than a sequel to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first scene, the first part of the movie begins with a black person walking down the stairs. But this is the first time we have seen them, which actually begins with them walking out the next morning. If you have to believe this movie is a true documentary, then you might even lose your faith in humanity because you are being persuaded that the actors do not have to do any of the things they do. It's all done in the spirit of the story, and that's a problem. This movie was made to be somewhat realistic, but it could not make it a realistic documentary. It just seems to be making everything up. There is absolutely nothing true in the story. The story is mostly made up of a fantasy that surrounds a real life situation that has never happened in history. It never made sense, and the acting is too low budget. If the actors want to be truthful, then they should have to be honest and serious about it.   This movie contains so much bad writing, and it is only OK to say that it contains a few good things. However, it could have been better to simply make a movie with a real cast of real actors. That would have been much more entertaining.  The ending is fairly pretentious and stupid. In the end, when a black woman walks in to a dark place with the first person alive in the movie, she is shocked by her new friend. This is in the very beginning of the film, but that scene never happened. The next day, she finds out that it has never been that way, and she decides that if it was real then it would be more exciting. She then goes in to see her friend, who is the person who made the elevator switch. She is the real person to the person to whom the first film opens. She tells her that when the black person was killed, she was never a black man, which caused her to feel sorry about her. It is in another place, a place in the film where there is a real explanation of how the story ends. This ending is so far from reality that it makes no sense and it leaves you feeling sad for the person in the last scene. Even worse. If there was a story, the ending would not have made you care about the main character. The main character is just one that is a complete waste of time, and very boring. The ending of this movie doesn't quite match up with the excellent storyline of the first movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know about movies. I have seen the original, but I've never seen this one. I've even been interested in it, but even when it was in my mind I thought there was more to it than what I saw. I did not think I was watching this film anymore, so I wasted the time, and watched. But it is not even a bad one. The story is terrible, but the worst part is that the acting is so bad. I can't believe people can be so stupid. When I saw the original I thought the characters were good, but when they're in this film it's just as stupid. And I think the actor, which I liked, is a terrible actor. How can the acting be so bad? My only response was that they can do good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those so bad films that we watch because they are entertaining. If you want to sit and watch something else besides a film, then you should not watch this movie. If your only thing about the film is to enjoy it, then stay away.  If you are looking for a good film to watch, then watch "The Sand" (the remake of the original). This film is not even that good, but for the sake of the fact that it is entertaining, I can't recommend it to anybody who has nothing else to do.   For all those interested in movies about aliens, but don't have time to sit to watch a movie, this movie is not worth to be a serious film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am the biggest fan of this movie ever, and my wife has not seen it! It is truly the worst movie ever. It is so bad that if it was played in any other movie, it would never be even entertaining! I am going to recommend a decent title:  8.5/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has to be an insult to the viewers. I know the show was obviously meant to be a "shame film". There is no way this could ever be presented as a "fun" show. It's really a complete joke. What I mean is that the whole story is stupid and this show is stupid. I don't have the words "joke" in the movie so the show has to keep trying to be funny while the show's story is really boring. It really should be an idea to make fun but this show really isn't. It needs to be used for a sitcom, where it can be funny and fun to be in an enjoyable way, like a little sitcom.  I am sick of it and the writer/director doesn't care about anything and it needs to get canceled ASAP. If this show does not get canceled soon, I will not even bother about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was pretty much a waste of money, and very bad from the acting. The best part of the movie was when the actors were actually good, because we can easily see that they didn't really want to have the movie to be about "the acting". The best of the performance, though, was when we can look at the faces of each actor and say, "oh well, you guys aren't so funny!" It was very bad and the acting isn't that good. I guess it's alright to enjoy an idiot, but this movie just was terrible, and I think that's a pity. It needs a decent actor to take the show seriously. The film also failed in its portrayal of the events of the war, and the portrayal of many Japanese soldiers and POWs. I feel like the producers really didn't care about the Japanese population, and just seemed like it was all their own and the Japanese war effort.  I also felt like the whole movie wasn't that funny, because there was no comedic element and almost no real humor whatsoever.  The ending also seemed to be too slow, and too long. And there wasn't enough real tension, despite the fact that the characters were actually interesting, and seemed to have their own problems.  There really isn't much tension in the film.  If you just look at this movie as a "bad movie", it is actually pretty funny. But the sad part of this movie is that it really wasn't for anyone. This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and my only rating of the film was the good parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a story of a drug addict who's obsessed with heroin, because he's seen as the biggest drug dealer in the city, and so he becomes obsessed with the drug dealer's friends. This story could have been a movie about a drug dealer getting into drug addiction, but it turns out to be a plot about a group of men who are in search of a woman to become their drug dealer, but instead, the guys want to drug her and drug her friends.  The acting is terrible. It's a mix of bad, bad, and good scenes. There's no real story line to the movie. There are too many scenes that are too long, too many clichés, and too many moments that are just stupid. It needs a director. There is no dialogue and no real emotion in the film. The ending is totally stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand this movie.I'm not going to say that it is bad or funny, just that it's just not funny to see this movie as a sequel to a joke movie.The first part was a very good comedy in the original.I enjoyed it, but the second part was just a very bad joke that was bad.  The third part was actually pretty funny, but it was so stupid that I couldn't even make it laugh.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I've seen my first 3 movies, and 2 of them were excellent comedies. But this movie should never have been taken seriously.  It is a sad end to the entire summer, and I want to say I'm sorry for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all i understand the premise and premise of this film. This is the same kind of thing with movies like "Ghost Of The Century", and others. You have an ordinary guy, who has a house to rent, to live, to eat, and to eat... and of course, you must go to a nightclub every week to drink. In the final scene, the owner comes out with his wife and the girl he's with.  That's what I said, but you will know more from the movie.   What is this movie's worst part? I suppose it's his wife's breasts, or the girl in the film is a little too fat, and his shirt is sort of small and too tight, and those clothes really need to be washed, and they can't breathe.  Also I'm not sure if the girl has a boyfriend? And the only thing worse than her, she's not so hot for him, either.  And the weird thing is how hard it is to change and fit her new underwear. You'll know exactly what she's got if you see the trailer for this movie. That is what happens in the last scene of this movie, where she's still with her boyfriend, but he is in the club and she is completely disinterested in him, and you realize she's only interested in him and his friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand this movie... I can't understand why it's supposed to be scary when I am seeing this bad piece of film. Maybe this is what I have been used to. This movie was made for those who like action films and are so used to it that they think action is the only way to go. I don\'t see this as a horror movie but I'm glad I have one movie that was scary so badly and only once. There are a few good horror movies in this section and I recommend you try them but it\'s not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of guys playing baseball get thrown on their feet by the police at the beginning of a movie, after which we are expected to laugh at the movie. This movie really should have been put in a higher priority category. As usual, there is no idea what would be happening in this movie. The police don't care about the movie being a joke, and the guys just want to find out more about the story. The story is pretty stupid, and there is an unnecessary number of scenes with the guys. What a story this is is? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am the only person who was watching this film in 2004, and this movie just lost its ability to matter. If you're going to watch this movie, try to make sure you don't go out of your bed to get a ticket for it because this movie has that awful edge. The acting is poor and the direction is poor. I won't even bother to comment on the casting because I don't think the girls are acting at all. But if you're interested, go and rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the UK, and I thought it was rubbish. I found myself not believing the whole story. I was not convinced at all. Even the girl who seemed to be playing the lead, seemed to have had an interesting plot and some clever touches on the plot. But it wasn't convincing enough. It seemed to lose interest halfway through the film and became an overblown comedy. The movie could have been made at least 10 minutes shorter and had the time spent watching it not wasted. Some of the jokes were simply poor and childish, and some of the character performances were too dull, so poor that I did not want to watch this movie again.  What a pity. I still find it interesting and the way it is put together can still have some elements of interest, but the overall effect is very poor. It is too long to get into anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the film is a very entertaining and entertaining piece but this kind of a film just wasn't good. I'm not sure how to make this out because of the awful acting that can be easily understood from the film but other times I found myself wondering if anyone can actually make it in a movie.  I'm going to skip this movie because it's just one of many terrible movies in the history of mankind. I'd really like to make an interesting watch and find out what people were thinking when they saw this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for maybe 2 minutes and decided it was just bad. I'm still not happy with it. I hope it gets deleted by the end. I'd be interested in a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning the movie seemed to be a good film, but the end is very disappointing. The plot is unbelievable and the movie is not entertaining.  This is a bad remake of a bad horror film of the 1960's, which was created from a very bad film of horror films of the early 1970's.  In addition the fact that the director was the most enthusiastic actor of the 1980's, he made the movie so bad he's hard to watch.  It seems to be something that is only meant for young kids and children who like horror films and want to have a little fun, but it should not be used for any kind of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's just so many other movies in this year that I thought this one should be made. I'm sure I'll be the one to get bored and disgusted by it. The worst movie ever? I can honestly say this one was the worst movie I've ever seen... I give it to anyone who watches the movie to have your minds set in stone with how these people have done and made their own movies... that's what's not good. I'll try to make some positive comment about the movie: 1. The plot is really stupid. The acting isn't good. There are some good things about it, I'll let you review the movie, but I think the film's just bad. 2. The character relationships are really stupid, not very honest. The dialogue is bad, not real. The camera isn't realistic at all. There isn't any funny or good music in the movie. 3. The movie is so bad that it doesn't matter how good it is... the characters themselves are completely unimpressed. This is no way to make a laugh out of this movie, it's just pathetic, it just plain stupid. There's absolutely no funny or anything else to make it better, just a waste of time to spend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading some of the reviews about this movie, I was wondering how this would affect an audience. I decided to go to my first video store, a video store with no opening hours. That was my first choice. My girlfriend insisted that I show the movie to her because it seemed interesting to me, and also because I wanted to share the view of an African American woman. My friend was not even interested in the movie, because he was a "white boy" and we were friends.  The movie had absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. I read one of the comments and I thought that the writer might have gone too hard in making this movie. It is just about the movie that is interesting, not the film itself. I didn't like it very much, though it was good at times, but there is no redeemer in this movie and it's not funny.  There are several reviews that have been posted that state "this movie has no redeemers" while I disagree. I do not know what the author's intention was, though I do understand that most of the people who commented on the comments didn't care about the film's value. The movie is about a drug-head who wants to run around and play with a girl who has blonde hair.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have nothing positive to say about this movie. It's simply awful. It makes absolutely no sense. This is a classic example of an unnecessary sequel. The fact that it is a sequel is something that has to make the movie better. But this movie could not be better.  This movie starts on a roller coaster of badness. There's no clue that there's anything to the story.  But then it turns into a horror story and ends up a joke. The whole movie starts at a sad ending and ends by a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film about a group of teenagers who decide to have an orgy and end some men who can't survive. The problem is that, unlike a lot of other films I've seen (some really good ones, like the new "Cancer", but this one was... a really poor film), it had one really good idea.  It was also pretty stupid, but what I was concerned about was that it failed to take a really deep thought.  The film is full of clichés, nudity and no real plot. If you like nudity and sex, you might find this film not too scary. If the film wasn't so bad, I probably would give it a 4, but in its current state, it just seems to take off like a balloon as soon as you see the film.   If this film gets the low ratings, I don't think it could be rated much higher. It has little room to make it worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad version of a bad horror film. It's painfully obvious that people who are in the film are having nightmares, but the movie never explains how the film has managed to make a decent horror film out of it. In the beginning it shows two women talking to the others in a house. Then they stop talking and start fighting. The story starts off right but then the women start fighting and moving their arms around. It is also hard to believe that someone that is not a woman, or a family member is in the house with them. It just goes down the most obvious and obvious way to start a horror film ever, but that is only one example. The film starts out okay but the ending is absolutely stupid, like an attempt at creating a scare film about killing a lot of people. I would think it's too early to start watching it so the film never comes out and I think the producers need to take some of the credit for having created an original film that could survive. The main reason for this disaster is the lack of a script and too weak on the actors. And the music also lacks the power and sound that makes it such a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, it was predictable and predictable - i have seen this movie countless times and decided that it was disappointing. I really didn't want to see this one - it just looked bad and predictable...it seemed like it's just another Hollywood movie from the 1990's.  I was surprised that the producer made it so hard to avoid, and even made me feel good after watching it.  My initial reaction was, "Who does this?" - "I don't want it." - "Yeah, I didn't care for the movie, but I didn to see the acting - it was bad.  But, as time passed, it kept getting worse and worse. The director decided that he was finally bored of the movie and had decided to make it much worse. Some of the jokes in the movie were interesting, but not funny; and some of the characters were stupid.  It just kept getting stranger - like a bunch of fake cars (like "Road Runner") and "A Dog's Revenge". At times, I had to laugh because I had been laughing for many years, but the movie got worse.  The soundtrack, and the music, didn't really help. I was hoping for a good soundtrack, but there wasn't one - the song is pretty damn awful. Some were funny, but it just got in the way. I didn`t feel much better after watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible, un-creductioned film about a family of people who refuse to follow the rules of the town. It starts with the mother, daughter and daughter who are so badly off their asses that they won't even try to live like normal people. Then there's the grandmother, father and mother who want to have sex with their daughter. Then the three grown children get drunk. And there is some music mixed in. But the movie fails in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was bad. I am sure the producers did good when they came out with good scripts. Unfortunately the script is bad and there is absolutely no story. It was disappointing seeing a film that contains almost no story line. The way the dialog in the film is presented is poor. I find this film to be awful. It must be canceled. I would watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of movies, and movies made in France are very good. They're not nearly as well as those made in US. The French movies, however, don't quite come close to those made here in the US, but they've made an entire series of films which look so bad they're probably just an insult to me.  I can only guess what happened. There must have been a big shift from Hollywood studios into France. French movies are all about the same level as the Hollywood movies here, although there are exceptions like "Les Mauds", which I can't find out how it's been a success.  There is nothing to say about this series. I only give it one point, the first being the film which has already been seen by the American press, and it would be nice to have a copy of it, which I haven't seen. It's not good. I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen, ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst one I have seen since I was 17. I mean it could have made a pretty good movie. And it's not so much the gore, but that is how I interpret it. I've never seen a movie this bad before! The acting is terrible. The acting really isn't, that's the only good thing about the movie. I'm not really sure why the writer wrote this movie, I mean he wrote a series of three movies: The first was about a group of drunken fools that killed one of their friends, the second one was about an abusive drunk who kills the other of their group and the third was about those who tried to commit robbery, and the fourth movie was about rape. The characters are pathetic, they're not even interesting, they just don't seem to have a clue. There are no good jokes, no characters. The whole thing is so bad, I have to listen to this movie to get the joy out of watching the movie again. If you have nothing good to say about the film, watch it for one night, and you'll be sad to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can tell you the film was awful. It's really unbelievable how someone could be so crazy. Also my favorite director was the original one and this one. I have to see the original. I wish I could remember what it was before the sequel. Also I've seen a few of those crazy comments mentioning "unrealistic" the original "Dirty Water" was. And the sequel (Dirty water) was about a few scenes of the same. The new version (dirty water is not a new film) is about a cop (Alaine Gifford) chasing a drug (Gustin Ronde) in a deserted beach. But they just get a chase where it could take down all the people he is chasing. No one does justice on this movie.  I really don't like this movie though it is funny to say a bad film. I think it is really sad since it was a one of the worst comedies in existence. I really thought it was way too mean to be a sequel. The funny guy did well in the original and is just going on his second movie for more money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because it looked interesting. However, the plot is pretty weak and the story has no real meaning. The plot is a fairly typical revenge fantasy story with the same twist of "A Man That Could Have It! A Man That Wanted It!". What made this movie a real disappointment is the fact that there wasn't a decent plot and the ending is weak. A couple of minutes of gore from a guy wearing a mask and a woman who we'd thought was a real person. The actors are simply bad, acting was poor, and the soundtrack was really poor. I didn't like this movie after seeing it and it wasn't even really enjoyable to see.  Overall, the movie was not only a bad remake but pretty stupid and bad as well. The story could have been better. If you'd like to see a movie that tries to be "cool" instead of the stereotypical revenge fantasy, watch Revenge 2 and watch this movie and your money will go up. If i could have taken this movie from release the same day, I would have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An interesting thing. This is the only reason I am ever interested in this movie. I found that the acting is bad and the dialog is pretty stupid. But hey, it's only a few minutes of the film, don't let it fool you! If you watch it for that reason alone you'll get a good laugh. But you just don't get it. I recommend skipping this movie unless you get a copy of the DVD. If you want to read this movie, don the second and third time. Don't buy this movie if you want a good story and enjoy the acting. But don't buy a copy if you can get a decent movie of some other movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the show (on a TV channel, actually) and not getting any closure, I think I would agree that this was probably the worst movie I had seen in my life. I understand people have seen a lot of terrible movies from the likes of "House Of Cards" and "Beverly House". But I cannot believe this is the worst film I ever saw. I find the premise to be quite absurd. I've seen two episodes of "The Walking Dead" and I am sure this movie was bad enough for that show to be made. And I'm also aware of the history of the show and the fact that the pilot was also made when the show was released. This is truly a complete, unfathomable mess. There are so many stupid things that occur throughout the film, and this movie is full of unnecessary and pointless subplot and pointless filler scenes. There is absolutely no explanation of the plot; the characters are completely oblivious of everything.  I am sad to have wasted my time on this bad movie. I would recommend a DVD copy of the movie to anyone who is interested in this sort of crap. I don't know why the pilot didn't have this DVD, but I understand that it was probably meant to be released in theaters anyway. It was released on the very cheap cable channel which was being sold for $2.99. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be a funny piece of entertainment for the year. However the film proves to be too long and too long. This movie also needs a voice cast of celebrities who are not well known. Also the movie fails to make any good story. The plot of the movie is very weak, and if anything bad happens to a character (not just to a specific character) it should be the character's fault. The cinematography of the film is poor and mediocre. The film has nothing decent to offer. The movie is not funny, but rather annoying. It would make a good movie but only at this point it fails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry for this movie. It really does not seem like a serious film at all... I can't understand why this is considered a film, because I actually think it would be a comedy. The characters are boring and the storyline is not worth. I don't know why it has been released in the year when they should start making movies again. I just wish they could make a better film than these ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it was easily the worst version of the series ever made. The series is about people in the world who are insane and crazy, that have to be saved. The people who are in this movie have to kill them, kill them all, kill themselves. The world is full of bad people in this world and they need saving from the bad people. People in this earth world have a number of rules to help people, which they follow as they go along. The most egregious and disgusting aspect of this film is the fact that the people who survive the final battle are killed or killed in the next morning. I would have been embarrassed if I watched this film again and not watched it. I have seen this movie twice, but I do not plan to go out and see the sequel. The show is not up to the best of all time in the series. It has a few things, and a few minor parts of the show do make it seem interesting, but it is just not good. It is not worth a second watch, and even better off to be an extended version of this series of films. I do feel sorry to watch it and I feel sorry for the people that watch it. They had some good moments in the earlier episodes of the films and they made good ones. The problem here is that they just wanted to fill up a large time frame with the plot. The ending leaves out a lot of things that could have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that wants to be the same for the other movies, but it has to go through the usual method of making a plot out. The film starts out with an idea that the world is controlled by one person, and that they need a few people who will use money to keep it afloat. That is done, and the person in power is called "George Clooney" or "Mr. Clooney", and the two of them meet and discuss how to get the rest of the movie.  In this story the person who is in control of the world has money, and wants to keep all of his assets, and in exchange for money, people with money (or have a big job, and want to earn the money in a job) will keep this "money" in the world. The two who want to keep the money are two people who are in control, or "power" people. So, Clooney and his friends want to be in control and help these people by taking their money away from the world, and thus get the money back to the world and try to keep this from taking away from them. They don't even bother about having a job, as the people who have the power want to get everyone's assets back to get their jobs, but just to keep everyone's money in their hands. Also, the "power' people keep the wealth on their hands so they can use their money to run away from "the humans" and get the upper hand in the game. After they win their jobs and get jobs again, they realize that there is a lot of money in the "money store" where they can earn money for people to put in as they are paid for. So these two guys are using their money for this reason, but are apparently just using it for "the very thing" (as in getting to an auction) they need for the "people who have money and need to put it in a "bank".  There is a very, very, extremely stupid premise. And I don't know why anyone would ever care about this movie. I just think I had a lot to do with the fact that this movie had one good movie. That's not a very good movie, but still at least I get the feeling that this is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and even has the name for a good one. I get sad just seeing the plot.  And for a film in which
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a piece of garbage from the 70's - it was released during the late 70's. The video was released in 1969 so it is not an original production but like many other films it was recycled from the 1930's film world, it was made at the same time, so it was only used for the same movie.  It also seems like they think that the main character is not a true movie hero but his career is not about a real hero, it is about the main characters and not a real life hero. In the beginning the main male actor is a hard man, very stoeless and very quiet, not very glamorous, the woman and child are only two, but nothing makes this movie stand out like a classic Hollywood star like Anthony Mundone or Fred MacMurray.  But the other two women (the woman and daughter) are about the worst, boring and not as good as the two male heroes and it is hard to watch these women act like heroes. They also get involved in a bad drug and sex scene with an ugly woman who is having fun.  The best part of this movie is when a guy named George Dungel(The actor), shoots a guy with a shotgun in the woods in revenge. It is then the woman's husband is waiting to get to meet George Dangel and he is clearly ready for the shoot-up, and you would not be surprised if you saw one of the actors wearing a suit and boots. This movie is also bad for the movie but the only good parts were the end of the film, the ending and the end credits.  I was surprised that the film is not still alive, but I heard that this movie was released about 3 times (more or less) and now they have made it a DVD to bring it to the market. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad it had to be made into one of the most excruciatingly boring films I've seen in a few years. I found myself asking why it even got made. I've not seen any of the film so far and I've worked so hard to watch it again. Even as I watched the film it was clear that there was no substance to this movie. The story is completely pointless. I could understand a little of the plot but it was simply not interesting enough to warrant my spending much time on it. The best part of the movie is simply having to sit through an entire 'joke' and try to get through the movie without laughing. If you like horror movies, this is not worth of your time. If that is your interest, I recommend a movie that isn't worth of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't like this movie, but the only way it can get under my mind, this is it. I would recommend avoiding it for any time, but there are some scenes that really stand out. I think it has something that is so sad and so lacking in character development, and I just want to believe that it was a mistake on their part. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say the thing. But I also want to say there are few interesting plotlines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not a "great" film, in any way. However, it was entertaining. I'd like to think that the people who made this film, should have read some of the other writings, movies, or magazines, so that they would have seen some of these. I don't know why this is made so bad, nor do I believe it to be a bad film, but it really isn't worth watching, it is pointless, and the characters are not believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end, there is little hope to stick around this film. The plot is very weak and the acting is really bad, there are no good performances, no good writing, no real characterizations and it just doesn't matter. You can feel sorry about this and you will, but it is a hard task to forgive. Don't miss the great moments from the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the future, I'm gonna try this one. I will watch it with all the others, and I will walk away from it.  But the one I like more, and that I have always remembered is the 1990 film, "The Ours Of Terriers". It looks like it has been run again, and the acting is far worse than any other film ever made. It is not a good film, though, and is quite pathetic.  It is about a family that turns into vampires and they engage in "vampire wars" for a few hours, but before that is done, it is so bad it seems like a movie about a child, and it is about this child that is turned into a vampire.  The film is about the same as it was in the movie, "Bung!". In the new one, the vampire, "Luka" is a child. The girl who is played by Kristen Stewart, has to be brought out of the room to take his "vampiness" to a child who is going to come home and try to teach a boy about what a vampire does, and who is also involved in this. The vampire's mother is the only person involved in the vampire's plan to win her daughter's soul, and she wants to be her daughter. So, the father is going off to his girlfriend and tries to convince the girl not to follow through, but the girl keeps talking about making a vampire and killing her family. In the meantime, the family decides to go to a vampire factory, and with a bunch of bloodsuckers, they get to a room and everyone is sent in for the blood transfusion to the girl's vampire. As soon as the vampire is in the room, the kid is killed and the vampire tries to get revenge for the child's family. The other vampire is killed by the bloodsucker, then gets to life and kills everyone involved with them.  Also, the vampires are actually monsters, not ghosts. So if you want to see a vampire, make sure your vampire is a ghost first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is that it's still good to watch. The whole thing could be made funnier. The idea of creating a horror movie seems silly. I was hoping the movie would have some good ideas that were the result of what you'd already seen. Unfortunately, that's not the case. There is absolutely no good comedy for this movie. I am honestly surprised that the writer is a fan of "Silence" and he's obviously a writer of horror. But the premise is too cheap and there is no good way to be funny in a horror story. If you are a fan like me and you've watched this movie for 4 hours, I'd advise you to watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I must confess, I saw this movie a while back when I was watching it. And I thought the movie was pretty good. A young male actor goes up on stage to sing the song that was the theme of the movie. He is very handsome, has an interesting job, and has not really done much since his debut. Unfortunately, he has a rather shallow voice. There is no variety in his performances. And the ending is extremely predictable and predictable. Afterward I was a bit depressed. I mean, if you want to see a really good movie, you'll probably have to watch this one first.  I hope someone at some movie site will take this off the shelf and try to rescue it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this film on a video tape years ago, and I still have nightmares. I am sure there are some people out there who would love this film. I won't give them credit, but you'll understand what my comments are.  The script was a bit confusing - a bit too long, I guess I would not get my bearings, and the pace of the script seemed to drag on. I guess most of the time I sat in the theater, I just stared at the screen, hoping that it would go down the way that it did. I can't tell if this movie was for or against my father, but I would hate to have this story taken out of it - with the guy who was a real firefighter - the way the story is structured, and it really did not make sense, especially the way it was structured, especially in a way that I saw it coming and went. I couldn't even tell if a fire was going to burn or was going a little bit, the way this story went - with some little girl trying to save a bunch of people from the burning house and the way something went. The whole "chosen" theme of the story was simply an effort to get me out to feel sorry about my dad, in my mind, and to get the "happiness" out of me. And I guess it worked.  As for me, I think it was supposed to be a comedy of sorts - but just the other way. It was sad to see the story of the fire - with everyone who knew what was going on were just what I had come across in the tape. The only time I had laughed were when they were going to the bathroom where they had a bathroom and I had to sit in an elevator. When they were leaving the bathroom, I didn't get a response - a lot of them didn't even come out of the bathroom and, on top of that, I couldn of course, smell the smoke that was coming out of a house. I laughed a bit, but that's OK. The film felt a bit slow, especially since it was going for so long and seemed to be about one hour, as opposed to one-to-a-the-time movies, and then all you would have to wait for the fire to burn. As for being a "hater", I felt more like the idea of it all in my head - I didnThe funny comments the movie had about the woman who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't like this movie, but I'm surprised by how ridiculous it is. It's full of the typical Hollywood clichés that we expect of a film from a Hollywood director (the "plot is just a little too obvious, and the acting and acting are pretty poor, too. But that's the movie's main strength, and is the movie itself). This movie just makes you sick and angry, because it just makes us bored and uncomfortable. And you've got to find out to spend $4.95 on DVDs and even go to the movie clubs to watch it. I can't wait to go back to the original, but sadly I'll probably never find out what it was like when I first saw it. The only good thing about the movie was the song. But the movie made it so bad when it was released that I had to sit in the movie theater for a long time before I could watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it's first aired on a special channel, I was skeptical about the acting. The best way I can see to compare it to a bad film is the way the plot and acting are portrayed.  I have seen this film several times in the past and they all get tired by the same kind of acting. I have done quite a lot of bad films myself and I don't like it very often, but it isn't as bad as those others who think it is a good film. I donuts of other bad movies and I find these actors in other movies. This is not a movie worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an unoriginal piece of work; it lacks the realism of modern movies, and it really should have been made as a feature film rather than as a series of bad films. In fact, it has just one truly predictable element: a middle aged, divorced woman who is pregnant. Although she is a woman, she has no other job, and she has little interest in the men in the movie. There is no way to relate to this woman's life outside of the movie, and this movie doesn't have any strong or lasting themes. But what happens with this film is that it is all in the beginning too predictable. This film starts off with some good ideas, but those are overshadowed by too predictable characters. The whole thing is just bad, and at least I didn't realize that until watching it. I have been told this movie is so low-budget, but now I'm glad it was that. I just wish it was a series so bad that I hadn't even seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First the "I'm an actress" - the plot was very unsatisfying, the acting was bad and the script was a bore.  Then, as everyone I heard about this movie, the director and his co-producers seemed to take a positive approach to what could be a really interesting film, I thought. So I was surprised when they chose to release this one. I wasn't surprised because I just wanted to see a film to get me to understand that Hollywood has a lot of problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I've been reading this book for weeks now, and the movie is truly disappointing. The characters are interesting and the acting is...not interesting. The main storyline is unbelievable and the ending is unbelievable. The story is not about the characters and their quest for revenge; it's about the events that happen to them. I have to laugh at the ending that the characters are never shown again, or at the end, after they are shown again. Also, the ending of the movie was unbelievably stupid. I felt it to be a "clump of old film" that could only be put in a "film" category.  This movie does not inspire anyone to follow the story further, and it is obviously not about a good movie. It is a disgrace to a lot of people who have read the book and are willing to buy it. I cannot recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd be happy to read some other reviews from the other comments, and I think I can agree with some of them. I'm not sure if the film was actually an anti-war movie, though I've heard people suggest that this is. Maybe, and it could be an anti "war movie", but I think that would make me crazy. I think it's way too short and there aren't enough dialog. In addition to this, the acting is really terrible, and the ending is very boring. The acting is just bad, even when there are a few parts that really have some of the drama and character development. I don't think it is even a sequel to The Fall, although it looks like it was in that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not an exact person nor do I know the specific details. However I did like the way the actors were talking about a child, because I was a teenager. They don't like children, they don't take care of them, they have an attitude. The movie was simply the way to ruin this. I think this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's just not funny and there's a lot of bad language. It's just awful. I can't even recommend this movie to anyone. I know what it was for, and I was not in for the whole time I watched it, but I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. I enjoyed the fact that they were making a sequel movie, one of my favourites from this movie was "I Love You". I was looking for my friend who had never seen this movie and wanted to see it. He thought the movie was so bad that it was about the same as the original movie. He liked the fact they made a sequel so much. He loved the fact he and I had not even watched the original until this movie's out. I wish this movie had to be scrapped, and I wish it had to come back again. I'm a huge fan of the original, but if you were thinking about this movie you should be prepared to watch this movie again, as I said.  I was really upset that they made it. They really made a terrible sequel. And I only wish it could have ended in one way, just like the original. They made a bad sequel, and it's just one of the things that has done in the last 15 years or so of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing the show and what was it like at the time. I remember the first episode of the show was pretty funny, if you ask me. There was little dialog for a good laugh and a lot of "this is dumb" stuff. It was about the worst thing I've seen since my parents laughed at the show. It's not funny, it's just stupid.  I found this episode when watching it in the theater and I laughed when I watched it. I know it's not a true story but it really wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An action thriller that could have been so good if it had been a decent remake of the classic, simply because it would have been much funnier. I was hoping that the book, which had been used in a short story collection in the late 1940s, could take the movie to the height of the book without the need for a new set of characters. Instead, this was a poor version of the plot, with too many holes and inconsistencies. In fact, it has several moments in a sequence that are supposed to be one long. The movie could have ended in one section, but the characters didn't even get the chance to get out. I found myself thinking that this movie was a parody of the novel, and it would really be an enjoyable copy of a book to read for a few hours, but instead it became a complete disappointment. This film simply didn't stand for the movie it supposedly was supposed to have a chance to stand for itself. The plot is very bad and it is a disappointment because there is no tension in the ending. The film also contains a really terrible acting, that is probably due to the fact that at least one of the actors was familiar to the book's original writers and, to be honest. If I had never read the book myself, I would never have noticed that they were only slightly competent actors, rather than the other ones that made the book interesting. The book is not only a book of bad fantasy, but there is also an awful and disappointing story that has been reworked again. I wish a story was more interesting than the one it attempts to create.  I don't expect you to rate it. The only good thing about this movie is that it's still interesting to look at. It would have done well as a short film to have some laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this on the video store when I got home in January, 2004. I can barely remember it. I had to have an idea of what the plot was all about because it seemed so silly, but I was a little bit scared from the beginning. It wasn't funny to anyone. It was so sad it reminded me of those stupid movies I've seen so much in the last 15 years. This movie wasn't even a "funny" film. What happened to it when I saw it?  The first movie I rented was "Honey Baby" which was so funny and funny, but even in that movie, the jokes weren't funny.  I really liked "Beetles" from "The One The Big Gang" which is a more light-hearted version of the story. The "Beets" movie was only about two guys, and that wasn't as funny as "Beeting". This movie is just about as horrible as the first one, and even with the lighter laughs it still does seem stupid. But that's alright, because the writers and directors of this movie are good. The characters are just not funny, they just boring and the jokes are only a bit annoying. The jokes aren't funny either. It's hard to find the jokes in the movies, because they are often made so funny, and they aren't made for anyone, they are just an obvious joke. The people on the screen were just totally boring, just plain and unfunny.  This movie was bad, and I would never see it again. If you enjoy stupid movies, don't rent it, just because it has an interesting plot and some good comedy. It is a bad film, and it's not funny. The plot is just so bad, I'm sorry I actually gave it so much money because I didn't really think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's not good. If there's one point I'd like to make about this film, it's that they had a couple of plot points that were somewhat predictable, and there were some pretty ugly images, that were hard to watch and were very disturbing. Also, what the hell were they to do to edit the film. Some of the other points were kinda predictable, but the main issue with this film is that the dialog was weak, and the acting wasn't good, too. A couple of dialog lines were pretty good, but I'm sure there were a lot of other jokes that had the same "cuteness" feel to them that didn't. But hey, I'm probably wrong about most of the jokes, but if you're interested in watching this movie, you'll probably just have to watch it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a terrible movie. What a concept to produce this kind of movie. I'm surprised that this is so popular in the states that run this movie. Even in Idaho where the movie never aired, its rated 7. If a kid could take it in and be cool, they should get an "F" for the movie. The way the plot is presented in the book makes the book look unappetable. I had to listen the songs. Some of the songs are just awful, so bad that if you listen them, you'll be off for the next few weeks. But i know that's not true, they are good, but what about all those songs? You want to hear some funny songs like the "Disco song" or the "Empire song" etc etc etc, but they just don't. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who has any interest in the movie at all. The best I could say is that the characters are just boring and there are no action sequences. The movie is really bad for adults who enjoy an enjoyable movie, but the movie could get them into the character-formation aspect of the book. I recommend only a "regular" DVD of the movie so that people can see what is truly bad and what's not really fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really upset with this movie. It had a really terrible storyline and I couldn't even read the characters. It could have made me vomit. This movie could have been better if it had a decent director. The only good thing about the movie was the art-related scenes. The artwork and the art just weren't good enough to make the movie truly enjoyable. It should be a movie about a family movie about people who were trying to kill each other's lives. I think it would have been a better film if it could have gotten better acting. It's just stupid.  It was also kind of a long story. The ending is really annoying and the ending really sucks! But it doesn't need to end like this. It was obviously a complete waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I understand it, this is the most annoying thing I've seen since the last summer. But I still have to sit through the ending to avoid the fact that this movie was one of the worst things I've ever seen (not even after seeing the original and the sequel.) I hope that the producer has the forethought that they are about to lose some money and to try to make some good movies. But even so, I can't say that was a great movie. And it never really started off with a good opening or story. It's a story that drags on a line that seems to be stuck somewhere. The dialogue is also not good, and the pace doesn't do much with the fact we're wasting our time. And the supporting characters are not so interesting as I expected them to be. All in all, I don't think this movie will make anyone happier. I have seen better movies. They still are better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a movie where the only thing that should be done is "Don't miss the final shot" to get a little bit of closure. I mean, who was the person who gave the clue to "Don not miss the last shot" on the movie? What was the clue?  This is a movie that made no sense whatsoever. That's all you need to know.  So if you want to get any laughs out of this movie, don't watch it, donít pay for it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and my husband tried to watch it and give me a thumbs up. This movie is a complete failure. The story line is so bad that I didn't even mind that it was supposed to be about a zombie virus. The plot is so lacking, it is very bad, the acting was very bad and there were no realistic dialogue. I couldn't even see the acting in this film, it was so bad I just got annoyed! I just hope this movie has the writer and directors of the film to fix this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad film that has the worst ending. The movie doesn't allow you to understand anything about the story and it makes you believe in the worst possible scenario. Also it takes advantage of a great acting that was good earlier in the first 60 minutes. Don't even get me started on the story. The acting is not good enough. There is no suspense, no suspense is needed and there is no emotion. If you don't have any idea what happened, then you'll understand what just happened. If this movie was made for a TV series, they should've known better. But it was made just for a movie with no money and no money is needed. So, don't watch this unless you're in the mood for a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really sick of this film, because I felt it had a very sick ending, and I have to say that if this has any potential to make me watch it, it's a waste of time. There is no way for me to understand the end. It has a really low plot, and the acting has no real meaning or purpose, which really takes away from the movie's appeal and effectiveness. It is also stupid, and a complete waste of money that I would never spend on another one of these movies. I really didn't recommend this movie, but the only thing it has done is give me an idea to try my own copy of it. The first time I saw it I was very disappointed. I'm sorry, but it's pretty obvious that it was the movie where I was sick of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie and was very troubled by the ending. I can't find out why this movie was not released for the TV show and the fact that this was not to go into production. What a waste of money, I'll tell you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to laugh for the plot, but that's only the third of a full review. The story is about a young man, his life is about to be over and his father is trying to kill him because he wants to inherit his father's mansion so he starts killing everyone who wants to help him in his life. He has a bunch of super powers and the girl he is in love with is pregnant. When he gets to work he finds he's in an apartment on an empty block and he doesn't have a car.  In the apartment he meets a prostitute who he is told to get him to a prostitute in order to get money for him. The girl is a drug addict who gives him money to the prostitute who in turn gives him a new lease for a place to stay and they decide to go back to that prostitute's life. After the prostitute comes to her father's house he tries to make sure he's dead so he gets the girl to a bath with him and is in the bath together. Then he gets on the wrong couch and is attacked by another thug and is killed by a woman who's angry with him for trying to be his friend and the sex worker.  It's not only terrible because there's no real character development at all. In the first scene the girl tells the father, he's a drunk guy who has lost his girlfriend and he wants money and his family so it's good to have his family, especially because the mother is having problems with the heroin addict.  So he puts her in a bathtub and she hands him some money for the bath. He doesn't want her to do anything with the woman so he goes and has sex with her. He's killed by the heroin dealer and his body gets torn apart by his friends. Then the guy and the woman go back together and the two of them discuss how she is a prostitute and they are working together.  He tries to use the money he had to pay to his dad to get some money and send some money to her dad and he does it. I've seen this girl so many times since she was murdered by her family and the first time I had to watch it I just laughed that he's trying to make money.  Then one time I stopped watching and didn't even bother watching it. The next day I saw it again. It starts off like a soap movie that got mixed up with a soap opera. There's no plot and the story is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave it one shot in half an hour. There were no music at all. The acting was poor. The dialogs were not the best. The direction was bad and the sound effects were poor. I give this movie a poor rating in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I found the plot very odd. It has to be made in a country where the people do not think the police are that good. I am going to tell you that I am a law enforcement officer, but don't tell me that the police officers are that GOOD!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In "The Last American Movie:  I'd like to take this movie off to find a good movie: this movie is not so bad, but in the end it just turns into a joke that is totally unpubble. The premise is about a small town with many American small towns...and the town's inhabitants want to make the town a place to avoid getting into trouble. So the townspeers are able to get a bigger place by selling the town to the town, so they buy it and build the wall that keeps the town from being an annoyance. Unfortunately, the town leader tries to convince a member of the town that his town has turned into a war zone, and he has to hide the town...but then he goes to work and says he can afford the wall to the next town he builds! The other guy is stuck in his town, and if his wife doesn't go along with it, she will see him killed. The people in the town don't know his wife and want to leave, but that does not matter, as the town is run by a family that wants to become its leader.  The rest of the film is about the town and its inhabitants trying to resist having them removed...and its a really pathetic ending that is hard to find.  It just becomes a little too long after the end and I can't find out what happens next. I recommend a quick review of one bad movie because it's a very poor movie that doesn't care if anyone sees it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think of the cast of each movie - i think they were just a pair of old-fashioned actors. i can see why they made this movie - nothing in the plot was anything original.  The main point of the film was its anti-social mentality of the group. i think the members were the old friends of these guys. i don't think that was a good way to ruin the group - the characters were the two main characters. but this movie could just make you lose the interest in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is about how the government had all the people at a hotel that were on their knees, with their legs in their hands and they were screaming and kicking off their shoes. The premise doesn't matter and the characters are flat-scored. The acting was horrible and the whole thing is badly staged, with the music and the soundtrack that is a complete mismatch with the songs.  The storyline is so badly constructed, and the ending didn't make much sense, and there's no real payoff. The characters are stupid and there were no real suspense to the end. I guess the director really didn't want to go straight to a movie. I think the writer made a mistake and they got a poor review about how bad this movie was. The ending was simply too hard to believe that they were able to actually make it. They just didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie fails to achieve any sort of seriousness whatsoever.  The best way to say this is, that it was an attempt to scare us into thinking the movie would be scary.  It was obviously an attempt at making the movie scary. I can't even tell if the makers intended to be scary or if they intended to make a scary movie. The acting is weak, there are no funny lines in it, and the cinematography isn't good.  I cannot even begin to compare this movie to the classic classic horror films of the early 1980's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie very disappointing. I could have gotten bored or bored watching it. But it wasn't bad. And it doesn't give me any satisfaction seeing a bad film. And the first time I saw it, I thought it was funny. So, I watched it and then saw it again.  When I re-read it, again, I was surprised that I liked the movie. I thought the actor was good in it. In fact, the movie itself seemed pretty interesting, but not so funny. The acting was poor, and the acting seemed weak. And I think that they wanted to capitalize on a bad picture: a couple of bad actors. I mean, the actress, as I mentioned, was pretty good.  But, she didn't act to give the characters any character development. The storyline was pretty dull and slow, but never really progressed. The actors were simply stupid. The whole thing seems like they wanted you to hate them. And there were a couple moments in the movie that were uncomfortable. I was afraid. I wasn't prepared for this movie to be enjoyed. I just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie is very weak. It's not enough to scare the viewer, because this movie really falls to be a cheap horror-film, and not a real horror film at all.  I'm not a horror film specialist, but I watched one movie and was very confused, like I said earlier, this movie was just a horror movie that didn't have a plot or a storyline. It also had an average budget and a pretty dull plot, and the acting was bad, and there were also some annoying character actors (like, Jumbo, which could act as a comedic role, or the bad acting of the whole "The Dark Eye Killer" movie.)  It was probably one of the lowest rated horror films of the year, though I've been reading a few horror movies, so I didn't expect to be one of "Top 10" horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd prefer to be in the desert with a shotgun and an AK. There should be a place for a different story. They should be in a remote desert somewhere. I don't think this movie is even a fun idea but it does have some interesting moments. However, I feel it should be an action thriller. I feel the ending is a joke. There are no good scenes in the movie. The cinematography was horrible, at times boring and slow. I think the director was hoping to make a movie that would turn out like this but instead, he created a piece of low-budget horror that is just as boring as the first one. The plot is so predictable that you can't believe the director. I have the impression that this movie will probably be a horror film that isn't actually funny or a comedy. I didn't notice anything funny or funny but what I did find interesting were the fact that the actors in this movie were so bad, so bad that they were embarrassed to be on-screen with the actors. The acting was not bad at all and there were some interesting interactions. The music was OK but I think that the songs were too loud and hard to listen to. This movie really needs to be a comedy at least. I know there are some good actors in it but why can they all become a comedy? The actors didn't do anything except that they seemed to have been working on the script. I was very tired of this movie and I was never actually interested.  I give this movie two stars out of 10 because I really liked the acting and I liked the songs but after I made it through two times, I thought that the acting was bad. I do feel that if it's a comedy, the film is going to suck to hell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been looking at this movie for almost 2 hours and finally decided I'd like to rent it, and while doing that I found some interesting comments about it. I have seen some of the comments and then I was stuck and I decided not to rent this movie. I guess it was an expensive movie, I guess if you want to rent something cheap you'll have to pay the $1.00 to get a copy. It was the only movie i've ever rent on my way to find out that sucked me off in the movie theater.  The only thing you get in the end is a crappy ending, no acting and no storyline. The script is a bit pretentious, and there is no interesting story lines to go into.  I gave this movie 2/5 stars, because it is about as boring as a movie could possibly get.  It is also an example of a major Hollywood failure that just don't take it seriously. If you really want to get into this, don't rent this, get it in the video store, rent it for the time, rent the movie at a local video shop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad comedy with bad acting and the music that sounds terrible. It is like a bunch of old movie posters. The plot is bad, too shallow, the characters are not interesting and the acting is bad. The acting is not good, the humor is not funny and the soundtrack is very annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this movie, your heart will start pounding when you read this review. The ending is painfully boring and there are no real characters.  Even worse than an unplayable, over-the-twowingly over-written teen-movie with no real plot and very unoriginal ending, I would recommend this movie for a few hours of time and then rent it again. But if you are expecting a good movie, do not watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not surprised, though I didn't expect such a low grade comedy. I figured out who the people were and what they were doing as soon as I read the reviews online.  As expected, I thought this was the worst film I've ever seen. I did a few things with the plot, but the other part of it was a weak attempt at drama. The only thing that was interesting was the fact that it had "the girl" (who I'd considered a good actress) in the pilot (a girl who had been an actual girlfriend of the lead actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What i have to say, i find this movie to be the worst horror film ever. And there is not much that it is scary, but it has some interesting spots. And the main issue that makes the movie fail is that this movie has no good scares. If you watch this movie for a good reason, don't waste money on it. If it's for me and my son, please don't give it to anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be so badly edited and so much awful. I would recommend this to anyone interested of having a look at it but I do not. I've been looking to see the other great film in which the "plot" is really a short cut to a long extended version of a story. I can't find it in any other way, and if I were to see this movie again, I would expect that this is the same thing as the other version of "Caitus". If you were a fan of the previous "Catch Me Free" film, you'd probably find it much better than this one, because it has so much more action.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad! It's not even a mystery to be funny, but it's pretty bad. A lot of stuff is pretty bad, but the one thing that's good is the scene where the kids are playing tag games. Of course, the problem is that none of them are acting properly, so they're not actually good at acting. Also, they keep talking to their friends and friends.  The kids get away from their friends when they are in trouble, and leave them alone when they get a good chance to escape from the bad prison.  They meet some other gang members and then take over their friends, and then fight over the fact that their gangmates have been locked in their jail.  Then they decide to leave their gang, and it's only after they give the reason. Now, a new gang members is put in the prison, and they have a great deal to gain and their plan is to capture their gang mates to get their gangmembers out of jail. Of all, I'm not sure what's going to happen. They get away with some money, which they get to spend on some bad movie.  I would rate this movie as a 2-star bad movie for its lack of comedy and the lack of comedic scenes, but there is no real funny scene. In the end, it's hard to say, "The Kid" is a good movie, but not as good as some of his movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I've finally come to the end of this nightmare of a film. I was really sad when I watched this on the first time seeing it as it could have been only three years ago. I have always seen this film in one sense, it wasn't a funny film, not a great film at all.  The main reason I was sad seeing it was because I didn't know how I could watch this in a positive way, how horrible the acting was. The actors didn't act well at all and I had to watch this movie for a few years just to get some of the actors in there so the story of the movie wasn't so bad, although at the same time I wish I didn not have to see this,  I can only compare it to what you would expect to watch on HBO. It was absolutely painful. I can't watch this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just stumbled around and didn't find this one much earlier than I do now. What a few minutes of bad acting and bad acting makes this movie truly an embarrassment. In fact, I'd really prefer this one, as I found a movie that is so awful but so much fun. The only thing about it was a little touch of humor; there were no jokes or characterizations, just awful actors, really bad story. It is also really poor on a comedy standpoint, but I still saw it as funny.  A film this bad, but really funny to look down on is simply the fact that the whole idea is so badly written that there were many ways to try to make it, as evidenced by this piece from the British Broadcasting Association that, I believe, is so disappointing. There was an interesting question. Could the lead actor, William Walker, have been a major director of a major film for so many years, as he did with so many of his films over the years? There wasn't even a clue to this question.  In fact. Yes, I was given the name of Walker's former work, which was to create, in addition to the "Cobber" series, and was really the one that was truly good. I'm sure he had been working for years. But in the "Alfell" movie, he simply turned off the main role to play an old lady who is a real "Bordello"-type character who had all of her lines. That's the most disappointing thing in all of this movie.  The only other reason I found this film was because I liked the way it was.  It is like a man-eating-fish movie. I really wish I were to see something that was less absurd and more fun. But it is so bad that I'd rather see something better for its own sake. I think the film could have been much better at a point in time when it was good. The fact that it has been overcast for so long makes it all the more pathetic. The funny parts are just too easy. I just wonder how anyone actually believed this film could ever have been anything fun to watch.  What is interesting about this movie is that it is supposed to be a comedy. If this film had to be made, it wouldn't be as funny as it is now, because it really isn't. The acting is terrible, the acting is bad, the characters are flat, and the film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen "The Last Days" when it was released in 1985. This movie was pretty disappointing and there was nothing in it to make it any better. When it was made, it was pretty obvious that this movie would not appeal to modern audiences. The plot was really dumb, and there were a few people that were interesting, but not a lot. It had an obvious sex scene that would have been better than a sex scene in "Naughty Little Lizards" (the movie that was released a few years earlier). It had nothing to redeeming it. And this movie has no redeeming features. I've also seen this movie in Japan, and found it a little disappointing, considering how it played out in Japan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is happening with these movies is that the actors are having all kinds of emotional difficulties when they act in this manner and, they are all having all sorts of physical difficulties.  I can only guess that this is because they are the same people who were supposed to be very good actors, or they've lost their respect for their craft. The movies are not, for example, a horror movie.  If there was a person who had suffered through this movie, I'd be willing to be interested in talking about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director, who was supposedly directing "Bryon Forever," was really bad. The movie was not the movie I remember watching for the previous seven years. This movie was just an awful, completely awful, horrible joke. I can only guess that the people involved in making it didn't even have an idea how to make it. I think it would have been better to make this movie, and made a great joke about a guy getting old. It was terrible. I'm not joking. I cannot tell you how awful this movie was. And it never would have done that much in comedy to be funnier. I've seen several movies that could be funny, but never really laughed. Just an ordinary, poor, ugly joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one big step in the 'wannaboosing' craze which seems to have been used for a few years. I'm going to tell you. It was way too long. It is full of pointless characters. The ending is pointless. And it is also extremely bad. A couple of actors were good at making it funny, but these two were so predictable. I wouldn't recommend this movie. I think it is because of the way they use the 'Narcissist' to convey a theme, but not when it is a 'true story', it makes the film seem stupid and depressing.  The only thing about it that is a positive is the fact that 'Nastes' has such an important significance that it is considered the number one movie of the year. It doesn't really matter who the hero is or who the'main villain' is. The story is about how they try to get at the FBI office in order to gain information from the FBI. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had high hopes of the movie and I never did really expect it. I was really looking for some good horror movies to have.  This movie is simply bad. It is not even scary and not even entertaining.  I can see where this came from, considering how the actors were acting, but the horror movie scenes were all fake. I hope it will not get released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete disaster, one that could not possibly be compared to the last one. While I enjoyed the first one for a fun flick, that's not the case here. The story goes on for an hour and there is nothing else to do. If you have any interest in the subject or just watch the first two of these films, then skip the next two. It just is horrible. The plot is terrible and the characters are the same ones you've already seen, acting is terrible.  I won't recommend this one to anyone but if you're a movie lover, you will be wasting your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad the movie wasn't a big horror film as I think most of the comments here. I mean, that's not to say it was that scary, but it wasn't for the other actors in the movie. I found this movie, which is a disappointment, on the same subject, but that doesn't mean much in the end. The story is very weak, the acting is poor, and the story is terrible. I've seen my other movie, but even the original, for my friend, was better than this one.  There are many problems here, and I think it's very poor choice for a horror film. There are some great scenes and the actors' scenes aren't particularly good, but there are bad moments that ruin it. I give this movie a 1/10, but I have not seen this one in a movie theater so I can't say what the actors were really tired about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An example of the worst possible film I've ever seen. I was in the movie and watched it all day, it just doesn't make any sense. The acting is weak, the story is stupid and there is a massive plot line that the actors don't act at all. The direction has no idea what to do, and the acting is bad. But what makes it so bad is that the plot and acting are terrible! The plot line is so bad that the film isn't even that good. And the acting in the film is terrible, the acting are good but the acting isn't. The characters aren't even good characters, they just have to be made to seem real or pretend. I could have never seen this much in a movie, but it wasn't just bad, it was terrible. I know the acting was bad, and I know that it's a low-budget film. Still, I hope that it doesn't end up getting canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like a good horror movie, make sure it doesn't go straight into the garbage. This movie is about as pretentious as the late 1980's version of "Evil House". There are so many plot points and story twists that the ending is very unsatisfactory. I was especially unhappy when I read the movie review on the box and had to throw it away. Even though it's one of the most amusing films ever made, it just never gets to be funny. I can't imagine how any of the cast or crew would have been able to do the same thing as they did. I'm sure that all the cast would have gotten bored by the movie by the time it's released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really surprised that people have rated it so high. I was just expecting it to be some sort of trash movie with some light effects and good old music to keep you entertained. Sadly, it just turned out to be a really bad movie with no good music or dialogue. It's even worse than "The House of Stag" from the 70's. The acting is bad and the acting is downright awful. Even for a child who grew up with anime, and a person who really likes it to keep their eyes in their heads, this movie just seemed to be too weak and lacking in some important parts of the plot. The fact that there is no good dialog and the characters are totally unsympathetic makes the movie seem pretty useless to me.  But it does have some nice scenes. I wish it could have ended up like a movie, but it just keeps on repeating the same scenes over and over. The good thing about "The World's End" is that it was the best and shortest movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is not very good and the characters are not well done at all. A decent plot, but nothing really works. But this has to be the weakest film of the entire franchise. The main reason that it's not good is the lack of a proper plot and not that it really works for it. But there are some good things.  I guess you're wondering how I can possibly justify a 10/10 movie, but you are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The War" has a few good moments, with some of the plot and some good visual effects. The film has the worst dialog ever made in a film. There are lots of fake characters throughout the movie, like the guy who appears to be in a bank. And the girl with red hair is in a nightclub with a guy in the club, who is apparently crazy but not crazy. And then the girl has a guy she calls her father, who apparently is really a bank owner, and he apparently doesn't even have a car with a roof in the hood. But he tells her he is really not going anywhere with his friend, and her father is in jail. And apparently the dad is in prison. The whole film has these characters stuck in a bad and uninteresting plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was extremely bad. A couple of dialog lines are pretty good, but the rest were poor. I'm not sure whether I liked it or not, so don't take my opinions from me, but if you did please watch it, don't read it. You will see that most of the movie was about one of the kids who is in the midst of a drug addiction problem. I was surprised that the film ended so soon, even though it was well done. I had to imagine there were some very good dialog in it. I don't know why. It was just too bad to make it. In the end, I just can't find anyone who is interested in this movie. I've read a lot of other reviews online from people who are interested in it and the story, but not after reading the comments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it before, and it didn't work. And so, that has made me very depressed. I do not like this film. I also think that this movie was the only movie in my life that was not at all interesting. I cannot believe this movie is really about a love story, as if that is what it really was about. It is about a soap opera show.  It is really not about love, but the actors and the people in the film do not really talk about it, and I really do not understand why they do. I really thought that they just wanted to make something that they were going to do, that there is no more to it.  I give this movie one one star rating, but it really does not count for much. If you like it, don't. I won't be laughing. I hope that the writers will get the thing together and are able to come up with a real film about something, because there is one good story in this whole mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing about this movie is the fact that the director wanted to film it in a single shot. That's what it is. The plot is weak and the acting is terrible. And although I have seen some of the other movies in the 1990's, the new one is even worse than the original. It is about half the length, so the movie could be a 2 hour movie in 2 hours. The new version is the same one that appeared in a video release of the same movie as a low budget movie, so it's a bit better. But it's not worth a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "plot" is mostly bad, the acting is OK, the special effects are OK. What a letdown. "The end" should probably be considered the "greatest" of the whole film: "The film is a long waste of time; there are no good endings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film had many problems. One of the main reason I had problems with this film was because I was so used to what was in the real world. The main problems I had in this film were the characters were too long to relate to one person and I wanted to see the movie to go for some kind of ending. What I had not expected was that they were going to make this movie and I thought the plot was weak. Also they should have done a good job on the movie setting to create a decent story. Instead they kept going.  There is also a lot of unnecessary dialogue and a lack of action. And I would probably avoid it if I was used to the real World War 2 movies or had seen them on the TV. That would have been too hard for me to relate it.  But they aren't even a decent movie and the ending is not even all of what it has to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Truly the Worst Movies Of American Cinema: The Return to Hell (2/3/2002)  The "Return to Hell" is the same as the movie "The Return to Armageddon," a movie which was also released in 1994 and was apparently the inspiration of this movie.  In a strange film format, this movie takes place during a major crisis in American society, the beginning of a major, and very big war in Vietnam. The main character, the lead in the "Return To Hell" film, is a female "follower," who has come from Japan, and she and a male co-writer travel with them to a war site in Vietnam, where she becomes a member of a secret group who are sent to meet with the leader of a group called "The Cult of God". The group begins a battle with the military, and they kill two soldiers they are sent for, and one soldier is killed by an explosive grenade. The leader has several "secret" members of his group, and the other soldier is also killed by a grenade that explodes in a tent he and the group were sitting in. The soldier takes a couple of soldiers and becomes involved in a major battle with an enemy, and he and her family are killed by the enemy. The cult leader is killed, but the leader's body is thrown into a "hell." Then, the female soldier and her co-helmer (a man named "Pam") are sent back to the battlefield to meet the cult leader with the help of their colleagues, who are also sent to war. When they meet back with the lead, Pam is killed when she and her colleagues (men named "Kali") come across. They take out a soldier who has been killed, and Pam's family is killed as well. The soldiers then go into the tent, where Pam has a baby, who is then taken hostage, and eaten by another soldier.  The cult is then invaded by soldiers from the war in the region of Vietnam. These soldiers then take on Pam to a "revelation" at some point and kill the members of "The cult of God" in order to supposedly make them "recover" from this "hell".  I have one major problem with this movie, which I do not want to discuss very much.   The end of the story is a plot of an impassable ending. The story is about a couple (the lead's mother, the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the name of the movie makes me think of, this movie is a dismal piece of entertainment that I did not expect it to be. It's full of awful jokes, low-budget gag-treats and a totally pointless attempt at humor. There were actually better versions of the same movie: the early "Babarang" series, and the TV series "Cali". The first two were pretty good, but it's the last one that has this awful gag-like gag of a guy wearing a black hat and taking out his keys for his penis and getting in bed with a woman.  There are no good reasons for these ridiculous jokes. This is an embarrassingly awful movie, but is definitely not to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is decent, and I recommend a copy of it. But that's not the point to view the movie. Instead, the main point is that this movie is a complete lack of laughs. In the middle of the movie, there is a large section where it seems like it's all in there. It could have been better had the writers done something that would really make the movie a worthwhile one. But the main part of the comedy is that you have to believe that the actors aren't in a normal mood.  It's probably the worst comedy I've seen since this one, and there are lots of laughs but not a funny one. There is a whole load of problems here. I've already commented a lot about the movie and the acting, so I'll review more later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very upset when I watched this movie. I think it was made worse than the original was. It is like watching an old movie from the 1930s. It's not very good, but it is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm no-one the film's biggest fan, and have nothing whatsoever to do with it. I didn't want to like it, and I thought that a movie like "Aliens" would have been good. But this movie isn't much of a horror flick. It has absolutely nothing to do, and it's the same size as the "Alien" sequel! There's not even an intelligent one or two-liner riff, either. There are no special effects or effects or special effects. There's just stupid people walking through a zombie-like maze, with no real purpose or purpose. The cinematography is bad and the acting is bad. The movie has no premise whatsoever and no idea of what it's about. They're just talking about "juggling monsters" instead of the movie's main story. I've always hated "Alians" movies, but this is worse than the original in every way. The most disappointing movie in my life was "Dino's World" because you couldn't even watch it without turning your heads off.  I hate "Alonsides", for my whole life I've never been one of their fans, and this movie fails to convince me. It's sad. I want my friends to know it's a waste of time, because it's so bad! I really think this movie was designed to be bad. I'm sure there are a lot of good movies about aliens and their activities, and "Alien Origins" did well. There was one of the best parts of the "Matrix" movies ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping it would be better than this review. I was expecting a good movie, but this one is not. What's the worst thing you can say about a movie: a movie is bad for an hour and a half (the way it looks like it's going!) and one great piece (the art) is also bad.  I cannot recommend this movie if you're looking for an amusing and dramatic film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting better. I was the only one who left the screening and didn't finish watching, and I did not expect this movie to be good. The acting is so bad that it really bothers me to watch it. I guess it's supposed to be a comedy-so the reason that it's not a comedy is because they didn't care how cheesy it is. This movie is supposed to have some sort of twist to the plot, but they didn' care how it was done.  The plot is bad enough that it needs no twist to make it funny. The ending is a disappointment, but it is supposed as something funny. That's about all you need to know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really had liked the idea that I could have been. This wasn't too bad, because I'd seen the entire season and pretty much known the cast. But here they are acting and acting like a bunch of people who had never spoken to me, and don't know what's happening about the movie. I really couldn't have laughed at this movie, but unfortunately I didn't laugh. I didn a chuckle when I read that the other actors were involved. I also think that the casting was badly put together. I had an idea that the main role was to be a big, fat guy who was involved in all kinds of sex acts, but I think that it would be too much to be. I don't think that you have to have good looks for the movie, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm embarrassed to say I've seen this movie more than once. It doesn't help that I have seen it in the video store over two months ago. The movie was about four minutes long and it had some pretty bad jokes and a few dialog. It really sucked. It didn't even get to the end in time before it was released but it's still a pretty awful movie. I've had nightmares at night. My wife, the writer is really a jerk as she's the worst actor I've ever met.  The cast is pretty bad too. One of the female stars in this movie is Elizabeth Berkley and she's acting with a terrible wig. I'm hoping it's some movie that someone will do better. It hasn't changed since she played the girl in "The Perfect Family" but it hasn't been great since it came out.  I've only watched a few movies and I'm wondering if this really is an American movie. It is about a guy who gets into a car with a girl, finds out that there is a guy that had sex with her (the girl) in the parking lot and turns in a negative movie. Then the girl turns in to the guy and says she's a whore and he's not interested. The guy starts flaunting, insulting the girl for being a prostitute, saying "She's got a good job" and showing the guy a couple of money, saying he needs it to keep her on the premises. So the girl is embarrassed and he gives the guy some money to rent her a motel room and he goes to a hotel to find the girl who's sleeping on the sofa and the two go to sleep together. The girl's friend comes back and they end up sleeping together on the bed (or in the bathroom). The girls sleeps together. When the girls are sleeping, we get to see the girls in their underwear having sex in the shower and all the action is shown. If you want to see some kind of drama, it is not worth it. I have to ask if the movie has a decent ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie back in the 70's. When I saw this film and I couldn't believe the director and the casting director wanted this movie to be a really scary horror movie. I can't tell if it was a copy of some of the films in the 80's, but what did they do with it? The story was so bad that it made me think of myself at all. The ending was so stupid and there was no real payoff. I was hoping there would be a little twist or some action. I just didn't see it. The acting was terrible as well as the direction was awful. It really got old about the end of the movie. It was too weak and lacked real comedy. I didn't like it and I wasn't even interested in seeing the movie for a long time. It just a little sad and sad when a movie like that dies. I would never waste any time looking for more movies like this. They should have known what they had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really surprised at how horrible it was. After watching this movie, I started to think about how this movie would compare to the other other one. The only way it was good is in the final sequence, when one of the two guys is chasing an egg and they get stuck. Then they stop running and get stuck in a ditch. The whole idea is that they are eating worms and worms eat worms. They get stuck and their leg gets broken. They then decide to find a worm for them and they are in search of a worm. Then one of them starts acting stupid. This is only good in the movie to watch it and see how horrible they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little girl dies in a car accident. It looks like she had no idea. But she dies in this car. But I have to admit that there were many mistakes in this movie. The first mistake was in the first scene. She looks sad, and she is sad in the last scene. The next mistakes were about the car. The third mistakes are about the guy who died in the car, and the other car, a truck. The car's cabin was not clean. And the other truck was a trailer. There was no music, no dialog. The soundtrack was not good at all, and there were some annoying moments. But this movie just got plain awful. It is not a good film, but it does get the worst qualities for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even have to get to the beginning, it just has a lack of structure, and the fact that no one talks in it bothers me...  The whole thing feels like an adult soap opera in that it should be at least a PG-13 level. But it's got a very simplistic story line with very little direction. You could have easily done a better movie in that movie. I could even tell you that the people who have come into the movie have done movies like this, which is a whole lot of crap. In fact, I didn't like it for what it was. You'll never know the story of this movie, and you'll never feel any emotion after watching it. Also, there were probably a few people in the cast that really made it uncomfortable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a fan of the series but the only way I could get out of it was watching the series on video in 2000 or a few years later. Some of the cast seemed OK though the acting seemed to be lacking. I've seen some of the other shows but they were better than this. I'd be fine if the people involved weren't in this film. It seems like the writers decided to go all in for themselves and didn't care if their reputation had anything to do with this movie. They did a few jokes that were funny, but if they had to pay that much money to make it a "film", I think they might get burned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An uninspired attempt at a low budget horror movie fails to make any sort of sense, much less a meaningful point. If the first part of the movie is good it might have been good enough, but the other parts just look terrible. It has just three scary scenes (1, 2, 3) in the whole movie, a couple of them stand out a little better than the first one. Even the little story of the "Keebs" (as the movie's title is) is pretty dull, with no story beyond that one. And the characters, at least the ones who survive it, seem very silly as they are all acting through the acting that they are taking in, not really trying to behave like normal humans. There aren't any decent lines, the dialog is flat, and there are no good laughs or any real funny parts to the dialog. If you think this movie is funny and funny then you are going to be very bored. This movie just doesn't have any redeeming qualities, and even worse it fails to close any opportunities for comedy. It is like a soap opera.  The soundtrack is OK, but at least some of the songs are good. But don't expect something funny to this type of movie. The soundtrack, like most horror albums, is the same, predictable, and not particularly funny. This is no way for a horror movie to be serious.   4 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea that this movie has "made" is laughable at best, and a couple of us have been debating whether this is actually a true movie. The writing and acting are not good either, and there are some decent references for the plot and even some of the acting.  However, the film's focus on the characters and their motivations is really laughable.   I'm not trying to be harsh here, but I know people who were fans of the show, like the show.  This is a bad film. There are only three people in it, and they are all very inconsistent.  Some of the actors are OK, and some of them are totally awful. Some of them act as stand-ins, and others act like idiots.  The story line is a weak attempt at an American "gangster movie", and the film could easily have been an interesting film.  What this movie fails to do is not make money or even take the viewer into the "gangsters", which seems to be the goal of this movie. It's just a small plot of things.  I wish this movie was about a soap opera with a decent plot. If you don't watch it for the entertainment value, you'll only be entertained by the "show" and its actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible and the story is bad. The ending is the worst and makes no sense. You would never want to see that. The acting was OK, but the story was a lot of crap and really sucked. The people in the movies were the same, except that most of them were acting on their own behalf. I would not recommend it to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really the worst of the first three films this franchise has been released. It doesn't even come close to the first two in the franchise, which was the first film in the series. As a series, they are bad. In my opinion, the first 2 movies are okay, but this has been two films before this franchise, and two of those are bad, and one of them has a totally ridiculous plot! The plot is stupid, and the acting is bad. It's also bad for the kids. If you have seen the series before, don't waste your time watching it, and you'll end up feeling like an addict. It is not worth watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is interesting, the movie isn't that good, and the plot is so thin that it feels as if it's a soap-operations show, and it's actually not terribly good to watch.  The best of the bad actors in this movie are not the actors themselves, but just the way the show is constructed, or even the dialogue. (The acting is so bad that there isn't even any plot lines in the movie. It's an especially poor decision on the part of the writers, and that's largely due to the director.)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never expected this movie to be like the other movies they made. The story is about the family's problem - that each of them has some problems with the other guy, and he is a member of the family, so he has some power. The plot is pretty weak, and the ending is quite boring - the girl who is supposed to be an actress is supposed for to have a lot of acting in movies. I could not even finish watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It wasn't like a movie: I don't think I was in it, I mean I was so embarrassed. I tried to stay away from it as I have been many times before and just didn't know what to do. But I did watch it one time. The ending is awful. It's just unbelievable. The story is pointless, the dialog is bad, the acting is terrible, and I'm scared about it.  It's absolutely awful to watch.   This movie is a disgrace, in the true sense of a shameful piece of work. Don't think of it, don't buy it, and if you must see it. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm appalled that this film made its debut. I was very upset. The story is so bad that it can only be understood by those who do not see the film. And the acting, especially that of the main actors is so poor. And those people, such as John Carver, must have some high moral fiber. It's not even a surprise that these two are best known for their superb acting, but this seems to be a self-indentrated bunch. Even for Carver and Carrie Guzman, there is some courage that Carver shows. I've been watching for some time, but I did not get into a battle for these two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is an attempt to start afresh the genre. Unfortunately, it fails to do anything as well as most of the other "straight man" films out there. The first few minutes of the movie are all so bad that I didn't really like it. I did like the fact that the movie included a male director. He seemed to care about how much drama he had to go through. Of course, I was just tired to see him cry to his ex. However, I didn`t like the ending.  The plot is bad and there are too many parts to be seen in one movie. This movie is just a re-use of the "straight guy" genre. If you don`t have an idea of what is wrong with the movie, don`T spend the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible! It is a very stupid, un-realistic and stupidly boring story and I do not understand why people are allowed to watch it. The only reason I have given this movie to my friends is because I know the director has a large family and he could not want to see this movie if he tried. I don't know what was he thinking in making this movie and I don`t believe he has any clue what he thinks about his family. This is one of the worst movies of all time. It shows a very obvious, shallow, and shallow relationship and it isn't real. There is no emotion, no love, no happiness, no respect, no empathy, no understanding, no caring, no life. The film is designed to be depressing, and boring and boring. In a good movie it is a fun movie and even when it is disappointing and really disappointing it is still better than the other movie of the same genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this film to be a very entertaining horror film. But I'm a fan of Michael Jackson (as well as one of my childhood favorites). He and the rest of the cast just aren't very interesting and don't make any real sense. The story is really dumb, and the acting seems to be terrible. I can't really say anything good about it, but it's not even worth a rental. I've watched Michael Jackson movies and he is a very talented actor, but this movie is just bad. I was hoping for an entertaining horror with a good story to keep me entertained. But sadly, this is not the movie I had been hoping for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never seen a movie this low budget wannabble before, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had a really good time with the acting and the acting was good, but the plot wasn't much, and the movie seemed to go into an endless loop of the same boring scenes.  I was surprised that it didn't get much buzz when it came out on DVD a few months ago. The only thing I was interested in was the first person who said the word "Shampoo" (I said it) after a really hard time. I can't even remember it.  If anyone wants to see a sequel, watch some of the original films, and if you liked the original movies, go ahead and watch one of those. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes you a couple of minutes to enjoy without the promise of anything. There is nothing to make it better. Nothing to hope for.  But it looks more like a movie than a movie. If this movie is a movie then that means it's not a movie but a film. If it is a film then it's an attempt to make a movie that looks like a film but is actually a complete attempt to do so. It is about being the worst movie in the whole world with just one director.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie with only one eye. It was absolutely horrid. I laughed with the ending. The ending is so bad that it has to be a parody. I was so upset and angry that I stopped the movie and never watched it again. I knew I never would find the movie funny if I had to watch it again - that was the only thing I had wanted to do. I have watched a movie: I really like and am embarrassed by it, but this movie is just a bad parody of a good movie: awful ending that is so, so, SO bad, that I was annoyed when I didn't see it again when it was on my way back. This movie is so lame, that even the characters themselves would laugh at the ending, and I never laughed to watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot believe it was made. The main reason is that I was hoping it would be better. What I've been able to find out is that it is so bad that it won't make any sense and even the few funny moments (such as a slight bit of an ending at the end). What it is about is that most of the characters are boring, even the main two actors. I cannot figure out what they are in life anyway... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen...I have been told many times over the years, it is one of the worst movies ever made...maybe that's my clue. It's terrible. The cast is terrible and the writing seems to have nothing to do with the story. But I have to admit, I did like some of the cast and I think this film was good. There are some funny moments...I don't think there's enough for a sequel. I just want to say that the cast are terrible actors, they are not funny, they're not funny and the story is completely predictable.  I'm surprised they could make this film any better than the original one. They were good before, the original was good but they were terrible after. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really disappointed because nothing came out from the acting. I just got a laugh seeing the movie ending after the 10 minutes it actually made. I tried to laugh but the movie kept rolling like a bad joke.  I gave it one star because there was no movie, but the acting was terrible. You have to see the movie before deciding to go to its video club website. If you did this movie, your life will be so dull.  If you don't watch this movie like a live movie, then you are going to have a bad time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is an "crisis" (not the other one) occurring around the world with no "greater" reason why this is so bad. A typical movie, and then it's all wrong. In fact, most movies about a real crisis are like this one. This one was even worse. It was a very bad movie and made me angry and I didn't want to see more of it. I'd give it a rating at one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this film but I think it just wasn't worth my time to bother with. I wasn't sure whether it was a good or bad film, but in the end I was bored and frustrated. I suppose it's meant to be a comedy, but it's also just not funny and it doesn't make any sense. I think the whole thing is kind of depressing, but I suppose the people that liked this film would just ignore it, because their main interest would be in something else. So, if you enjoy this film, stick your fingers in your butt and enjoy it, or if you aren't a fan of it, get it so that you don't waste time on watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am watching this for the sole reason of trying to get it to see. I'm going to review this because it's so pathetic and I'm still hoping it is one of my favorite movies of the year, and I think that's only a little bit of me. The plot is so bad that it is impossible to enjoy this movie. The dialogs were poor. There was a lot of unnecessary scenes in the story, and the main question is not whether this movie is worth to anyone. Even though it was in fact the best picture I've seen from a good movie ever made, I think it deserves a 2 out of 10. Even with the exception of "The Great American Adventure", this movie was pretty bad, and even with the one part that I enjoyed it, it could have been better. The acting is bad, there was nothing worth watching.  I have to agree with the majority of this movie's audience. Some of you know better than me, and some of you may even be smarter than me. But I do not trust such a thing. I hope that the next time I try to see this movie I'll be able to enjoy it, and that part will not be so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a horror/b-csh film. The plot, not good, is not worth to watch, and the acting doesn't matter. It's not a good horror film, even after you watch it. I mean that this film does take place within a horror movie, so it is obviously a horror film.  But it fails on a second count for a second movie in a horror shop. The story is not good and the character acting is bad and the casting is not well done. The movie doesn't make you laugh, and don't laugh for it. It has a very bad story and there aren't enough lines and dialog to keep you from falling asleep. If you want a horror horror movie you will definitely miss a good one and get lost in a few hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the old movies - I was an avid Disney fan even as a teenager - but this is not the same thing as Disney movies. If you were watching this film in 1999, this would be good for you. It's not even like I remember the "B" series movies when they were funny. I mean, I guess this is a lot like B's, but the jokes are awful and they are never funny - like the scenes of "Snow White" and "Mink" etc - you just go through an entire movie of them. The only good thing about this is that there is a few of the best ones, but these jokes are pretty stupid.  Anyway, this movie is not good. It doesn't make sense, it has no decent storyline and there are no real suspense to the plot - there are just a few people who die, the entire thing is just about being a bad film. But this is still about the best movie in the franchise. I think the director and the writer made this a joke but it would be better if they just stopped making the jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was poorly conceived, even after it was first distributed on the Internet. Most of the jokes are ridiculous, but the characters are so cartoonish that they get a funny punch line that should be there. In the end, I cannot understand any of the dialog. At the end of the movie, I found the movie was very depressing and the storyline was very disappointing. I tried to buy the DVD, but ultimately I cannot find any good reason to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i agree i find this film to be somewhat pathetic. i really don't understand why this is the only movie i am ever seen. i dont think i'll ever find out why this film has been made. i'm really not positive about this film. i don't know why it was made, the cast was bad, and it's absolutely terrible to watch. i know what happens on screen, and i think i've seen many of these films. i find myself looking for movies and movies that are better than this.  The biggest problem i had with this film was that the cast were completely bad actors.  I think I was just waiting for the first episode to get all of the things right. i hope you'll find the rest of this film in a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An average trash-movie from a guy who knows nothing about filmmaking and no knowledge about making movies. It's not that bad, but the movie also contains a very interesting, but rather weak plot. There's no funny lines or funny moments; no scenes with funny music; no funny acting; no special effects, etc. It just plain sucks. It also contains some funny dialog.  However, it's too bad. The point of view I give this movie is that a man who is good at music and doesn't know how to use special effects to get interesting or funny or funnier; can't get funny or funny and it's not like a typical movie. The ending is not too funny, but it's pretty unbelievable.  Overall, it is just plain bad, not funny, not even a very good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is to be expected from this film: A girl walks into the closet, gets into the bathroom, and has the right to go to the shower? A guy is going to be at the shower to pick up a girl and get a shower. What's the last thing? Nothing? Well, what's the best thing? No. Nothing. In fact, it's just a terrible movie!  I would give this movie an 'A' but not 'D' (the most B-list piece of crap ever.)   It's really stupid. The main theme is that the girl was in the bathroom having a heated shower when she is trying to go and shower. I can't even tell you what the girl's clothing was and what she has in the shower.  It is painfully obvious that the people who do this are really stupid! It just turns off the people involved with the movie and it's obviously meant to be a distraction, but not at the very least. The only problem is that nobody ever sees the point of this whole film. The "best way" in this movie is to simply let the girls go to a shower without making a splash, and then the shower should be so hot that you're not even noticed. This was my first choice of a movie: I went out with my sister and one of my friends for the second time in the school, and there was no one who said, 'You know what we're going to do here? The best way is to let them in and go to shower. If you don't see this, go with the girl. If they are good, it makes the film totally stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a fairly standard genre movie, but for the film it failed to survive its debut and remained only in two or three minutes of duration. The film does have a lot of good qualities, but its bad-feature-making nature, rather than its merit, is clearly evident. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some good lines here, but for most of the scenes they don't quite fit. There's a lot of plot, and there's something else that is very bad that has nothing to do with the film at all. They were all really a pretty predictable, but just to have a bit of the charm of the classic movies they couldn't keep doing that. This movie didn't do anything right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I said, "Citizen Kane" has some interesting characters. One of them is a teenager who wants to become a prostitute. The other is a policeman who was on his last job before getting killed in a shootout. The only reason he thinks this is right is because of "Citizens Kane", the movie has one of those scenes where you get the impression you are a part of the movie, because "C Citizen Kane" is a movie that centers around the idea of "celebrity" and not "reality".  The movie starts off with a pretty good soundtrack and some cool movies like "Criminator", which was excellent for the time. But then the movie starts with a completely nonsensical plot line. The first scene is about a couple of teenagers who are on their way to a murder, and the other couple is in town after getting into an argument that they broke up because they were getting married. Then the murderer takes the lead of the rest of the townspeople, killing them and making the couple dead. We follow the murder victim, who turns out to be a stripper. But now he has a new job as a bouncer. So, who's the stripper? The "citizen Kane", not the murderer. It's pretty clear how he's doing this, but he still seems to be playing in a high school and thinks he's about to be an actor. We have the killer, so let's start counting him off.  Next, we find out he's a drug dealer. He asks his friend, Mr. Gannon, to run a "swamp" sale where he can get some drug money for his money. We then find out that he has taken the heroin to a pawn shop and there's a "drug shop" selling narcotics to the customers. This drug dealer's boss is in a place where the customer needs drugs, so he's working there. Then he gets them in and pays the drug dealer to buy the drugs for his customers. We're getting paid now, and he's taking a discount to go back to work.  Now we find the drug seller's friend, who doesn't even bother with his job at all. He's getting a huge amount of money from a drug house because the drug gang keeps his name in the phone. This is supposed to be for a client. But the boss at the drug house (his name) tells the boss that he's not going to take care of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to like this movie, and I could barely tolerate it. I laughed at some of the dialog and the acting. But I had a couple of points of hope with it. The plot was decent, but the acting was weak, and the whole thing could have easily been better directed for it was just one of a bunch of "B" films. The characters were boring and flat, but did well. I think this is the worst movie ever made, and there was a lot of money made on it, which should have been spent somewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at one of the biggest screening party ever at the Toronto International Film Festival. I saw it in the lobby. I didn't know what was going on. It just looked like a film, nothing interesting at all. The film had a decent story, but the movie could not move on. There was too many scenes. Too long. This was not a good movie. I would have to say that the filmmakers were just trying to get to the end. If you're looking for a movie that's about a drama with a plot but has no plot, then watch this film. If the cinematographers are interested in telling a funny drama, you'll get bored with the end being so predictable, and if they're interested in making a thriller, you won't feel like a climax.  The plot is really lacking, and it's also not clear about what happened in the movie. In the beginning, the protagonist, and I, as a fan of the book, is a man who has to get married. But the husband's job is not about getting a married girl. We know that he lives in his house, but in the beginning the book is very vague about what the house is about. There are some bits of the storyline that are vaguely connected to the book and the book. The book is apparently about a time of chaos in England when the Englishman's life is threatened by his stepdaughter. The man dies in the middle of the story and then gets his life back in the book - but the man's stepdaughter is dead because he has no stepdaughter alive. (He then goes on to have an elaborate funeral with several relatives)  He is apparently having trouble getting his life into order - but it's clear that he has problems with his stepdresses.   The first few minutes of the film were pretty good.  There's a slight, fleeting scene where one of them is trying to find a way to get some food or help. I'm not sure why it was in the video. They just seemed to do something on it and then disappear from the scene.  But then, what's even worse is the ending - the ending is so disappointing! It's clear from the book that there are no ending. When the two characters are getting married they are having to wait to get all the marriage documents done. One scene in the film has them waiting for their paperwork, but we also get to see a couple of times that they've not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on a tape (thanks, my wife) that was stored in the closet in the middle of a bad pile of junk. I had an idea that I would review it, and so I did. I watched it. When I read the plot, I found that the plot was bad. In my opinion, this movie is just another example of the same old crap and crap that everyone tries to make movies that only make up or fill a small pocket of money.  I did not like the film as a whole, in the end it did not make up for the parts I was looking at. It's not like a thriller movie, so what are you, that's all you have to do?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about two things that are bad, not just the actors. First, the story. Second, the acting. In a nutshell, the entire cast is totally wasted. That being said, the actors in this movie are so bad, they don't even fit the roles. They don't look convincing, and it's apparent that the story would have been good if they had actually done their jobs well. But, that's not a good excuse. The acting is also bad. I give no points for the acting, but if I were to nitpick on a bad film, I would nitpick. There are a few nice moments, but at the same time, not the best moments. This film simply can't be counted for anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I've seen this movie several times now. The dialogue is so stupid and unrealistic. This film starts off alright, but when it goes on and goes on it becomes annoying and annoying. What it should have done: First, we shouldn't have used the old way to talk about this film in print. It's a bad film to watch and be wasted as a film. The camera work is bad as well. Also, the acting is not up to the level of the movie. The story has no relevance to the film, but it also is way too long. The film itself is just a waste of time, even though it does have a couple of funny moments. The cast is just the worst thing I've ever seen. You have to sit on your couch and laugh to see it. There aren't even enough jokes.  I'd recommend avoiding it if you don't have an hour of free time. The main reason I recommend skipping this film is that it is so boring to watch. If you want to watch a film with a nice plot and decent acting, this isn't for you. The ending is OK, but the ending doesn't go as far as it did in "The Perfect Crime". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is so bad, I can only laugh, and that is all I get to say. However, this has also got to be funny. The fact that there is a male voice that sounds like it wants to be the singer is hilarious. The girl that comes out of nowhere, that has a huge nose and a lot of red hair, that is absolutely unbelievable, and who can say they are all blonde or otherwise attractive? I will try to think this is funny but in fact, it is really painful to listen to. In the beginning the movie starts on a horrible trend and there is more or less an episode. However the actress was able to get something better, but that just did not work. I can't see the end to any good movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the weakest ever shot in a film I've ever seen. The director was just as bad as his previous work, the most bizarre and stupid film ever made. I found the story and plot to be so weak that even I didn't know how it could work. The direction was bad, and there was only one good moment. The plot was extremely contrived and completely unconnected. The ending wasn't even a good ending. There were no good ending and it wasn't really a film at all. There was no decent acting, especially for the female lead. The male lead was annoying, not too bad, but his lines were too contrived. I wasn't able to care for anyone who was involved in the story, not just the people who were dying. In any case, I never really laughed for the ending. The acting was very weak and flat, and was just bad in a sad manner. The only good part was the female heroine. Her only good scene was when she finds the black eye to the wall of the room and throws it through the wall. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My big problem was the actor's name. When i looked at the plot line I thought, maybe its one thing and that this movie was supposed to be the funny story about a guy who got the girl to cry. I was not the biggest fan of the movie, but I was starting to really like the story. I can't blame the movie for being so poorly written. But the only thing about this movie is that the dialog is so bad. It's bad in a way that it can't even be funny. Its just an attempt for a young actor to get a good movie: to be a comedian, a funny actor, and a comedy actor, or even just to laugh without even a gag. I would prefer if he played a lot of his scenes (instead of just laughing) and didn't mind his movie, because otherwise he just won't get the job done.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So the writer has done this well. It's a huge failure. If you were watching the show, you knew it was only a little deeper than average, but not the show had a decent plot. The show had one funny moment. After this scene where we got some happy ending, you could swear that it was the only funny scene you've ever seen. I didn't care, but the fact that it wasn't any more funny than usual was very disappointing.  The writing is pathetic. Some of the ideas were actually funny in a small way, and it could really be funny. But it got me so sad.   Also, the show is so dull and boring that it didn't have any real ability to convey a message.  I had to listen to the show on to keep from becoming bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this film for about a few days and realized that this is a bad remake of "The Muppy". I saw it on Amazon after reading about it on the internet and, although I was still able to feel the same feeling, I couldn't even begin to care what it was about.  There are many times when I have to look at the comments that have been posted about this movie and wonder why. I have heard a lot of comments from people that thought I didn't want it to be such a bad version. The film is a pretty bad one to say, but even worse than that I am very angry that this film has been made. I really didn't expect a "Muppet" version of "Gagata" to be so bad, even though I would probably like it to have been more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 60 minutes of this movie is absolutely wasted - it's boring and slow. The second half a dozen minutes is about the same as the first half a decade ago.   It would be better if it wasn't so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is actually only one of two of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. Not only was it a complete mess, it was so awful it left me wanting for more, not even for a few hours. One minute you could tell it was going to be a good film, or an honest movie. One of the things I didn't like was the fact that the ending could not follow an idea I had. How could it even have an ending? You know, the film seemed pretty good. I had a really good time seeing it in theaters. I think it was just bad for the actors involved. The acting is so bad that I didn' feel good after seeing it. My guess is that it's just one of the worst movies ever produced.  It was also just a bad film, and a bad excuse for the people involved in the film, who either weren't aware of the fact or didn't do anything to deserve it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some of my childhood memories that this movie was good. I still remember the ending. I think the movie could have been better. I did not find a good reason for anyone to watch it. The movie starts off promising with a plot, but then drops off pretty quick. In the end, it seems like it's just one of a series of stupid crap that people have thrown at it. I cannot even say it was bad, but it was just an overall dumb, pointless, and totally pointless. The way it plays out seems like the script. There is no direction to it. There are no story in it. This movie is just pure rubbish. I have not even watched this movie twice, so I'm sure it's a good idea to spend some money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The video is bad...it is so bad...I'm sorry to say i watched it in the video store. I saw it and it made me want to throw up my head down. The acting is weak, the dialog is bad and the film itself...no, but it wasn't good. What is interesting about this movie is that its not supposed to be about anything, it is about a film that's so bad it made itself seem like it had an agenda.  I watched it because i found this movie to be so disappointing, because it was so bad to my eyes...i've heard a lot of bad reviews about it. And so i decided to sit in the car and listen to the movie instead of coming out with an award. I don't know if it will improve, but if it is to improve the film it could be made to look better, but at the same time, it won't improve me. It's just an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had the biggest shock in my life. It is a horror movie and nothing else. I thought the director and writer were OK, but this made me sad. I saw the trailer and I didn't believe it was made to shock us. I don't like horror, I like action and I like movies like a good movie. I think horror movies are just so bland and boring. It also doesn't help that it's a very long movie. In one of the trailers, a female character is standing up looking at a lady (not even a woman, but we know she's pretty pretty). She is all dressed in a really sexy outfit and the girl is talking to her. There is no real acting in the movie except a few moments where a character comes out and says, "hey hey, what a cute girl" to the girl. There are also a lot of stupid clichés and stupid things. People who didn't know that the movie was coming out were just as likely to watch it. This movie was poorly written, it was too long and too stupid. I didn was extremely uncomfortable watching this movie. There were also some of those stupid moments. Some of my friends didn't even know what was happening, and some of my classmates thought it was so bad, too. This is an average bad movie.  It has the potential for a lot more action than a good horror movie, but it isn't much better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the early part of the year of filming this movie.  I had to watch every part of it. And I hate it! I hate this movie! I don't know why! I'm not sure what it was supposed to be. The plot is not interesting or suspenseful! The camera was bad! The acting was bad. I know the cast was bad, the acting is bad. And the ending is not funny. I wish this movie was a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in awe over the fact that this movie is so bad! I'm afraid to say that I would watch this movie if I saw it in the theater. The acting is awful and the acting is laughable. If you are a film buff, you don't need to see this movie. It's absolutely awful! I know what's going on in this movie, I'm certain. I don't understand it anymore. If somebody is watching it, please do yourself some serious action because it's only going to take you away from the movie. I'm sorry for your brain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie, and even with all the "Bunch of Haggs" I had in the line, it could not stand alone. The acting was so bad that it made it hard to watch. But I would really like to find out if there was a plot or story in it, and how that was put together. I'm not sure. I've never been to this movie in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I both saw this movie, and we both laughed, because it made absolutely no sense. It was a bad, pretentious, and ultimately uninteresting film. I thought it was an insult to the memory of those who died, that this movie had the nerve to try and be funny for a sitcom. It's just pointless, and it is absolutely absurd to try to make a comedy out of a terrible movie, with little comedy, and no comedic or funny elements. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of time. I am not surprised to hear of it being broadcast on television (because I knew it was), but I would have to say the movie was not nearly funny. The cast was not that good. The acting was terrible, and the special effects were bad. I was extremely disappointed. I think this is what a "Cinderella's film" should be, because it's not funny, but very silly, and it's nothing that I liked, and there's no plot, and no story. If you are a fan of this movie and want to see a sequel to this movie, then I'm sorry, because the only person I like most in this movie is Eddie Murphy, and his character is always on an island somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and he never gets any money for this movie. If the movie had been shown on TV, it would have been good, and you could have at least had some of the laughs out of this bad movie. But, I wish to say this movie had just been put out by the networks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so badly acted that I didn not even notice that it is a comedy at all, much less comedy. It is a bad, boring, very disappointing and completely pointless comedy that could easily be dubbed a "comedic" movie (the only time I was even bothered about it) or not even comedically interesting. The director is good, but he is clearly lacking any charisma and his acting is weak, especially compared to the other films he has. The movie was very bad for the sake of the story, the actors were good, and the other people, although annoying. This film just wasn't worth anything, and I would never recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is an interesting premise to be put together in a film about a man who wants to be famous for making a movie called "Bitter Bitter".  It all works terribly, and there is no explanation why the writer (who was a writer) felt this would be a good movie, or why they were interested in the script. The ending is also rather predictable.  The film begins with some sort of a sequence that follows, so that the "Bitters Bitter" gets his job done in a way that is completely contrived.  One person, named "Charlie," was already a known writer on a major network show that was titled "Havens. This is a good part of the film, but not a good actor. I was thinking about the script because this part was about a very interesting situation with Charlie's character, but when I first saw the movie, I just got sick from it.   The ending ends with a middle-class man (a man that lives in a basement and has a big job in a nightclub) who has an affair with "Charlie", then begins his career of trying to go to the best nightclub, or any other adult entertainment establishment.  I was not sure whether the film was intended to be a comedy or an action film, and although it doesn't necessarily have a clear ending, it is clearly a plot that's nothing but a plot of "chasing Charlie" to get more money from the nightclubs. As in, the ending is about the guy who gets his real life started at the nightclub, gets his car stolen, and then has to pay a man named "Buster" to go see some movie called: "Bimmer Bitter", and as soon as he is in possession of his car, Charlie gets his life stolen from him.  There isn't any mention of Charlie in this film, nor the director/director of this film. I could tell you why he was chosen to go into the nightclub and go through the process, but no explanations were given. The story seems to be about a guy who's friend (a guy who goes through the nightclub as a stripper) who also got his job as a bartender (a bartender who's "business"). It seems that the friend is in on a gambling binge and he decides to use Charlie's name to get some money, but that is where it goes on.  He also gets into the business of his friend's friends, and his girlfriend
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no jokes, no action sequences, no plot, no real life. You can even hear a song at the beginning of the movie and it only starts when the movie is finished. There's even no plot. A movie which takes you two hours and thirty minutes to see, is the last two hours of your life. What's worse than that? What's the worst? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only imagine what happens when you get to see this movie. One question is, why did the producers want this movie to be made? They were obviously trying to sell it to the world. They probably didn't want the publicity to help increase interest in this movie and make it interesting to everyone. They wanted to keep this movie so that people would like it. But I have some bad advice. It's not entirely clear in the movie why they wanted to make this movie; I think they wanted it to be cheap to make it. If you are looking for a movie that contains some serious action and violence, then go straight to "Cannibalism". It's pretty hard to find that movie. But if you are willing to sit and watch this movie for fifteen minutes, you should never go for this movie: if you get bored, watch something else, and then decide to rent it.  If you want a movie whose central theme is, "Carnival" vs "Criminal Activity", that is the way to make a decent movie, then, enjoy it. The producers and the actor who are involved in this film made this movie, but they probably did a little too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it is not one of the great films I have seen, but it is a pretty bad one. The only thing that makes this film worth watching is the old scenes from the early movies and the plot of the sequel. I would recommend the movie for anyone who's looking for some old horror film from the mid-1950s. This movie is bad for a horror film, because its a gross joke, and there's little that stands out in it. There are the obligatory scenes of a ghost, but there is nothing really special about them, and what is that about?  The only redeeming part of the film is the fact that the actor has a great mustache. The girl who plays Nancy in the movie is good as always, but this film is bad because the whole cast is bad. There is not a good excuse for a bad film.  The best part of this movie was an old one. This was a big mistake. The film had a decent cast, though some of them seemed to be better in the later movies. The other good aspect about the movie was its funny ending. A young girl is accidentally killed by a demon and her boyfriend, but she is saved by the demon, who is going to kill her mother. After getting killed, the girl takes the demon back to the demon's place, where he kills everyone in the room he's in and gives Nancy a black robe. He gives the girl a silver ring and a silver bracelet which she carries with her for a long time. The demon wears this bracelet and wears it for a couple of weeks before the girl's body is returned to her. When the girl is returned, she can no longer use it and attempts to recreate it from the silver belt. That night, she goes back to school and ends up killing people and eating some of the demons. She returns with some of her old friends who are also returning to the restaurant that has the same name as the restaurant. She kills a demon there and we see her boyfriend and the demon leave. A few months later, Nancy is back at school and she is in an interesting place. She has to make it seem more interesting for those who have never seen this movie before. I was afraid when the next movie was released and I had to watch it, for I wasn't able to enjoy it more than it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still a huge fan of this film and its music, but I don't think that this one was that good. I'm not sure that it was even good for my family. I can't even begin to write out the lyrics. Also, if you knew the movie didn't have a plot and plot, this would be the worst thing ever. I've watched this film again after my wife decided to rent it, and we watched it again and all that time, I was looking for the right time to rent and it just didn't happen. The soundtrack is just bad, I think that is how it went down. This movie is so stupid! The acting is bad, the camera is bad as well, and the music is very bad!  The film is so bad that I didn't even care about seeing it. The only good thing about this movie was that it actually contained some good things!   If you like this kind of stuff, it'll come in a special package with a really good, hard copy. Don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an absolute disaster, especially the ending. The plot is pretty good, the actors and the scenery are OK, but there are too many loose shots. The ending is also stupid and unnecessary.  Also the ending is a very stupid way to end the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is one of those films that just won't make it into the film. I think it's too bad to be taken seriously. It has a lot of horrible lines and the dialog is the worst I've seen for a long time. In a way, it makes you like the guy, but when the dialog goes bad, you can't recommend the movie anymore. I give this one 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not to be taken seriously, at all. It seems to be a derivative of "Kino," a Japanese film from the 1990's. That's what the Japanese film does.  One of the many flaws with this film is the acting. I've already said that I've noticed two or three characters not speak properly. This is a disappointment. But there's more to it than just that. This film has poor performances, a weak plot, and bad dialogs. This has some really good shots, though. The film has too many bad dialog for a plot and doesn't come close to the final scene. All in all, I'd take the whole thing down a few years later. I'd like to see a remake of the "Ida". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited to see this movie as an introduction to the modern horror genre, even though I was less enthusiastic that the plot was bad. But what was wrong with the plot? The main problem is the lack of a good acting in the film. I know a few actors who could have done a better job at this genre, and the rest of the actors did better with this movie than I expected. What we've seen is just one of many terrible horror movies of the decade, and no way can I ever watch this movie again, even if it is for my son, and I don't want him to be sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of the poor acting I can remember seeing, it is the worst of the "Beverly Films", this is a very poor performance. There's little acting except for the main actors like Ron Howard and Paul Newman. And the story is awful, I would prefer to see another "classic" film over this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two problems. The first problem is that the film starts with an extremely confusing and poorly constructed plot that doesn't make much sense. The plot is not a mystery. It has a very long period where there is no continuity in continuity. The acting is bad, the dialog is poor and the cinematography is bad. It's almost impossible to understand what is happening and why the events relate to the plot, and this happens almost all the way through the movie. The second problem is the story is so bad that it cannot be understood unless the person directing is really good. This is simply a bunch of three long, confusing and unsatisfying scenes that don't work well at all. There are also some annoying elements in the story, which is a complete lack of dramatic context. The film itself also has some kind of a plot, but that's not enough to understand why it is important.  The third problem is because the character's actions are simply ridiculous. The characters are just awful. They are not all in agreement with the characters, the time line is extremely weird and hard to understand, and the story has poor direction and continuity. I recommend a really good movie, but a bad one at the worst of any. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The concept of "The Incredible Jessica" is stupid, stupid, and stupid! You can't even tell the story in a movie unless you watch it for an hour and a half, or even if you had to sit through a whole film, for the entire time. A plot, with an even more pointless protagonist, who apparently had the guts to take over a lot of his customers, to get revenge on those who had been tricked by their husbands, a total of three or more women who had apparently been cheated in their marriages by Mr. Jones, a third husband, and a first wife who seemed to be falling through it all and failed. The result was, of course, a horrible way to watch a film. The acting was awful, and the acting was even worse.  But, in the end, if you think it was a good movie, it was only the weakest of the horror movies I was able to find. Don't expect to enjoy this movie. I've even seen it on HBO. I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film's bad acting, too bad for such a film to be so low budget and not only a cheap one to make. The storyline isn't good and the whole movie is so dull that there isn't even any real story.  The only good thing about this film was that I enjoyed the fact that it was a comedy. In the end, I felt sorry for the director. The sad part of the movie was that this director actually liked his own work and didn't even have anything to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot recommend this film to anyone. I understand that, as a film, it is a pretty silly show. But it is so lacking in the sense of a proper movie that I cannot really recommend it. I didn't know what the director had been like when he made the film and I decided to watch it.  I was so surprised that I was unable to see any of the "good" stuff in the film, even though it is still funny and decent. I really feel embarrassed after watching the movie. It really does not even seem like a proper horror film at all. It seems to be based on a very bad, almost incomprehensible story, that I found it so hard to take seriously. A few lines in the story were pretty funny and the jokes were stupid, but all of the stuff was so bad that it is just laughable. I have to warn anyone who sees this film from the beginning of its existence, even if it is good and good at times, it just cannot be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i agree, this is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. The characters are terrible and the plot is not as good as you would expect. The camera work is bad, the dialog is bad as the writing was, the acting is bad. I don't understand the movie at all and don't intend to go on. Its obvious lack of focus, bad acting, and terrible special effects are just a poor idea to even a 3 star movie. There isn't anything decent in it. I think it's a complete failure for any of us who actually like it. Its not like I think people are going to sleep watching this, nor does it have a point. I do think people who have to get a big screen movie at the beginning of their movie need to understand the basics of the movie. If you're interested in getting a few days of sleep with the movie, it's no better than an extended episode of "the other guy's house".  If you really want to see something great, you'll need to watch more than 4 days of "The Omen", and watch it again for the first time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many reasons to dislike this film, and I find them one, and that's the biggest reason.  You have to sit through it without changing any plot. If you do that, you will be bored, and there's no real tension until the end of the film. It is sad when a film so bad you need something to take in its time. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and there is a lack of action. But the biggest problem is the fact that this film is so bad.  I cannot find any positives.  Other movies are better, even better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The story was a bit predictable, and the acting was not funny enough. The acting was awful, it's not funny, and it just got old. I've only seen this movie twice, and don't know what's up with it. This movie needs to be taken away from the shelf, and there are lots of other movies I'd like to review that are better. The ending is disappointing and just unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off I would recommend to stay away from this movie. The acting is poor, the dialogue is stupid, the editing is poor. This movie was badly edited to make it look like it was actually made, and I don't recommend watching this unless you want to see a piece of junk film.  But if you can't, or just want to have fun and enjoy the occasional humor, watch this movie, because it is simply worthless. There are few laughs out of this movie and I usually laugh about it. The story is so absurd it it makes me want to walk out and tell everyone that they can't wait for the next time.  The worst movie of my life I ever heard! It has a funny name, too, and is full of awful lines and horrible performances.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, the whole idea of the show was that there were several women in the crowd and the women thought that men were in prison and their hearts were breaking them.  There was some interesting things about the setting, particularly what women thought about each other and how the men were dealing with their own lives. They just didn't have any good relationships.  I found the whole series a bit annoying, and there was a lot of plot twists that were far less interesting than the rest of the series, which were about the people in the show and the people out of it. But still, the series couldn't come across as sincere and well-directed, and the acting was really bad. The series was probably most depressing of all the TV shows I've seen since I watched "KTV." If you want to try to watch it, I'd recommend this show as a "guitemaster's dream" or something with a lot less plot twists.  The whole series, in its attempt to make a comedic series, seems to lack a connection to the real world and it's not very funny. The show really went for laughs instead of just plain old sitcom jokes. But it's too late for everyone, including myself, by now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story lines are poorly written, with no real insight to the story being portrayed, and the plot seems to have been written by someone who could have written a better screenplay. The ending is so ludicrous that it is obvious that this movie would never stand on its own, and I couldn't find anyone else who actually agreed with this one. This is an obvious effort to appeal to fans of classic horror movies by resorting to a silly story. I wouldn be very dubious if one would actually care to rent this movie, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed in this film. It was an embarrassing film. I mean it had something to do with the story, but there were a few stupid lines that made me laugh, especially the last one. I don't care if anyone else actually thinks it's good, the film is awful! There is no plot, a plot is there but no dialogue. The characters are stupid, the characters are boring, the direction is terrible, the actors are bad, the music is bad. Don't waste your time watching this film, you just need to see this crappy piece of shit. It has to be done by anyone interested in a horror film. Do not waste your money, but if you don't, you're in the wrong category. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was made because the producer thought he could make money off of it. He is an overrated talent to say that. The acting is bad, the storyline is not good, the characters are boring, and the direction is poor at times. But the main reason I'm giving this bad movie is that it's not really a horror film like "House of Bones". It would be better if it were a horror/thory film like a horror sequel. If you're a horror movie, watch "House Of Bones". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard of this movie a while ago, though I hadn't really bothered it until I saw it on TV, and I was interested in the fact that it was being released on the DVD, which was not even a DVD, and it had a pretty low budget. This film was not only bad, it was awful in a bad way. The film is about a bunch of people that are in town, trying to get a job in town and one woman goes, to a job which happens to be in a very small place. That's about everything. This is about the worst film I've ever seen. In my opinion, this movie is a complete bore-land drama about people, whose lives are in a small town, and who don't know what their life is supposed to be. It is really pointless. In short, what do these people need? Well, what does it cost? They get some money, they pay to the town's owner, and then get some good clothes for the town. This was never meant to be a comedy or a horror film, and not even in the slightest bit of a horror movie kind of film. This movie should have been a horror/thriller instead of a comedy. The first movie I rented in 2005, called The Great American Zombie Apocalypse, had many of the same elements of a terrible horror movie. The fact that people could make a lot of money on it and have absolutely no money to pay for it makes it no longer enjoyable. The plot is not so scary in its first 30 minutes, but it is way too long. It's not scary at all.  This film fails in even the lowest of all possible standards of horror movies (that means a very low budget). It's absolutely terrible in it's overall quality, and there should have still been a few decent movies about it. The way the story of this film is structured is pretty unapparent, but not too exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a positive review about it, for it was good at times and some good at others. But this movie is completely awful, it's not a comedy, it looks just mean. When there are several good moments I think that it is good, but this movie never makes any sense. The acting is just terrible, the editing is horrendous, and some of the dialog looks like it's from the stage, like the "Myster Girl" episode. There are just two parts that are good. I mean the part about the boy trying to sleep with the girl, and the part where he says his girlfriend is getting so sick he thinks he's going to die from having sex with her. I guess that's how you get to know where you really stand in a movie,    The acting doesn't work well, the music is bad, the dialog is bad. The movie looks good for a comedy but not for a film, it really just a bad film.   I was not expecting this to be the best movie in the show, but it was so bad that it should be renamed "The Worst Movie Ever Made!". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only imagine that this movie is an attempt to bring into the world some kind of idea that everyone wants to call it a "Pony Mill". In the video, everyone is making fun about the most terrible movie ever produced by anyone. I have been through many movies that are good, and I don't want this one to be one of them. The movie itself is horrible and not even good, so please stop wasting your time. I give this movie a one-stars rating because, like most movies, you can't really judge its worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a complete and disappointing piece of work. The "real" life of a typical teenage boy, then told by a very convincing actor, has been grossly misrepresented by the scriptwriter.  This is the kind of film you'd expect to see in a sequel to a movie. The premise is bad, the dialog is poor, the actors are not good, the direction is bad. If you liked it in a sitcom, like "Mr. Peanuts" or "Angam" this will be hard to relate to. There are no funny scenes, no funny lines, no amusing characters, no humor, no special effects or special effects. The script is so bad, in fact, that it cannot survive the second half of its running time. If this film had a good script, like it has at least two great actors (I think the only ones who do have a real role are Kristy Russo, who is the best), and the acting was very good, that's not what happens in this movie.  It's not even true, it's not really like a movie, but it is still a poor movie, and in my opinion it's a waste of money.   I don't know if you liked this movie, because I didn't see it, but if you want to see something for free, why are you wasting money? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand what this film was about, but I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I really think that it was an insult to the people who actually have had to cope with the real issue of poverty. What they are complaining about is that their own lives have been worse than the lives of the people in the film.  I'm sure the people that thought it was interesting didn't make a movie about the plight of people in poverty. They have to face their problems, and all their problems in the face of the real problem. What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone at all thinks I'm being too hard on this film - I'm. You'd like it if it had a better plot. For this film it needs a decent plot.  The script fails. I can't tell how the writer came to write it. The dialog is not well done, the acting is poor, and the script is not too good to be funny.  I would recommend this to the fans of this terrible film, because it doesn't hold its own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My name was Jack, a 9 year old kid from England. He was the kid who got a ticket, and got to see an hour of the movies in the first half of the year. The movie ended at the end of the movie, and he and I have been completely disgusted. The ending is a complete bore! No story, no story about Jack. Jack is a character who has a girlfriend, and Jack gets into a drugstore fight with him. The action scenes are just unnecessary, and are just stupid. What an action movie does is to show us how many men who have done such a thing in their life -like the movie -is to get involved in the business of selling drugs for money, then to get into the sex trade and get into a life of selling fake drugs. But in a real movie, I believe it should have used some effort to come up with a story, and come up some idea. If they had done both these things they would have had done, and the movie would not have been wasted!  The movie is just a bad, awful movie. If it had been directed by some one who had done a real film, this would have been good movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is not only a terrible movie, it is also really pointless, and really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand you guys just want to laugh! But this movie fails to live up to the premise. If it is a comedy, I think it should be a serious comedy, but it doesn't really live up its own. If you are a fan of a movie that has so many holes it doesn´s impossible to understand the movie, let me tell you what happened to me. I can´s remember I was laughing so hard, I can even feel tears inside my head. And when this movie is not a comedy it is downright ridiculous. But I hope it doesn�t take away from the point. I don´t need a life of misery. I hope this movie has some interesting funny moments, but most of the time it is just a bore to listen to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is just too many movies that have to be made. The only way to get this movie over the edge is to not expect too much. I'd really like to encourage you to watch another one to try and give this movie a chance. If you go to this movie for the chance to watch something that actually works, you have wasted your time. If this movie is going to be another movie about a movie that works, then you should be able to at least try and find something that is at least slightly interesting. Unfortunately, there is no good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe that the best thing this movie has done is that it has been rated to 8. This movie was so bad that it could be a 9 or even 15. It fails in just about every way. The story was horrible as it starts out with the young, gay, and beautiful women on a boat. The characters were not even able to understand who the guy was and why he was in their lives. And the acting wasn't much good either. I never even saw the characters that were good, but that's a small thing considering how amazing the other characters were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion the most disappointing feature in a bad film is "Shuffling," the story being told for all to be false - just one line, which is totally meaningless. That's only three days of production - the story is never told, but then the film just keeps on repeating itself, and you've been bored for the past eight hours.  How much is a film this? It's one of three stories, not one big plot, not a full of story, and about all three, the plot is simply a complete, not-true story. There is nothing else - a new title, the actors are not the best, or the acting, or their personalities are convincing. But, what is most disappointing about "Shuffle," is the ending. It's a bad, boring, pointless film - with nothing whatsoever - it has nothing to show for the director and no purpose, that it never really worked.  The best thing about this film, in the worst category, is this movie's soundtrack. For some reason this is the only thing that keeps this movie alive, and I cannot understand why people would spend so much time to listen to them. They are a very poor film and I'd avoid them, but don't mind.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the hell did you expect? The first line, "It's better than the last movie: we're going to be very sorry. There are five guys sitting in a cell in the cell.  I guess it must have been something like a campfire fire, with the big tent that looked like it was an inside-the-the prison-like campfire.  Also, the guys in the jail were like the ones in the first film.  The characters were very stupid, acting like the characters in the original. The one good thing I've seen in this movie was the girl that said she was pregnant, which wasn't a lie.  In the end, it was a good scene, but the ending was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some very good moments, and it's a disappointment after all. For example, the main villain, James Caine, does a decent job as a villain, but when he makes a point about how bad things will be in the future, it doesn't.  There is a really interesting story of one guy being haunted by the ghost of another guy who died in the first few days, which we never get to know. It is only a bit dull, but it could have been better.  But I still wouldn't recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an insult to every child who has ever been a fan of a movie that could get away from me. There's some of my early memories of it, but I was not raised on this stuff. My favorite movie in the original was "Cabinet Dogs," which was about a teenage girl (she was a big animal) that is raised by a family who also happens to be her father (who also happened to be a pedopho). There's a scene where her dad is eating his sandwich with her hands and she doesn't get a job because she doesnno money for rent, so she decides to go to school for another year. And she's still a teenager and has some kind of friend, but you can tell that she's not really a friend.  Also, there's an overused movie premise. Some of it is good, like the scenes with the kid playing cards with an old lady with a kid, and the guy in a little video game who's just getting a few minutes at the school before class time. But a lot of it comes down upon poor actors, particularly the guy who plays his teacher.  A lot of the dialog is bad. There is no real action, no real story, and even no real dialogue. The movie is so bad that I only saw it once at its premiere because I thought I'd be showing the first installment. The scene that the kids are in when the kid gets away from a class is very depressing.  There's no story whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a strange premise; a "dramac" is to go to Japan to be filmed, but somehow the person is to get involved in an actual crime. I believe this is a major bad movie in the history of Japanese movie industry. I hope someone decides to look at this movie as a documentary, because it would be a very interesting story! It is also painfully bad from the Japanese point of view. There is nothing in the world that will improve this movie, not one. The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and there is absolutely no humor. I'm not sure this movie would have been made were it weren't so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had always been amazed in this film with my first views of "The Overninger's House". I had loved this film as a kid and thought it was a masterpiece.  It was an insult in the end, I am a sucker for the filmmakers who made it. The way that the storyline is structured is simply horrible.  I give this bad movie one point for one thing, it's not funny, it was just plain depressing and not funny.  The other point is that I am not happy with the way the "Overninger House" is made up. I don't understand how they do it, it is simply sad. I believe they are getting desperate for the story to be funny so they could make the movie better. The actors were good, but not very good. The story is very depressing, and no suspense, and I do not think it's worth even a rating in the 7/10 area. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that would not even warrant the 'rating' would be this bad. The dialogs are not even funny enough to keep me watching. But I am a huge fan of this series.  My biggest problem is the 'Poker' and 'Reality.' There are too many scenes that are unnecessary, the editing is bad and the 'plot' is unbelievable. There is no 'cutenure' for the actors. There are no funny moments, no funny scenes. Just bad movies and that's about it. The 'Real' is a sequel of 'Reel' which is about as good as this.  I don't have any problem with the 'Reals' though I would love to see more 'Reels' in the next installment, but at the same time the 'Invisible Ink' shows the same trend. The only saving factor is the story. The idea of the'reals' is good and I don`t think that is the reason why people want to go watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one had a pretty good script, I thought. But the plot isn't real enough, and even the music was bad. The music was good though.  I was very unhappy with the ending. I wasn't even surprised that the guy had a daughter in the ending, because I know it has always been that way. The ending seemed so lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something else going on here. And that's what's in the first two paragraphs. There's three or four "acts" that seem to be at least vaguely interesting or even semi-plagem-friendly, the first being about the "good" character of the lead, the second about a drug plot, and the third about a rape scene. And don't get me wrong, the lead's acting is decent, and there's a decent plot but the movie has no real substance to it.  The lead's character is weak. There are no lines, the film is not "real" at all. It really is a movie to avoid. The film has no interest whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so weak and not good. The movie has a lot of stuff about sex that makes you want to sit on the sofa and cry about your self-hate and how your girlfriend is probably thinking about how badly you hate this movie and how she can't work out or go back to your life. I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking to see this movie. I highly recommend you get a second chance to see it and see what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this is a good movie, it suffers from badly scripted and plot-driven dialogs. The film is also boring and a disappointing, and the ending is totally pointless. Also, the film is totally lacking in a special effects scene. It looks like the filmmakers would have done better than they did. In my opinion, if you have not seen any of Michael Oster's films, then you might enjoy this film, but there is a lot of stuff in the film that doesn't make sense, including too much editing and overly bad-written dialog. The actors are all terrible and don't do a very decent job of being a hero. If you like Michael Olander, you will not be happy. I would not recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't care. I was in the movie for my first time reading the books, and the first book I ever read was in my first year of college. They weren't the same stories in the first movie and they weren't like the books I read in high school, so I was hoping to read the books in the future.  This movie just isn't worth any of the money. They can't say the same thing in the books you're reading. It's about as long as a movie you could rent when you're an hour late. What a good movie: movies don't have to have a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of The Simpsons (the show) and of the series in general (as an avid TV viewer), but i did not even care that this had to be made, as it was so bad and made for no good reason. I was a bit surprised. But, the funny stuff was good. I have also been annoyed by a number of poorly-made comedies in the past, so I was willing to watch this. It was painfully hard to watch, and I'm a little sad that it didn't stick. But my thoughts are that there are very few jokes. This isn't a bad film, but its performance is just plain bad. The characters were not funny. I really did not like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been bored with a bad video, but I get it now. I can't comment on this one very well, but it had the usual predictable stuff I've gotten the majority of times. It got the worst part of the movie. I never was happy to have been shown such a shallow plot, and I had to sit on it so that I didn't get into it for the ending. The ending is quite predictable and unsatisfying, as you can see. It's really bad on the music. I think most of the music was OK, though some was not. I thought I was a part of this movie because the producers were very bad with the music and I knew I was there for a reason. When it came to the final scene, I was annoyed and disappointed, and not in a good way.   There are only one or two "good things" in this movie. But, in the end, I'd rather enjoy a good movie than a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. I have to admit that I saw the movie when I was 7 and it was only a few years later. There was no story or plot to begin with and there is no story line. Nothing was interesting, no characters are interesting, and there were no dialog. I don't know what happened to the actor and the female characters, why would anyone want them in this movie? Why would anyone pay money to rent this movie again when there are better movies out there? This movie has the worst acting I have ever seen. I am disappointed. It really doesn't even need to be played out. I really wanted to rent a copy of this movie because I was bored with this movie, but I just gave it one star because I found that a good movie with good acting can be very entertaining and very enjoyable. The movie isn't even close to good, just a bad experience that I didn't want to watch again. It needs to be remembered by those who have been so stupid. I know what is in this film's future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never thought that there was such a long-running gag gag I was so bad for my friends. In fact, I thought it was more like a fake television series. I was bored by this one for the last couple of hours. I mean, I laughed. So, I guess it's true. This film is so bad that it's hilarious. It's so bad because it isn't funny in any way. It starts out looking like a piece of theater drape. That's how I describe it. This is so, so bad. I'm sorry, I'm glad I didn't fall in love. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is like some sort of bad cult fandaman episode. I don't think that any good movie made about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the plot and pacing are just too poor to be believable. One of the actors, as portrayed by Gary Barrell, has good ability in acting. However, he does not act well and thus does not deliver the most believable portrayal of a young boy with no experience in acting, though he does a good job in it. The story is even worse. The characters are not convincing and the plot is too simplistic. The storyline is the story is simply unbelievable and the characters are too cliché to be realistic, such as being unable to act. The film does not take itself seriously, despite it being a comedy. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone considering it's not only bad but it could be taken seriously by those who do not take seriously. It is a comedy but not a comedy that would become serious if people actually tried to find humour in a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director's name is "HARD" because they are so unimaginative that it's easy to miss this. And a really terrible acting performance. I'd give the director a "B" for this one, if he was a serious actor. And the soundtrack...I think I can hear voices in the video at the beginning of the movie, even if they were muffled and silent. I just can't concentrate on any of the dialog. The film was so bad that I expected it would be used for a parody of some movie I saw recently - I suppose it was for a young movie: a very dull, but I can definitely understand that. It really sucked up energy. The actors were so bad too. My guess is that some actors knew what they were doing, but didn't care.  If you want to see an anti-comic film, then watch some of the early anti-war films of the late 1940s. It just won't have as much gore as the film in "The Thin Man" does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got really scared. I mean, really scared for the first time. But I knew the director and editor for what they were doing. This is the first movie I ever watched in my life, and it was not like "Starlight Summer" and "In The Shadows". "In the Shadows" was so-so-bad that it had to be avoided. "In Night" was OK, but "In Day" really was bad.    It has all the same problem. This movie is not a horror movie. It is a comedy that never could deliver a good movie.  It is so bad that you can't sleep unless you really want to. This story is so dull that it's not even funny. It's so boring, so stupid and so bad, so funny that it never gets laughs. It should have been a comedy, but it's turned into a horror, so that made it more unpleasant to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it becomes apparent, I can understand why it was released, but I couldn't understand how anyone can love this movie. Even after watching it, I still find it difficult to sit through the first few minutes of the movie. The storyline is nothing interesting, the characters are flat and forget-able, and the dialogue is so badly executed that it's a real pain to listen to. I have to say that I don't recommend this movie, but it was only one of several of the films I've seen this year, so my advice is: don't waste your time here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an insult to everyone. It is the least interesting movie I've seen since I've been in high school. I don't want to believe they are going to make this movie. Even if you want to see an interesting movie it should be for children. They did it with kids and there was a little bit of magic but it wasn't a good movie.  I didn't think they would get away from it, but it is too sad to live a life based on religion that has to be taken seriously. I'm ashamed. This movie doesn't even qualify as a short-film film for kids. It doesn't make you feel better or more grateful for anything in life. You may find a good one like this in a sequel or another movie, but I hope no one will make it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really upset. I have always been a fan of "Bunch" and so much this movie didn't work. I was so upset, I never have been happy about this film. I can only take the time to get to work so I can see some of the actors out. I am so upset that I can't even make any money off of it.  What is it that has to go with this movie? Some of the acting is laughable. I did see the acting in this movie, but that's not enough to make me enjoy it!   The acting, which I didn't see in this film at all, is just bad. The acting is extremely bad and there are not enough moments that I like to watch, it is all bad. I would never even mention the acting. I think that this film has more problems then than some of "Rampage".  What was my intention to say, that it was a pretty stupid, lazy film? The acting was bad, the direction was bad and the acting wasn't funny, all. The other problem with this film was that it seemed to be so very bad that I was literally afraid to watch it. I guess I didn\'t even get that far and still didn\'it even get through the entire movie, and I still saw my first 10 minutes of it and still wanted to finish it so I didn\ remember it. It is absolutely terrible. I gave it a 1/10/4.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started in earnest, but after about half of the episodes, the movie felt very silly. It was very annoying to see the characters talk and act like they are on the television shows.   As a movie, it should have had some story elements. If the movie had one, it would have been hilarious, but unfortunately it seemed to be an overly complicated and contrived. What is funny is the fact that there wasn't a good movie for us to see. It seems to be a really lame way to act and talk.  Other points:  It starts off in a kind of way, but that's just so, so, boring, and the movie is hard to watch for anyone to see how horrible it is. The ending isn't so bad, but it didn't quite go anywhere, it just seemed to go in and out. The way it ends doesn't work well.  The whole thing is just so bad that it just doesn't make any sense.  There isn't any decent actors in it. There aren't any good scenes for the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping to see this movie and I am a little bit disappointed. I was hoping to enjoy this movie but not and after seeing it, it was too long to enjoy. I mean I am not going to go into this movie with an objective rating because of the acting and acting, but this movie was bad. I couldn't believe in a movie like this unless you are to have an eye-wipe yourself through the entire movie. I think that the acting is bad, the dialog is bad and the acting didn't go down right. I did my best not to go for it because it's really bad, but the director was very good. They were in their 3's and 3's when he told them how it was. I could not believe that he was this bad when he was directing this movie. He was also not very good when he is directing the other two movies.  I did give my money back. I probably saw this movie in 3D but you wouldn't get much entertainment from it and if you don't like this movie then don't go to watch it because you might miss a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it so much, it's a good idea, but don't think about that. I gave this one 1 star because it's great, but if I had to rank it 1 star at all, then it's bad. I give it 1½ stars out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In another review, I am not sure that this movie was as bad as the other "Unrealized" movies of the 1990. But what about all the other movies? Of course, the main character in this one was James Dean Hall, so I don't know why he is in this movie.  He is, at least, a major character in the movie. But there are several small characters that do not get involved with the main story (or the plot). They are totally insignificant. So, if you like a movie about a plot of some teenaged girl, you will probably like it.  There were two movies, the first of which I saw this movie as a short review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The concept was interesting, but not very good for what it says about the movie itself. I am not going to comment on the movie, but I wish this guy got more work. He's not good enough as an actor, he's not bad at anything. He is too weak, too lazy, and too inconsistent. He should be more well balanced. He does not get close to the top.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After one good review it's time to go. And the movie is not just bad, but really worst. It's absolutely unbelievable! You can't even believe it. The movie is so bad that it's not worth watching. Just think a little bit about the story. If you see it, you'll never be able to understand it. There are many parts where the characters behave like the characters of "The Matrix" and "Honey" just by walking through. There's no dialogue, no continuity, no development, no growth, and no real action or suspense. The main character was a fairly good actor, I guess it's what we do in real life. It was probably the weakest part of the movie. He was acting more in the scenes than the actual scenes.  I thought the movie would have been better if he had taken his cues from the film to improve his performance.  The only thing that matters is that it was filmed so bad! It also had one good scene in the beginning where he got thrown off his horse.  But after seeing "The Secret Weapon," I think this is one of the worst movies I've seen. It has to be the worst of the "Matrix" movies and even worse than "H Honey"! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is hard to relate my opinions of this movie to anything, but it seems to be based around a young teenager, who thinks he is special, and the acting seems to lack empathy. The film is not even funny or funny, the film itself lacks a sense of empathy, and it seems as though it might just be a joke, but even the most passive of fans of this film should be willing to see the ending. But it is so bad, and so poorly presented that the fact that this is an 'unnamed' project makes it even worse. The best way I can describe this film is that it is just an "joke". But that's not an 'joke'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie before I was born. I mean the guy had it for some reason. That doesn't mean it was any good. This movie is not a comedy at all. It's very disturbing to think people should have paid a million dollars for this film. I think it was a very bad idea to watch this movie and call it a comedy. I really believe it's very bad. I do not understand why I would have paid my money to rent it. I believe this movie is very bad for anyone to rent. There is nothing funny or funny about it. It is just sad. It shows a very uncomfortable mood and that's all I've come across when renting movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst horror movies I've seen. You can barely hear what is coming. There are no real characters and there are no special effects. The music has been bad too. And I don't think I can describe it as a horror movie. If you know any horror fans, you will know this. Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You don't need to see more of a "great" movie to realize you don't. And don't even watch this. Don't. Please don't waste your time.  I really thought I was going to see one of the great movies of the late 1980s. It was about that time. I still had hope but I had the only hope. I did think the movie was interesting, the acting was decent, and the story was not horrible (though a little bit weak), but I think that if you are going to watch it, please don't do. Don´t waste your life and don´t think about the movie, its good and just don´'t think about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like most comedies like the old ones, but this one disappoints me. It was so bad, so bad it hurts. I don't think my girlfriend was nice enough to go in the end and I think this was the most disappointing of this movie. I really didn't expect anything positive about it, but I didn't understand it at all. I think the director is an idiot and should never see such movies again. It sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so poor that it needed two reviews to correct all my comments. I've seen this movie on TV, I've read it on the IMDb. So I'm in the film club, which is not in the movie, but it's pretty fun to have a couple of hours of your time on IMDb, and when I got the time, I thought I was in for a few days and then decided I'd stop watching the movie. Luckily, it never took two minutes to start and the movie never went anywhere. After half of the movie was over, I finally gave it back to a friend and he didn't like it too much.  I think it's about time that it's time to retire, and I don't recommend this movie to anybody. It really should be called "A Good Death," and I'd like to take a shot or two of it and see it again. If you're an "fauxesman," enjoy watching someone trying to kill someone, but don't do it if it kills you. If your friends are in the same room, it's not worth your time to waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie when I saw it on the Blu-Fi box (in the bargain store.) I was hoping that it would have a good movie because it looked so nice, but that wasn't the case. I was extremely disappointed, I think the acting was bad as well as the storyline. I think that all the other cast members were really bad, especially the actress. I also thought that the special effect didn't make it so good. It wasn't like that person you see in the video. It didn't really feel like a special effect, and I had no idea what was going on. Also, I couldn't figure out which actors were acting how much or how much they had to do for the special effects.  I think I would have had liked to see a movie that had some good actors, which I would like to say, because when I was looking for a movie, I thought about it more and more if they were really good. However, I was expecting to see better, and if there is a good film in the world, I want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie because it was a piece of crap...I didn't mind the fact that it was about a teenager dying. But it was really a bad sequel. I think that it is an excuse for an aging actor to try to make something good again.  In the sequel, there is a lot of cute characters, a plot involving a vampire and an even worse sex scene...the problem with this film is that it's just the same sort of movie that people like to watch.  I think the director doesn't have any interest in making this movie, but he has to create a positive review about the movie. It is obviously a bad film, but it doesn't need to be about a good film, the plot couldn't be better. The film is pretty stupid, but at the same time, it is still an interesting piece of trash. I'm not saying it is funny, but the characters of the characters are so stupid, the dialogue is just bad, and the acting really sucks. The only person who is good in this movie is the one with "supernatural" looks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the movie in high school. I was annoyed by this movie. I think it had a more realistic ending. I'm sorry that my sister didn't understand it. This is truly a bad way to go. What was the point of this movie? Well, the plot was good and well-planned. This movie was bad because it didn't come to a natural end. It was all a lie. It got bogged down in an awkward way that I couldn't find out that it was over and over. I'd like to see a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed and angry. I was also disappointed that it was so bad. I'm a fairly serious person, so I thought what I saw on the cover was real. I felt that after a couple of months of watching this movie that it should have been left in the archives. There were some moments that were very good and the ones that weren't. I didn't mind the old actor who was not part of this movie, and some actors who were very interesting. Some characters were very bad, and others were very, let's say, OK. I just wanted to see the film to understand how bad it was and how stupid it was. I also wish I had more info about the actors and writers involved in this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I find it amusing to see people commenting on it as funny, even if they didn't. And I'm not joking. I'm really sad. I found the premise of this film to be pathetic. I was hoping to see more entertaining movies in this genre, but I can't stand for this one. I'd have to agree that the whole thing is a bunch of jokes that got people laughing but failed. I don't think you can really blame the actor for any of it, but he should at least try to stick a few jokes in there.  So if you are looking for a film about a movie that is completely devoid of entertainment or even a good movie, I'd advice you to just give it a pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing more than a poor excuse for some of the film's characters to be portrayed as a bunch of goofballs with their stupid antics and ridiculous acting. What is more, they don't quite reflect the characters' acting, which is completely unsympathetic for all of them. The film's dialog is annoying, and it just doesn't work.  So, if you are looking for a film that isn't on the level of hilariously stupid, you might be looking at something that's actually funny, or you might have simply gotten bored by the film.  If you don't care for such things, go see something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing part of this movie is the storyline of the girl who was sent to a new house to a mysterious house. This is supposed to be the main element of the film, but in fact it wasn't. The girl's ex-wife, an old lady with the same name that was sent by the police, seemed to be dead and the police were only able to find a body, which they were able to revive from the body she was in (see "The Last Days of the House") only a few hours earlier. The main storyline of "House" is as though it's been taken from a movie made in the 1980s. This movie is obviously very unsatisfactory and there's nothing redeeming about it except the fact that the "house" is apparently a house made from an old house that had nothing to do with anything in the real world.  There are no real characters of any real life characters in this movie. There are about 40 characters in the movie (with the exception of the wife and the new house owners) and it is just terrible. In fact it is almost like a series of "Twin" movies. There's no real plot line in "House", and it feels like a porno movie. The ending could be better if the movie had some decent acting and some decent story telling. In the meantime this movie has no ending and there are a lot of scenes that really should've been cut. They could have been cut together, but it didn't matter. The characters of the women that we found in the house are pretty bland and unsympathetic, and they are pretty stupid.  The story is obviously totally unrelated to the main character, but the main part of the movie that really matters is the character that we find in the new family that they sent us to question. The character in this family that is killed in the "House' is named "Mrs. Wilcox". I'm fairly positive that we'll get some more info on the character, the house owner and the character in the film later. However the main characters are the same sort of characters that we've seen in "Babu". There are some other women in the story and the main villain is very obviously a woman. This reminds us of the character from "The Matrix" who is called "Elena" in the Japanese version of "The Six Faces". This is another bad movie from a bad Japanese movie: horrible acting, horrible plot, bad camera
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an absolute failure, this movie should never have been made, because there is nothing to show this movie. I'm so sorry. In the beginning of the movie I had hopes for this movie, but after seeing the plot I was very bored and even more bored by the scenes.  I can barely care less about it and its actors, but still I must admit to having seen the show so many times before. I know there is some magic going on. There is a chance that the movie will not be made into a full film, but I cannot see it's true potential. I cannot say if it was possible for me to see this movie and get all the laughs that it could get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful, very disappointing, and even worse than I would have imagined. I was stunned when it came out.  It is a piece of work, but the acting is simply awful, and the camera is simply bad. Also, the only thing I can't believe is that the director is so unaware of how to film it. You don't have to try any more, and you should really just watch it to avoid trying to see more than the two main actors.  Also, there is nothing interesting whatsoever. What I thought was interesting was that there were multiple references to previous film (not just one) in the film - like a scene where I found a book, a restaurant or a TV network - the same thing as a copy of a DVD series: a book that doesn't exist.  In one scene there is a scene with a prostitute, who comes into the diner with her boyfriend. When she comes out the hotel, he hands her a gun and leaves the hotel. She is then chased into a restaurant, and it is clear that he's still involved in a prostitution situation. The prostitute is then killed (or dies?) by a truck driver on the street. The next scene is a murder. It is clear from the DVD that the girl is dead and her body is being transported to a room in a hotel.  The film is about three hours long, with only one story. The other story is a bunch of trash, nothing to be proud of, nothing especially involving the characters, but even worse trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a poor attempt at a comedy/comedy/exploration movie. The characters are too badly flawed to be believable. There's too little money to justify this film, and the ending seems to be a plot-cycle.  Overall this movie was pretty boring, but there were some interesting ideas. I think that a decent film would have been better than this one. The movie was about a bunch of old men who had their lives ahead of their time, who got so much better than they expected. Unfortunately this movie is just one part of a bad lot of films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot understand why it is so low-budget for this movie. There's a lot of great movies from the 80's (maybe this was just an early example of the film.) But this is a disappointment, and there are no good movies about the 90's.  I'm surprised that they don't even make it to the big screen, but it looks like they did some fine work, like this film. The acting is terrible, and it's all completely bad.  Overall the film is a real disappointment for a first-timer like myself. There should have been a sequel. It should be about the "Dirty Duck", "Scary Duck". I don't think I'll see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was simply the worst. I'm not really a "fan" but just an average, bored, stoned, and pretentious film-maker with a bunch of cheap jokes and bad direction. There are some good parts but the acting is poor and there are no funny moments.   The movie was not only bad but also extremely hard to enjoy. There is nothing else in it that I liked. Nothing was funny, no funny lines, no character development. The special effects were weak and unnecessary. The story is about an incompetent and stupid human who wants to rule the world, who tries to rule it but fails because of poor direction, the ridiculous acting and bad dialogue. I did enjoy "Cocoro" and the rest of the "Iggy's Revenge", but even that movie didn't make any sense.  I gave this movie a low rating. It was way too long, way too stupid, too cheesy and too stupid. I give this movie one point, if you're tired of watching porn or just want to rent it, don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a commercial screen after I left my house. I thought it was funny, but not funny. I had to see if I wanted to like it. I guess I should have watched it after I had seen my 3D print. I tried to get it, and I wasn't happy with it. There were a couple of funny jokes (the first one was when the female actor is naked, and there was a gag about a boy who was naked in front of the girls). The ending was one of those things you just read a joke: if you can see it. That didn't work.  I mean, it wasn't just stupid, it was just plain stupid. It is so bad, it's so bad that I couldn't sit, even if I could get a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is simply bad, from the very beginning, and there are no suspense or suspense whatsoever, so all the actors are simply going through the whole movie to deliver nothing, and the viewer's only satisfaction comes by watching them act.  There are no funny moments, and in fact the movie becomes boring right from the start, especially after the first hour.  It should also be noted that the acting is not good either, as the actors don't act on any character, or even on their own lives, but rather are acting to a "scary" audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few of the actors were good, but they got the job because they were the best. And the rest was so poor it didn't seem like any good film:  It was not at all that good.  The direction was terribly lame. Some of the acting was decent. The characters were just so bad it just seemed like a bad version of "Little House of Belville".  But most of the dialog was poor. The plot was about nothing, and the characters were so stupid it was hard to believe that they could act well. I think the director should take the time to fix these things.  I could not find any better words.   4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has a story line and some good actors, but I think the story is very much overblown, and the characters are badly acted. Also, the music has no theme of life in it. A lot of young girls are supposed to be funny, and they are not. They aren't interesting to me. You need to see a sequel and a sequel after. I really don't think there's anything else in the movie that could be better than this. It just don't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you do this film, I'm very dubious that you would find your life worth the suffering, so that's my answer. This was one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. And the whole movie is so bad that it hurts your life. I'm not kidding, the movie was pretty terrible, the music was bad as well, and I'm sure the cinematography was OK but the acting was really bad, the direction was bad, and the acting just bad. And don't forget about the acting, the acting in this movie was terrible, and some of the actors didn't stand well in some scenes. Some of the characters are so poorly written and they're not good. And there was one or two moments when you had to think. That is one of three reasons why this is bad. I don't even need to mention the acting. The characters didn't behave properly and none of them acted properly, they didn't act properly and didn't give proper respect to the main character. And I'm sad that I can't comment on some of them because I donth feel like I can. I do understand that it is a cult film.  But don't waste your time listening to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this movie and the reviews were bad. I laughed at the first review that said that the movie had been rated "unrated". That's about as high as I could have rated the first of the five movies in this list. I just don't understand. I tried not to comment on this movie. I gave the movie a rating of 7. It just couldn't keep this rating low enough. It was way too bad to be "un-rated", even though the movie was very, very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really laughed at this film. I would have rated it a 7. It was terrible. I couldn't even find it in the box to find it. I know there are people who love it, but don't put yourself through the movie. Also, it has a pretty stupid ending that is, at least, predictable and never is it. The film doesn't seem like it was made to last for a long time. A man dying is probably going to hell if he stays alive. It's just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poorly written script. This film is boring and contains so many poorly written elements that no one who was watching this film from the beginning can understand what it was about. If you knew nothing about the movie it's time to finish this movie. A plot to the story of the movie is badly written. A lot of the film is so bad that it's hard to understand what the film was about and what it could have been about. The main problem is the actors don't get to do much in the movie. The actors aren't good and don't do a decent job in it. This movie is so weak and there is no story! The actors and the directors don't care about being in the film and the story is so poor and there isn't enough to see the movie as a whole. The ending is weak and disappointing, and the movie could have easily been saved if the screenplay was well written.  The film is supposed to be a sequel to "Lakers Of Darkness" but I haven't seen any sequel so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can honestly say it's the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean this movie is bad at worst, and I didn't know when I was coming on this movie. The fact that the guy at the beginning was going to be the guy that would win a movie, and after the movie finished, I thought about this movie because it was a really bad. He was the only bad actor in this movie, in fact he is one of the worst actors. He has some good acting, but he has none of the charisma that the other actors in this cast have. The actor with the same name as in "Happiness," the actor that is supposed to be in this is very good. It was so bad, it made me feel sick just thinking about it. It had a ridiculous ending, so I did my usual the next day, but I did not finish watching it until I was sick. This movie really needs a plot or at least a real ending. It also has an ending. The ending is quite predictable. The actors did all the things they said, but you just wanted to see what the hell they said. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you were to see this movie, then you're going to lose your interest in this rubbish movie. You're going for the joke of this stupid plot. Don't think this movie will work out for your own, and if you think it will work it, then it's going to be so stupid that you'll wonder why anyone would watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Great Adventure of the Dog" is a bad and predictable comedy that lacks all credibility and credibility. The plot is unbelievable, especially the plot to "bring back a lost time traveler" is just an excuse to justify a gag that involves a very fake dog. Also, I really didn't get this film. I am a fan of Animal House, but this film isn't even good Animal House-style. The film is too hard to see, too bad for me to even make a funny gag with such a serious lack of humor. The movie doesn't even make sense, since it relies on an extreme amount of cheese, something I was very surprised to find out about the plot. I can't even count how much is supposed to have been spent on this cheese-making. So if you aren't an Animal House fan, don't go out to see this film unless you have to. The only thing I can say is that the movie is not funny, but at least it has plenty of action and it is interesting enough. However, there are plenty of things that really should be happening in the movie. What would have been a big laugh if the movie really made sense to me? But it wasn't the way I saw it, and I suspect this is a very small joke of the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an absolutely terrible film, and I was hoping for an interesting movie to see this film so that I could get myself into it. I was expecting to find a decent film to see so that we could actually talk to the other film that has this plot. I found the movie was full of so many bizarre plots that I couldn't follow what I was watching. I even got the ending of the movie so that it would have been a waste of time. I wasn't even able to follow the plot and the plot lines. I mean, if there is a good version of the plot, I would expect to see the film. But it wasn't worth as much as a movie. What a shame to see a movie that had an ending that was so stupid. I am also glad that I didn't see the sequel. It was definitely the worst film that I have ever seen. It is also sad to see that a movie from a child film studio is completely stupid, and it should have been rated. It should be rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was about half of the time. I didn't even care for the acting. That's all good. The movie was not funny. The dialog was so flat and unsympathetic. The acting was so terrible that it could be expected of a better film. I expected that the producers would have done something to improve it, but they didn't. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. My husband and I are in total disgust. We'd never laughed. The story is so bad that it is very hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has so many of the same problems as The Untouching, I've seen the movie before, and they are only marginally more enjoyable than a piece of gum. Also, there are very many ways to make a good movie, I don't know if anyone has ever made a movie like this one before, so I'm not sure what is the point. It has a lot of really bad dialogue, and most of the people I know who have seen it before give the plot of this movie a high five. I can tell you how stupid the person who is in the film is. He talks with her and the people who are in it are stupid and don't really listen. How can you make sense out of such a movie? It's a movie where you're just listening to a bad joke. This movie is not entertaining, but the producers tried to make it look good. What do you think of this? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I've seen many of them in my life, but they never seem to be quite as bad as this movie. There's a lot of crazy characters and they're all awful, but I've never seen a film with as terrible acting that I liked. I don't know why but I think the writer for this movie was obviously influenced by Hollywood. This is a movie about the people who are in the film, and I think that they should have put some effort into the script. It is pretty stupid, and there's no redeeming factor. It's supposed to be a movie of "people," but I donth think there's enough room for people to be involved in it. This movie could be good if it were a true story, but that's where things are normally done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film doesn't even begin to be funny as this thing is. The story starts off as the police officer arrives at a hotel where a gang of hoods are headed in their way to kill the next victim. The gang leader is shot and his associate is stabbed. He has to escape because the police will not follow him. He then leaves with the police and leaves the hotel and he then goes back to a hotel. He sees some of the victims of the earlier murder and beats up some of them.  When he returns to the hotel, he has a new crew of hood and associates. They meet with a bunch of female thugs, but there is no information on who they were and who they wanted to be. He beats up their gang members and gets them back in the hotel.  The gangster who is the leader of the gang is also involved in another plot to murder the victims. He tries to go after the gang leader and when he does, he is beaten up by his friends. The police get the gang member and put him in a jail cell with the gangster. The victims are killed by the gangsters and the police then proceed to kill everyone else in the jail. The victim is not identified, but the women and the gang members are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't care if people liked this movie. I thought the movie was pretty interesting, even though there wasn't much going on. The storyline was pretty predictable and the characters were pretty boring, no one actually cared about the characters. The movie is the most stupid movie I've seen since "Rampage Music" which I found this too. The acting was pretty bad, the music was bad, and the acting, even the voice acting was bad. The ending is so bad I wish I could give this movie a zero rating, not that it's an action-film! I'd go to the website, and if somebody would recommend it, I would try my best to find another way to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been watching this movie for a couple of weeks and had it on the shelf. When I saw it I thought it would be interesting and I really liked it. Unfortunately, this movie was just an awful, pointless, stupid movie. I didn't even care that it was a part of some show or movie. It just made me wonder why they were wasting money on an awful movie. If I were a younger person and didn't know any of the story of the movie I would probably have been a little bit happier at finding some of my favorite movies in other places. This movie is so bad that the only good review about it is that it is so stupid.  I know I'm in the middle of this movie, but if I was to watch this movie again I would never do anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. I was really looking for an escape from the everyday reality of life, but was really expecting a horror/thricry horror story with a good story and that which was completely lacking. I read through the comments on the original review and the reviews and the main theme of the movie was very, very bad. It wasn't that bad in the original book but I'm sure it was. It could have been a good film about the movie being so bad that people might lose interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was simply terrible and is about the worst film I have ever seen. I was expecting an entertaining film with a catchy soundtrack and good story. Unfortunately, it just flatly failed to be that film. I never expected it to be worth 5 out of 10 minutes. It certainly does not have a good story - the characters are poor and there is not a lot to do. The story is completely nonsensical and the writing is not strong at all. It's absolutely not worth picking up. But it could have been better than a movie: 3 out of 5.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this film twice, and I am completely disappointed.   1.1: In a realist style of a film, we'll see a man that has just been beaten for the second time, with no hope to recover. In the next scene, we will see a bunch of women in the gym, who obviously don't want anything to do with him. We will then find him, in a white shirt, in the parking lot of a motel that is not an actual motel, we get the idea of the "Dating Situation". They get married at the hotel, where they are married, we find the two together in their kitchen, and we find out he's a man. When we find him in a car, we ask him what his plans with regards to the woman he's married to, we are not allowed to film anything about the girl's story. The scenes run all too quickly, with little plot and no plot, and it is not clear what the man is about, he never shows his face, and he never talks to a woman.  1st of the 3 films: 2/2/3/2 (the same) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very bad as it seemed to be a straight-shooter style horror film. The story seemed so badly put together that it should have been much longer than it was. It seems like some of the characters were just a few lines, and the story seemed to have no motivation, or anything else to support it. The special effects were horrible, and they were all over the place. The soundtrack was bad, too, too. It seemed like this was an old horror film, or a one that was so badly made it couldn't survive in theaters. I gave this movie 4 out of 10. I didn't really care for this film at all. It was just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot line goes on for many pages, but you know what this movie is! It's like a cartoon, except that you're supposed to like it. It has to be a "comboiled" film that's supposed to be funny for its plot.  The acting is awful. The story is horrible.  It's not funny! It is really horrible. It just isn't funny, even by an American! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been involved in the movies over the years, and I don't believe any of them worked well, as far as acting.  But they were all great for the first 2½ hours.  Of course, the only reason that any of those movies worked is that their plot was actually predictable. That's not much consolation.  There was also an entirely unbelievable twist in the last one.  I can barely count the number of times I was told. This should be the last movie I can get tired of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to say:  I'm a movie fan. My interest has been drained. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. It has an enormous plot, very lacking in any sense of structure and no plot development whatsoever. And not to mention that it has no plot and it's a rip-off from "The Secret"; which I found the book was better and it actually, more imaginative. That's a very short point in terms of its story. It starts out with the story of a child named "Jenny", who is sent off to a boardinghouse in Los Angeles by her parents, and who turns into a girl named "Kitten". Kitten is a sad child, but her parents take her to a mansion on the outskirts of town in Los, California. There, when they find the boy they have to commit to a mental health clinic. That happens in an incredibly unappeted setting that looks like a throwaway movie set for kids.  The movie has two people. There are no good stories, no good character, and no good scenes. What is so disappointing about it? A lot of people in the world want to kill Kitten. You'll find a lot of books in the book that cover the topic. But they weren't quite willing to kill off Kitten in "The Mysterious Child".   The story starts with a fairly predictable setup. There's a little romance between Kitten and the woman that she's in love with. I guess she's not an ideal husband for the guy. What makes her special is not that she is very unhappy and she is in love, but rather that she can make the guy her life, and that she gives him everything she wants. She's unhappy with her husband, but it is also his sister. And that isn't necessarily what makes it sad.  As time goes on, Kitten becomes involved in the murder of another woman. Kitten then murders "the girl" (who is named Samantha) in order to have "the real "mom" (Kitten) kill off Samantha's new husband. There is no explanation for why it happened and it is all pretense. The "real" Kitten" is a boy, whom Kitten murders in order for his sister and his sister's husband to have him killed off and to have a sibling kill off another girl named Samantha. I have never seen this story. I've never thought this movie was more depressing than anything else
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is so bad, that it's almost indistinguishable from the other series. The action sequences are poor, but the storyline is not bad. However, I do think that there is a deeper story in the series. It's not really clear, although I would like to know. There's a new element that is not found in the previous series. There are these new things in the world that are important and even threatening. But they're not really important in the current world, which makes it too convoluted to relate to the story. The story also is not original, since it is so very basic, not original to the series, and it is not really a story. Also, the acting is bad. I don't know the actors, but I do know the actresses do a good job, which is mostly wasted the movie. I just like seeing the acting.  I know that this is a series of one film, but it's just as bad as the one series. And i don't even get into the sex, since there is no sex in this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie so bad. I don't believe in the "realistic" approach to movies like this. This movie just proves that they aren't trying to be funny, but just being so absurd that the plot is laughable. I was surprised that it was a block-buster. I'd give it a low one to an "cork" rating. I also find the soundtrack a bit disappointing for a blockbuster. It's sad to see "The Return Of The Stars" which has a lot of good, interesting, and original songs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was bad! It's the worst movie I've seen since the whole show of Arrestie's "Punk Rock". The song is terrible and there are not even enough people in the movie. That's about 10 guys in one. You know why these guys would never leave the stage, like Arrestin's act? Because they had a pretty good show? I mean, yeah, but this is way too early. I mean I don't know about these people. The best act is about this movie. It's just bad!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has two main characters. One of them is an aspiring writer/director with a huge success as the writer. One character is the editor of a local film company.  Other character is also the writer's friend, who in the beginning has problems with his girlfriend. It's also a bad film because there are no clear boundaries about the film's ending. I think it's a good idea to watch it for a good reasons but this movie just misses an obvious goal.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought this would be interesting to watch - at the time i thought it was a little too close to the final draft. I was disappointed.  Overall, it isn't a good movie, but there are some interesting and compelling characters. I'd never seen these characters, and even after seeing these characters i didn't believe that I would relate much to the character, nor that the story was interesting to me.  There is too little of the character's personalities to be meaningful and the story is just really predictable and uninteresting.  The characters in this movie were not that interesting, but what they were were doing was pretty predictable. I had to believe that this was the same way as the movie in "Naughty Old Times", except without any character development, which is not necessarily a bad thing if the characters are good at what they do, but it would hurt the enjoyment of a movie to watch.  I was surprised that no character was in this, but you'd be surprised if they were in the movie - it could have been better than what the original comic series was doing. I do feel that this is a really awful movie, so I didn't see it, and just because it was in the script I thought it seemed more interesting than the TV series - though I'd have seen that before.  This movie is bad for both comedy and drama - if you like watching actors and they are good, you won't like it, if you do not, it will hurt your entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to rent this on DVD yesterday.  The movie was a little too long, it wasn't even a good movie. I thought I was going to end up with a really good movie, but that's not the point I guess. I watched it with the same feeling I did with "House of Lies" and it didn't really make any sense.  I'd never seen anything this awful, but I'd bet it wasn\'t just a matter of fact.  There were many things about "House Of Lies" that did make sense, and a lot of things that didn't. I think this film's a complete waste of money. The movie starts off decent, but when it wasn`t, I couldn't watch the end of it. It's just pointless. I'd have to rent it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it's unbelievable. I don't think it's good. I give the acting bad. I just find it so sad and so bad to have anything that doesn't work for me. I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed and the acting was terrible. I think there is a real problem here with the acting in the whole movie. I know there are many fans who would love it, but this movie should not be released into the public. I guess it's not worth releasing, but I just don't like to see more bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago I discovered an interesting movie called "The Dapper's Revenge", a movie starring Paul Kelly and Kevin Bacon as some kind of sadomasochistic gangster. In the movie, Kevin Bacon is in some sort of trance as Paul Kelly as the "Dapper". His new friends, Chico Gonzalez and James McFarland, meet the gangster called "Dancer" at some point in the film, and Chico's team (one of which is a bunch of guys that just go around murdering people, only in the first scene when they meet Chico and Kevin.  There are two scenes that were interesting and the whole movie seemed to have a "D-list", but there really is no plot. This movie is like a porn movie, minus the actual porn scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first major disappointment of the year. Even the great, great, 'Wizards' trilogy (with Batman & Superman), is better than the other three.  In fact, the 'Superman of the Century' is an even worse movie.  The story is simply a collection of a number of old comic books. You'll notice many of them right before you recognize them, but the ones that aren't familiar with each of the characters are much more difficult to detect. There is a lot of the same material as the 'Wizard trilogy' - 'The Secret Weapon of the Legion' and 'Batman's Adventures, 'The Batgirl', 'Batman & Superman'. They're not so great, but I think they make up for the movie's lack of subtlety.  We also get several scenes that are, in retrospect, quite stupid. It's almost like a modern version of the 'Death Wish' film from the 60's. Some of the scenes in the 'Mysterious Monster' film are almost identical to the 'Batman and Superman' films. Some scenes in 'Batman' and the 'King of the Seven Worlds' movies are just plain bad. This could have been easily forgiven in a 60's Batman TV series.  There are also a few plot elements that are very offensive, especially to the viewer. Like the 'Unspeakable Death' film, which features a man with no arms, no legs, no chest, no head, no facial hair, and no facial muscles (the "body's chest").  Some of them, like the film's ending scenes, are actually pretty funny, and even the 'War Crime' version was amusing. Some are still less enjoyable.  But the movie ends with several more of those clichés. They are ridiculous. It would have been good if there weren't many of those. There was one truly hilarious moment when the film was turned into a movie, as I discovered. It seems to have been recorded in a recording studio, like any of the other'super hero' films of the day. It features the same kind of clichéd acting and dialog that has already been made over and over again, but is even worse when it's been re-edited for the 'war crime' version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard about this film before seeing it at the theater. This is the kind of film I was expecting, but I was surprised to find the same style and style of "The Way" that I would expect from. There were no scenes with any characters, and all scenes were presented by a black-and-white backdrop which was absolutely ridiculous. I have never seen this film since its inception and even that isn't particularly funny.  The plot seems to be pretty straight forward. There are no dialog, character dialog, or even a clear picture of what the characters are going to do. I am interested in seeing a film that can be rated "R" or "B" and at least have the guts to put out the words, and even if there is a "R", I don't know if they are supposed to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You read the reviews of the movie: (a)  There are more than enough reasons to question the film. It's about one person who comes into a bank with "the cash" and proceeds to take a bunch of debt, then proceeds to go to jail. So, the person who has to pay a little more to the bank's insurance agent (who is the guy in charge of the bank), decides to make a copy of the story. That makes him a better thief, so he does the job and gets in on the job. The next day he goes to the lawyer's office to get his money, and he has some documents to prove he's a criminal, and there's a bunch to see. Unfortunately, the movie isn't good! It's just about the most disappointing movie I've ever seen! It contains the worst acting and I'm surprised by how poor it was. I mean, even though I liked some of the film, I just couldn't see it, but I was surprised with how awful the plot was. It shows some sort of romantic feeling that only a few actors can give, but you don't have to watch the romantic scenes for a romantic movie. This movie is very disappointing and I suspect that nobody actually knows how bad it is. The acting is just stupid and extremely bad, but the fact that the movie is so poorly acted is part of the fun factor in the movie. The whole thing is so bad, I have to think about the guy who was supposed to be the hero to the people who are stuck in the middle of the whole thing.  This is absolutely terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of this name before. This is what I found when looking at the comments for "Cancer" (a remake of a much-too-short-lived 2001 film. I thought it would be funny to see a movie about the greatest monster in history--the monster--because of the way it was made, and the way the plot was presented. I'm not sure if this is a sequel to any of the books, or if it's a film, but if you ask me, it's probably a remake.  If you ask if I'd even be interested in this, the answer is no. I just don't want to watch it, and I don't like watching it. I was already disturbed by the fact that this was an "originator" of a bad video that I had seen. I didn't want any of it for the video-counters, and even found the book, for the book is okay but poorly written and the story is really poor. If I'm interested in any other books, I'd have to read the book before watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for a few minutes and I laughed. This movie is horrible and has nothing at all. The acting is bad and the story is not even interesting. The movie is about one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If I could watch it again, I would never. This is bad as a film, bad as it is funny. And even if you liked the movie, please don't waste your time to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a huge waste of money - I don't recommend this film because of the budget and the crappy acting. However, it's definitely a comedy in my opinion, but it's bad.   1st of 3 stars, the rest is just wasted - it's a pity film that's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a die-hard collector of movie memorabilia from the 1950's, my favorite is this little masterpiece of a 'demented' director, Michael O'Neill. It's hard to believe that he can'make it good', that the story is a long story, and that it is not a horror.  The only point of contention I have for this film is that Michael O''Neill was involved in the 'Arian' movie for his own film 'Fever', which was, after all, about a sequel to 'The Arian', and is the only movie that has Michael O"Neill in it. It is no longer a sequel. I have absolutely no idea how it was supposed to 'go', or whether he was even a part of the sequel.  This 'Demented'? Really, the director should have his own script, as they do in 'Fester' and 'The Other Thing', and then go on to make a sequel of this film. This is the worst remake I have ever seen, and I'm disappointed that it would have to be remembered as a 'Dude-like' for him to 'have it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst film I've ever seen. I think it was bad for a young kid to watch but it's good for a grown-up who didn't grow up with movies. A film such as this should never be made. The story is so bad, it doesn't make much sense. The only thing that makes sense is the ending. The whole thing is completely ridiculous and feels like it's something out of a cartoon. It's really not worth watching, it's just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was bad and the acting was awful. The cinematography was poor and it's not only that the actors were poor, it's also that there was little story line and there were too many points that were ignored.  I give this movie 2/10 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film and laughed to death. I think this film should've been killed for the fact that this movie never got the proper endings. I mean I can't even say the ending was the funniest ever made. I had to put a negative spin on it because it was obviously a waste of my time, and I don't think the acting was that good, as I usually prefer films that make you laugh. But still, I don`t know if I had that feeling for the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains about half of the first five movies in its history (some of them are pretty good). It's pretty hard to decide whether it's actually an American movie or an 'British movie' because of its tone and content.  The movie doesn't have the same 'proporture' or 'highbrow entertainment' as any other movie (for example, the French movies of Jean-Paul Jair, Michel-Pierre Bayon, or even some other movies that have actually made much money off of 'The Last Days of Hitler'!). The movie is so boring that you are constantly thinking about it and the dialog is stupid.  I've never seen this movie twice but I can guess that it's only going to appeal to a hardcore 'British fans' and it's also kinda sad. It has very little 'humour' and no 'cuddling' dialog. This movie also seems to be lacking some'social' message and it actually is just 'pretty' a British movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one isn't really a bad film, at least from what I've seen so far, but it was way too long. And the dialog is terrible. This film starts with a scene where a family member asks her daughter for a hand-written "wad of paper" with a line that sounds like an accusation. But that is followed by some real violence and then some of the actors are acting in a very unsatisfingly stupid manner. I'd like to see some real dialog for this film.  The story follows a bunch of old school teachers, who have just lost their own lives to the depths of hell, and the newbies are still in their lives but still have some dignity. That's all there is. However, there are people left behind in the story who have been burned by their classmates, and apparently not everyone, but the only thing left was their kids. And this movie is a complete waste of time. The dialogue is also awful, especially the ones that are supposed to have some meaning. For example, it's been obvious to me that there are two big kids who are in the hospital because they're sick from cancer and have not slept for more than a week and they look and act like they're in pain. And then the character of one of the kids is in the prison, but that doesn't really make the movie funny. I also saw the scene when they're forced to get the cops involved and the cops come in to interrogations.  I don't know what else this movie was trying to do, and I didn't think they had done a good job. I think there is no place for a decent movie like this to have any respect. There is no longer a need for such a movie. It's sad and depressing to see a movie of such poor quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all fairness, this movie was bad. It wasn't worth a point to watch it, I saw it on Blu-ray and it wasn't even a good movie at all. And I didn't like it. I was surprised that the people who are willing to watch this movie also rated it "a bad movie", despite the fact that it was one of the few films I had ever seen before.  This movie just got stuck somewhere in my head. When I checked out on the Blu-Ray, I just couldn't stop thinking.  The only thing about this movie that matters is the fact of being a bad film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My review of this movie was like everyone else. It had just 1 good line and 3 lousy lines. There were many times I was annoyed with this movie. It was too long and too bad to be shown in a movie theater. I tried to watch this film several times, but I couldn't understand the plot. In the first movie, I saw the plot unfold, and I saw how it had started and how it was carried out. In two previous movies I saw this plot unfold. There was a strong connection between the hero and the villain, and it didn't matter that the villain was a hero and didn't really care. There wasn't even a strong bond between the two hero and their respective foes. In this movie, there wasn't a connection between either hero and villain, the hero had some semblance of loyalty to his former nemesis (his previous nemesis had a long relationship with the villain), and the loser in their rivalry had some sort of a friendship with the hero. They had two major conflicts involving their allies and the hero, and neither one was really the hero or the loser, so neither hero/scarlings had to pay any attention to the loser. The dialog, which I thought was interesting, and the acting were bad. There seemed to be no good dialog. The acting was bad, but there were two actors who made a decent effort. The plot wasn't much of a drama and the story was weak. Overall this movie isn't much better than the second one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has gotten me out of the hospital, because I thought I was too late. I'm not a movie buff, but I'm sure if I'd watched the other 2 or 4 movies before I could have watched the whole one. It was an inhumane portrayal of a "joe," and it was just plain terrible. Even the director was OK at times, but his depiction of John DeNuey as a male chauffeur was just wrong. It made me angry, and I didn't care if it got you out of your chair. It has just one redeeming feature - the fact that you can still watch it. It's also bad on the acting (and, by a huge margin, the acting!) - there were moments when John De Nuey did good in a romantic context and even gave a positive review about his "love" scene. The most frustrating moment of this movie was when he broke a good movie relationship (one which was supposedly being broken!) and made a really bad movie about the whole concept of love, which he proceeded to use in a poor rendition of love scenes. It had to be seen before it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to give my opinion and I'll explain it. This movie is not funny or funny or good. It was stupid in a funny way but it was too long and it could get lost in a really funny way.  Its a remake of the movie "Rock 'n Roll" starring Mel Brooks. If you have to have your own movie you'd better stick to the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life, i can never even tell if I was still interested in it. The movie is a complete rip-off of "The Matrix" with the worst acting that I have seen in the whole world, and I'm not even a fan of it. I cannot even watch this movie because I already know how horrible it would be to see, let alone to act like it, and it was just so bad that I actually think I wanted it to get banned. If I can make it worse than that, I'm really desperate to get my money back. I'm sick of the fact that I couldn't even watch it, I couldn be sick of it, since this is like the worst movie i've ever seen. Even I was scared to put it off for my parents to see it and they told me that it's supposed to be scary, not like the Matrix movies. The fact that the director claims he was working on it is unbelievable, as he never even mentioned anything about making it and I had to ask. When I saw the end, I felt so embarrassed I was so desperate to see other movies: if I could give up, it would just be good for my kids.  The only good thing about this movie was a bad joke: "Couchin", "Cinoyin", and "Stalker" made it seem funny. The characters in those movies could not have acted like these people in the movie. In the end they were simply too funny, too mean, and just too much of an imitation of the real "Matrix". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can find some good movies, but this one isn't one of them. It's hard to understand the plot of this movie and the story is pretty dumb. I just have to agree with everyone else and give this one a good rating. I'd like to give it a "C" rating for that reason. But when I start watching it I realized that most of the story lines in this movie are just an example of what everyone is expected to do. Some of the dialog is simply bad. I would recommend this movie to a guy that wants to see more movies and feel like the movies he buys movies because they are pretty good.  I mean, that's the way it works and nobody expected anything to happen. Nobody expects to be in a fight. Just the way this movie was made was so unbelievable and stupid. I don't expect the guy to go crazy or jump into the woods after a couple of days of filming.   But I've noticed that these guys did write a positive review about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie because I was a huge fan of it. I liked the characters, but not the movie, and it did not go anywhere. I was disappointed by the end, which could be considered a failure of the writer and director. I did not know that the first 15 minutes of the film were so bad, nor do I even think it was a great film. I gave it one star because I liked it, the acting, the story, and the acting. Unfortunately, none of those elements work in any way, but some of them do go in the direction of the overall film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a remake of the 1983 hit 'Naughty World' for a new wave of video-based action video games, and as I said, it's a disappointment. There's no good reason why these 3 guys can't work in this crappy action game. The original 'Nasty World' game was a good action game, and had excellent story line, and excellent characters. The 'Noddy World' sequel is the opposite of 'Nappy World'. This is the same 'Nicky World' version that had all players to be totally self-satisfied and not even be interested in one of the characters, and it has been totally ruined in both story and character development.  The 'Nitro' remake doesn't add any action or action game play. The game itself is the exact same as the original 'Nitre'.  It just has some really bad video camera work and bad storyline.  Overall this movie is just plain boring. Even after my first playthrough of it, I still didn't like it and I didn't watch all of its first 3 episodes. It's just kind of a weak excuse to try it. I don't want to waste my time to see this, because I'm a big fan of 'Nitrate' video games. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never found this movie. I didn't care whether it was for me or anyone else. The plot is awful, the dialog is stupid and the acting is bad. I laughed, I laughed.  I know a lot more about acting than I do about music. But it's not a comedy, it's a musical horror film. That's what it was.  If you're a diehard music fan (like me), you'll probably laugh for the first time, or even at its execution. I hope that no one reads this movie seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just awful. The story was bad, but the ending had me wondering what would be done. I'm not sure that any one would survive it, and my guess would be the same person that would survive the whole movie. I wouldn't really believe such a thing could really happen, but I guess that's because the story is weak and the ending wasn't that big. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the result of a lot of crap-bombs. You'd think that, at least, it had some semblance of a plot. But it does not. This movie simply lacks the proper form of a movie.  The plot is fairly incoherent, but at the same time it is also completely incomprehensible. Also, there are a few scenes that would be considered funny if they actually happened in real life, such as the one scene involving a guy with a horse. There's also some very weak acting (such as an old guy with sunglasses and a little girl) and some of the dialogue is a bit laughable. Still, a more interesting character is not an adult film character, but a monster who wears a suit and who kills people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember having to watch this film when it was first released. It was an absolute waste of time, and I was disappointed with the results.  I would watch again and just try to get the plot out of my mind, and just hope that it would go one way out. Then I started watching it again and the acting was so bad. I just felt so sad. It should never have been to the point where this film would have been rated as a comedy but it was more like a comedy than a comedy. I don't know if this is a comedy or not, but it is more like comedy that a comedy was, and definitely not a comedy!!  All in all, I would see this film for 10 minutes, or if I could see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 2 films I saw in their production were excellent. The first one I ever saw was a horrible, pretentious, nasty and stupid film, and I don't know where that's going. There was no plot. The acting was terrible, terrible and so did the special effects. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a film, but it sure looked bad! All in all I can't believe that they'd really filmed one of the two films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was unbelievably bad, but, I do recommend the original version on Blu-ray, the original was a hilarious comedy. But, after this was released, I am very curious. Who were these actors who created this film? I want to see the person on the screen, and I can't because it was the guy who played the original actor. (That being said, I was hoping the guy was also the actor.) It seems to me, that this film is just the same as the original. There is no discernible distinction between this and the original movie. I'm sure it was originally created for its own purposes, but the way it was written is confusing, and the end-credits are too brief and predictable to be considered a comedy. What's truly wrong about this? I am going to watch it again, and if I'm reading this, I'm not going to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is a familiar premise, so it is a little hard to accept and that's part of the fun of a rip off. However, it does not provide anything better than an absurd plot. And the rest of the acting is bad as well, though the characters are interesting (though not so bad). There are no discernable personalities, so the actors are just acting, and the ending is never really predictable. Still, the movie itself contains several jokes. The one that stands out is the "I'll steal everything from you" line, where a man in a white robe tells you, "I will steal everything and then we'll do the same thing for you." It is a complete disappointment, but it never manages to inspire any emotion.  I'm sorry for the movie because it was fun at the beginning, but, unfortunately, too many of the jokes are ruined. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film released on February 4, 2009, entitled "Death, A Day, A Life". It was to be released on April 25th, the 20th year in the US. Its story was about the first day of a man's life. But when the day comes, the film begins a series of events that could cause a fatal accident. It is also a poorly written story about a young woman who is put in the middle of an accident on a road in Japan.  There are many bad parts in this film, but its production values do not justify its content. In one, a female doctor is looking to a couple of men to be rescued, and her team of experts is asked to look at the woman's husband to see if he's OK to be used by the police, and she is offered. The wife is on her own and they decide to take him to the police station. But then they decide that he needs to be brought to the hospital to see the doctor. The woman, however, is completely unharmed by the very public hospital.  One of the bad parts is a man who kills a man with a hose, and then goes on the road and is hit by a gas tank on the other side of the road (with a flam-gun, for no apparent reason). The camera does a good job of filming, but the film is very bad for the viewer. There is no indication of the consequences of what happened or of the accident.  Another bad part is the scene where the woman runs back into the hospital and is seen walking into the room where she can't find anyone else (this was in an abandoned hospital with a sign posted on the door). It is very hard to see anyone in the next scene because the hospital is on fire and covered in flames.  The bad parts include the fact that the woman was taken to a clinic to find out if a man would be taken to the toilet, and the scene in the first scene where we get to see a fire alarm playing through the hospital, and there is a small fire extinguishers near by. There are no other lights in the hospital. No more. The film's main goal is being a story of a woman who lives in the life of a dead man, and who dies in the aftermath of an injury.  I don't think that this film would have done anything good, if it had been released. The bad acting and bad story aside, the cast is good
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been searching for more, but the best I found was this video, which was only about 40 minutes. I'm not sure if it was a sequel or something else. And what about all those scenes? It was an effort to create the illusion that the actors are working together to make it seem like they are. They're not. The acting was so bad, I wasn't even able to follow it. It's just sad, because the acting is bad! It just doesn't help that it had just been another very unoriginal film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to laugh for these people. But I guess it's more like a bad romantic film: I think it's just pathetic and stupid. The movie is about a man who gets into the business with a small, beautiful lady who's only a few months old. That's it and it's done. After two days and a couple of episodes, he tries to woo her (though I'm not sure that's what he's done) and gets her into his hotel room to get a job. She doesn't exactly see the funny side of it. The only good thing that is the end is the ending and the fact that this movie is so awful that nobody cares about this movie. And if you are looking for the beginning of the movie, I'm sorry, you'll never find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just an interesting little bit of film for the kids of the 90's, but it would not be even a "fun" film. This is not one of the better comedies to have made or even seen. They just made it worse! If you have a spare pair of hands, then you might enjoy it. If you want something a little bit less annoying than what this movie is, I don't recommend you this film, but I would recommend it as a snack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a small bit of decent good work, but the ending is stupid and the characters get killed in the most ridiculous and unsympadromous way. I would've recommend to rent another film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is it has a cool soundtrack and a decent cast of actors. Still, it still sucks. There were some decent performances in the other parts, but in the movie itself, it is a major fail. The story is about a love triangle. It ends when one member of the group is killed and another comes back alive, thus causing the whole group to fight over each other member to death. The people in the plot eventually do a bit of justice. I can tell you that it was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was very disappointing and disappointing in a sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie has the worst acting of any film I've ever seen. I know I get this way, it is how you make movies.  This movie is so bad that it is actually funny and has to be banned in every movie in the world. I can feel empathy for the actors and crew members because I have to understand how to feel.  I hope this movie gets banned because it's so disappointing, really bad and totally over-the-top. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this movie as a child, you should be glad it has not been directed by George R. Brown, of which I know I believe but I'm not entirely positive that he has anything positive to say. This movie is an example of how bad movies get made. The story and acting are completely worthless, and the acting is bad. If you like a really lousy movie, and if you're a fan of George R Brown then you might enjoy it. But if you just want a simple movie to watch, please try to find an earlier version of this movie that actually has some plot and at least some interesting dialogue. I don't think it's worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the original intent of this film was a satire about how the current political climate of the country is not being respected by the masses. I was very surprised that it is actually so awful that it wasn't just a satire but a completely ludicrous waste of time and money that could have been used to make a positive review about the film. If it didn't make money, it would be awful. The idea of being "a person" to go through the motions of the film was not realistic and the director should have done better. The cinematography was not that good. The sound was bad and the dialog was not good. I could think of many more funny things but I wasn't willing to waste my time to listen to more. The film was the sort of a dumbo joke. I can't figure out why it is so terrible to have been made at this point.  I recommend a more well-rounded review of this movie: I'm not sure what the original intention was with this film, but it's just so hard to watch. The whole thing had been taken over for an "F" rating, which I thought was unfair and bad for an action film. I think that the director probably made it because he wanted to get an A+ rating from the censor board. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first section of the movie, I was able to detect a slight glimpse of humor in the movie. In the next section, the acting was very unconstructive, and there was only one line that made me laugh. It was absolutely ridiculous. I can't even think of how anyone could have imagined the director to have directed this movie. It must be very difficult to find humor in a movie with a bad director, but in all cases I'm pretty sure that it's hard. I'm not sure what this movie was about, and I've only watched it once, so I'm going to put it down as soon as I find out how to avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many questions I've put in the comments on this movie: 1. Did the other kids watch the movie? It was definitely a terrible, yet strangely amusing choice of an ending. 2. Did they kill them? Did they die? Was the kid playing an imaginary toy with them? I don't have answers. The acting was OK, but it just seemed like there was no reason why it had not been stopped. 3. What happened with the children? 4. Why was the movie made? 5. What were they thinking? The answer to those questions in the last sentence of the DVD title is, "No answers, but a lot of questions. "  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst, and possibly the worst American movie ever made. In the beginning, I thought it was funny. However, by the end, it is very sad. I really hope that the people involved who make it were capable of making other movies. Also, if they have the guts to make this movie, they should have left it behind. It's so sad and sad to be in a movie. It was so bad, it just made me think about how sad and lonely life is to live with a friend. I didn't like this movie because I was just happy it was so funny and so funny, and it was OK to have sex again. I just don't like the idea of watching this movie and feeling like I was a stranger in the middle of the story. I guess I'm the only person who can have that feeling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought I'd read it again after I watched it, since it's so bad. The movie starts about 2 minutes in and it takes about 30 seconds to last 20 minutes of the movie. I didn't care for the actors. I just kept looking at the screen hoping to see the characters get together. I don't understand how anyone would be able to like this movie. This movie is not funny at all. The film is way too long for people to stay glued to it. I really think it's an insult to people who enjoy this type of movie.   It doesn't make any sense at all when the movie is in 3 or 4 parts to one movie. You just end up watching them on different parts of the story and you get bored.  This movie doesn't really make sense. It is not even about a real life conflict. It really just seems to be about making money so that nothing can be said about it.  Also, I think the director was very naive. The actors didn't really act like characters. They just seemed to act as people. The people who really seemed to be happy in this movie were the people who seemed to care. They didn't even say a word. This is so bad that it's not even worth watching. If you watch it, it's just an excuse for you to waste time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of those movies, something went wrong and the world seemed to collapse. However, that is not my only problem. The other important thing is the lack of direction. My heart would have melted if it was all the same movies. The first film had all the classic movies of the 1950's, all the funny comedies and most of the time, but at some point it got so bad and so boring that I couldn't finish it.  The rest of the movies had been very good, but when it comes to this one, it really fell apart in the beginning. The characters and the movie, and even the camera, seemed to be totally flat.  Overall, this movie seems to have been created in the 1970's, but it seems that the people who make it must have not been born. The point of this movie is to be entertainment. This is a major issue, even if the people in the movie know how to act. This movie was made in England for people who want to "fancy" this movie, but did they have an idea of how to do it? Maybe they should have done something for their own sake.  It's time for the filmmakers to get their act right. If they are guilty, that's it, but please take the hint. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was poor, the dialogue was not funny. The storyline and character design were lacking and there were some very weak jokes.  The first scene, the first couple of minutes of the film is hilarious. I was surprised how it could take away a very talented person like Daniel Dada who had played many different roles in different productions, but the second movie it had me falling for it. I would not have had faith that it could work for one or two days after. I found it impossible to find a good movie to watch.   I was hoping to see something better than this one. Unfortunately it was one of the worst movie I have ever watched. If you want a comedy to watch please just one or three minutes of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is a copy of a movie I would like to re-rent. The actor has been to many parts and hasn't aged, the acting is terrible and the dialogue is slow, but I like that they did some of the action scenes that they showed. I really don't know how anyone could be pleased with this movie. This movie is really a joke! It seems to be a movie directed in a school for a movie director who didn't have a good idea how to film. I think it was one of those things put together in the late 70's. It was created as a way to be funny, but it looks like it was just so written that it wasn't funny. I have seen these films on YouTube, but they were always comedically funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first few scenes showed that the actors were good at their respective roles, but in the rest of the movie there are far too many moments that have been forgotten from the original films, namely the introduction of a character in a car that had no previous acting experience.  This is a terrible movie, and I can't imagine why it would be made after their success on "A Wrinkle In The Land". I know the producers tried to come up with a story where it's okay to tell a story about how bad a movie is and to start over again and go back in the same way again. I know too that it's impossible to tell the story in a movie with such a poor script.  But that's not the worst thing about "Wasting Away". It's also annoying when it happens to a bad comedy, since it doesn't really focus on the characters but on a bad, meaningless storyline that is nothing but annoying and pointless.  It was a shame to see "Wishing Away" to this movie. It was made to promote a movie: this is not a film for kids. It is not an interesting and fun movie. The ending is simply bad, and not even funny.  If you are a fan of a bad film, then you must watch this movie as soon as possible, if you really enjoyed the movie, then I would not recommend it, but if you just can't find it anywhere then you might try watching it again for awhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has some good moments and some of the best shots, but the plot is weak and badly acted. The story is weak, with too many inconsistencies, and the scenes are too long, too much to take seriously. And when you start watching it, you will be bored. If you do watch it, I strongly recommend not wasting any time, and just look at the plot for what it has to be.   8 out of 10   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie countless times, because I hate all horror movies that feature a blood-sucking plot. I have seen this movie so many times, and I have to say that it sucked me in. The premise is unbelievable, the acting is bad, and the film seems to lack a real suspense. This is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen in a long time. I was one of those who saw the movie and decided it was OK to watch, but the plot is so stupid, I had to throw it off. I really have to hate this movie. I mean, seriously, this is a movie which includes some of the best acting and most interesting plot lines ever. Don't waste your time looking for it, don't rent it, and don't put it anywhere near your home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horror film is not a great choice if you want to see an experience that's better than the typical horror flick. I'm not sure if you were expecting more than one movie. This film isn't even close to the standard "credible" horror cinema! This movie isn't very good either, as I said, but it does have some good elements. I'll get back into reviewing it soon, but the fact that they chose to skip the final 30 minutes makes this movie a very poor choice! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with just one eye in the window because it was about 70% to be worth the price. I was so embarrassed! I would give a negative rating if I had a free house room and used this movie as a house security for just one night.  I tried to sit out of the movie, but after one count I couldn't. I left to get the movie over and finished it. I tried so hard to get out of it because I couldnít even get the time of my day in a video store. I would not even be able to use my video store if I were at home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. The way they go about showing movies in the first scene is simply bad. I can imagine it being filmed in a hotel room, with nothing to go wrong, with a couple of women dressed up as women, to go places with other people. How far out of the frame does this movie go? Just one of my friends told me, the main character is a racist white man, and the main plot line is a bunch of racist comments. It's all just stupid, the only funny part in the movie is the part where we see the protagonist try to catch one of the gangster's horses. We're also supposed to see a couple that looks like a lesbian couple in the next scene. But that is about a comedic moment!  I'm sorry to say that this film is completely unappentive, and I'm afraid that they'll make it look good on the DVD. I'm also worried that I'll be thrown out of this movie. I just want to watch some of the more interesting films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that it's quite disappointing to have a film that could only barely stand out as an interesting short-film - something bad about it in some respects - and is so bad that it barely stands out as a feature film. The story is just so predictable and boring - about the fact that it had just recently been released - that you are about to be sucked in with the idea of wanting to see the end. It's a pity to have had a film released that would take so much time - time - to put in the effort to make this one.  But I had to admit it was interesting - it has some decent action sequences, an interesting soundtrack, and some decent visual effects, but the whole thing was so disappointing. This could just be a small part of an ongoing film series, but it is so hard to watch that I didn't even want to see it. I don't really care what the movie is about, but just about half of it was badly acted that it just seems like some kind of pointless action porn.  This film could have been made in a different way - it would be an amusing film, perhaps with some interesting cast members - perhaps a few actors with rather interesting personalities. But if you look down at the credits, they won't be very funny either - and even the action sequences look weak compared to other such films.  Still, it might be a funny little flick - with only the actors and a few good actors, it is more than worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what the hell this movie is about. In one point it had to be for one whole movie - and I think the guy is a real jerk. I think that he's one of those weird, fake gangsters who's really only used as a disguise, and that he wants to go on a rampage. So what I want to say is:  You don't really care if they shoot you, but I think this movie should really just be a bit sad, and I'm sure the only reason you're here is so they want to be sad. And you don't care if you get killed, but you know that you're going to be killed.  If the guy was a real member of a gang, then maybe he might be a part of a real gang. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have a little time to spare, check this. It's a total mess. If you want to watch a movie about a bunch of guys going to school who are all in their teens, this is the worst thing you could see. It looks absolutely nothing like a "real movie" with a plot. If this movie was released in 1986, they would have put out a special edition with the same storyline, but I guess that's not what this movie really is. The first 20 minutes are about a school where the students are getting kicked in the head by their peers. If it were put out in 2010, I would have gotten the same reaction.  There are so many bad things about this movie that I'm not even sure what to put in its own context. There are too many stupid scenes and stupid dialog that come out of nowhere and the end to the movie is antic-conversion. This movie is so bad that it was actually embarrassing to watch for it's existence. There is no real plot. The characters are all completely unrealistic, there is no plot, and this movie is completely absurd. If I had to watch this movie I would be bored, because there is not enough money to even care about it. I just don't see it, but if you do, I think you'll find it really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was the premise? to be an entertaining film: "The best revenge you could hope to have on a bad time is to be a funny movie about a boring movie about bad movies, because of the poor direction of the films.  This movie is so bad, it's so terrible, that it is actually funny. It is so painful to watch, and it fails to be funny in any way, but the most entertaining story in the entire country comes from this movie, a story that has just the faintest of hopes of being funny.  It starts with a stupid plot with a plot and some silly acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely annoyed. I couldn't understand the reasoning behind this stupid thing. In fact, I didn't really think there was one reason to go out with it. In any way, it was funny, though I wish they were able to finish it. I can't find a good analogy here, but the film had something else going on that was never there. I guess it is just like a TV show. I am not sure if it was a true horror show or a really low-budget, but it was that for me, it just didn't make any sense at all.  I think if they were willing to finish this movie, they would have to be sure they would make it worthwhile. I'd like to see something more realistic to compare it to, say, some of the shows I watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Die Hard 3" is one of those films with no good story. It is absolutely ridiculous that these actors are allowed to shoot their own movies. The story is completely unbelievable, like an hour of old cheesy fare from some of the 80's. I am the only one who thinks the characters are being duped by the people on the screen. In the beginning I knew that they were in fact making a sequel to the original "Die Hardy 3". But when I finally got to the point of the story, I began wondering. Who was this guy? The guy who tried to fight his way through prison, and died in a firehouse that has only recently been demolished. The guy whose father committed suicide, and was burned to death at his house, and his wife was murdered at their home...the guy who worked with his wife while he was a cop, and got stabbed to death...the guys who died in the car, but is remembered and forgteren them...these guys were the ones who made "DieHard 4" in the 1990's.  This guy should have had a job in the prison that has a lot of prisoners. That would have been easier to work, but he would have a job there.  The story starts on the fourth night of filming, with the characters coming in to the prison, where they are getting ready for their final meeting. There is no story for this film. They just get ready to meet each other, and start fighting.  In the opening scene the characters meet in a hotel room that looks like a room where the main character's former, Jack Bauer (John Faxel), has done a few months earlier. This is also the last scene of the film, so we cannot see anything about the victims. After the meeting, Fax and Bauer have sex. The first scene is supposed to take place in a motel room. The next day they break out on the street, where everyone tries to get them to be killed.  "He Who Wanted The Second Person In His Own Gun" is pretty good, though the main characters don't even make much sense. As for the film's main character, he is a man, who would be killed to save others. He has a father that was dead, his family killed, his wife murdered, his kids, the son's kids, and the kids. He looks like he wants to kill himself, but it is all in vain.   The other problem is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A plot and script is stretched over too long and is only a half hour or so. A director who is not a great storyteller and who can't do any dramatic dialogue should not have been hired to work on this film.  The film starts off looking like it's an action film, but after it settles, it becomes completely predictable and boring. The premise is completely lacking.  I cannot even begin to give this movie any rating of 1 for me. This film is just awful and there is no sense of direction or plot progression. I hope the director will take his chances and get another film soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting something good and even had to have my expectations raised. I give it two out of 10, and there is only one positive review.  A good movie that didn't have a great plot, but did have a good ending. But the ending was totally boring, and I would not recommend it for anyone who watches it. There were some interesting moments throughout the movie, but they were the weakest parts of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that the movie is not in Spanish, it is not a "real-life drama" it is in fact an American trash thriller- it is about a group of people who are looking for a better life. I guess that this is a Japanese film, because I found it in American film and they were in Japan. There were no English subtitles on the DVD and this movie is full of all of the American crap that comes out of American film. The plot is so awful that it is incomprehensible. There are no suspense, none of the "great" plot lines, no special special effects, and the dialog is so stupid that it just sounds stupid. I've seen many movies, and I've never seen something like this. This movie is made by a guy who lives in Hollywood, so it is easy to understand that he made it. But this movie proves that the producers and the cast don't have good writing and acting skills, but that doesn't mean that they are good actors. It is a shame that this movie does not come from Hollywood. I give this movie two stars, and they are each acting in the roles. It's also a pity that so little thought and care has been put into this movie. If you like the Japanese, you'll probably love it anyway but don't waste your time. This is a complete trash-film, not a great Japanese movie. I'd give this a 10 out of 10, but don`t expect to get any high rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this film was the best film I've seen this year. Not that I didn't like this movie; I just didn't think it was that great. I was really scared of it and I couldn't stop watching it. I also hate it when there's a zombie and people who do what he says are evil. I don't understand why people liked this movie. It looks so sad and all the people looked so sad like people who died in the first movie. I think the director was a really weak person at first. He's probably a very bad person; he had absolutely nothing for horror, and he had everything wrong in his mouth. He showed nothing interest in the story line, just a really bad attitude and bad voice acting.  I give this film a rating 1 out of 10, which I think is extremely low. He probably won't know what he's doing right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's not only a bad thing, but I think that it might have been used to convey a message.  I've not seen the movies, but they remind me a bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An attempt at re-imagining the life of the most annoying and ridiculous American, and perhaps the most popular of American pop stars (who might be the greatest film ever made) on earth, this movie failed because it didn't really follow the spirit of the book and never really captures some of the content of the books. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some decent bits of the movie, like the title song, but they were much more distracting than expected. One of the worst films ever I've seen on the screen. And the soundtrack is so bad, I nearly laughed at it. I had to listen to the song just once, and I laughed at every single one.  Overall, it's a bad and very uninteresting movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Gravelling Away from Death" is the worst movie I have ever seen. I didn't enjoy it for the first 2 years I was in college. I laughed for 5 or 6 times, but this is the last time I laughed. I wish I could say that it wasn't so bad, but it is.  A lot of money is made in this movie, a lot of time and money goes into making a sequel. That's the same thing I always used in my class and I couldn't get out of it for 8 years.  What about the movies I used to watch? The "Erotos," "Doomers," "The Crow" "Ghosts of the Underworld," "Sucker's Revenge" "The Monster Maker" and "The House of Gores," all were pretty cool. The "Doron" was OK, but in this remake, it doesn't even have the characters and characters. They just walk away from the grave. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie when I was younger. The actors are not good and the plot is not funny. It doesn't make sense what a "movie" could be. And what a comedy it could be, it is a pathetic effort, especially in the end.  There should have been more creative ways to make the whole movie. I can even forgive the writer for putting a different plot line into the plot line and saying that the "plot" was about to become a movie. So many people on here have this movie as their movie and I'm not sure the point of the movie even was made, as it's not about a "funny" movie but a sort of film for a low budget. I know I liked the movies from this movie because it was a laughing thing, but it's really boring. There should be an actual film with a plot, which didn't seem like one on a big screen with a large set. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting it to be better, even though it was very bad. I'm still hoping that this movie will get more like it in the sequel. I was just plain sad to have seen it. I saw the first part of this movie and then I watched it again and didn't want to see it again.  I do not know if I'm even supposed to say the director was directing this movie. But I saw it in advance and, I think, like most people do, I thought it was an absolute joke. I can't even get into my own thoughts about this film. I just saw a sequel to the original movie and I laughed. I mean, I liked the first one, but I'm ashamed to admit it. It just was really bad and so bad it just got to the point where it just had to be discarded. I never felt like this movie had anything to say. The director should have just made a sequel. The movie is not so bad that it had to make an apology, but so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the first episode. I thought it had a pretty good ending. But it wasn't quite as good as most of the others I watched. This was bad movie because it had no story. The ending is not interesting, the plot is boring, and it was way too long. The movie just doesn't look like a movie and I thought this movie was way to long for it to actually stick around. The acting wasn't good but the people were decent, and the movie didn't really help the movie.  The fact that the plot was so disappointing didn't hurt much as I knew the people who worked in the movie would. They were all horrible actors. The special effect isn't so bad either, it's just bad when people try to make it out with their special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just a complete waste of time. Even for all the other actors, this movie had to be an absolute waste of a flick. I do not know if this movie was supposed to have an original plot, which makes me think that maybe the other makers of this film had some ideas for it and had just tried it on their own. I thought that they did give the story and script for this movie. But the story was just too contrived. I would definitely take this movie if the writer and producer would try to make some kind of film that was a comedy. I didn't understand how people could have been able to kill the people that they had just killed off. The first part was stupid and the second part was the stupidest. The ending was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A short, boring, disappointing sequel of the first installment. There is only one good thing in the film, the fact that the story had been developed in a way that would lend it more credibility.  Also, there is no scene to have the characters get along for a real time. No way of getting to see each other.  Of course, I do get it. But if it has been done to me, why did I not read the novel when I saw it on video? It was interesting and I'm glad I did, the movie didn't have any surprises. I'm not even sure that it was meant to be this long. But I would have enjoyed the movie more if it was a full, unstructured sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have to like this movie, but it is not good at all. I really don't like it because it is so stupid. It's too long, too slow, and too boring. I'm not going to watch it again but I am sure there are people who do. This movie has two stars in this film. I think the lead is a bit over the top for a film that supposedly has nothing to do with music or other entertainment. I also think the song is an outdated tune, and that it has no rhythm or accompanist. There were also stupid lines in the song. If I could give it an 8, that would be fine, but at 2 and 8 I think it's too slow and boring, and it doesn't have any funny or funny dialog. I have to hate it. I hate this movie because I didn't like the original one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was the last person to see this film on a local television station. This film was awful, bad, very bad, not in a way that any one can expect from this film. It's bad, bad really, and this has to be taken as seriously as the story. I believe there's a reason for it to have a high degree of seriousness. I know for every actor to get bored because they're forced to go through these "unnecessary" scenes. I also believe there must be a reason behind this film's existence. The story seems to have little meaning to me. It could be anything to anyone involved in it. I think it would be better if they got a new film about a real movie. In other words, I'm disappointed that this one has not been removed from circulation. I have no doubt about any of the actors. What is wrong with this film? I don't think it's serious, but it's way too short and pretentious. I can't even see any of it and have even more difficulty in seeing it. The movie seems to go straight to the very low-grade. I didn't expect anything more from this, but there should be a way to fix this. I've read several good reviews and they were so poor at writing they didn't even work, which is a real shame. The ending has absolutely no purpose. The fact that the story and the cast's characters were totally unrelated should have been a much better film. This movie would have been better if it were in a different form. I just wanted to see the film and its ending. I thought this would be much better than this movie, but that never happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard of this movie before I looked for it on IMDb. I thought I was going to like the story. I really liked it, but the ending was too horrible.  I was very relieved at the fact that I didn't like the plot, which was the main reason I was interested in the film. There wasn't even a plot! This is an excuse why so many people have come to the rescue of the film! You see a lot of bad film makers out there, too much money is involved, and it's not even a good film, really! I didn`t buy it, since it is so bad. I wasn't able to watch it until late night, and the ending really ruined my faith in the ending.  The worst part of the movie was the first scene when everyone is talking about the characters. They are all wrong. The reason I don't like this movie is because there are so many errors in the writing and the acting, and if you like an adventure-type film with a plot, you should never watch it if you have patience, and don't even try to stick it out if you want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an insult to the fans of the original "Grimm" series. Some of the actors did excellent work. The problem was that this remake is so bad that it's hard to find it.  But that's only part of the problem. The plot and characters are terrible, the acting is bad, the plot is not good, and the acting really doesn't work. But the other part is that the cast is terrible, some of the characters are pretty interesting. Some good performances are the characters, but not at all. If you enjoyed "Gimme" for the original series, watch the new sequel. Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to be honest. It has two actors who tried to make it better, one a pretty actor, the other a very ditzy actor. The two best actors are a really good actor, who looks like he's really a good actor. But it's a bad, lazy film that has no humor whatsoever. The plot is bad enough but the supporting cast is so bad that I can't stand it. The movie has the worst acting that I've seen in my entire life. It is absolutely terrible!  I do not recommend this movie to anybody who's tired of this kind of films. You're bored with the film and you might like to see it because you're sick from the movie, but you're also sick from it because there's no entertainment in the film.  This movie has nothing to do with the music, music, or even the cinematography! It's really about pointless crap, no fun, no entertaining whatsoever. If you want a fun entertainment film, a movie that's a little bit like "Waddulla" with a lot of cheese, a few jokes, and an interesting storyline, don't see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to think that the movie is funny but this one falls to the grave. The humor is very cheap, the acting is awful, and there's nothing special except the one character. Also, there's a ton of fake blood flying. The cinematography is OK at times, but the acting isn't good, too. I'd like to see some people with a better story.  There's something else that must be done here. I think that people who are fans of "Wincheito" will appreciate the way that it was structured and there are people who would like to watch it. Unfortunately, you won't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think that it was for me to believe. I don''t like this movie at all. I feel like it's so pretentious that it could just be a low-budget flick or a 'joke' but this film had no real comedy or suspense. I was never expecting it to be funny or even have any suspense or suspense to be much fun.  I honestly think that this film was made in an effort to shock the world and get people talking about it. But sadly it doesn't have any funny, dramatic or suspense-it just a cheap, one-night-only film. That's one thing I do not like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason the writer is so interested in creating a horror film about a child rapist is that the premise is ludicrous and has no real foundation. However, it is interesting to note that the writer has created a horror movie: a sadistic film with only the premise to scare the viewer (at least one third of the way in). Of course, I don't know if the director was aware of his true purpose, but I think he is very unsatisfying. The first thing I noticed was that there is no story of someones in town. Then, in the beginning of the film, the people who were in town seemed to be in a really good mood. I was trying to hide my eyes but it didn't take long. At the beginning, I was afraid of the director because he had good acting in the scene but he seemed to have no idea how to go about writing a horror story and he didn't care about writing that story. The only thing I did was try to scare my friends and family. It doesn't work, and I'm sorry but the rest of my friends didn't get their money back.  I give the movie 4/10 because there are worse things in the world but this is awful.  The movie itself seems to be all about the writer's inability to get a decent director for this film but if the writer could help to get some good actors to do something better, then maybe that should not be a huge mistake. The movie would just be a lot better if it contained a story. I donut want to see this movie for the stupidity of the writers. But that's not a good movie. I give it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a really poor movie. In fact, it is not only bad, but it is so stupid that I didn't even care if it were in any way entertaining. I think I will never forget this movie. I was extremely disappointed when it came out on Blu-ray, but after seeing it again for the second time I finally decided that I was getting bored. I would not have liked to watch the movie because I felt like I was an idiot. I am very sure that this movie was meant to appeal to the young male demographic, but unfortunately I was too young to even care what it had to appeal. I guess I thought the movie was very unapparent, but that is just a matter of opinion. Still I would never mind going to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad I was so surprised I hadn't even bothered to see it. The plot is so poor, there are no story lines and no real plot, the action is bad as hell, and the acting is terrible and weak. The acting is so weak that there isn't even any character development. I really think they should have used a special camera lens to make the action look better, but I guess that's too expensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Inception" is a very bad movie! It is not worth watching unless you get the full five minutes of the film. If you are looking for a great film with this one, this might be an option, but unfortunately this movie is not the good film. And what is the other message? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i can only express the most shocking parts of this movie. The acting is bad, the acting is not believable, and the storyline is predictable but not believable. I'm sure a lot of people would have enjoyed it but for some reason, it just didn't work for me. I really had to see the movie in the theater to figure out what it was about. The people involved in this movie seemed to do it just for the laughs. I had to watch it again to get the idea of the plot.  I am sure the filmmakers were trying to make it seem like a classic, but they failed to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not surprised that this is one of the lowest rated and hardest rated movies at the time. I can understand why the people that make this film thought that it was one of their best. I mean the only other person that was this low rated in movies was the original film "Dancing Chicken". It was about the same caliber as the original. I think it's a film to be avoided if you can't enjoy it or if you cannot find a copy on DVD. It's just that awful. You have to see a movie to understand what's happening in this film and the message behind it is that it's nothing more than a shallow, boring, and worthless. There is no purpose and no meaning whatsoever and the only thing you get out of this film is the story and characters. But I cannot believe that all the people involved in this project were thinking that the film was so great. This is an empty, pointless story and a waste of time. It should have never been made. I'm glad that it has been made since I discovered the DVD had the same rating as the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first discovered this movie after seeing a copy of the movie. It was absolutely horrible, and even worse to those who knew of it before it was released. It's basically a mix of three different movies. The first one is about a bunch of old women who live in a trailer park. The second one is the same movie with a bunch who live around the town, the town is populated by people who live together and share a house in a back yard. The third movie is a remake of a 1990 film called "Winnie's House", about a guy who buys a house to live there. He rents out some old neighbors and gives the lady in a bad mood because she hasn't seen a movie in ages. But the wife decides to let the man renovate their house and tries to get some work done on it.  This movie really disappoints as a comedy, because it's so contrived and boring and fails to take the concept seriously. This movie is also terrible for the younger children. The movie is so badly constructed, and I don't know how a movie like this could have any credibility. I'm not sure there's a point to making this movie. This must have been done just for the joke of a couple taking a car and getting behind the house to sleep. That's the only good thing I can find in this crap. But if you're going to see it, you should avoid it. It is nothing more than a series of stupid jokes. Don't go see this movie, because your life is far too busy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of the main audience to see this movie. If you do NOT get me and my sister, you will NEVER see this film. If we both watch it. If one of us does not get to watch this film, you have to get the tickets and mail them. Even in my brother's case, I didn't see the movie when we were on vacation. I'm not sure why. We got the tickets but didn't really care to go out and saw it. We just wanted to go home and get our tickets.  What could have been done? The movie is a complete disaster. It's completely laughable. The fact that I was involved with this film must be taken into account. It must be made for money. The actors were supposed to be able to do the job and the film was made with such a small budget.  If you can't stand too long, this film should be made into a sitcom of some sort or some other TV series. This movie is only good at getting laughs.  The acting was also pretty bad, the acting was bad. The plot was bad, nothing was remotely funny. The dialog was bad and the characters were so stupid. The only people that got it were the actors themselves. It was just a really bad movie.  In the end, I think I'd recommend a little group of movie stars to rent this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an older male with many years to spend on this series, I would normally be happy. It isn't like the kids on the shows I've seen. I know the ones who were, like their parents, and the people I'd think of as heroes.  But here, not so much. This movie made me feel like the guy that plays in "the most despicable movies I've ever seen". It's a sad thing to see a man who has never even acted in real life and the fact that he is trying to make an honest comedy about a sad movie doesn't make it any better.  I can't believe I thought it would even make my mind at ease. The characters in the film were stupid, just stupid enough. The storyline itself wasn't bad, but it just didn't go anywhere.  There are some good moments, but even in the sad scenes, it's not in the least interesting.  In any case, I'm not surprised it wasn't good. I've given this one so much credit, even a bad one, which I don't understand how any American movie can be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it was only available on my video rental machine. It would have made a perfect score for a bad film. I think I would have preferred to rent it again, because I have heard that it's good in other ways. (If I'm not looking at the video rentals on my tape rental machine I'm a bit anxious to rent this movie again, even though I think the video has a pretty good soundtrack.) It is not an interesting movie, but it is only a bad sequel. (The sequel was pretty funny, but the sequel didn't make up for the one in the first year.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie because the characters were interesting, but they just aren't that interesting. This movie could've been a decent feature-level film, but it simply was so bad. There are a couple of nice moments in the movie but that is just one small incident among many. The fact that the movie is a "horror film" has to affect its appeal for many people.  The story is weak and there are little clues to its characters that should make them identifiable as being interesting. That's probably the best way to kill this movie, because there isn't much to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie after watching it in the store. I was not surprised that it was a remake of the original! It was not really a remake, but I think it might have been. It's just not the same movie.  The film is not so bad as a remakes of a movie, but it's not a good one either! There were probably a few jokes that could be funny, but they were much less funny than the ones in the original.  I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 for being completely bad, but a 9 for the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in high school during the summer break, and I thought it was so bad it was scary. I saw it in theaters (not in school, it was in the movies of the '60's, for my own sake).  I saw this movie twice, and then I thought, 'NOOOOO this movie sucked!' I didn't like this movie. I just didn't want to see it again. In fact, the only movie I liked to watch was 'Rocky Horror' which is so good, and although this movie was bad, it had some decent acting. This movie was simply the 'Worst movie ever!' It is an insult to everyone who tries to go to movies like 'Rockys' where they can watch their own movie. It isn't even worth getting into this movie if you're just one of the people who wanted to see this movie and feel like a winner. This is bad because, if you really enjoy watching this movie, then you really should feel like this as a winner, or at least enjoy a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a complete waste of money, a waste of time and effort, and no plot, no action, no romance, no suspense, no plot. Its supposed to be a fun movie, but unfortunately it's the worst. And don't go off to me if you want to find a good movie: you won't.  It's not a bad film: it is a poorly made movie with no plot or romance, but this movie should be remembered for the fact it was the worst I'd seen since my first college. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I understand that this movie is probably the worst ever of its era. I am a big fan of films like this, but if you really like those type of movies this one might be a bad thing. The acting and the script are not too good. But if you like this kind of crap, you will enjoy this, because it will just be an hour of worthless drama. If you are looking for a film about a guy who has sex, maybe a little more of sex, I would recommend this movie as a low effort. It just wastes money on a movie that needs to be a little better than average, but it could probably be better. If there is a better movie to be released at this point than this one, I think it would be a "Cinderella" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie had little plot and didn't have the suspense to make you care about the plot. There was a scene that could have been funnier, but the plot didn't matter much. I was disappointed with the ending and the ending had no climax. I thought the end had been so rushed and unbelievable that I couldn't finish. The movie's main purpose was to be "funny" and I can't find any funny feeling. It was too obvious and unrealistic. I could not find any humor in it. I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has the worst acting of any of the comedies that are rated, I found this movie to be very low, and I didn't even finish it. If you liked any of those movies, don't waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an extremely bad and very embarrassing picture for anyone involved in this movie. And I can't even make an analogy out of how horrible it was. I cannot really call it a comedy - this is not a comedy but a horrible piece of work with poor directing, bad cast (mainly due to the fact that there were many actors not in the casting. And a lack of originality as well. And the acting just is terrible and awful. And this movie is not in any way like a cult film. It just shows the viewer a bad, unbalanced person and the viewer can't really tell if he's a believer or a believer of anything. The script was terrible! And don't believe the actors. A cult film? There are plenty of cult films that have decent plots but they are also films with some dramatic scenes.   I have to believe that this movie has a cult like quality to it. But it was only one of a few cult films. I am sure that it is no longer going to be cult film because it has fallen out of the cult film status that is currently dominant. The only one I was afraid of in this is the one I wrote about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is about a typical story that doesn't even care about character development. The characters are all very small, the acting is poor, the editing is bad, and the acting styles that the director has chosen to use is poor. There are two guys that act like the film's lead, the one is in a black wig and the other in a white wig, both characters are very wooden and have poor dialog. The one other character is in fact a racist, but that doesn\'t matter because he's not an actual racist. There is no real suspense and there are no story twists. There isn't any suspense, and there aren't any good characters, and that's why the movie isn't worth it.  The acting is so bad, especially the characters.  I haven't seen this film much, but I did like it before reading it and have watched it twice and had some difficulty understanding it. I've seen it again and nothing to say except that the acting isn't good and the film doesn't have much suspense or suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the movie twice, so I have to admit that it was not really an original film, as I've seen many so many of them. But it is still a bad piece of work for a low budget movie about a kid who spends $10,000 (or more, on a rental, for an hour) to see what is supposed to be an original and good film, and turns into a complete crap movie.   The story of the girl who runs a gas station in the middle of nowhere, and her dad is a racist (not a racist or homophobic one) who has not stopped eating his meat before he has been married (for only $500), but his girlfriend is very sad that she hasn't met the guy who has been going to her home. They have run off together and are in a battle over the same subject (that is not homophobia, but people who are homophobic will never learn to be gay and can do that sort of thing).  I am very interested in seeing a movie about people who act in homophobic ways, and people who believe this is morally right. It is about people in the real world, and there is nothing funny or funny about this. If you really want to laugh, don't. If people want to cry, don. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst, most predictable movies to see released in the year of 2005. But that's what the director says it is and that is what it is. I'm guessing that these people are in a perpetual state of rage that their opinions of the movie have been taken seriously by the world's media. There is no attempt to make a movie with comedy or a plot or a character development. There's no character development, no dialogue, no humor or any plot development, etc. And I'm not going to be sad about the fact that the director doesn't want to make movies anymore. But the overall picture is boring and disappointing. I don't recommend this movie unless it's a horror movie. And the film is not even scary in any way. If you like a horror/no comedy movie, that's not the best choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise, while interesting, is a poorly executed film by a team of inexperienced actors. The story starts with a plot that doesn't even contain enough details for its story to matter. The plot has one element that was simply too contrived to be a story. One of the main characters in the story was so bland and one of the only female characters. The director should not have made any effort to get that character to the point of becoming interesting or to even be believable.  There are too many things that the movie is supposed to be about to be. The direction, acting, camera, and soundtrack seem to have done just enough to be good to be bad, but there's a strong theme that isn't in fact there, like "I'm gonna make my way free". A good movie only has a bad tag, and even though it is funny, it has too many flaws to be enjoyable. And even worse, the actors' voices seem to lack depth. They have nothing to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie in the theater at the same theater where I saw "American Made". And now I'm looking for a new copy of this movie on VHS and my suspicions are confirmed.  I'm still confused about it and the only good thing I can think of is that the movie does have an interesting script.  But unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver what it promised. The actor's performance seems to fall to an average low. I'm also concerned about the fact that the actor is inexperienced at the point of shooting the movie and he doesn't even look comfortable, particularly when he was involved in "American" Made, which was not even a big film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't make up this comment about it.  What a movie this really is? You know what a movie is? It is stupid, ugly, and depressing.  I didn't even like the movie, but I can give you a few points.  There is a long list of reasons why it can be good, but there's no reason why it was good to start. There are no real reason why a movie like this could have made it so bad. I mean, even the guy with the "stache" hat on can see it all. The "gum is wet" is a good movie, if you think it's OK to like it because you like the character.  This movie is full of pointless things. The ending is the worst thing I've ever seen, ever.  If you think this is good, ask yourself if you'd seen the movie when they made it. Then let me tell you how it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all the movie had an excellent script but no good acting, this made for a laughable movie. Also there is a decent, if somewhat low-budget budget at the beginning, I was surprised. However, if you liked the movie and actually want to watch it, it is not a very good film, not even a decent horror film. You probably won't want to rent it again but at least you might want to get one for the price. I recommend a quick quick-time review of this bad movie, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, they put an actual photo of a man in the bath. But a girl and a guy are standing up and getting sucked into the water. He is so embarrassed by the water that he decides to run away.  When he falls, he is caught in the pool. The girl and guy are just like a pair of rubber bands. The first time we've seen that man we've never seen.  After this film we get a glimpse of the bath man who we're supposed to find in the next scene, then we're put in the tub with an acid solution. That's where our story begins.  There is no real reason why this man would end up in a bath with a girl, but it DOES seem like he is in search of some sort of escape.   But the funny thing is that there are so many problems with this film. We aren't given anything until the beginning is almost over. In the end, we don't really get to see what happens. And as they are in the bathroom, there's nothing to see. So far there are few real clues in this story.  I'm sure the producer and his brother, and I have learned the secret, but please don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why this is such a big deal to me when I first saw this movie in the late 1980's and I remember the very bad review it received back when I was starting to watch it. I was so embarrassed after seeing this movie. I remember this movie was rated a 1.5 out of 10, but this review is not quite fair. So I'm going to give it one big bonus score.  I gave this movie a 1 because I think it is OK to give this movie an average rating. I give it an average score because it has some good acting and some pretty good action but it's so bad that this movie could lose the score. Overall this movie is bad, awful, and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my eyes, this movie is terrible. The dialog is very thin and unbelievable. I thought that it was a great movie. But it is so far from being great that I cannot recommend it. It is not even funny at all. I recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two main differences between this movie and other films. Firstly, the time period between the two war films was so drastically exaggerated as it wasn't even remotely plausible to believe that a conflict between Germany and the USSR was imminent. Second, this was very dull, and not even remotely realistic, despite the fact that it seemed to be an ongoing war that had been in the back and forth of all movies. I was particularly appalled that the ending had to be so incredibly slow that I didn't even understand it. It wasn't very credible to me that the war was about to break up. Of course, the film makers didn't make any effort to hide the fact they were writing this story and the result was just plain boring. I suppose it was a very expensive war effort but if you were watching it, you would have to have a reason for thinking it was actually serious. And even though it had been a war, it still seemed too soon to be a serious war and seemed like it was going to break. There was too much talk of the Soviet people making up in their minds and the fact of the war, which made me very uneasy to even think about the conflict, and the dialog between the German and Soviet soldiers was rather clumsy and unrealistic and the end had no real impact on the story.  The idea of the "war-crash" seems to be thrown out there because it is too hard to believe.  While the film does have some entertaining parts - the Russian soldiers having a talk with the German soldiers, the Nazi soldiers having an encounter with the Allied soldiers and the women coming on a train carrying the German army and then going to the Americans - and even some parts of the soldiers and Soviet citizens having a conversation - the movie could never have been realistic and had no idea of a war on its future. I'm also pretty sure that the Russians did have a chance at getting a break out during the war. Perhaps that is why it didn't occur during the first war and the Russians didn't have to get a really serious war - I mean the Germans knew their soldiers weren't going to win. The Russians fought their final stand by themselves. The Germans were also allowed to get out of the way before the Soviet troops could be involved but they couldn't. The Russian soldiers couldn't kill the Soviets, it just sort of died and there was no real reason to have to go on a nuclear war.  A better version of the movie was produced by the same
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how I was expecting this film to be a good horror film. There are very few things I can recall, such as the lack of gore, the very weak dialogs and the general lack of horror-movie-style. But, unfortunately, it was a complete failure. The director did the best he could with his low budget, but I'm not about getting any sleep at night, as this is a fairly low budget horror film, and I think there's a lot of money to make. This is the most boring horror film I've seen in awhile. The gore is OK, but it's not great and the story is not funny. What this means in effect is a very cheap horror film that does not take advantage of the whole genre, and has no true genre. It's very disappointing. If you're hoping for a good story, make sure that you watch the first one before coming on it. Otherwise, this is not worth your time, and does not deliver anything entertaining. I'd recommend the less interesting and less entertaining horror films, such is the films of "Killer On Rails", or the "Black Mirror" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this film before. I found it on YouTube to watch it. I did not like it. The acting was bad, and the film is so bad that it leaves no way for any of us to actually understand the plot. My friends did not understand the story in advance of the film. When I saw the trailer I thought the story was about how there were "ghosts" of the souls who supposedly died in the past, and went to the afterlife of the spirits. The ghosts are coming to find "ghost" souls in the world, and it would be easy to believe. Also, what a waste of the time, money, and effort to get my friend to the "Ghosts" in the afterlife. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first film of "The American Football" is the first movie about a football team, the most ridiculous of "football" films ever made. There's no story, no plot, no action, and even the opening credits and title sequence are so bad that they might be considered as part of a movie. This is, indeed, the worst movie I've seen since "Curse of Blood", which I actually liked to see, even though I couldn't even finish it. There is no plot; the opening title is about the first football game. It isn't even a football game; it is just an old football movie. The main characters have a fake "kickoff" in the first game, so the first film has no story.  The ending is stupid and nonsensical; the ending is the very least entertaining ending. The reason I laughed is that the ending actually is the greatest movie made of all time! It just goes out of the way, and is just about as funny as the original. And I'm sure that any film made in the world will never be able to rival "Cobscout of Blood" in terms of the overall excellence, and I think even the Japanese version of "Cipher of Blood". But, because I'm obsessed with this movie, I'm willing to admit I'm guilty as a fellow comedian who laughed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say this movie is not funny at all, but it could be interesting if the jokes were funny. If the jokes in the movie were funny, I might get mad at the first couple of them. There were an awful lot of "winnie little bunnies" and "little bunnits" that are far less funny than the ones I've seen on television. The jokes were pretty good though, but there wasn't enough humor for the movie.  What bothers me is how it takes a long time to get rid of the humor in this movie. The movie was about 20 minutes long and I could tell that it wasn't there for much longer. I didn't care if it was a good movie as much as I didn\'t care if the movie was too long. The plot of the movie is bad, it wasn\'t funny, but I felt that it didn\'n make any sense, and it felt like it was taking too long for the jokes to come out. I did enjoy the fact that the kids were actually in trouble, and I enjoyed the fact they had to be a coward, as I said, but the movie didn't give me any sense of any good. I don\'t think this movie was meant for comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all respects this movie was a disappointment. The movie had some nice bits and scenes. But they were totally wasted. There was absolutely no scene where the two of them could really go together. The whole plot was awful, the whole acting and everything felt cheap. The lead actor was obviously terrible, although it is not entirely his fault. The main character's not so bad though...but the director was pretty clueless about what he was doing. I guess he was just doing it because he got bored and needed to do something. There were a couple of plot twists that were obviously intended, but they were too obvious. But overall I could only recommend this movie for those who had nothing to do with the movie, and those who just wanted to see some crappy movie. This movie would not be suitable for a younger sibling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you walk through the first 3-4 minutes of this movie, you realize that the plot is completely implausible, and then you get bored. That was enough to make me believe this movie was a terrible movie, but it's more like an attempt to make a comedy to be funny in the way that everyone else can (but, unfortunately, it can't be taken seriously by anyone, even if you know what's funny.) I'm not sure what's the point of this film, though I don't know what the other 5-6 minutes were supposed to be. I had no idea how serious it was, but apparently it was. I don 't know how much to be expected to make fun of a bad film; it is obvious from the first 5 minutes. I mean, it's just ridiculous to expect these things to happen in a "true" comedy, but you don't necessarily need to have more than the 5-10 minutes to expect it.  It's just annoying to watch. I'll give you some good things about it, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the actors and the writer make their film in a movie, they do something very odd with this one. The characters, the plot, and the storyline all look like an episode of some kind of bad piece of TV. The dialog is predictable and incoherent, the direction is bad and the acting is bad.  But, when the director, Steven Soderbeths, is involved in this project, you realize that he should be responsible for making a movie like this one, with the proper casting, directing, and financing, in a way that makes it less scary. If you want to see an example of his film, see "House Of Cards."   In this movie, there are two characters, one who is very close to a teenager, and one who isn't. The teenager is in love with another woman, the other who is in denial of the love. The relationship turns sad and painful, and they become locked in and never, ever, stay in love. But it is unclear whether the teenager actually wants to be in love, or whether she is just using the girl's feelings as a way to distract from the sad behavior of the other women. This is what we got from "House of Cards"-- that, despite all his best efforts to be charming, the actor doesn't quite act like a romantic hero. He is very insecure and insecure. The only person he could be loving is his friend, Jessica.  There's no chemistry between them, and at the end of the film the teens are in the final stages of their relationship, which is then, of course, broken and thrown off, because a girl doesn't want to break it off. The two women are in an awkward situation, and that is not the end.  Even though it is very sad, it's pretty stupid, the movie is just another version of an actor doing his job. There's nothing new here. The actors don't get into character that would even remotely match his material, but the material is the same as the material he has been making up in this movie.  The writing is the worst of the movie, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was an obvious example of a bad, pointless comedy. the acting is the only reason for the movie to have its first 6 stars. the movie is not funny and it lacks much in the script. the plot is laughable and there are no strong characters. the characters are stupid and nothing really needs to be said. if you want to see some good comedy, watch this movie. the other point is that you probably can never watch this film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the words of my late friend (who is a real horror aficionado - with a morbid smile) this movie was pretty creepy and just plain awful. I couldn't help thinking of it as one of those "films" that take you back to the beginning of the film but the other half of the script seems to follow that, in a sense, like a movie about a ghost who has come to seek revenge, and then goes to the afterlife, whereupon his body was buried or burned to death, as the characters' own funeral arrangements had made it known. However, after you get all of the way through the movie (the first 5 or so minutes are pretty good, and I thought the film could have been a movie like "The Dead". I had seen this as a horror, but after I finished watching it I just thought the story was not very interesting. And I still got to know the characters from this movie pretty early on. They were pretty pathetic, and the film just began to come around so hard it really looked like it could have used some of the most powerful scenes in a horror film. It's kinda hard to come out of the movie's low budget, but at least it could help one movie to be a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at the height of my life when I was a young kid. It was bad for me and it was horrible for the young people who had to have seen it so many times. The people in the film were totally ridiculous and I found myself laughing, like a 10 year old. I've seen it a few times and I still think there was a little bit better than a rip-off to a bad video of one of the "I'm not your daddy!" films of the year. I wish it would get some money and take care of its production. The video is absolutely terrible and the acting is completely bad. I'll give it a second rating because I think it does have some good qualities but it was not one that makes me laugh. I would give this to a cheap video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete joke, and I don't even know why it had the name "The American" but that's only the thing that's funny. I have to admit that this movie was bad, I mean terrible, bad, bad...but that doesn't mean it is a true horror story. The way it is supposed to be "just a horror film" is laughable, I'm sure that is just a way to tell a very old movie in another country in the way it has been presented without any meaning, that's not a horror story, and that's what this movie's all about.  The movie contains so many of the wrongs I've read about from "The Americans" movie, the way in which the character is supposed a "real person", and the way they are treated, with a poor treatment of the character. That's what I call "just one of their tricks, like when the Americans were just pretending they have a connection with the people they are pretending to be, like this movie has.  If you're looking for a horror movie with good blood and gore, you should avoid this movie like a bad beer. Don't waste your time, and just watch this movie in a movie: its bad, the crappy, and there is nothing else in it that is funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You really need to see the movie in a video store and then go to YouTube. It is a bunch of crap. The script is terrible, the dialogue and the acting are just plain bad. The plot is even worse than the original "Sausuma's Revenge". But i love that movie. That is the best thing ever in my life ever. Even though they made it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good things in this movie but unfortunately this one did not. I have not watched it for years and could not find any good thing. I'm not even sure what the "plot" is. It starts out as something that's too ridiculous to be believable and then it turns funny. Then the movie turns into something else that's even dumber. It is really sad to see the movie. It's hard to make out what the plot is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading my review about this movie, it turns out that it's just about as bad as some of the early '90s fare.  I'm not going to start crying about this because it's only a few of the films that have this sort of sub-standard '70s 'fantasy' over on. I'm sorry, because they all suck!  I guess it's what you would expect to see.   They've got it together but I have some advice for those who like it. Don't rent it out on Amazon.  If you're a fan of any one of the '70's comedies, watch it because it isn't actually an original film, and don't buy this movie if you're looking for 'Iron Man' or 'Sudden Iron' or something.  Some of the guys doing this might have been pretty good actors, like Charles Bair (who was one of my favorite actors in 'Iron Men') and Jason Durden (who I'm guessing was the closest to the way of 'Iron men'). I just wish they weren't making this sort-of-real, over-the-top comedy.  It's so bad, I'm almost afraid of anyone recommending this one, and I can't really blame them, because I don't think anyone ever gave this one any love.  (1)  2) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors have one or two decent acting performances, but they don't give much of anything to a story that is nothing but an amateurish little love affair between two guys who would obviously struggle to survive. I can forgive them, because I think their acting is very good, but at a point when they're supposed to act like teenagers, they just don't have any range, just a dull, shallow, and utterly meaningless love affair that doesn't allow for any real emotion. Also, I'm surprised that there are only one of the actors, who are actually good, in this movie. It's also surprising that the only character in the whole film is female, so I think that's the only thing that makes this movie actually worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this for the last 20 years, and the only time I've ever been sick is to watch it. It's an in-depth, pretentious, self-entitioning film about a soap opera with no plot whatsoever. One good thing about it is that the characters are cute, the dialog is good and the plot is totally stupid. But even if that was good, there's nothing at all about it.  The other bad thing about this is the acting. The girls are annoying and the dialog themselves are stupid, the acting is poor. But the worst part about this film is that it contains the same old "The One Ring" musical number. It has nothing about it and it really made me sick. I've heard so many people claim it's a sequel to "The Six Days of Revelation". But just to be honest, I've never seen anything else like that, and even if I were to hear the soundtrack of "The Two Manly Doctors", I would never recognize it as a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a little bit sad to see this movie as it is quite so uninteresting and disappointing. It does offer some ideas but nothing new. The acting is weak and the story of the story is boring. The animation is ok but nothing good either. This film does not even have the most original story of it. No real drama, no real drama. This movie does not have any meaning whatsoever. This has a story in the story but not in the main character. Also I don't understand where the story comes from. I am looking for the story to have a meaning. A lot of money for this movie has been wasted. It could have been better put into a more interesting movie like "The Grandfather's Last Days" or some other film which has a better story of its own. In the end this movie leaves a bad impression. It is a very uninteresting movie that could have used some money. I don´t have any praise for this film at all, the direction and story are bad. It leaves you bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand the premise, if you think "the plot is about to end." "the world is dying" -- and "everyone is dying!" is very vague. However, I do understand the point of "the first person" at the beginning is you, and you are going to find out what is going to happen to the world. This is the same kind of movie as "The Hunger Games," except in the extreme of both the subject matter and the message. There's a lot of pointless plot points, and it's completely pointless for the film to be effective, since you get lost in its "plot" in the first 30 seconds. I'm a fan of movies, but this is one of those movies. You're just watching for the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this book on Amazon and came so close it touched me in the way that I thought it might not make sense. I think it's funny and maybe even funny, but not funny enough. And this book is full of so many mis-taunts and insults, and the only thing about the book that I found interesting was the way the writer writes that the hero (I'm not talking about the heroes in the book, just the men) is a woman.  I think she writes a bad thing about a girl. It's just a little sad, the kind of a bitch with a heart of gold.  There are no good lines in the whole book. Not even an ending. In the first scene of the book the girl is talking with an old man who wants to get into the woman's life, and is so nice to the man that the girl comes across to the old man and is clearly embarrassed by this. The girl wants to take this man into her bedroom, but is so scared that she does everything that anyone can do.  The end happens that this girl doesn't want to take her husband to bed with her, and that's it. And in the end the men are going to the house and the woman is in tears. I can never find out why she had it taken away, since it wasn't very clear in the beginning. The first scene in the last scene of this book was a good one, a funny moment, with the girl walking in front with tears. That was good.  It was too slow and too bad to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always been a critic of movies with no interest, but this is the worst I've ever seen!  In an attempt to "lighten" it, a character named "Humble" takes over one day every morning to do an analysis of a local movie. The scene begins when he arrives in the town where he's staying and talks with an old lady. The old lady's daughter has just died and the girl is unhappy with him and he seems to be somewhat happy about the scene.  There is some really funny elements (some of which are not in the book, but I'll try to ignore the jokes) but at the same time it isn't funny enough. I have to admit that he talks to a girl who looks like a girl. There is no real indication of who he is talking to. He talks about his daughter saying she's sorry that her parents won't bury the girl's body in the land of the dead.  I can't really understand why that happened.  The character is too stupid to be a good actor (as I said in my previous review of the movie, the character in the movie is stupid -  The movie is about as cheesy as it can get. This is not serious about being funny - it was supposed to be funny but unfortunately it wasn't.)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you read any positive review about this movie: please ask if the movie is accurate and how accurate it is. The director's script is bad and the acting is bad as well. I can understand that a few of the actors may have been really good but the script is completely devoid of anything to suggest the story. The way the main character is portrayed is just plain stupid. The direction is bad too and the dialogue is just bad and really not convincing. Overall this movie is really disappointing. This movie is so bad it hurts me! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of Ron Burgle but I hate this one. There was a good point to this film but I didn't like it. I think that I'm still angry because I hated all of the acting, but the story was not interesting and I didn´t get much interest in the story line. The first 3 minutes were alright. There were some really funny scenes. But the end was just a waste of time. I'd definitely give this movie a B for effort and no thank that Ron Burglet is still in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the film in its preview days. I felt very angry after watching the previews. The plot had little relevance and the dialogue was very poor, although I didn't mind the fact that the actors were good. I knew that the film had a pretty good director, but at the end I felt extremely sad. The ending is very dull, and I don't know why the story is so predictable, especially if there is a third sequel. Even the ending was pretty corny. I thought the story was good at the beginning, but I was bored by it. I found the plot so unbelievable and the dialog was too stupid, so I didn�t care about the story anymore. I give this movie two stars, though I have some respect for the actors (though I don�t understand why they have their own films, like the sequel). However, the actors really sucked at being in a movie as a series. They weren�t doing their job and acting.  I think the director didn�D be very good. The story was a bad imitation of a horror movie and not a comedy, and the acting was poor and there were too many unnecessary twists and corny scenes. I didn �really� think the ending is okay, considering how stupid the director is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first installment of this story, the two main female characters were pretty predictable. The other two women were only pretty atypical. We could barely figure out what their motivations were. But there was also one woman who was so obviously terrible that even after watching the first episode, the other two characters would never even recognize her self to be capable of such behavior. In a story set in the mid-1970s, the main female character would always look at the male counterpart. She would always be smiling and cheerful, never sad or angry or even sad.  The woman would always smile because the other guy was just a happy guy and the other man never liked her because he didn't even recognize that she was acting in such a way to save him.  It was always clear that the two men always had a reason to be happy and to be in a good relationship with the other woman, and that it was always true. The one person who was in this episode that would never be sad at all was obviously the villain. The person who would be sad and lonely would never act to the other person that would be in this story. And even in the case of the other women, our main female protagonist would never make the slightest effort to save the man she was in love with.  But in the first story, there were at least one woman that was genuinely nice. But then, all those things didn't happen. I found myself looking at the women who were in that story and thinking, "Oh, you're a nice person." But then the movie got canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like a scene in a bad piece of American Horror. The ending is completely disconnected from the rest of the film...it's a complete, pointless, and totally incoherent and over-the-time incoherent story. That's pretty much a big problem, because it makes no sense of a plot...it never tells a story. It never goes anywhere near the ending.  This is a bad American Horror spoof. If you like it, it's probably a little too funny, but a little less funny than the original.  It is not a good excuse for a movie, but it's a good way to have a bad film make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, it would be nice to say this movie could be the same in a different universe. I mean in a galaxy far, far away universe. Where the action is actually faster, the story is slower, and the characters aren't on the same level. The story's boring, and there are just so few important characters who can do their jobs. In order to have the viewer understand what was happening, a director must make sure you can't guess the entire story, and they must go to an insane man to try and explain what was going on in the film. It would take away a big part of the movie's energy, which I think is a huge part of being a "fan", because you can really understand the whole plot before reading the next section.   The plot was good in one way, but, unfortunately, I was a "no one" who had to see through the plot.  It seems like they were never really interested in how this movie was made. I really didn't care. I would give this movie one stars for writing the best script, but it's just so bad! It just didn't have all of the important scenes in the entire film.  4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a bad film with a disappointing ending that was bad on a plot and some pretty decent scenes. I think this was the worst film I've seen, and I'm not saying that it was terrible, but there are several elements that seemed to be missing. Also, the acting had a bad quality to some sequences (especially the ending) and I think the ending looked pretty desperate, although it looks like it's supposed to go in the end. I don't think the director has anything to do with this, and even had a chance to finish the film. This is also a bad thing on the music as well, although I didn't think this soundtrack was bad, and the music was good. The songs were very bad as the music is about as good as it could be. There were also two songs that were far too long, and were just half the music to the movie. I'm sure the music will be used for a good movie when the director decides to shoot it in order to make some kind of film for TV, but I don" believe it's good for a bad director to do. This movie could have been made by one guy who got inspired by the early 60's films of the genre, which is a shame to such a guy. I'll watch this once, but probably don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this movie? What's up? It's another version of the classic, but I'm not sure about that. What's the problem? The plot is not all that interesting, what the hell is in it? The script and the cinematography don't much matter, if you want to see some pictures to show you.  There is a long section at the end of the movie, but you have to see it in order to understand what's happening. If you want this movie to be a comedy, you have got to watch this, even if you do see it on TV.  The story was very weak and the acting was very poor. There are two pretty obvious endings, but there's an even less obvious ending.  If you just want to watch one movie, don't waste your time watching this one. You don't necessarily have to.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I don't know who this person is, and I just know the people who have produced this terrible movie and this is the end of the movie. The movie is about a murder that starts with an innocent pregnant woman (played by Carla Garson), who is later found on the floor in a dark room with her husband (played the comedian/actor Eddie Dean), who then attempts to murder the wife (played as Nancy Daniels) by throwing an explosive bomb at her husband and a policeman named Joe Pomeroy. Pomeroyle and Pomeroys are soon caught in the act, with which he and the cops are shown watching it in a slow-motion sequence. The police are shown on the scene after Pomerox has been brought out of his handcuffs, where he and Pompoy look on helplessly as he gets into the room he and he is locked in with the door shut down.  The film is not funny at all, and when the cops and the witnesses are shown finally having the same conversation (though the way in which the story begins is unclear), it is treated as a mere plot. The story ends with Pomerow giving his daughter, an impulsive girl named Nancy Daniels (Kathy Daniels) and a bunch of random strangers who have nothing but money to throw at her. The plot seems to have a long and strange plot, but it comes to a crashing down a cliff when the whole thing collapses. Pomping up on the woman (in this case the mother) appears on a bus stop by the police; she is then arrested, and gets beaten up by a member of the mob.  After this crash, the gang get into a fight over a couple of beers. The gang then take a bunch to their camps for a while, and the two guys are set on fire, killing everyone in the camps. Pomole has a brief scene of his girlfriend (the blonde woman who is one of the robbers in the "Death of Nancy") standing on a bench with a man in his underwear and he gets very horny. POMO then becomes a drunk, and his penis gets stuck in the back of his underwear.  Then they're set on the couch, and one of Pompoys' friends is taking a bath and the gang go for a drink. Pomicola is then shown, and he wakes up with an erect penis and he then proceeds to pee in it, and has his friends throw a few gallons of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been coming to this movie for years and I'm not very happy to see it again. I'm a guy who's been on Disney Studios for years now and really enjoy Disney and Disney Channel. I don't care how Disney Studios films are made, and I'll be honest, most of them are good. I just don't want to watch this movie. This movie is really just awful and the acting is terrible. The acting is not realistic at all and the story doesn't make sense. What I'm trying to say is that Disney can't afford to produce something that looks like a movie to an American audience. This is the worst movie of all time. The worst movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has to rank in the worst movies I've seen since my childhood. I have never been able to understand this movie. It's so obvious and predictable. There's nothing that makes any sense whatsoever. The characters are not funny and the story is absolutely bad. I cannot believe this movie was ever made for money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film to be so awful. I was hoping that it would be an 8 out 10, but it was a 6. The only thing about this film that makes me feel good is the acting, which I thought the whole movie was really bad, even though I thought that the other actors were good. The movie is really sad for my fellow actors, and I feel that this is a pretty awful film to watch, and that the movie is so bad, that it could probably have been good. I had never watched this film, but if you have never seen this movie, please don't even see it. It should never be a hit. It is so sad, in fact, that if you want to see the other films from this movie in a good movie, I would suggest that this film should be an 7 out 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even say I thought it was funny or pretty funny. It's just pointless and awful! I cannot believe it's OK to use this material to insult people. I hope the actor is still sane! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty predictable and the actors are predictable. Unfortunately, some of the casting choices are misplaced and bad. The plot becomes uninteresting and the acting is bad to the point of being incomprehensible. Some of the actors seem to try to make the show more interesting when they get into character. They can try to act in a funny way and show off their acting skills but it's clear that this is just a wasted effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it's funny. The girls are not good at all, that the people they are in are not well. This movie was made in the 60's, and it's not gonna be remembered for much. I'm not sure about the ending. This is a movie that should have been titled "The Crazy One". I'm sure the producers had to make it so that nobody would even care about this movie. It has some of the typical elements of the cult film, but I'm still amazed at the filmmakers. I have seen several of the "cult film" films made during the 1950's and they are way better. But some of them weren't even good.  I can't recommend this movie because it was an even worse movie than "The Thing" and I think it was made because the producers couldn't find any good people to make this movie, so they would have to make the story "fun" instead of something good. But even if it's made in a cult cult film you wouldn't necessarily want to see this movie to go to the rave. This must be a cult film because it's like a cult movie, but when you are in a religion cult movie it's usually not that good. I think some of those cult films make cult films because they are so crazy and some movies are so entertaining, but those cult movies don't make money either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was pretty predictable, and a little too long. The ending seemed interesting at the time, though it didn't exactly make the end up. A lot of time did go by on the acting department, though there were a couple of bits that could have done wonders. There was not enough time for anyone to keep the plot moving forward on purpose, and I think that part was a bit unfair in the end. I'm not sure whether this is a bad film because a lot of it's pretty stupid. I guess that's part of the reason for the film's appeal, but it's not like one of those comedies you watch when you're really bored. There are a lot less funny moments in this film, so don't go watching it at the end of the movie just because there's no plot.  Overall, a bad picture of a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this flick, I was really angry. I was annoyed by the way the story was dragged in by an entirely unbalanced script. My expectations were completely destroyed. But there are many moments in this movie that are simply stupid. I'd give any idiot who has read it as a kids reading a comic to the first of a lot of adult talk about how a movie could make you really feel sad.  One in a line is just as ridiculous as another.  The director's intentions were obviously not being that clear, though I wish them hadn't wasted a whole movie. The dialog and lines are simply nonsensical. The ending is bad as the end of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing I've watched from years past. Its almost identical to an episode from the first season of True Detective Series. Not the best movie on that series.  The only good thing about this series is that it was my first and the only time I saw True Detective. It was certainly the worst ever seen. It is just sad to see these characters and the writer/director (Casterin) leave their work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a total waste of time and I have to tell you, I will be looking for my life in it. I was expecting a good film but I was disappointed. The film was about 60 minutes, it was just a waste of money. A waste of $10 or $10 plus 10 bucks to go for this project. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie the rating, but there were a few bright spots. But there was a lot of garbage. And the acting was terrible. I give this film a 10 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still waiting to see a sequel. It won't happen but I think it might happen. I don't think it will make much better, though I am somewhat surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was awful. It was the worst video I have ever seen. It is very bad in the best way. It's hard to make out a little bit of story. The music is bad too. The characters were awful, the editing was bad, etc. But the good parts were, the acting, and the acting were ok, the plot was pretty good. The ending of the movie was the weakest I have seen for years. I am really sick of it.   This was bad. I think I'd recommend watching this movie only if you are sick of the people who have made it. It has a message about not being able to understand the message and the message is really clear. The plot is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading what I had learned about this movie, I was stunned. What I was taught was that I couldn't believe any film would ever be so bad. So I decided to listen to an original review of one of the first films, THE DO NOT BUILD THAT MOVIE.  I can see why this made me sick. It was so bad that it had some of the greatest acting and acting of the 1960's. The script was bad, the characters were stupid, the locations were totally uninteresting, the cinematography was bad and the photography was bad. What a waste of money to waste on this film! I would've stayed away from this movie in a heartbeat, but thankfully I did. This film is so bad! It is so unbelievably bad that I'm amazed that it got a 'D' rating! It should probably be rated 3.5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a major weakness on this movie's lackluster efforts.  The movie ends with a fairly predictable end that makes me believe the film was meant to be about an intergalactic battle between the male protagonists. The film is disappointing because it fails to deliver that quality and the viewer never knows whether the film is a parody or a straight-forward film.  If you're a fan of American animation, and don't have a great respect for this film, don't waste your time watching it. This film is just OK for the second of four. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i thought this movie was interesting, not so much because it was a gore fest and most of the film's dialog was about horror stories and nothing was actually scary, but the direction was terrible. it could have easily been a horror comedy, but I guess there's no need for any type of horror f*ckery except for a horror movie.  There were too many jokes that seemed to be the one big joke of the whole movie, and the dialogue seemed to come out too fast. it seemed like it was an attempt to bring back some of the early horror movies from the beginning, like Psycho, and even the film that had just released a remake of it from the same title. a decent horror film, but it just doesn't do it right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something else wrong with this film. I can't find anything at all. In the movie, the narrator is the person who got into an accident, and in the movie he goes back to the accident to tell him what happened. The only way I can make this connection is that the narrator seems to be the narrator. And he is not actually a writer! In the end, he is talking to the other narrator, and he is trying to find a way to avoid making it seem like he was a writer.  The other problem with the movie is that it contains a couple of scenes that are so badly choreographed, there's really nothing to compare it with the excellent "The Naked Gun" (which is pretty good too) and "The Paper Girls" (you'll see how they both are combined in a very different manner).  What this movie is about is that a character, one that has a deep personal struggle to overcome, comes back to life after being in an accident and is put back to his house with his family and children. In fact, his wife is pregnant, and it is up to the point where he is afraid. The movie is completely about drama, and the plot turns very bizarre. They are actually two totally different scenes. One is where his wife comes back from the toilet and she is crying, and then you'll see his wife in the shower with his hair in his eyes. The other scene is where a woman and her husband are having a discussion and she asks him for a new cigarette. The two women are going to go out to the hotel and ask him to take the cigarette into his hands and light it. And the woman and the man are going inside the hotel, where they are going for a drink of the smoke in the toilet. The man puts the cigarette in his mouth and the woman walks in with an alarm with a very loud alarm at her.  There is no clue that this is actually a movie. If you ask me, I would ask what it actually was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An obvious example of a poor movie. I tried to see it, but it wasn't convincing. I cannot get my eyes to see the acting. The story itself was pretty good and there was an element of romance and romance that seemed to exist. However, it failed to do well.  It had too much of the same old, recycled, and recycled characters who couldn't deliver much, and the acting was poor.  The music was OK for a few minutes and even the soundtrack sounded OK but it was too cheesy. The scenes were good but they were boring. The acting wasn't much good, either. The characters were bad, and nothing was good about the story.   I was hoping to hear the soundtrack, but sadly it wasnno longer.  Overall, if you were looking for a good movie then please try something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was watching this film just for the time, and that I had been curious to see it. That film had an over-the-top plot and a plot of "plot" after plot. It was simply a big pile of garbage. It had too much a "plot", and the plot is bad in a way that the plot was never used. It's not the kind of film that one would watch at a movie school, but rather an overused piece of film. Some of the film was funny, but the direction was bad. I saw this for a second time and I was sad to have watched it. It wasn't worth 4 or 5 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I don't understand why this movie is rated, but it is so bad! It is absolutely a horrible piece of work. It has to be the worst movie of all time. The storyline is really stupid, and the acting is stupid, the plot and the direction is terrible, the directing is awful, the acting and the editing is awful. The story is so pathetic that I didn't want to watch it. And I don''t understand what it is about the story.  I think this movie was made so cheap that it shows a complete lack of energy, which is very sad. There was no chemistry whatsoever in this movie, it was just awful. It really could have been easily made a better film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, it's a really bad movie. I'm not saying it's good, nor am I saying it is. But it isn't enjoyable at all. If you like the show, I guess it's okay, but if you don't like the way this movie is constructed it becomes a real embarrassment. I do recommend watching this show because it had some really good moments, but the rest of the time, and the movie itself, simply just don't.  This movie is absolutely despicable, and should have been made for nothing. Don't look at it, and don't rent it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the idea that the people who made this movie had an idea that it was about to make a funny film. That is what they wanted to make. They had all kinds of goofy ideas. One of them was this movie was about a woman that was a member of a "secret group". She was a secret group. In a certain place of an important meeting she told the other people that it had been "wrong" to do this. But as she said she liked them. They were not stupid or stupid but it wasn't fun. But people that said this in the film didn't listen to what she said. She didn't use it in a humorous way. I mean I didn't expect this movie to be anything like a sitcom. It was like a film to have a couple of jokes that were not funny. It wasn't funny, it was stupid and it wasnI'm ashamed of the people that made it. I'm ashamed because I bought it on DVD, but I knew I had seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out that this movie is supposed to be "realistic", however I didn't find this in any other movie I watched. This movie is not like other comedies because it is extremely stupid! It's supposed to have an "amazing" storyline. It has absolutely no plot, no comedy, no laughs, no tension. It is not funny! It is NOT a comedy! It needs to be a comedy at least for a comedy to be enjoyable and the movie doesn't really have any suspense! In my opinion it is not fun to watch! And no other funny movie that I have found out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for what it was supposed to be a comedy film, and didn't know what happened when it was over. It has three main characters that are the same, and there's still a plot twist in every single film. It starts off with a plot line about a couple falling into an intergalactic marriage, that leads to a dead bride that looks very old and has some blood on her face. I'm a sucker, but that's not a spoiler! If there were two movies released in the same month (the first one was made in 2004), they'd both get kicked off the floor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this movie to be good, considering the reviews. It sucked the first time around, and it got worse. I don't want to watch this thing, but it was pretty good. As much as I can admit. It's a very bad movie. The acting is horrible, and the ending is so lame, it hurts my eyes. It really should have gone straight to hell and left. The ending is good, but this is way too long, and I feel like it could be a funny one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have come to this movie because it's interesting. But to this point, it's not even interesting. The story is painfully predictable. It never goes anywhere! The acting is bad, and the story has the same old and annoying style that all films get by having characters act for a movie that doesn't matter to a story. It has little action and no plot. The music has just enough music to make your ears sing and that's the only good thing it has. I did not like this movie, but I'll tell you why because I think it was meant to be funny. It is absolutely ridiculous. I can't imagine how the writer of this movie was doing it. It needs to be taken away from the whole genre of film. It just needs a break from the "Hollywood" genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst film I have seen in a long time. I mean it's one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. And the acting is terrible! The acting is awful and it doesn't make up for a story that didn't have much to go in. And there's no sense of acting either.  I was really enjoying the movie, and it was pretty funny! But it wasn't funny. I didn't know what was going to happen until the end.  If you are looking for an offbeat comedy that doesn't really matter, this is the most disappointing film you can see. It's not funny enough, and doesn't even have a plot. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you really liked the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was amazed with my first time watching this movie that I didn't have any doubt this movie was a failure. I have never seen any other movie in a real sense like this movie. I found it amusing the first time I came across some of the jokes in this movie, they are not funny in any way. I think that would be good if they could get the same gag that would end with some laughter at least. But, if there are any other movies I would like to watch, the best would be this movie because most movies have a good gag that is pretty good in the first 20 minutes. I don't think there's any merit in watching a movie that has so many problems and even worse in the end. I would rather watch a movie from one person's perspective of the world, like an action movie or a horror movie or like a horror film.  The funny part of the movie is that most of the dialog, which is the very funny part, is used for the comedy purpose. But I found the other jokes in the movie are bad, and they're not funny at all. I'd be amazed if the people involved in this story were actually funny.  I can honestly say that I can't stand for this movie at all when it comes to entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There are a few good moments, but it just is bad. There's no real chemistry between the characters. The plot is just kind of stupid. I couldn't even sit and watch it, and the film is also completely predictable. I'd recommend avoiding it for a couple of reasons. A couple of years ago I saw it for the Halloween Festival, so I gave it some time to think about it. I still don't like it, but I did take a few hours and read some reviews.  I'm sure if you enjoy the movie and enjoy it, you will enjoy this bad movie. There wasn't even a decent scene in the final part. Even if you liked a good movie, you wouldn't like this one. I give this movie a negative rating in a bad film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does nothing interesting with this concept, and the ending is stupid. This is the worst movie of the decade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of the people that took this film to "test" the power of the most insane and possibly insane cult leader. My guess is that he was on the verge of turning into a real monster with the power to rule the world. I'm not even sure what he was doing at this point. That is a bad film to watch. It doesn't help that one actor (who is very good) gets a job in this movie to hide him from "the police". It really sucks! It really sucked!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely disappointing because of the fact that, for some people, it is the only film to have this much buzz. I didn't know what to say but I think it's a complete waste of time. In fact, I think the only point I'd be able to make it is that it is supposed to be scary. I have seen it before. I think what was the point of the message was really that they just wanted to shock people, but it didn't even do that. It was supposed to make people jump and run. I suppose you get the idea of how that happened when you watched this film, but I'm sure there was nothing to go there. If it was supposed that the whole thing would be scary, but that's only part of it and there aren't any surprises. Even though they don't want to scare anyone, there is nothing about the movie that makes anyone want to leave the movie. I mean, I don't know why it made a difference. This is just a typical crap movie and I think that if people are interested in watching it, they can still enjoy it without really enjoying it. I've never seen this movie before so I donno longer have any interest in making it again. I can't believe I wasted my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am sickened to even read the description on the box. I was expecting something better. But there is no plot, no good dialog, not a story line. There are no real characters or characters. The acting is awful, and I think that most of the actors are not good actors. I wish they could stick with the movie. I had never seen any of these movies but I can only imagine them being worse than this.  So I can't see any of my friends after this movie because of this movie, so I will just take it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You should just watch this crap. It's so bad that it's not worth watching, but I tried.  But you must only enjoy this because the good stuff is really good.  This is an insult of the gods, that they didn't recognize the talent of the talented actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "NUTS" is what I would like to have a sequel to. I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular than a decade ago. In my opinion, it's the most pointless Hollywood movies ever made. The plot seems to have been ripped from one of the greatest films of the past 40 years, "Rocky 2". It seems to be a new Hollywood hit that's been shoved into the movie industry's pocket and forgotten. That's bad for this movie because this isn't really a movie, it needs a sequel. A movie needs a plot to make the movie interesting, and it doesn't exist in the real world. If you want to get into a movie about a movie that can be interpreted by the best Hollywood actors, then this movie is a bad piece of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First the movie was just OK, it was OK, but it was not really a comedy. It was also pretty stupid in my opinion, and while it was funny the scene that made me laugh with an interesting joke was not one of the funniest scenes in this movie.  It also seemed like the film was way too thin and I felt like the whole movie was boring. The story was pretty predictable, but I was sick of the movie anyway, and that really bothered me. It also was pretty slow and didn't have a proper ending and it had just too many parts that were totally unnecessary. The acting was very bad, the comedy/silly jokes that could have been funny were a bit funny, but since the movie got so dull it just had to end. I just wish this was some kind of horror film where you could see something funny and funny and laugh in it. It seems like it was only meant to be a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although the name of the movie is something I would like to give it. The story is a complete waste of time. The first half of the story is already predictable, and there is no plot twist after that. The other half has a twist where all is very predictable, but not at all. And if the movie's ending is predictable, it's boring. The ending is pretty unbelievable. The best part of the film was the ending. The rest is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two scenes take place in the first act, then we see two female protagonists and one other character.  One of them is the boss, the other is the head of a family.  When the plot reaches its most ridiculous ends, the movie starts to become predictable. The scenes are so predictable and unbelievable they could easily be mistaken for a Hollywood film, except the director's own taste of working in Hollywood is so well carried out that it doesn't matter to him, no matter how well he thinks of this project.  It is very disappointing, in my opinion, to find a movie that's so utterly bad. It really is an idea that a director has just found some time to use and get ready for a job in Hollywood, and in a movie like this one there's no hope for its success. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're going to watch this movie, please don't. It's a disaster, a complete waste of time and money, and worst ever in my opinion. I don't want to be a movie-ner, but I really feel like this movie was designed to be as low budget as possible. I can't recommend this movie to anyone who would like a fun movie: I know it's a very boring, unoriginal film, but if you liked that movie, you should probably think twice about buying this movie. You'll never be interested in any of the plot or even the story. I had an absolutely wonderful time spending the whole movie, and then I had a horrendous disappointment, about 4 hours, after I'd wasted too much money on it. If you want something that doesn't take away from you, then buy the sequel, which is a good movie! If you have seen any of these movies, and even the sequel (they're okay), this movie is a bad one. If not, don't waste your time reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were two reasons why this movie was awful. Firstly, it's a pretty pretty picture but that's not a good reason to make a movie. There are some interesting moments but there are no plot points. This is the worst movie ever made. The only thing that's good about this movie is that there are some pretty good music songs, some good animation and that some of the acting was good. But that's about it. The movie made no effort to make any real suspense. In fact it seemed like there were three different endings. The ending was never even hinted at the ending. You could tell it was about a guy and this movie started about a movie because there was no one. This movie makes no effort whatsoever to be funny or even funny. It is an uninteresting movie that could probably be made for a sitcom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the two main characters in this film is the actress (Jean Louise Bourne). Jean Marie Bourne Bourne has an amazingly awful acting job. She is not quite acting well, at all, but the actor doesn't do her right. She's very good at the start and never gets better.  When she's the only person in the story, the movie begins with her character falling out of her world in the middle of an open desert. The scene starts with her leaving the desert. We then meet a woman named Marie, who we later learn has gone from the desert to a place called Desert Paradise, on a fishing trip to the Pacific.  The story of the fisherman and the woman (her name is not mentioned) is pretty silly. It also starts off with the first scene in the desert, with the woman running around a few kilometers, looking at a bunch of sand. But then we have to see her get into the house, and our heroine takes her place back to the desert again. The plot ends up going nowhere. We've known in the previous film, our heroine is named "Havens." This story is pretty stupid. But it's a very short film, and it starts out with a really good scene with a good story. That's about as much as I'd expect a film to have.  But that doesn't matter because it's the worst movie I've seen. It is the most painful thing I've ever heard, and I'm pretty sure you don't like it much, either. The acting is not that good, either, but not in the direction it's drawn towards. It's just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that I would like the film to have at least a bit of suspense. But I just couldn't see that on the screen. I kept looking at the clock on the film as the clock went and the movie went on. This film wasn't even suspense, it was an entertainment, a piece of junk, a bad piece of trash, a b-liner that didn't make much sense, a plot twist that didn� it's all about money, a man in a white coat, and a woman who is an evil monster. I am ashamed to admit that this film was a piece about the time of the first millennium. That would have been nice. This is what we live on now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is a very bad film. It has too many things in it, but that is the only good thing about it. I cannot recommend it because it is a complete lack of a story and I think that it is full of boring nonsense. The way the storyline is presented is not good. I was expecting that it would be more interesting than the ending. But unfortunately, that's just what happens. I have to admit, I liked the very interesting ending of "The Last Mission" because it was the final chapter of the movie and it was such an awesome ending.  There is a funny part in this film that shows the soldiers coming from Germany after the war in 1965. I didn't know that one story was that great. A soldier comes back to Germany and he is forced to leave his job, and then he just keeps his job. This soldier becomes a soldier in the military and he becomes a general in the army, and he has to follow a code while he is in the Army. Of course, he would eventually become the general, so his story would have ended at the same time. I don't believe that he was sent to war, because I heard that he got to a different location on the next day.  I think this movie made more money than most of the films I have seen. I've seen more than one dozen of them, and I have watched them in the box. They are all stupid and poorly made, and don't help people understand the way the movies are supposed to be.  What you should do, is not watch this movie. Avoid it if you have never seen it, or if you're a fan of Japanese anime. It is a long, boring film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They make the book look so stupid. A book about making magic for anyone should never be published. There are two of the characters involved in the book, and that's it. And the book has no plot. The magic is pretty weak and the story is so badly written that I wouldn't recommend anyone looking into it. I'm sure there are some people who would like it. It's not one of my favorite books ever, but I can't recommend any of them to anyone. You won't enjoy this book, but you'll spend a few days wasting money while it plays out on shelves. It should be left for the other books in the other series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dark Horse" is a complete disappointment. The plot is pretty much original. The ending is disappointing but it seems to have happened anyway.  The film has no redeeming qualities. The acting is amateur, the acting is bad, the cinematography is not good, and the soundtrack is terrible. It really should have been a full 10. If you can find some of my reviews about it and decide to see it, take it for half the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the first episode of the season of The Muppies, and found the rest of the movie really hard to believe. The first story arc seemed interesting and somewhat suspenseful. However, after the second story arc, I was just bored by the story line. I didn't like the characters, and I certainly didn't care about the plot. I don't even think this movie was worth watching, but I would have liked to have some sort of plot development. I'd have liked a better movie and a better plot to have developed. I can't believe this series was so bad and could have been much better. If I had to compare this to the two seasons, I would not get any enjoyment from this movie at all. The movie made it worse by making it so long! The next season of the Muppys will be much better, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never laughed so much. I've seen a lot of bad movies in the past; and these are probably the worst. "Rack Of Dollars" is the worst film I've ever seen. It's so bad that I actually laughed so hard. I don't know why, but the producers can't even be bothered with one-sided, one-point stories that take place throughout the film. I know this, but you have to understand something. Some of the stories take place after an event is staged, others take place in a separate scene. The "Necromonton" story is so lame that even the actors couldn't have cared so much for their storyline. They pretend to be a good actor, and the acting was so bad. They don't even seem to have any self-presence about their characters. And when the action is so fake, you start thinking about how much a film can be made from it. Even for a film that's good, it's so stupid.  I can see a funny movie at a movie festival, but this is just one of many more movies. They should focus on getting the scenes, in the right form, which they should have done. This film doesn't even deserve to exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well the other two of the other movies listed in the top 10 in this movie, "The Little Thing That Was Next to Life," and "The Lost Movie" both beat it. "The Last Wish" was good but not as good as those two movies. And what about the other "Lost Movie"? I have to admit, I have just been listening to the comments on it. I really like the way this film is put together. I think it should have been a more realistic documentary about the movie. The story is good but I think the movie could have used a more serious look. The acting is so poor and the acting was so bad. The main storyline is about a man named Mr. Bighead who is a king of the city and gets drunk. When Mr.Bighead refuses to do what Mr.Wick has done, Mr.Cordell (who plays Mr.Buddy) gets to live in a hotel. He is then told by Mr.Fuzzy (who is played by Charles Martin) that he will be sent to jail by Mr Bighead's friends. The movie is about how Mr. Buddy spends his life in jail, as Mr.Thaddies play a major role in the story. And why does he go to jail? This seems to be just an excuse to keep Mr.Gillings and his brother from getting to prison. He does this because he wanted them to spend time on a new project. Why did they even send him to jail, considering the fact that Mr.Pinker's wife is in the same situation? No. He should have known what was happening in jail. He would have known.  There are a lot of problems in this film. There is no suspense or suspense. The cinematography is bad. There are so many stupid scenes that one must not be able to watch this film because the movie is just so bad and stupid. There has to be something else in it. The "Lost Crime" was a pretty good film but I would not recommend it to anyone. There were many reasons to dislike it, but this movie could not be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for some time and just left the room to find out if anyone liked this movie. That was the beginning. It is extremely bad, and I didn't think I was gonna see it again. I think this movie was made about 30 years ago. The characters are boring, the plot is weak, the movie is not funny, and there's no sense of anything. It's probably the worst comedy ever made.  I wish this movie had just been the awful, awful version of "The Big Fat Movie". But it was still good for its first few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the same movie I had never seen. I was expecting something good but was the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie had absolutely no plot, good acting and bad acting. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that it is so long and dark (not even a single scene in the last half of the movie). I would like to give this movie a rating of 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you watch this movie, be prepared to cry. I did. I weep for those who liked the original film because they thought the original was a good movie. They are wrong. This movie is about the most boring, bland, and uninspired I've seen in years. The plot is basically pointless. I was hoping to watch a movie that would give me some closure and amusement. But this movie is so bad that it's hard to even watch. It's like watching a bad kid film and thinking: "Hoo, the next kid is coming." It's about the worst bad movie I've ever seen, and that's not even a spoiler.  I understand why this is the best American movie of all time, but I can't watch it. The only person I can recommend it to is an Australian. A bad kid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a huge fan of the video of the movie. I can only say the acting is bad and the acting has no charisma and isn't even really that believable.  A great actor like Melvada is a great actress but it's so dry and the film is so bad it just doesn't have that feeling like it should.  I don't really understand why they did this movie. A movie about a group of girls who has sex with each other guy, and they're all just a bunch of guys who get all drunk and then go around naked on their knees, can't seem to enjoy this movie, but after a few days, I still think it's okay, but they aren't going to like this movie and most of the girls would like it better.   Maybe these guys will get drunk and get into a fight about something, and when you have an altercation, you'll find that it's just the same thing a guy would want to fight with.  Overall this is bad, because it isn't a film, but a video, which does make it look like it is a porn movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a movie fan of all the Disney movies and have always been very disappointed by it. I don't know what the hell this movie is supposed to be. It's like it's just like the "The Hunch" and "Alice" with it's lack of story and action. This is the worst Disney movie I have ever seen. I was really sick to watch this movie because I just wanted something real to go in there. I've seen other Disney movies better than this one. So, I was hoping that they could get some money out of it and make a decent one, but instead, it just made me sick. It has all the same basic plot and story beats, but it's not funny.  This movie is really like a video movie that could be put into a children's movie. I think it should have been put into an adult film like "Cinderella" or something like "The One Thing". I didn't like the characters, but this movie isn't even a children-specific film. I mean that it's for kids, but the acting seems pretty stupid for a kids movie, at least Disney usually has decent performances. The girls are OK, but they're not really the characters in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains no good scenes, at least the ones that are interesting or good. I was in the mood to watch it because it had a good plot, but I was sad that it was so bad. I know people have liked this movie because it was a good movie and it was also good in the first installment of "Grim Reaper", but it was not at all good when it comes to this movie. I think it's because a lot of stuff is in this movie and the film itself becomes boring. The storyline is pretty weak, and the camera work is bad. The characters are not good. There aren't any good characters. I am definitely not going to see it again, but the people that do have some redeeming qualities in these people are, in a way, boring, and uninteresting. They are boring, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was supposed to be a film for the "Dancing Queen" who has always wanted to act like a "Dancer" to have a fun time. The movie had a director, who never used a camera in anything but got a "B-movie" at the end, and one of the most disappointing scenes in history. The film starts off as an unimpressive and very stupid film about how women act like normal women, who get into sexual relationships with their men with no idea how the heck they act. There are no real story or plot. The characters are very stupid, and the "main" character, who's called the "Queen", has a woman, who starts off having nothing to do with her husband, who has a gambling problem and is thrown into a debt loan with a businessman, who wants to buy a bunch of "cheques" in the hopes of getting into the bank to get a life insurance deal. The women's reactions to this situation are pathetic and make the film seem like it's some kind of porn. It seems like they are falling in love with each other and that men are falling for their "Pillow" scheme.  This film doesn't come close to the worst of "Naughty Maid" and even this was better than a poorly conceived version of "Bachelorn". The cast is pretty weak and even the characters are weak and don't necessarily stick together throughout the film. They aren't even in each scene, making it impossible to understand their friendship, and at the same time it doesn't make any real effort to have fun.  The only person who seemed to really enjoy it was John Coker, who plays a drug dealer and was apparently the best actor in the movie. Other celebrities, such as Donald Rumsby, did get to see the film, which I think that the director must have been very excited to get as much work out of it as he possibly could. However, since he seemed to be the main reason for the film and to have such a great cast, I'd recommend watching it for a short time and hoping that it would be a "real film". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an utter garbage. The acting is horrible, the story is boring, the acting is stupid, and the dialogs are not funny. I saw some of the film in a theater, but if I saw the sequel, I would have to cut my head off.  There are so many things that are wrong here: the story, the dialog, the performances, the special effects are not good. I can't even remember one of the actors for the first of the movies.  But the most important problem here was the ending. I cannot tell whether they got it or not. And I cannot even figure out whether they were trying to make a sequel or not- they didn't even attempt to make an original sequel-but I am certain they did a very poor job. The fact that a bunch of teenagers were put together like this is obviously not a good sign of youth, but it makes them look ignorant and weak. That is what it was supposed to be. They were obviously trying to create a sequel, and even made their faces with the characters. It is obvious that something is missing. This is bad for anyone who like movies, but also very bad for those who do not like movies. It should be called BEW. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this film - it looked interesting and was fun, but the worst part about this film was that the plot is completely lacking. The best part was when one of the male stars (Cesar, or I believe it was one of them) said in a scene that he had had "something to do with me" with his friends, and then I realized how bad he was making out with their friend. They should be able to make a sequel or sequel. This film should probably just be a mediocre horror film because its just an attempt at entertaining and not scary. It didn't take any direction. There is nothing funny or funny or interesting except when the male characters do something stupid. You can't even say anything without getting into trouble. I just had to get out of the theater and never see this film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the second worst movie I have seen in quite a while. The plot is too bland to be fun and I think it's a bit of an excuse for the movie to fail. I don't understand why the writers decided to make this awful, when the writers have done a good job with other movies, the writers did a good work with the one and a bad job with this one.  It looks as if the writer were trying to make a'movie' that actually made you laugh. It's not funny, not funny and not funny.  There is nothing in this movie that really makes you laugh, which was my biggest disappointment.  My rating is 1. I did not find anything funny, there is no humor, there's not a funny scene, there are no laughs and no funny scenes.  The funny scenes are the old kind of scenes, those scenes where you laugh with the characters to the point that you are laughing. It doesn't happen nearly enough and they are always funny, the scene in the movie was stupid, but I didn't laugh.  This movie is about a single character, the character doesn't act properly, it doesn't matter if there is a fight between him and another character. And you don't get to know anything about the people who they are fighting.  I do think that this movie is mainly about one of the people, which the actors do a good impression of, which is about them. The acting is bad and the acting is terrible, but if you can laugh, that's a big bonus. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had me at least a small chance of getting into "A Good Movie: "The One Where the Guy You Were" because I have seen this picture twice on DVD. But after the 3 minutes I was unable to even see the guy. I mean, I can't remember if he was in it or if he is. It seems like he could fly like I would fly. It's like a bad film from a bad, stupid director and a terrible story.  Also, the acting in it is pretty stupid and stupid. A man who is a millionaire and he lives in a huge mansion is talking about a guy who buys a bunch of used baseball caps from the mail box he's sending to a kid who has gotten the key for a movie called "The Show that People Wore".  If you are expecting a "good movie", please don't waste money on this movie. If you want a "real life", you'll be much better in the real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the movie is that the women get a new job in a fast-moving city and that they meet that is to be their best friend and they all become good friends to each other. It could be interpreted in the worst way possible.  I did laugh for the first time at the scene where a woman is getting to work because she says, "I have my job in my city". It could have been better. I guess it was better if the woman was in a good job and all the women in the world were good friends.  Also, the actress is not a real actress.  The movie starts with the "jealous person". I get that it's OK to laugh at the guy because she's in a bad situation, and she doesn't want to get involved with anyone else, but that's too long.  What happened next? We heard the following from a woman who said, "The movie starts out with my friend talking about how she's getting married again. Well, it goes downhill from there. She is having a hard time with the people. She's trying to convince the other women she's a good girl. She tries to keep her friend out of the relationship because it's just too early in the movie. She starts talking to her boyfriend, who she knows is really good friends with and who she hasn't seen since she was in high school, and also tries to convince her boyfriend that he's not going to the park with her to play. She doesn't think that he is good friend, and then she leaves to go to the club with him, so he decides not to go.   It turns out that the boyfriend of the other girl who is also in the same position is still in the park and they see a guy there. It turns into an evening outing, and the guy turns around and shoots off his car.  He then decides to drive to an area that is in the middle of a major street and decides he'll take her to a secret place, where he knows they are going. He puts the same thing in the car, and turns it out. The woman is very unhappy when she comes back to the car. She refuses to go along with the men's plan and she tries to take the next step to end the relationship.  It's also very bad when she's with a bad guy. I couldn't tell if the guy had a job or a job, though.  All it comes down
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An idea with two leads who seemed to have made good movies together and this is a huge disappointment.   The film is a complete mishap. The two leads act like people, with no idea how to behave. The one lead is completely oblivious of how to act. I don't know why they decided to change the script. I'm not sure what was the first draft or the last one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a feeling that there's been a bunch of newbie films, with the name of this one. I feel that the '90's' movies didn't get any traction. But what do I know about the '10's' and '11's'? I'm thinking this film was pretty crappy, but it seems like one of those '10' films that has some sort of appeal - perhaps one of the most stupid, but that's not quite clear.  But don't take my opinion of this film lightly. I think it would be considered a real '70's film, and I'm going to guess that the majority of you are probably less than 30% of who actually liked it, but, as one who is going for the '60's remake, you are all over for the 60's. That's not cool.  There is an enormous risk that this film will not succeed as a horror film, but there is an even worse risk that it will succeed as some kind of revenge film. The ending is a little too light.  The acting is pretty bad - a lot of old-fashioned horror-film stereotypes that we've seen before. They just weren't up to snuff - it's no shock it's been this bad. There were just a few people that appeared, and it had an awful ending - a '10 film that's just about as stupid as the 10's '10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad that it's laughable. The acting is bad. There are just too many actors to see here. There is no chemistry to the plot. There isn't a connection between the actors. They just sit in a room, with no action, with the other people around them. And there is no tension to the story. This is not a great movie. If you're looking for something to watch, watch something else. Don't see this.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'm reading this movie for the fifth time I have to say it again I'm appalled by it. I was already embarrassed, in the first time, when I saw it on the Internet, and this is one of the worst films I've seen in my life. You probably should've had a little better movie. But that's not all the reason. It's just that they couldn't manage the scenes properly.  My hope is that you have better movies out.  The plot isn't even funny, I'll admit, and it's a bunch of silly jokes thrown together like they were going to make a movie about a movie, but in addition to that it's really weak. And the sound is awful, as a point I'm sure I'm going to get used to, but the acting is pretty decent, just not good enough to be believable. And what's a huge problem if you don't like the movie? This is a bad, bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think my girlfriend and I just laughed. But that's the only thing that could be said. I have to say that this movie was absolutely horrible.  All the plot was a joke. You don't know what a plot would be. The whole scene could not have been filmed by anyone other than the people that would have done it. I am sorry for all my time to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like it at all, but I did get to see it in the special edition of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The film really isn't worth watching, but it's probably better than the other versions of the movie, and some of the other films that made up their "theme". However, I could still find little sympathy in the plot and story of the film.  As for me, I found myself just reading the dialog to go on and watch, because this film had some of my favorite actors, like Peter Dinkler and Ron O'Brien. I didn't know who those two would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good cast, but this movie fails in most of the ways. The acting is bad, but the cinematography is good. Just the fact that this is one of a bunch of low-budget films that includes this movie was a really disappointing thing. The special effects are also bad. It could have been better. Also the fact the entire plot was completely incoherent and made no sense at all. If you like the original "Corsi's Revenge" you would be happier with the newer version. I think the director should be fired because this is the second movie that was made within this decade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what's in this film. And if I were to guess, I would like to see a film with a female lead that can't contain that much sex, violence and nudity. I like to take sex and violence out of movies and I don;t care what they do.  The point was that the movie had absolutely no concept of what it was supposed to be. The plot seemed to have no connection with what was supposed, and the acting wasn't good.  I've seen movies before, and they are usually pretty good, but this movie is just awful. The dialog is completely pointless, and there were some serious problems with the story line. The violence is never shown on a scale that would be considered serious, and for anyone who cares about this film, don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie ever filmed in my memory. It was so bad, and I was scared to be crying. I can't say how bad this movie is, but the way the director went about making it really is scary. The entire movie is just a bunch of bad jokes, horrible jokes, and a few other things. I hope that whoever wrote this script will eventually get bored and stop doing this. It should only be made for the Halloween scene, but if it was made for Halloween, it should be made of a film that is a low effort and not a comedy at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie more than once and I never even remember it. What I've got to say is that it's really about a really dumb, uninspiring movie which really hasn't much to go with it, except for sex. If you want to see sex, you have to do without the acting, but don't see it. I just can't recommend this movie if you see it on the cable channel. I'd just like to see something that has some real sex going on, and if this movie is out of the realm of being an action thriller, it's not worth to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big movie buff, but I have seen this one several times. The movie is not very good, but the movie is good in many parts. The characters were very annoying to me. The dialog wasn't very interesting, and I thought that they were doing the right thing by getting all the girls. The acting wasn't that good, not that exciting either.  Some of the characters were interesting, the girl and the boy who played her, and the guy that played the boy. I've read several other comments about the movie which make me think that I agree with them. That's not a good movie, it fails for me to be interesting or original in any way. I think it's just plain bad.  I don't know if there is a better version of the movie, but you can imagine how much better a movie would be if I'm bored.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film as a kid, and I still think it's a bad film. I mean I was expecting it to be a little funny and pretty cool, and even though I didn't understand what the movie was about, it still doesn't have the charisma I was hoping it would have. I think it could have been really funny, but I don't want to watch it and laugh when I watched it. The director tried to be funny in this movie, but it isn't funny. I don was surprised that a movie about this kind of kid would make money. I'm embarrassed to admit this, but don't blame the movie's director for making money, it is just that sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to guess the author isn't really interested in what I said here, and they probably wouldn't care if I would admit it, because there are so many people out there who have to hear about it.  And I mean the guy who runs this movie, "the director", is an idiot.  There are two or more problems with this movie; 1. It's not really a "drama", it's really a little bit of a "fun" movie; 2. The movie is so stupid it breaks the series, and it doesn't make sense as a film. 3. The ending sucks and is completely incoherent, and there are no ending. It is really a weak film, in my opinion.  The only thing that matters, and I'll give you, is that the author has a really great sense of humor, and that he has a great interest in acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been really excited to watch this movie for it's first release. When it came out, I was a little skeptical and wondered what the hell would be the plot? And of course, I did so. I think it was an odd mix of a series of a movie about one family. There was no plot. A family of teenagers is sitting around playing a local radio station when the family is invaded by the military. What a lot of money, what a lot for the family members! And so, with such a simple plot and no plot, I really didn't think it could be so bad. Of course, it wasn't. The family members don't even understand how their enemies are warring, they just act in the normal way when they meet a new family member. Of that, the family never really had anything to do, but the children in the family were clearly doing the same thing. I guess it's just a little too complicated for such a family to watch.  It's a really bad movie. They could have done better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in one of my video stores in one attempt to get it for free. I was expecting the film to have good music and acting to have some great comedy. Instead, it was very disappointing and disappointing. I'm not sure whether it was intended to be a comedy or not, but in the end it wasn't funny at all.  I don't know why people thought this was a comedy. It just seems to be just an example of the poor movie industry's tendency to put money in the film industry's pockets. It may be better in general, but the overall film is not good at all! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A series of intersparous people, each with a "honey" girlfriend, gets ready for a new life, which is to be, the only time I'm aware of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a complete waste of time. This is an attempt to bring back the original plot. In the original script the main character would be at his withered feet. This film simply tries to go from there. I had to laugh at this film because the story is so predictable, the way they used to try and get the movie to go. They didn't really want to make a sequel but just wanted to run this through a short and there's too many false endings for it to be a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so badly acted that I almost laughed at it. The acting was so poor that I laughed when they said something was happening, and even after I had watched it one time, I was still laughing. It was absolutely terrible. The story was so bad that it looked like it might even be a documentary or a documentary, and the acting was just so bad as it was so poorly acted. The film really was a long slow bore - and I had to look it all over again just to see if I could see it. It had the worst acting I've seen in the last 30 years, and it made me sick, so I was glad it was only for a short time. I hope it's dead.   I don't know why people thought it was OK, it was just a sad story about an evil family. I don''t think they'll make much money off of it. I'd have to sit around and think about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised that I could not find anyone who liked this movie, and I couldn't find it on YouTube, except for the one I had in my own collection. I had to watch this movie and that's a shame since it's so bad.  I'm guessing that it was not made by a major Hollywood studio. The only reason I thought it made it was because it was one of the worst movies of all time. This is a piece of crap, a horror, a plot-less piece of garbage. It isn't even a horror. I mean, the point of the movie was to be scary but it could be so boring and predictable. It is a horror movie, with a weak direction and a slow, boring plot. Its not even funny to watch it and it takes over 20 minutes to go through the plot.  The end is annoying and it doesn't really have any kind of ending. There is only one scene which is the best part of the whole film. I have to believe that it could have been done by a high-budget Hollywood studio or one of Hollywood's directors who got bored of making horror movies.  What is even worse than it is an extremely bad movie is that it's just a very bad film. It's so boring, it's not even good to rent. I recommend one of my own movies, just like the film of "Dumbo", "Die Hard 2".  I can't really see anyone else do this bad movie, they're just the movies that make the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a first time movie fan I decided to watch this movie. What a fun movie was I watched the first 20 minutes. Then I noticed that I really did not like the movie. It had a lot of the same stuff that I normally watch. They were all the same stupid things except in this movie they didn't seem to be people. They had an almost stereotypical person like me who didn't like a lot about the people. It was really disappointing. There were not enough good stories to tell about a couple of bad movies. I tried to watch more and it would take only so long to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry for anyone who thinks this is one of the best things ever made. It's got everything wrong, everything, and everything is off-the-course. The girls are a bunch of wad-dudges. There are two main characters and they get all the leads and the characters get all their lines and stuff, and all of the scenes are so bad that they don't even make any sense.  The only reason I've gotten tired of this film is because it's so hard to watch. It is very disappointing that this is so bad, and I hope to see more of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was a bit disappointing, I would even compare it with a bad piece of art, or even an old film: "Unreal Life". It was bad because it had a lot of bad camera work, bad acting, bad writing, bad humor, bad direction, bad editing, etc. It was terrible for me to watch this film, but it isn't a terrible choice to rent. The worst film I have ever seen. I have seen some good ones, but "UnReal Life" is absolutely awful. It seems like it was only to be of interest to the general public. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want a good action movie about a good story, stay away from this one. I was interested in the premise. There is no story and the plot is pretty good. But the movie is too short. So I felt the plot was too short and I didn't know how the story would end. I saw this movie as a kind of sequel of "House of Belmon" from the other world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in LA for an old film festival and I made a copy of it and it was very boring. I can't recommend this film - I found it very dull to watch, especially considering the lack of a good storyline and story. I had liked the old Hollywood classic "The Legend of Zelda" but this film did not even come close to that. It wasn't funny at all. My friend was annoyed at the ending.  A decent story - a very sad ending and stupid dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would never have thought this could have been that bad - it was quite funny. The movie had some of the greatest acting. The dialog was terrible, the story was terrible - it's really unbelievable that it's one of the most mediocre films of all time (I usually like this one).  I'm sure you've all heard the words "the movie" has bad acting, that's the whole story. "the plot" has a bunch of stupid things that are a complete waste of the movie - not only the plot but also the ending.  I wouldn't even be able to watch the final scene, if I didn't know that the movie was terrible.  The movie itself is pretty bad. I wouldn've rated it lower than 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a movie, but it is a really bad movie with poor special effects, poor special locations, very bad acting, very poor story development, very disappointing soundtrack, and a truly pointless ending. The movie is pretty much like "The Matrix" but with the addition of a little girl with a cute voice to help fill out the movie, and some cute girls with cute voices. There is nothing about these girls, but there are a few cute moments. I understand that this movie might appeal to some younger movie fans. It has a plot twist that the movie doesn't work very well. The ending seems to be a one-joke ending that has absolutely nothing to do with the characters. Also, the ending was very annoying because it takes place in the middle of a car ride. It was like a kid screaming and waving a dangly hammer at another kid who is in front of the car. This movie isn't worth your time or money but it can be a good movie if you are looking for something in that genre. If you are in a mood to cry over a movie and don't care what it really is or if it has a story, don't even buy this movie. Don't rent it. I know I know what it is but I think it is really a bad film. There's a little clip that you can watch online, but if you're a fan of horror movies, donot watch it. It is just not a good film and the best part is that you just want to see a little bit of a horror movie to finish off your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a rating about 2 because I was already bored with it. But it was so bad I actually laughed at it. I was never bored with this movie, I never liked it or even thought it could be funny. The story is weak, the acting is poor, the plot is predictable, and the ending was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film's one redeeming element was that there were three different endings. All of them seemed to be true - the first ending seemed to have had some element of magic, and it wasn't just a plot device to get out the money. However, the first endings seemed to take care of everything else and we were in the middle of the movie. The second ending did allow us to get a glimpse of the magical, and so were we willing to suspend our disbelief and even spend money. Of course, that didn't last long, and by the third ending, the magic was real. The third ending was so convoluted and confusing as it never actually contained all of the previous endings. The characters were stupid. The story seemed to fall apart halfway through and failed to make any sense whatsoever.  I recommend watching this in a darkened room or at a movie club to avoid the inevitable end. If you're not into fantasy or horror, watch it with the kid, and do NOT rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, i find the cast i believe is bad, the movie really has a negative impact on the acting i feel like it's hard to watch in this dumbo over-in-design affair.  The acting in the movie is not good, or it at least there's a few better ones. I feel the most egregious is the portrayal of the girl who's a beautiful writer, but she really isn't even acting and she plays the opposite role and doesn't care about any of the characters that she plays. I guess it's a big pity.  There's no plot. The film was very boring, and the ending is quite awful. The ending is basically a slap in the face. i would watch it if i liked it though. I'll only give it an 8 out of 10 and don't think about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with no hopes of seeing the film. The plot, the cast, the acting, and even the ending were terrible and the plot seemed unbelievable. This is a "Demented Story", the plot has been ripped out of the book. This movie is nothing compared to a good flick. I feel that this movie would be just a little bit boring. This was one of the only bad movies ever made, but it was still really bad. I never thought that it was that bad. It was so bad that I was ashamed to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't care about people who complain that this movie is bad, the people who point out the fact that the story is bad are a bunch of crap. But, like it or hate it, they really do have some insight. You would think that they had some insight or that they knew what a good movie would be, but unfortunately, they do.  If you are interested in a movie that is not so terrible, maybe the plot is reasonable. But for me, it is so bad that it completely ruins the movie and I'm not even willing to say that it is too interesting to even mention it. There are no story line whatsoever. It is simply one of the worst horror movies I have seen. It was not a fun movie, but it wasn't so bad I wasn't able to finish it.  Also, it was just terrible when you made it, as I said, "for my" age group. That doesn't count for any adult who hasn't watched the series before.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst I have ever seen.  The movie starts with a pretty low budget, but that was only for one movie. Once the cameras start rolling it slowly gets worse. Once they are rolling, it becomes a really bad movie. It's a really slow and boring story with very little suspense. The actors were good, but the directing was so bad it could get away from you. It should've been a really serious film - but, sadly, it's not.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can i say?  A film which was only meant to be funny, but it really wasn't. This is an embarrassment for many people to see this film. A film that was only designed to appeal to a group of men, who would like to think themselves to be so funny. Unfortunately it hasn't been released, and it never is going to be released. I'm sick of this film, and don't know whether it'll make any money, but I'd like to know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was quite disinterested about this movie. I don't care what the characters are or the plot, but I do care if they are supposed to be in the real world. They are so terrible that it's not even funny. I found it fascinating though that the whole cast was acting on their own, and there was absolutely no clue how to make the characters a positive person. I think that's a shame. I also find that they made a great effort to make a funny movie, but when they started making it, it was really awful.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've had this movie so bad that I was prepared to watch the sequel, and I did.  If this movie was meant to be "dark", that would have been a good way to avoid watching the movie. But this movie is just awful. The acting was bad, and the plot was not original enough to appeal to anyone who wasn't scared off from the first movie.   Still, I wish the writer/director/producers have put in some work to have something to show people. If you want a horror-movie with a very low budget and no story/plot, don't watch this movie. It's not worth watching if you want to see a horror movie. There's a lot more to the picture than it needs, and there's nothing interesting to do in this movie besides it's story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts off like it's all good, but the pace drops a bit later in the first hour. And that's when the movie starts out in a way that is not a horror movie.  There are a lot of scenes that just don't work, and they're very unfashionful. It does not make any sense. And there's absolutely nothing that can be said that is suspenseful.  And the last of the three stars that are featured in the movie is pretty annoying. They're just two guys.  It's like an episode of a soap opera show or some horror flick. It's got all the right ingredients, but it's just a bad excuse to watch a horror flick that is bad in most respects.  The good thing about it is it doesn't really matter that it is about a horror show. It doesn't matter that the movie has a plot. It just doesn't make any good points.  But it is still a bad thing about the movie. If I didn't know that it was a horror film, I wouldn't have any interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is it was never given any credit. I find it hard to see why anyone thinks this movie was a masterpiece or worthy of a high praise.  It has a very short running time and a boring plot. It also has no decent dialog. It has no plot plot. And there are too many characters who are not believable and most of them are not even likable enough. It is also an extremely boring and very shallow movie and not really scary. I recommend one to avoid this movie. The only thing I can recommend to those who want to watch something that is not a "drama", is to watch the movie with its own plot and dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's sad to see a movie so bad it is. They've put a man in a giant tank that has a little robot fighting. I have a feeling that it was designed to be that way. But as a result the whole movie fails to live up to expectations. The robots have to fight with another robot, the human being is just watching them on. I don't know if this movie has any chance of success. I'm not saying that it has any capability, but it is sad to watch it when it attempts to be funny, but for whatever reason it fails to make any real effort.  It has no chance of making funny for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of the players do not seem to really want to be good, it takes them a long time to get to a place where they can become a good player. One of them plays a bad game of one hand with a bad opponent. The other team also plays a worse game, a bad hand is a bad poker card.  The players should get to their place in the reality of "playing bad poker" and come out of it and realize that you should be good. Then we should get some better players. Some of them in the current league are really good poker players.  This movie just needs to be put away by some talented person who can do what is necessary. It's also disappointing when it's at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an utter waste of time, in my opinion.  The story is bad, the characters are boring and not even interesting, the acting is bad and the music is bad.  In my opinion the film starts out looking nice but by the end its overblown and it has just begun to suck my life away. There is nothing that makes the film work, nothing that keeps it going.  If you are looking for a good movie then get something that has a decent storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible film. In fact I could imagine it getting worse as it gets worse and this film keeps getting worse. There is no plot, no direction, no story, and no action. In the end this movie fails for two reasons. One reason is that there is no ending, and that it's a weak film to say that this movie should have been better than the other films.  The second reason is because this movie is so awful, it's not even funny, it really hurts my brain. I found it hilarious to watch this film and to listen to the other movies. I'm also getting sick from the smell of the movie.  It's bad for the people who bought it, the people that have it, and the people whose money are on it. It's awful because it's so bad, but it's funny, and there are some moments, such as the scene where we get into the elevator and the fight where they don't even fight, but this is only an indication of the overall film's bad condition.   The only redeeming thing about this movie was that it was the best horror movie of the 1980's, and it never really had the power to scare you. It was the same way with most horror movies of today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some of this movie in the past. This one is a little light-hearted in the beginning. But, the plot keeps you from feeling that you are watching a funny movie. And the ending is not quite funny. Not a good movie. It needs some sort of glue to stick on the movie and keep it together. You can't even find anything funny in it. There is no humor. Nothing to suggest that this movie was funny at all. The dialogue is bad, and the acting is bad. I cannot recommend this movie because of the fact that it was about a small movie with a really short story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was unbelievably stupid. Its just a silly idea that says something about a guy who becomes a little bit of a dervant. No more silly ideas. They say that he dresses his lady's son in black leather pants and a black leather mask to hide his face and, like a child, wears the same suit with no hair. The most ridiculous thing in this movie is that the guy who wears the mask on his face is actually the one who dresses his father in a suit and wears a black hat. And don't you know the name of the man in the mask. There's not even a twist to this!  The first scene is about him giving a bunch of hogs a couple of drinks. He was in one of these scenes in some of the movies of his career, but in the film, he never drinks and talks with his dad. The movie starts with a car crashing into the road, and the girl's father is terrified about the car crashing in his front seat. He gets out of the car, throws his wife's underwear at the lady's feet, and she's in the kitchen crying about how it's been run off by a car and that it must have been him that drove the car. The girls get caught in a bathtub on a highway, and one of them, a girl who is crying in the next scene, is about to run around the bathtub and kill the woman in the shower. The girl is in the bath tub, but she doesn't get a chance to run away. She's like a little pig who is so desperate to get into a bath tub and run around like a pig who wants to get in the bathroom and throw the bathwater over some of them.  There is no character development whatsoever in the movie. In fact, it's just about a three or four hundred minutes long.  It's too bad to be made fun of, and it's way too dull to be even remotely interesting. There are no jokes. It just takes the idea of being a "dervant" to an absurd level. It's just kind of dull and not funny to be taken seriously. There aren't even any plot lines here. This movie is just an excuse to make people feel like they're acting. But not to me, that's not true, in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i find myself to be more of a big American, and that people with the white label would enjoy a little taste of the history of America. So far, this is one of my worst films i've ever seen. It's far too cliché to be funny, it's far way too long, and it's not nearly funny to even the second-rate films I've seen. I'm not saying I'm a comedian, or I'm going to be the world's most funny person, or that I'm trying to be a comedian. What I'm saying is that it's a very bad movie to see, and I don't even think that most people in this film can understand the funny or meaning of it, and those that do understand this are going to think they're funny. This movie is a complete disaster, and a complete embarrassment. I've been coming to shows for years, and have never seen this movie, but for the record, I didn't even see the first of the other shows I've made. The whole thing was an embarrassment, and now I want to see it again. But it's too bad to be ironic. The fact that it has a long description and the entire movie is only one paragraph long and could be easily understood by anybody who doesn't understand it. I found it interesting enough to just to see something that was interesting. There is so little humor in it and there is such a weak script and poor animation. It really could not get much of anything to say about this movie. I don\'t know what else it could be. The only thing I can get is that the director is an interesting person, and there are no good words about this. It should be a comedy, not a comedy. I hope that the person who made this film is either an actor or writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't care if the writers have worked on this film, the acting has terrible, and the plot is absolutely predictable. I couldn't stop watching it for two or three episodes. That's what comes of, when you pay attention to this piece of trash, or even if you just read the plot, it can become really stupid and disturbing. This film isn't funny, it's sad, it doesn't have any sense of what it really is about, and I hope it never gets filmed again. Don't bother thinking about any of it, just look at the pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you see this movie, you are going to know exactly what you can expect. I hope that you have the patience to endure one more viewing. As I said, the movie takes a huge amount of time to develop. The whole plot is a complete pile of garbage. This is bad for the viewer. The dialog is awful, the camera and effects are bad, the acting is not funny, the dialogue is annoying, the direction is bad, and the soundtrack is absolutely awful.  This movie is nothing but a cheap piece of trash. What has the filmmakers been doing with this film? How did they choose the ending? How was the director? This is the worst movie I have seen since my childhood.  There is a good thing about watching movies: you can watch them with no expectations or expectations. You just have to expect that the movie is interesting, but there is nothing to be done. I really cannot expect anything from this film. I am a big fan of the films "Carmontes," "Ivan" (with its original title, "Wizard of Darkness"), and "The Lord of Death." This movie lacks the same kind of entertainment that these two movies provide. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really was expecting something great, this wasn't!  I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. Unfortunately I didn't like it, it was just a bit boring!  But if you enjoy it, then you will like this movie!  Don't buy this movie if you want something good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even start out the movie. I was watching the show with my kids and there was a guy standing behind the TV. He got so drunk and he was just holding the remote down while holding the mirror and talking. "I have nothing left to get home...I have to leave it here." Then he put on a bad line about his new wife and he just laughed. It was so bad. I'm not gonna cry...but...what happened to be so funny? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this one, i'm going to judge the film to be an amateur film and nothing is for certain. There is an awful storyline with a plot line, the ending and the ending. I'm not sure if it is possible to watch the end, since the way it was made up didn't match the script. A bit of extra work was added in this one but not a major one. A complete lack of action for the whole duration of the movie. A bad ending, the worst ending i've seen in a film since.  There were better films: "Death Mask" and "The Black Eye".  There is one good bit in the movie, but in the end the ending is predictable and there is not much room for suspense. I don't know how I'll watch this movie in the next weeks and decide whether it will be my favorite film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are interesting, the characters are good, but the whole plot is lacking. I didn't like the end credits of this film because it seems that it's not a lot of film to make. The ending is too long and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst I've seen so far. I'm glad I only watched some of it. Unfortunately it wasn't entirely awful. It did have some good moments but it was too slow, and there were a couple of moments I couldn't follow for obvious reasons. There were parts that seemed to show a bit of emotion but those parts were so short that it was obvious that the actor just didn't know how to do them. The scene where the little boy's father was eating some candy and the little girl was talking to him didn't go anywhere. I never saw the lady at all. A few of the bits were amusing, but that's mostly all I got. I didn't like the guy. I did feel sorry for the guy too, considering his good-looking family. But I have to give this movie an 'F' for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of money and time, as well as a big disappointment. The acting was awful, but the plot was alright. I've seen many other movies that are interesting and enjoyable. I have to say this movie sucked the life out of me. The story is so bad that it is unbelievable that it was supposed to be a comedy. The cinematography was bad, especially the camera was bad. I cannot say I liked the movie, I did not even liked the cast, but I did enjoy my time in the first movie. The ending is just a complete mess. I am trying to write this review about the movie: The story was bad and the acting was terrible, but if the story was good I would expect this film to be good. The actors did well, even the acting should improve. The plot was bad but I liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked that line in the film, but it was a complete waste of time. The acting is the worst in this movie, the dialogue is awful and I never found any real sense to the movie. Also the special effects are not convincing and the camera is very bad. But hey, it's a horror movie, so you can't complain about that. I don't know what went on with the special FX, I'd like to have those on again, the special effect when you see that a character is frozen and they're thrown off is so bad - I'd hate it if you used it in a horror film. The special effect is probably the best in the entire movie. That's about all I can say.  I hope they made a sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off I really liked this movie, the idea behind this movie is interesting, but what a disappointment. That is just one of many bad things I can say about this movie. I don't like the plot at all, the movie is bad and bad for the two main characters and the other story is pretty lame and stupid. There's nothing in it to do in real life like a lot of crap.  There should have been some better idea if there were only 2 guys playing in this movie because you could only have one. If there was just one guy you might expect the movie to be funny. I guess it wasn't to be, but to be honest I don 't believe. I just think they were acting with the other guys acting.  The other guy was an acting teacher. That was about the only good thing about this film. There was no funny or funny scenes in this whole film. The best part about this was in the movie where there were an angry looking guy who is very angry and very dumb. He kept shouting and yelling about how stupid he was, and how it was impossible to live. The other character played the role of a very stupid and mean person. That's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What could be the worst movie ever made ever, ever. It has to be the lowest rated film ever made in this country. The actors are bad, the direction is terrible, and the story is stupid. I find this movie a bit laughable. I think the director was drunk during some of the last weeks of filming so we can never really expect that this movie will ever get published. I really don't know whether I'd ever watch this movie, but I'm glad that the writers are making it. This movie has a terrible rating, so don't waste your time wasting time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really angry after seeing this one. It really doesn't matter if the kids' reaction to this movie is like a little boy who really thinks he can drive a car...it doesn't. They just look really stupid, with their big mouth of a mouth. The ending is so sad and hard to read.  The funny part is when they say they don't need to sleep and they're starving...so you're wondering why they're taking this so long. Also, the kids are all too weak to be able to fly. Also the only kid in this movie who really speaks properly is their father who comes in as the only person in their family...so your guess is, you'd have to kill your dad. The funny thing about this movie was that you didn't even know your dad was gay, when they finally found out. The actor in the movie is not even the same actor who plays the father, but one of his friends. And he's got a good job for it.  There is no way to relate to this film...it's just not funny, and it really sucks. The way it is done just doesn't even make it seem like it was. I can't recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't laugh....it doesn"t matter how you act, just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm very sick of this movie. I don't think it's good for the family to watch. A lot of people have asked me how I was able to watch this movie so quickly. The acting was terrible and some of the stories were confusing. The plot was also horrible. I feel like this movie had been released without giving it any chance to survive. I recommend not watching this movie unless you like movies that actually matter. I have the feeling that it's not like a great movie in the first place. I would recommend skipping it if you have nothing else to do with it. It was pretty stupid to get this movie, which was just the beginning of this series. A few of the people in the series did good, but some of them did not. I really liked all of the movies in this series, but I donno way I'll ever enjoy this movie because I felt that it was so bad. I've never seen anything that made me really laugh. But it was fun for me to see, and I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that a lot of my friends have seen this movie on Youtube in recent years should have been obvious. The reason I've seen this on the video channel is because I've never actually seen it. I can't get much of it in the normal way, even after watching it a dozen times and trying to understand the basic concept. Even after reading what the movie says and the dialog, the plot is nothing special. It's just a generic fantasy movie with a bad story and a bad cast. There are a couple decent moments in the film, but most of it is overblown. The final shot is just a stock photo of the town where the movie was set up, with only a hint that it has been used in the future. I don't care whether you see the movie as a good movie or a bad one. You simply have to ask yourself whether you like it or dislike it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I got from this movie is the fact that this film is about the death of a dead child in the book which I was reading on the website. So if I could give an opinion about this movie then I would like a good review. First off this movie was bad on every aspect of the book. First of all the death and subsequent book covers had not been done right. I'm a big fan of the books and I wanted to read one of the two books that were supposed to be written after the death. But I was only expecting the book to have one half of the story. In other words, they left out a whole chapter. Second of all there was the story and the plot. I've never read a story that was that bad in book before. I never read books so bad, I think, but what was the point of this movie? First of the fact the book is supposed to have a chapter that will take place in this movie, where there is a child that has been dead for 10 years. The movie fails to follow this and it was clearly made to be a horror movie.  It was just a bad, bad movie that made me sick. The book was okay, but I didn't like it as much as this movie. This is just a terrible film that would never get the attention of people. Don't take my word for what I think about this book. It was done to a kid.  The movie is so bad that I was hoping it wasn't so bad. The plot was pretty good. The death scene was interesting, but a lack of time to the death scene made the scene so weak.  As for the good part of the movie: the acting was good and the scenery was good. I'd love to see the movie. The only problem I had was that there was no time to see this book in this film. It had been done several times already. When I saw the book cover when I found out on the book, I thought it was going to be just another page of the chapter. So my reaction was a disappointment. The story on the other hand also was OK, but the story on this book was so weak that it really left out important stuff in the novel.  I have the feeling of knowing this movie so bad I just couldn't buy it. The way I was reminded of this was when I saw it in the first time I purchased the book and I didn "buy" the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the heck was this. I've never been a big fan of it, but it had me wondering what would have happened. I mean it was really bad. It's absolutely no good. I can honestly tell the fans of this film that the whole thing wasn't interesting and it's really bad for the actors in the film. There were plenty of terrible jokes and lines that had the ability to make sense out of everything. The worst parts were just the acting, which was just plain awful. I just hope the writer had the right to do something decent. I think the acting was a bit better, but that wasn't a good thing for acting. I really think the producers should be fired off. The movie was really predictable and there were no funny jokes here, but overall it's just one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. I was surprised that the producers actually made it. I thought the film was going to be an honest documentary about a guy who gets a job and his life starts falling apart because of it. That's what the movie is really about, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a long and disappointing sequence. The plot is not really good, though the story is decent. The story is not interesting or even interesting, just mediocre. I've even found that the ending could have been so better. The film is very bad for two reasons, first is that it is a poor sequel to a good movie. 2nd reason is the lack of a good actor. 3rd reason is that this film is completely disappointing. The best way to describe this movie is: "Don't try to judge for the movie, just for the fact that the movie is not only a waste of time, but that there is absolutely no good way to judge this movie: no way to tell if the movie was good or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a disgrace, a disgrace to all lovers of classic movies. Some of the scenes that were presented were funny, and some were downright disturbing, but they are nothing like I have ever seen in my 70 years of film enjoyment. Some scenes seemed to contain an element of humour, but the whole thing felt like it was just an ugly pile of nonsense.  The best way to describe this film would be that it's a very cheap knock-off for a low budget movie. This film contains only 6 or 7 minutes of actual film.  If I could, I would give this film a 10, but it isn't worth 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't have a movie with all the plotlines and sex at the same time. Also, there are no ending scenes. It's like if you had no idea how to make this movie, but they just gave it out. And the movie is so bad that I don't even know how to use it. It was only a few minutes longer than I think this one could have. And I would suggest anyone to just watch this movie on YouTube or even just turn it off and delete it. A film about this is not only bad, but a bad way to kill off a big old bank robbery. It also has some of the best dialog. They had excellent dialog, but this movie fails to deliver. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a mess. I'd really like to see a new horror movie to try to out for younger audiences. And I guess there was a reason to put a new cast to play the same roles as the ones that were already there. But, I think that's fine. We get these movies and take them and try to work them into their own lives, and then they are used to their own ends.   I've never seen a movie like this before. I hope there will be one in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie an 8 rating because the story is so contrived and nonsensical. I guess it is based on a typical western, so not really interesting to western fans, but just a disappointment. I was a big fan of the first 3 movies but 4 was not a good film and 7 was better. I'm not sure if this movie was created to get audiences interested or if it was just a money-grab. This movie didn't do much for me, but my friends and I all know what it means to be a western film to be poorly filmed. I would never recommend this movie as a "fun-no" film but it is really just a way to give the Western audience something which they don't already have. This film is no longer in the same category as a real Western film because it's not really like a real western film and it's definitely not to the best kind of film. I give it one rating because it does provide some amusement. But not only amusement, the movie lacks interest. I don't really see much interest in this film because I know it is only 7 hours long, but it's interesting for me. I can't say anything good about this movie because it is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was in for an enjoyable film. I expected something to be more interesting than the usual kind of zombie movies, but alas it's the most disappointing ever. There are no action sequences, no plot, no tension, no drama, and no plot to be anything more than a plot to kill the zombies. The acting is also bad, and the special effects were extremely disappointing. As the end credits rolled, I was really puzzled by the premise, and what we've just seen here was just wasted money. What happened when this was all over? There is no way to save these zombies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was an attempt to take revenge on a former slave in the film. It was poorly produced and the acting was awful but there was something to be happy about it. The idea of the film was laughable, and there was an obvious lack of substance in the story and storyline. Unfortunately this is a movie with some decent acting and decent directing. Unfortunately the film did not have any plot and it did not do much to hold the movie together. It seemed like a child's play for a young audience, and unfortunately it wasn't. The storyline was a little too predictable for such a serious film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was supposed to be more of a movie than what I've seen in the past few months. It is a poorly written, predictable plot, and some of the acting is even not well executed at all. There's nothing interesting about this movie. I can say that the director should have taken the time to watch the first ten minutes of this film to get a grasp of how it's constructed and what the plot is. The plot is mostly predictable and boring, and the acting isn't even good at all (though the actor is actually very good), but the acting was good, if you didn't know the movie. There are several times in the movie where the actress's lines are completely over-the-front and over-prepared. I also think that the ending is a complete disaster. This is an obvious, lazy, and ultimately unappreciable film. In conclusion, I recommend skipping it, and watching something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is, to put some things in perspective, quite pathetic. It's not a movie. It should have been an interactive film and not been intended to be funny. It had so many obvious inconsistencies and terrible direction that I didn't want to look for the next movie it would be. It was bad on every level. Its story, if you want to listen to the movie, seemed very fake and the characters were all so far removed from reality that you never got a sense of them. The cinematography was also bad, it seemed like they weren't getting through their heads in order to have the scenes to be interesting. In short, the film is bad, but it's interesting to listen for the fact that it was really just a movie about a movie that people just didn't realize that was being done. I also note that I had seen the movie for so long, and that I did not like it. The acting was not good and, in the end, I found myself unable to find any redeeming attributes.   As an adult, I felt this movie very strange and could not figure out if the movie was funny or not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was thinking about this movie from the beginning to the end and had high hopes. Now I am wondering why it's not making it more interesting or more interesting. Its a very dull movie to watch and the acting is awful and the pace is very slow. This movie isn't the movie I imagined it to be. I would suggest skipping it if you really want to see a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just awful and bad. The story was pretty decent, and at least, the actors had some of their best acting performances. There were very few funny lines and the story wasn't even interesting. What really bothered me was the lack of chemistry. The characters were too silly and the plots were completely pointless and the whole movie had the same problems. There's a lot of pointless scenes. There are no ending. The only thing I liked was the film's ending which was a little bit of funny. I didn't even like the ending which made me laugh. I don't know why I didn nothing liking the final scene. Just think it's too bad. It's a shame, but if you like seeing cute kittens, then this is fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been thinking this movie was supposed to be really interesting but it really wasn't. I'm not a fan of the music or the acting. I think the film made it look as a comedy, but not a comedy. The direction was bad. I guess it's like "The Hangman" from 'Hangover'. I'm hoping I can get the film to get the number of laughs it deserves, but don't expect to get any.  Overall this film is terrible, not a good movie for a 3.6 time out. I don't know why the writer who wrote this movie did it or whether they just forgot about the music/drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate it because it really sucks! This movie is not really funny, I really feel like it is boring. I hope this movie will not be any less annoying than the other one. Don't watch it, you wont find anything funny at all, and don't want to watch this movie because it is really really bad. I would like to recommend a good movie: "The Great Train", of course the movie is very good and I wish the movie was more funny. "My Name Is Fred" is kinda bad, but I really liked the movie anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of this film is the plot. But it wasn't good, or great, even in the first 15 minutes. The story takes about 20 minutes to a complete story. The ending is completely predictable and boring.  This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I'm not sure if anyone on this site is aware of the true value of the story. I know it is worth a lot of money and it is, as it is now, too large and stupid to be truly scary. But this is one big mistake. I recommend you give this film a Z for a very low score. The only thing that is good is the trailer for this film. But the trailer is only a small part of the film. It doesn't help. I really feel sorry for the filmmakers of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's an old movie: the same guy goes on an adventure with another dude with a dog (I guess he was going to get in some trouble when he was in the water). But what happens when the other guy dies? Well, apparently the dead guy turns up again for another movie. Now I'm gonna say that the acting of the movie is OK. I've read a lot of people that have said that. People say that if you've seen it, then you should definitely be able to discern the truth of it. But this movie isn't worth that, because it relies on bad-ass, poorly acted, poorly written and, as a matter of fact, really bad acting. I don't think I've ever read a good movie to have, but I have watched a few. I mean I didn't have to watch this, so I didn' care. But that's not true, because my movie doesn't have a great story. I'd have to say that this is the worst movie I've seen since my brother's birthday.  There are no good acting or anything good about it, the script is terrible, the editing is terrible (they are both horrible), the plot is about as bad as you can expect from a movie.  But I think it's good if you can understand what it is doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so badly made. I was hoping it was a one of my worst horror films ever made. It wasn't. It was way worse than that. The story was so bad and the plot is so badly written. You don't really understand what the story is. The acting is poor and the direction is so poor. I think it was put together by a couple of people who worked with the director to make it. It's hard to watch, but if you're one that likes horror movies, don't go to this film. I didn't even think it would get an 'X' rating, but it is so bad! The acting, too, is bad, the story, not too good, and the acting is so corny! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't find the person who made this film to be very interesting. This film was just another typical piece of junk that you would expect to see in the end of the year. I don?t even know what the person behind this film is capable of. I would have said "the person" and not "the director".  I understand the idea of trying to recreate a world of modern civilization, but it was a very bad film. To me, this film was a complete waste of time and money. I really liked it because it looked so realistic, but you could just look at it as a very cheap movie to go to waste your time watching.  I really would have to avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you have all your life's events, you can make up a life. In this movie, not one good thing happens, and it turns into a mess. This movie starts off with an interesting premise of two guys who are in the house. The first one is James, a good guy, and the second guy is the drug addict. It has nothing to do with the other drug addict, who says that they both owe the guys who owned the house, and asks to go to the bank where the cops are.  The plot is so badly constructed and the characters are so bad, that most of them are annoying, but it's interesting to see that there's nothing else. The movie is bad enough, but then you feel it's so sad and lonely that you have to break up with the first guy. I have to give this movie two stars out. The acting has to be too low-budget to be effective. It wasn't a funny film, but you could have at least some funny scenes.   I can't recommend this movie any more than a low-grade comedy in a bad-movie school who made a movie with a bad premise and a story line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie with some of my family friends and loved it, but it was never fun after. Some of the movies that have been made like "The Thing" have been great, but the other movies that I have seen have been pretty awful, and they never got the fun out of it. I'm not a fan of the music or art or story behind this movie. I just gave it a bad name because it's not a good movie. The acting in the movie is bad and the story is bad.  What else is happening when your whole life is completely over, but something in movies can often become funny, even if you're stuck in a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are people that have seen this movie and were not quite as shocked. I am sorry to see my friends and my wife who thought that this film was a good film. It was nothing but a bunch of stupid jokes. It seems to me that it was about as good as an episode from "The X Factor". My father, after seeing this film, did not know how to go back into the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 2 movies, after their amazing debut, are now being trashed. This movie features a story involving a lot of pointless filler and bad characterizations (and, unfortunately, a very disappointing ending) and is filled with bad scenes. The third movie, on the other hand, is a sequel to the first two. It also features the plot about a murder that never happens, even though the characters in this film are the same guys who are in the first movie. They never even meet the killer's victims, and the plot revolves around a bunch of characters with no real life or depth.  The plot doesn't have a good plot and some of the film's moments are very poor, but there's also a lot more drama in this movie than you'd expect.  All in all, if you have to see this movie, skip it. There are only one or two funny moments. There's too many unnecessary characters, too many uninteresting scenes, too few jokes. It's pretty hard to watch, but it's just about as hard to enjoy. It could be a little longer and a little more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many places where there are no real references to the story line in the movie, and the movie starts off with a fake story about a boy and his uncle. I really wish this movie to be another story about how young boys get into sexual relationships and how they deal with their lives, but it is not. There is just not any relevance to the plot line.  The movie tries to be funny but fails. There really aren't laughs. The fact that the boys are so badly dressed is just plain stupid. It really shouldn't have a "chimps" theme, and I think they should have just thrown out the entire cast of actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a little dinked at the plot, but the movie is the worst. The acting is awful - the whole thing is just plain bad - but it's all pretty good at the end, so don't be sad. I'm not saying I like the movie because I do, but I did like the character. I can't say if I liked the character, but if you're really hoping for a good movie, don't go for a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a bad film, I mean it can be a terrible comedy, but this film fails to make a good sequel and simply falls to a middle of nowhere. I think this film must have been made in 1993. This film is very much lacking in acting and actually fails to have a plot. I mean this could have been put together with some good actors, but sadly it's just a bunch of old guys who could barely stand out of one table. They have no real talent and could not do much with a script. They are all very boring and there is not enough humor in the film. There is absolutely no redeeming feature to go in a sequel, the best is that all the old men here in this film were in other movies. It's just an absolute waste of money. If you have any interest in making a film about a film that has some comedic quality, even as a sequel to a comedy, the film is about as bad as The Grand Finale. If i had any interest at all, this movie would be a comedy but it's too long and pointless for that. I just can't think any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is absolutely awful and the acting is downright bad. It is truly unbelievable to watch a film that has so many people who have only been aware of this movie but hasn't heard the details.  This film is a disaster that has not only a horrible plot, but it also a poor direction to act and the story is not good. The film was supposed to be a funny film, but unfortunately it's not. The acting is terrible and the film is bad at almost every level. The editing is terrible, and there is even a "plot" in the middle of the film.  I gave this film an '2' because it is so bad that it needs to be taken away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so depressed. I'd like to get the movie: But not if they make it better. This movie is so bad that if you'd like it, you'll think the person in the movie will be too hot. That's not cool. I would like to see someone like this guy go out and chase this chick, and I know he'll be really, really, hot. But don't see this guy: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major problem is the script - the acting is bad. Very sad, but if you don't laugh then you are not a proper film-fan. It's not about comedy - it's about soap. That's really not my excuse. My biggest frustration was that the guy who played the guy on the show that was my favorite, actually ended up getting killed - I was really disappointed. I'm really embarrassed at how hard it was to watch this movie. Don't expect too much out of me if you are a die-hard film-donor-ner - it is not a comedy, it's not a musical, it has nothing to do with the characters. If you are in the mood to film a comedy or musical film, don't waste your time - this film isn't serious.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a movie that looks like it is about the movie, and the ending seems to make the movie more interesting. I didn't like the ending.  What makes this bad movie worse is that it's not a real movie, but it has a lot of similarities to the original. There are some jokes and some themes. The humor has been reduced to a few minutes. And the ending is just stupid. I think a movie made a lot more sense in the original when it was just a sitcom. The film is just bad.  If you like a comedy, try this one. Avoid it unless you actually enjoy a good movie: this is a bad, low-budget movie that isn't funny, but you'll find some comedy if you like it. I'd definitely avoid this movie if you were in a film club. I also recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how my friends find this movie, but I found it very disappointing. It just didn't seem like it could possibly be taken seriously, and I could not recall any other movies I've seen with the same or similar scenes. I think it was the most horrible film I've ever seen, but what it is does make me wonder why this is the only one I've remembered. I don`t like this movie because I didn`t want to spoil it for others. There is no suspense or suspense. The characters are totally one dimensional and the characters' dialog are the same boring as the rest of the movies. There's no connection to any character or plot. I really enjoyed this movie for it was a comedy that couldn't really stand on its own. It was just plain boring, and don't want it to be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is an obvious film in this year, it might be "Demented", but if not, it's certainly the worst film I've seen since it was released.  This film is about a couple of teenagers who decide to go on the road to find a new house for the homeless (and the homeless's house was just on the side of the road) and become victims of road rage when they decide to shoot a bunch of guys (or in a house with an open door and a few empty crates). They go to a house where a couple that used to go to the street once rented a room because they had a new home. But their new house has to be locked down when they leave to the house they rented for a few weeks. So when they find a place to rent it out, the two teenagers and their friends set up a garage to use for a little bit of storage space when they're all in the house. As they decide what is going to happen, they decide the location where their house will be. They do not know the house has a huge amount of wooden panels and there are few wooden pieces everywhere, but there is obviously a lot of wooden pieces in the wood floor of the home. This leads the teens to chase the teens. The way the girls decide to get out of the house is such a poor way to show off a film. One of the teens goes to a big room where the guys are and the two girls get a gun and go in there, and that's where they decide it would be. However, the guys don't know that there are two guys in the same house and the house owner is in one of them so they shoot them all. But that doesn't matter, and after the guys shoot them, the girls get to a car. But it turns out that the girl's mom isn't too happy about the house, and one of the guys is on a lot to go, so he has to go that way. The rest of the car is a big piece of plywood and a bunch and some sort of furniture, a stove and the door on a long wooden pole. The two guys decide to take a chance and chase after the girls as the car goes off the road, and when they are ready to drive, the scene gets a very long time. It takes them about 40 minutes before the girl gets to an answer, but it also contains a really awful fight sequence that I really didn't care for
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 5 years of the movie have been mediocre and the acting and story are the only thing worth talking about, though they were quite good. This movie has a VERY low quality for a film about a boy who lives in a strange world. What a waste of money! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really not sure how I missed this whole film. It's pretty bad. I don't know how anyone is getting through the last half hour before it's over and I'd be interested to see more of it. The funny part that I didn't like was when the film was about to begin and then I had forgotten the name of the film, only to find it again in the video store...oh, man...they don't give away this film to anyone for a long time, but I can tell you how it is. The acting is bad, the actors really don't care, the sound is terrible...and the overall atmosphere is bad. All in all, I think I'll buy it for nothing except to laugh at the stupid people who laughed when the video was over. They made us laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm not going to go on and praise this movie as it is...this movie is nothing to the liking. It starts out with an amusingly stupid line and you know that when it becomes interesting, it won't be. But, on the bright side, it wasn't funny at all, and it's got a really terrible premise to go with it. There are enough bad things about this movie to go in. I'm going to warn you to steer away from it at the least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot is absolutely pathetic and the whole cast is very annoying. I can see the same in any other movie, but not in this one! I can't really see anything of interest here. This movie does not make you feel like a movie-loving character (especially in a movie that is supposed to be a comedy), but it is made worse by the fact that some of the acting is so poor. Some of the dialog in the movie is very poor, especially the "Gentlemen of the Church" episode where the church leader is talking about how the church should act. I actually liked the idea of this movie, considering it was the best film ever made, but unfortunately, it didn't come alive.  Overall, I could give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a few good moments, but the ones that came in were so low-level. In fact, even if you have to spend a dollar to rent it, you don't really have to.  The plot is pretty stupid, and the acting is terrible.  But if you need a little time to sit and watch it, perhaps watching one of the films is a good way to catch up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this one, the plot was OK but not much. The only one I liked was the "Bitter Man". That line was nice but that line wasn't interesting and seemed to be a "Bitch" moment, with the guy being completely obsessed with him. The idea of Bitter was very funny but the whole film felt like a horror flick. I was sorry to see how the other "Bits" were going to work, the lines were just awful, I'd just skip it. I'll give it the first chance and see if it's even that interesting. It should just be an old cheese movie for people to watch and then walk away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a couple of interesting things to say about this movie. One is that its supposed to be a horror movie, and there is some of the gore scenes that don't take place in actual reality. But these people are probably not the best people to have around for "plot development". There are also a couple interesting things. The main actors of the movie don't make good. Not the two main characters that you remember like the original ones. I've read a lot of comments about the characters that the director tried to develop, and that the characters have the right to be good. However, the acting is not that good, and not the actors that I've heard are good.  I'm also of the opinion that this movie had no plot, and is not interesting either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is really not for the teens. the movie starts with a random scene that we all know the plot and it is all very predictable. so that's not a great way to get a fresh perspective into this movie. the plot is pretty predictable and all the characters are a waste of time. the only interesting thing in this movie was the end. the end is pretty boring. all in all, it's just the same as all other movies out there.  The movie is not for anyone who wants to be smarter than teenagers. if you want to be a genius, don't watch this movie and don't take this chance. if your eyes are already open the movie is only worth 7/10. but the movie doesn't have to be played out as it's obviously not a film! i would recommend avoiding this movie if you are not looking for an intelligent action film. don't even see it as a full-on action film, but don't look at it because it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was at least one good movie out of the whole. The story was good and the main storyline was good, but the storyline was very bad. The cinematography was not good either, not at all. The dialog was mostly good, although the acting was horrible. The plot was very poor and the characters were annoying to watch. The last time I saw this movie was about a year ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of a cliché plot and plot. The plot is pretty weak. The camera and editing is terrible, and the acting is awful. Don't watch this movie if you're trying to make this film as realistic as it could possibly be. Also, don't buy it if you feel like an urban mystery movie with bad jokes and bad acting. You'll probably find yourself too scared to do much of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film of the year, the acting is awful, and the plot is not convincing. The movie is filled with the worst acting scenes ever seen on TV, even though the characters are acting quite well. I really enjoy the classic film of "Carsol", but the ones they are watching here are not good for actors. I cannot even find the word "unreal" in this movie. If you have some time, don't take this movie off and rent it. You will not be entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had absolutely hoped to find this movie on DVD because I thought it would be good, but instead I find the movie on video that I purchased, and it looks so bad! I tried to make it watchable, but it didn't work.  I wasn't surprised when I finally checked out the DVD to see the pictures, and I still didn't expect to see a copy of this movie anywhere. This movie is a complete waste of time. The fact that it is about an animated film just adds to the bad factor, but even then I think it has to be at least a 2/10 for me to watch it. But don't tell me that I have liked Disney, because I have actually seen a live film about this movie, I mean the book! I don't like to see people thinking that there is some hidden secret plot with this movie! There is nothing special or interesting about it, and you don't realize how hard it really takes to get through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a disaster. The story is fairly predictable, if not for a good story. What happens with this film? Well, the story is not as good as the original. The characters are very poor. The direction of the film is bad. The special effects are bad.  I recommend taking this film out and burning it to the ground, as this is a complete waste of money, energy and energy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was a disaster for two reasons. The story was poor, and the actors were bad. i'm a movie fanatic, and i want to see something serious, but this was far below the standard of movies. the main theme of the movie is a man in a white suit with a white eye, so people can tell he is a Nazi. the only thing more than that was that people can see him. the guy in the suit was a Nazi, but he wasn't even a Nazi! what could this be, you know? he has a Nazi insignia, that can make him look like a Nazi leader of all the country's Jews, and then he becomes a Nazi dictator of the world. all the way through, he is very slow, and very rude. he is on top of the chain, so we can't call him a bad leader. what the hell is he doing??? I don't want to say he's a bad politician or a bad Nazi, if he's in reality then he has to be a Nazi to the extent. people who like him in real life are so sick, the least we can do is laugh. but at least that has a sense of humor! a bad, unfunny, and pointless movie. don't waste your time watching it and go off to some movie: it is only a joke. I just wish they made a sequel to the far worse movies in Bollywood. I can only hope for their best efforts to stop the spread of "Killer" propaganda through the internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on IMDb yesterday afternoon and had my roommate/friend watch it and I just shook my head in disbelief. It's so bad that it should have been an Oscar-level film. There were absolutely no comedy or comedy to the story. It just came off the airwaves, or was too hard to watch. There was a plot that had no humor or comedic elements to justify it.  It really sucks, but I guess there is one guy that might have put this off to the studio. This film is only about 25 minutes long and it is supposed to be an educational film about the lives of an average teenaged kid. What a shame. If they had known what they were doing it would never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because I was very scared of the fact that this movie was about a teen who has an incestuous relationship with a co-parent. As the movie progressed, it seemed that it was all about "a teen's life", not about how a teen girl has sexual relations with her dad. The ending could have been much better, but I just think it's hard to see the point of this movie. I just wish it could be more like the old "Ripdog" movies. It's not like the one who is in the real life world, where you have to pay attention to every little detail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this movie should have known better. He was one of the few directors who has been accused of making this movie. The movie doesn't have the plot or even have any decent plot. It's just a bunch of people that want to be rich. The characters are annoying but not very interesting, and the actors don't do anything special on their own.  The actors in this movie seem to be playing as one person. The actors are not acting in a believable manner and are acting as a bunch. What a lot of actors can't do in movies is that we want them to act with more realism than this is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard anything good about this movie - I only ever heard of it when it came out as a special preview on HBO. When this film came out, I was floored. The acting was bad - not at all good, not at least in the performances. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I wasn't happy when it was shown. There were two actors who I thought were good - David Ducho, and John Hildes - I don't think they are both actors. However, I do not think they need to be involved in the movie - they seem to be playing a lot of "self-help" types of characters. They seemed to be having trouble with the casting and would always just look at each other, making them seem unhappy, angry.  The first part I remember was when they filmed this movie. The first time they filmed it was because of a bad weather. They didn't shoot any of the main parts - they were afraid of rain. After the first part was filmed, they were forced to do something else. In the meantime, some of the actors did fine. When it was shot, one of the movie's producers said that the movie could be finished by December - it didn't get finished until two years later. By December, the movie started to make money, but I think the producers should have done more work. This movie is nothing more than an insult to the acting community. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's okay to say that this movie sucks, and if you do see it on Blu-ray it is stupid, but I think it would have been better if it just got one part done right. The actors, mostly the ones who played the character were decent, and they are OK for a couple of scenes. The other stuff was a bad version of a terrible movie: I hate that they made this thing, and I find myself laughing at the scene where the gangster is talking to his boss and saying about the kid. I didn't know what the gang is going to do to him, and in the end I'm sure they just kill him.  It doesn't help your sanity, and you can't figure out what it's saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie contains no funny jokes. It would have been hilarious if there were no jokes. The acting is laughable, with the exception of Jim Stark's character, who makes the movie fun. I was surprised that one of the actors, Paul Sorcetti (who appeared as a very serious young man in his film) and Julia D. She is actually a funny actor, but you can't be very funny in "My Big Home." He is the worst actor in the film. The soundtrack is terrible, too, with no funny songs, or special effects. You will feel the loss of your money, if you rent it.  The ending is completely unnecessary. The next time you buy this movie will be much more enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie and I'm surprised the director (who has the best, if you can) did such a poor job. I don't mean it's terrible, but there are many problems with this movie. First of all, the idea of having a female character (and not having her in a sex movie) in a film with "sex" is ridiculous. Even if you watch this movie, and find yourself in the middle, it feels weird to think it could even exist. The "procedural scene" is supposed to convey a message of female identity that is somehow totally meaningless to a male actor. And it's hard to get into the main story of this movie because the actors are so predictable. They look like they're going to be actors, and they look like their personalities don't really matter. The other problem with this film is the ending. After the movie is over, the characters are all gone, and the movie never repeats the same plot, and I was a little bit sad that it had finally come to a natural end. I hope it's never remembered. The acting in this movie was bad, but the movie was so bad that it's difficult to watch. I have nothing good about it, and even if I made the first time for the movie I wouldn't recommend it. I would also advise against spending money on this movie if you want to see it, though it isn't really a bad time-of-the-life type. It's about as funny as the end to the "Wings" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever made in the history of the genre. It's not good, not bad, not even OK, but not so bad that I am willing to waste my precious time watching it. But the bad thing about this movie was that it was badly made and bad that it sucked. I did really like the story and I thought the story was really good, but the acting was bad. I didn't even like the acting, but that's OK, I can't blame them for that, but what with the acting. The acting was so bad, so bad... and this movie has a few good ones, but they are too dull and not good.  If you are a fan of the original The Matrix (the original version) or some other sequel, I would recommend watching something that has no plot, no plot. I'm a fan, but I don't have that, because they are boring and they have nothing in it.  Don't waste your time watching this movie. Don't go watch this bad movie. Avoid it if you like Matrix or The Matrix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think there's a lot to be said about this movie.  It's just the sad fact that I believe this is the worst movie of all time. There's a reason why this is one of the worst movies ever made. It's really sad that it took such a long time to come out. There were some interesting and funny stories in this movie, and I'd like to see more. There was also an incredibly awful ending that was awful, and didn't actually have any sense to the point at all. It was extremely disappointing and sad. If you don't like the ending, don't watch it. If the ending didn't make sense to you, it didn't matter.  I'm sure there are some good parts, but if you want to watch it again, you'll have to look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I'm not a music nerd, so I don't have an interest for a music music video, but this movie didn't seem to take it seriously. It felt like a poorly directed movie with too many of the same scenes and not enough to go off the page.  There was an interesting and somewhat believable (in the way the "Rockettice" was) musical piece at the beginning, but the next action is the only music in the movie. Some of the songs were good, but not enough. The plot is predictable, and the ending is not very convincing, though the ending can be exciting.  All in all, it's a weak movie that has a lot of shallow and unnecessary shots at some of the best actors in the history, like Jack Bonner, Jay Corman and Robert Dean.   Also if you want to watch it, if you have any interest in acting, or like music, I would recommend looking for a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original movie was very interesting, and it's now defunct.  It's not funny enough to be funny, and I'm not the biggest fan of it, but there are some funny things about it. Unfortunately, it doesn't have enough material and it just isn't funny. I don't think it's even funny in any way, but it's not very funny. The only part that works is the song "I Don't Hear You" which was catchy, but really doesn't go anywhere.  So, if you liked it, why not watch it? I'd recommend watching it, in retrospect. It might make you think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm getting older, and that means I'm probably tired. I cannot enjoy this film. But this was definitely the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that there are two girls who were married at least three times did give me some sympathy. I also have very bad memories of a movie like this one. I don't know why people don't get this film or why it was so poorly made. There were so many errors in the film. If you find the movie online somewhere, get it and don't go see this film...unless you can laugh. But if you're a fan of one of these horror movies then you should spend $300 to rent the movie again. The best part of this film was when you could watch it on the big screen TV and laugh. Not even though it was a horrible movie, but the story had some funny moments and the characters didn't make it clear what their relationship was. I didn't think the girls made it clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this movie is a bad comedy - and this is what I expected from the premise.  It's not a comedy, it's a comedy with a heavy focus on sex and drugs, and no plot. I can't even understand how anyone would think this movie would be funny. There is no plot, the characters are just flat characters. But there is no decent comedy here.  The acting is pretty awful, and there's not enough comedy.  There should have been a decent comedy movie in the first place. And this movie isn't really a comedy either. It's just about a couple of high-priced, alcohol-enhanced teens who run off with some people and run off into some bad scenes. But, seriously, get a grip on these guys and understand how stupid they are and how stupid their behavior is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had absolutely zero plot. All it was was a plot that just wasn't good enough to be one of "Dirty Cops" movies. In short, it failed on every single one level. The movie had a decent plot, and a lot of things happened which seemed to fit the story at the time. However, when these scenes were presented, they were never presented for an audience. The plot was completely meaningless, and there was no reason to care about it. I believe that the main reason this movie was so bad is because I don't believe the people who created it cared about making it.  It seemed like the story was about an older man who is working on a farm, who is falling apart, and who gets involved with a prostitute who is in love with him. The problem with this plot was that the people on the farm just didn't care, but they didn't make the right choice and decided to leave him alone to go to California, and the fact that this man was in love doesn't matter either.  The film had poor acting, bad dialog, and no idea how to get the characters off their own for good performances. Also, there wasn't enough to make the scenes work, and some parts of the movie didn't even make the effort to work. It just felt like a story about a simple, boring sex life in a white house.  This made me worry for an old guy who is lost and desperate, and just want something to watch. He didn't want to sleep alone, and his life is a mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very annoyed with this movie and I will not comment anymore. But I did laugh at one of the dialogues. I can't believe the writers and director put so many nonsense dialogs that they have made a movie so lousy. I really wanted to like this movie because it was hilarious and I liked funny movies, but after a couple of hours, this movie could be easily summed up as a terrible one.  If you like a lot of old-fashioned 'war movies' (a very old school type movie for the ages) or if you like fantasy-stuff, then it might be a good movie but if you liked horror movies, it is bad.  I know I cannot be the only one who thinks that this movie was bad. But this movie had some good moments, it had some really good moments and it has some terrible moments. And it has its problems.  There were probably some good lines in the movie but it just gets boring, and it gets even worse when the end is nearing. But it wasn't a good film and it isn't even a good horror movie, only a poor movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never really understood what all the other people had in the beginning. There wasn't any proper explanation for the whole film. They said it was about a family in Texas who had an animal life and their son was killed by a pig (who then was decapitated by a deer). There was no indication how the animal life was different. There were three days with the animal, so I had to go through the entire movie to understand how each animal was different from each other.  There wasn`t any good story to start with. The film starts with the premise of a family with a kid, then the kid starts acting like a kid. There was nothing else for the rest of the film. The animal life is simply presented without anything substantial. The family lives are in a large building, and they spend their entire day eating their food while getting drunk. Nothing seems to have been done or have been a surprise to anyone. The lead animal is portrayed as an animal, but it didn't matter. The actors just pretend that there's a guy in the middle of the scene and pretend he's a person, then they have their own animal lives and pretend they're human.  This film doesn't even have any plot or suspense. There are no real action, and there are no dramatic endings. You can tell a story after they've finished eating the food and the animal's bodies are moving around.  It's just plain and ugly, with no real ending and no real suspense.  I'd like to think that the producers are OK with this kind of film, because they want their name to go by "Family Reunion." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry. I wasted about an hour of my time watching this movie. It is horrible...  It is so bad. It's a bad, slow, sleazy, sleazey, dour, sleazi-esque, slow-moving, slow paced, dumber movie that is about the worst film I have ever seen. It looks and sounds like an indie film put together from cheap materials. The cinematography, sound effects, and direction are OK... but it is so poorly developed that you wonder why they'd waste so much time on creating it, even if you had something good. It seems like a one-off movie for a very poor budget. And it turns out to be a full-on, unbalanced sequel to two of the first two films, so we're treated to the old characters.  I get the sense of irony that this is one of the very worst movies I have seen in a long time. I can't think of any positive adjectitions to describe it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An interesting film, I found this movie a bad. I really liked this movie to watch for the time. It wasn't too interesting and I wasn't able to stay long. I didn't really care for any of the things they were saying.  The ending is disappointing at the end. I give this movie 2 out 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a total disaster. The main thing that keeps me from giving it the lowest rating is the fact that there were no people who would notice the fact of existence. If you don't do that, you'll just make the movie less entertaining. The only positive point I can find is the acting. I don't know the actor who played the role, but he probably was good. If I was one of those who liked this movie, I'd give it a "F" rating. The movie is really boring, and I'd recommend the movie as a caution for the age group who are willing to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, in the first film of this sequel to the original, I really thought it was a remake. It was so disappointing! It just couldn't stand on its own, and looked so unstructured in its first few minutes that I was just waiting for some sort of bizarrely funny little interludes. A small, almost un-inspired and unimpressed film, which I would not recommend as a viewing experience. I'm still waiting for a better movie to emerge. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure I am a true skeptic, but this is not to be a comedy, as it's the typical "disco" movies. The script is bad, the acting is poor, the cinematography is bad and the story is bad. What is this?  The movie has to have been made in a high school cafeteria, where an acting class is run in a low-school cafeteria to watch "A Song to Sleep" on TV every day. It's a real pity! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I'd seen this movie, I thought it was only a one hour movie and it really sucked! It sucked! I had watched this movie for the first time and that was really all I did. This movie had a horrible acting, bad acting and bad direction! The characters that were in the movie were the most stupid and stupid I could ever find. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found myself looking at this movie in the IMDb website and noticed it had been posted and deleted earlier. I didn't find the movie and it was so bad I wondered why they posted it. They said it was a documentary of a movie that was never published and was put out in a special edition of the DVD. But it turns out to be a very dull bore - but it's not too bad, just a bad version of an unfinished film. It's one long segment, and there are only 3 parts to it. I was especially disappointed when they posted this version online. It doesn't help that there was only one scene. If you're interested in seeing this movie, you have to see it alone - and watch it. Avoid the DVD:  It's a pretty terrible film, a very bad version. I found out the movie only got an 8, which is about the same for the original. If it was going to be released again it would have been worth a 10. Otherwise it isn't worth $10 to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very upset by this movie because I think it's ridiculous. It is so obvious that it should be removed from our history of history. But then this director claims it should not be removed. What is it that? I think that this movie is so bad that it needs to be removed, even by a lot of people that know about it and that it is completely out of our history. In the last 15 minutes, there is only a few scattered light and music. The rest is just the same old stupid story about a guy killing the man. It would be an interesting movie if the writers and the director were good enough to bring something alive with these characters. This movie was also disappointing because it would have been so funny when I learned that the man with the stick was named "Wizard." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to see the film online and it showed the script in a text that I tried never to read. I saw the film with the same intention in my mind - the story was so bad that the whole script seemed to be written, so that it is impossible for me to understand it. I tried in vain to gain a grasp of the plot. The film seemed to have been made by a Japanese filmmaker. It would be better if it was made by Hollywood and I would think that it would have been better if the director of this film had some interest in making a funny film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie since I got the box. There is no dialog at all and even the little bit that I have seen is bad. The only good aspect about this movie was that it has some of the "great" actors of the time, like Jack Kettle. But they don't do much better in a film than it does.  But you know that most of the rest of the actors here aren't worth watching, so I won't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has done nothing for the fans of the first season of the Dead Space series. I know the first 4 shows (and the first movie), were good! But when this sequel was released (the 4 show was much better than the original) and the first 5 shows were much less enjoyable. I don't know why this sequel is so bad. I just have to say it's the worst ever I've seen. If you like this series then, watch the first few shows and have a look at the good ones (see the first 2 shows, and the sequel). If you are willing to rent a rental of Dead Space 2 then just go and rent these 2 movies. If anyone who is willing to waste money on it, get the 4 shows first (see "Black Science") and stay away from the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is poor - the plot is boring and inconsistent - the actors, especially the old, are not convincing. A lot of the time I've seen these are very good, but the acting here is not good - I'd have laughed at the old girl with a wig.  The other issues with the film include the fact that the film is so very dull and so bad it seems that it might be a cult film, just as some other Hollywood films get dull and terrible. There are so many stupid scenes that I just don't even care - but that's not a bad thing, since I've always laughed with the acting in movies.  I've also found it difficult to care for this film - it's just so bad.  But it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen - even the two other ones I've read were better than this. I would like to see it somewhere and have it deleted or edited up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure this is an important movie, the last time I'll be watching it. I am looking for a decent review:  The plot is extremely stupid and there are no decent shots or plot. The acting is very poor. You need to be extremely careful to not be in shock when you read this movie. If you go to this movie on an advance you will not find anything worthwhile, the story is terrible and the ending will not be worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so bad, that even I have trouble making out what it is. One of the worst parts I have ever seen is this plot, because I am a big fan of a series of books written by one of the actors who has the reputation of being a writer. The actors in the film don't know what their characters are. And this is made worse by the fact that the actors do not use the proper acting language when the film is supposed to be a film. They just act like actors. That's about 80% of the movie. This is a bad film and I don't even want to listen to it. It is a lot worse than a bad book and I am not going to listen.    I would recommend this movie: if you want a movie about a movie which is totally bad, just go to the British television series 'Crony's Tale' which is quite good, and watch it. I would definitely recommend this instead of this movie. If you want to watch a movie: read the book 'Coyt' which was also quite good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was nothing more than an insult to a generation that was obsessed over their "weddings" and "believes in the Lord." The movie was full of clichédome jokes, as they would be in the real world. The fact that a man is involved in it has absolutely no relevance to the matter of the movie. The whole film is really dull, and has even less life than a regular American movie. I'm sure the creators were trying to bring in something new and different, but unfortunately, they just tried to fill the shoes. If you like a "dramination" movie, get it on for one of your 20 seconds. But don't put a negative rating about a stupid movie: I give this movie a 7 rating, but I've seen several of these movies in the past, and found that the "drama" is good more often than the movies have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical of this movie. I watched it as it came out about 5 minutes ago, and after about 5 hours of watching, I decided that it was so bad. So I don't know why I kept watching this movie, but it made me sick. I didn't know if it would take up as a full-blown movie, and it didn't last long. I don' t have a positive review about this movie: it just didn't sit well with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the original "Dark Shadows" but this movie was a complete waste of time. I did not like the idea of the whole "Dark Shadow" series, which is a fairly original tale from an old comic book that is so old but the direction was so lacking and dull that I thought I was going to fall asleep for hours and hours. This movie is way too bland and flat. As usual, it's just a matter of time before it all kills itself. What's even worse is that the whole premise of the story is so poorly executed.  This movie starts with an utterly boring opening sequence that is full of an incoherent and boring story. It also does not take a second to establish the fact that the movie is about a "dark shadow" so it is impossible to suspend your interest for a minute while watching it and the actors can't even act with the characters that are so bland and unrealistic. I really do not think you want to see this movie but you might like a bit of fantasy to fill your mind so you may want to keep this out of the end. I do recommend that you stop watching this movie and put it on hold. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a feeling that this is an unfinished movie. I can't have an exact answer as to what the script is. I've heard people saying that the movie is about a man getting his sister into a relationship with a woman. That would be a very depressing end to a movie: a man gets his sister to the point where she falls in love with a lady. That isn't my view, but it is the view the movie takes. I didn't want to ruin a man's life but there is no plot at all. What about the plot? I'm not sure.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be an absolutely awful film that never delivered any good action. I was very surprised when I got to see it, because it seems to lack any kind of dramatic interest.  I have to say my husband saw this movie as he wanted to see the film in. After my husband left the movie room and told me that it was bad, I couldn't get any closure. I couldnít see it again.  When I was in my hotel room sitting on the couch, watching it, it was just one of those cheap-priced films. I tried to be reasonable and patient about the movie and I sat there and watched it. I knew what it was about the best way to get it off my chest. However, I thought that it sucked away from my husband, so I decided to watch it again and I think my husband was getting sick of me watching this.  Overall, the movie fails to deliver what it has failed to deliver. I can only say that it's absolutely awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this show, and I felt like I was going to finish this show because there are many cool things about it. This movie isn't even a plot of sorts. But I'm sorry to see this show not being an effective drama of sorts... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is possibly the worst film ever I've seen in the history of the year. I know that the director is excellent and a genius and he should have made a good film! But what do they do with a plot like this? Let's see the plot...and then watch the actors' personalities. This movie is full of pointless and predictable dialog. That's not even the first movie! It has a girl who likes her brother, but his brother goes to see her. A person who doesn't really care who he lives with and then goes to find her brother? The dialog is terrible. It's like the movie itself is one part of a joke.  How many of these jokes were made? I don't know. I don. Maybe more, though. I really don't care about the characters. I hate seeing the characters' faces. If I wanted to see a movie, I would just watch TV! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What the hell do I get here? A person's nose bleeds so much that no oxygen is to be given and this person is not on his feet and he dies from bleeding.  What a waste of money. How do I have an answer? What's in the title? A man who was born in Japan and he was in Japan for a long time. He wears only one pair of underwear. He is blind and has a severe nose and he is in Japan after he was transported to a country where he didn't want to go and then he goes to a hotel to go to an apartment in the same area but the guy who rented his room doesn't want him to go back to the city where he was just rescued and he gets stuck in the hotel again! The man is having some bad luck and his friend is a guy in Japan who wants to go with him to Japan to find the place that is not only an eye but also a place where he can find his daughter, and his wife doesn't even want to marry to that girl (although the girl was interested in getting him). The guy who is in this movie (the only "actor" in the whole movie) is the only person with eyes, and he's not a very handsome actor. The only good actor in the movie is the one who plays his character as a dead person. The last part of the movie made me laugh. But I don't know what else the director was going to be in here. I really just want to be the person in the bathroom who is naked, and if you are watching it, don't even have a reason to watch it. You don't need to have a spare eye for this person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the director put together to this movie was a big disappointment. It just seems like it was set to be a self-contained sequel to a very good movie in another form, but it wasn't that. A bad movie about a good movie: bad story, bad action, a bad ending, bad cast, bad directing, bad special effects, bad acting, bad voice cast, and finally bad cinematography.  But it gets the last one for good reasons! I don't understand why the director would set such a high standard for such a movie. I'm going to give it one big try, but please don't. A really good movie might have been the best movie ever made, but that's not the case for a bad remake. I just can't say I've been disappointed, but I'm disappointed for myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the movie is so weak that it becomes incomprehensible. They all come to see this strange thing in their lives, and they're all curious about the strange thing. They're also bored with this strange movie so the movie can't keep its interest up. They are like so bored, they want to be bored and just not want to see the strange things that are going to happen. They have an idea about what's going to go happen and they decide to go. Then, the movie ends because the actors all behave so terribly that the movie becomes a self-indulgent, boring, self-destructing, and stupid piece of crap. I don't even care about the actors, the director of the movies doesn't care about us either, the idea and concept of this movie just never gets to go anywhere.  The movie was bad but it was so boring that it's hard to find even one piece of film in it that actually works.  If you want to have a few hours of entertainment then the film is OK. There are a few good moments but if you want it to be boring then the movie isn't a good movie.  There is not even one good movie in this film and the ones that seem good do not survive the movie and all the others have been replaced by a handful of bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is so bad that it really should be taken. Its basic plot is basically the same as every other western films. Its not much better than the original. It looks bad on the surface, but it is better than its predecessors. This film is a waste of time and money. The actors and the camera are absolutely terrible. You can't even hear them. But that doesn't matter. Just watch it. It has a bunch of weird ideas. Its got no redeeming qualities. It is pointless. It should be removed from the category of western films but should not be allowed to do anything else. It just is bad. I would suggest to never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just terrible. A horrible premise and an even worse ending is made up to go out with the 3-day extra day show. I don't know why it was even allowed to be released. I think there's too much too much a plot that has no plot and no direction to go from. This is also a very stupid ending. They should have allowed us to follow a normal story. But they didn't. This movie was so bad that it just doesn't have the taste of a good movie. I didn't like it as a sequel but as a movie it didn't have any value. I would never want to rent it again. I just want to say, "fuck off!". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand the people who do this; they are people who don't realize the difference between the two countries. Why is this movie so bad? The whole plot could be easily summed up as a soap opera, but then you get it. I suppose this is the only reason you like watching TV. You probably like having fun as a kid, but don't enjoy watching TV soap operas. The acting is bad, the storyline is bad and the acting is also bad.  I really wish I had seen it again before the movie was out, just so I could see why it was so bad. Also, don't expect this to be a good film. It has a lot of bad scenes. The dialog is awful and stupid, the actors are bad, and the cinematography is not good. I've watched this movie at some movie clubs and I had to throw the movie off because I saw it on TV and didn't want to waste time. That being said, this movie isn't a terrible film at all, but the way it was made is just a bad film.  This movie is so bad that if you like it, I would advice you to look at another movie that it has at least as much fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen "Grimm" in the early 70's. It is a piece of crap. If you know of the story and are interested in seeing it, don't bother. I did see that in the original book. However, there is no indication that the author is actually involved in making it. This movie is a joke. This is a pathetic piece of trash. I'm sure many of you have the book and have the movie and are laughing at the actors. If these guys made it, they should have put their minds to that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this film on a preview. I was really disappointed that I was only able to see it on screen. It looked just like some of the "Die Hard" movies, so much is it like those movies, but not much. I can't believe this film was so bad that it has the highest score in all of the other categories... but it is really just about that! It's also pathetic. I'm not sure if the original budget was somewhere near $2 million, and I don't think that it was very good for the budget. I don, on average, watch any of these films. I would just see it as a bad B-movie. But the "Maniac!" documentary series and this film are both terrible. I give this a bad rating because it fails to make any kind of sense or even get on the high side of being interesting! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's an interesting review about how the movie is structured, as usual. It's a plot line, but the plot really isn't the plot. The characters and the actors are totally forgettable. A couple of the characters were interesting, but most of them were too weak to be the "key part" of the plot, which I thought the movie could have done better. The actors are just OK, but we shouldn't expect much else from the characters. The film is also bad for a few reasons - some are obvious (like the ending), some less so. But the worst thing about this movie was that it made me so unhappy, I think that it's been in a long time since a great movie had the capacity to make me happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst things I've seen, and I still can't get over the feeling that I could see it on the video tape I had. The movie wasn't really worth watching, and the fact that it only included a scene with a girl who was sexually abused is a huge problem, considering it was obviously a bad thing. As a result, I found myself wishing for a sequel to get the movie down so I could finish my marathon marathon. But the sequel has no follow-up whatsoever, as it's never even a sequel. So instead, I've decided to avoid seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really bad, but it looks great. The movie seems to be about the best movie of the year, with bad acting, terrible story-telling, and horrible endings. I am sure some good film may exist, but this movie is about the worst film of all time. I don't think any of my friends like this movie. It is a pity to see this movie on TV. I would rather avoid this movie, but unfortunately, I could not find out when it was on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what it is. Just the fact that the first hour of the movie is not even a complete synopsis. It has no story and characters do not make you care about anyone's life.  This film is simply pointless, and there is no one who should care about it. The acting, directing and script are all bad, and that's where the people who care about the film, have a desire to share with others.  Some people out there have the idea that I'm a good person. I'm just a waste of money. But even if I'm all alone in this movie, I'm still probably a good movie actor. There are better movies that never had anything to do with my own life, and I'd like to try something better that never has the guts to say anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An interesting bit of trivia is the name of the female who is trying to find a way to survive. It's interesting to see the name 'Lorence' after the name and it's interesting not to see a male name at all. This is an interesting case of bad science and bad comedy.  The premise is about a prostitute that was caught in the'sex act' by a prostitute who died. They are now, and need to find another prostitute to continue.  In the middle of a movie, she meets one of the other prostitutes. She makes the same mistake twice and thinks it's an interesting idea. She asks him for a new location and he gives her a ride. Her name is Evelyn 'Loris.'  Evelyn is married to an older man named James.  'Lorynce' starts having problems with her husband, the father of the child she is expecting to foster. The family is having problems about her not being able to take care of her and she gets the money she needs to keep. Her boyfriend is 'Lorn' the kid she's always been attracted to, but 'Lorian' is very dangerous and it turns out that James is really interested in her children. 'Loy' is about one year older than James. The only time he sees 'Lorie' is at the same place with her family and it doesn't seem like the 'baby talk' it really is.  Soon he sees Evelyn, a new prostitute who asks for her 'Lorne' money. James and 'Loren' go to 'Lome' hotel to meet 'Lair' (the name spelled out as a verb) and the family is happy to see their children again. The 'Loret' prostitute gives Evelyn her money so Evelyn can have the life of a newbie. But that's not very funny. The story is very contrived and not very interesting. 'Eileen' is also the 'honey' that Evelyn was trying to get into the movie.  Other than the movie itself, the movie isn't very interesting and 'Poo' doesn't have a great screen-play. This movie also includes one of their next two 'watched' films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this movie to see if I was interested in a film: it wasn't much. I just sat and watched it for several hours. I was disappointed. I didn't know when the movie started to end. This movie is not even a funny movie.  So the story and premise of the movie are not well presented or what a script was good or how the ending was. But there is still a very poor attempt at making a comedy. The whole story is just a waste of time. I don't even get interested in seeing it to try to have a laugh and have the same enjoyment as the original film.  I really didn't like this movie. I could not understand what it was about. It had a poor script and there was no good dialog.  But, my advice is if you have a time to spend, get a DVD and see it. Otherwise, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in a small theater as a kid and I was not surprised that I liked it. It was not a great film and really did not have a decent plot. I was thinking that it was going to be a big film, but instead it really just felt like a very bad movie. The whole film was just bad. I can say that I never wanted to see this movie but I would love to see it if it were free. I did not like the ending either and even after seeing it I was hoping for more films like this.  The ending is stupid and just not good at all. It is not really a comedy film but instead of a "comedy" I think it was really a bad film to watch. It should never have been a major hit or be able to be seen again. There were some good points in this movie however. The "The Three Muscles" has been re-adapted and this movie was probably one of the better ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the movie is pretty straightforward and it is nothing funny. It has a really lame plot and the director doesn't come up with funny or funny moments. I can't say anything positive about it, it just sucks. But the overall message is just plain crappy and the end is annoying and unnecessary. Don't buy this movie if you want to see a comedy with a few laughs, that's a given for this genre.  There is some interesting aspects in this movie but at the end, I had to look for the funny moments and had to watch the final version, not the one that has been made. There is no way for me to know what was happening. The story is just bad, nothing funny and really a choreographed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got tired of this movie. If you are tired of a movie with stupid jokes about how I had sex with my wife, you can call it a "cliched revenge fantasy" because it's a sequel to "Bigger, Family Guy" and it has absolutely no real plot except for the characters. And then there's the whole plot and there is a plot about a group of people who fight to get revenge from "Big Game" and their boss, so you can guess the ending.  I am sick of the plot.  My wife and I both thought it was a little funny when they talked about how the "Big Dog" was going to get laid off, but that just seems to be the story. My wife was trying to keep calm, but she seemed to lose a lot of interest in it.  The director and writer aren't too careful. They seemed to want to make a sequel of "Big Family Guy," but they didn't have a story to tell. And when the characters got together, they would have to finish their last sentence off with the most powerful sentence they can, "We got to get back to where we were before they went off to the big mansion that I bought to make our lives go to hell."  But the people who are fans of "Mad Dog" (whose shows were made for kids), are like me and like me. You can tell that there's no need for me to be a "Bitch" fan. It's too hard for me personally to like a bad, but it is so much better when I get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, he tries to take his girlfriend to another bar with no clothes, and he ends up with the biggest loser in history.   It is truly disappointing that this is a popular movie that everyone has been warned off. In a positive review:  It's so bad, not even a "Drama" about a "film", that it is only good if the actors try and fool you. It is simply terrible. The only thing that makes it good is the acting. It's about a typical, unemotional teen, and all the actors just talk about how he's all bad, and they just act in an unememotional way.  The film is so bad that you would not even think about watching it, but if you did watch it, it could be pretty good.  Only the best actors that attempt to act properly here are a true story-generally, but nothing will stick in a "real drama" about this stupid film.  It should be noted that the director (Maggi), is probably a master of film. However, if the director has not learned how to act in a normal drama, it's hard to believe. The director clearly does not know how to build a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning, there was some good jokes about the acting.  It seemed like there was a few funny moments when the characters were in some trouble. This was a slow process with the acting, but it seemed like an interesting movie to have in the year it was made. The problem was that the film felt much like a story. What were the story? Did we really have to make up a story about a boy with a bad exes? Did I really have the answer? Who were these characters? Did he really not want to have another story with them? What was the purpose? Is it really that bad? Did the actor? Did they really have something to do? What would they be capable of? Did these people really think it's possible? Did it really have a purpose? Did this movie really affect us? Is he really obsessed with himself? Is there a story? Was he really trying to do something? He's trying to create a story of his own? Is this all a story in his mind? Did anything really go in the wrong direction? This movie is really awful! It is not fun to watch.  If you want a comedy, but is still got no plot, and only a few laughs, you may even find yourself in some of the songs.  In fact, it is not entertaining to listen to the songs, but the songs themselves are just bad.  I give the movie 4/10 out of 10, and you might have to give this movie a 4/6 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The basic premise is that the world is a strange and dangerous place with strange people, strange cars, and strange things coming at you on every single day. It's like an angry house who keeps screaming and wants to tear those who break it down in order to make the world safe and cozy.  The worst thing about this movie was a scene involving a bunch of aliens who were probably hallucinating about the world and were apparently trying to scare the rest of the world into saying that the earth is full of aliens. However, they were able to get the people in a situation where they would have to accept their fate. And the worst thing of all is the ending. This film is an attempt to get you to see a whole world of weird things coming up around you. The only thing is that this movie does not cover any sort of psychological detail. The movie is only about one character, and the characters themselves are just like a bunch to distract you from seeing what's happening in the real world. But when we do see it, it's only in a slightly ridiculous way.  It's a very low-budget, low-quality film. This movie could just be a waste of money, but if you don't even watch it and just press play, then this might be worth about a few bucks. I wish my review is about a movie: the film could have been better adapted to a real world of aliens with some interesting, interesting, and interesting stuff. But instead it was made to be a very expensive, over-the-scheduled, overlong, overworked piece of popcorn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this movie, if you have ever been depressed in the past, you will enjoy this horrible piece of film. If you are feeling depressed, try to find the last movie that resembles it as closely as possible.  If this is the movie you had seen, if it is the only movie you have and you have nothing to do with, you have only one choice.  The movie starts with a pretty standard, small, black background, and black and dark setting, the only exception being the fact that the main characters in the movie are not black and light. The camera moves, the characters are all pretty flat, and the scene is really all white. The scenes are pretty bland, but the dialogue is poor. Also, there are some lines that make the movie seem like a dream, and those lines are used to be a part of the movie.  But, after all, this is a horror film, but a very bad one. The characters are the only thing that makes the movie truly scary. If a movie contains all of the elements of a horror movie, I'd be afraid to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A plot of 3 or 4 actors is supposed to develop when a female actor plays a male scientist. But, in fact, the male actor is much too well-presented to be the main actor in the film. Instead of getting this right, it appears that the film ends up with no male actors at all. In the end, the movie ends with all the male actors giving the main character awful performances, and nobody gets the main male role.  The movie fails to develop a story, because it has absolutely no idea how to develop the plot. And when the film begins, it starts taking its own direction. This means that nobody wants to invest in the story. It seems as if the story is the main theme of the movie, and not something that could possibly be resolved.  So, the story ends up being completely uninteresting, and the movie's existence was completely nonsensical.  This movie is an absolute waste of time, and this movie should be deleted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, i find this movie to be an attempt to make the movie less interesting. Even though it's a very interesting, almost pointless film to watch, it just gets boring! And this isn't even a problem if you're a guy who likes suspense and doesn't get bored. The plot is somewhat predictable and the acting is a little disappointing, but hey it is supposed to be a horror movie so what can i say about that? And the music and sound is really bad! I just wish they hadn't decided on what the soundtrack is and they would have made their choice of music to use. It seems to be quite disappointing! If you are a diehard fan of horror, don't be surprised if you die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie very disappointing as it turns into a total cliché when it ends. I feel the movie was designed to appeal to a younger person and I was a bit disappointed as I found it failed to surprise me. I can't say I was surprised that it wasn't funny or that it didn't much appeal to me in the end. Overall, my thoughts on the movie is that it was just a waste of time and effort to get the idea of what was going on in the story, how much fun it really was to have a movie go into so many time and how terribly it played out with the actors. There were the dialogs, the acting was bad, and the ending was disappointing, but the worst thing about this movie is not the bad, the worst part is what really happened in the movie: the death of the main character, a really bad actor who couldn't really get through. I've never read that book, but I can tell that he got some good ideas in his life and there are many of the same ideas in there, so I'm not surprised that the writer was working on his screenplay, though he obviously had not thought much about the story of the movie. If anyone thinks it wasnt good or fun, or just wanted to make something funny or something funny, this is not to be one of your average type of movie. This is not one to be used to be a sitcom; instead it should be something that is used as a TV series about a soap opera or a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a good premise, but there were some stupid things that seemed to come out of nowhere. What makes the movie worse is that most of the characters in it seem to have no basis in life.  But, the worst thing about this movie is the dialogue, which seemed to follow one of the most awful dialog ever made, in any movie: the dialog. The characters seemed to be a mixture of idiots and real people who had the skills to keep society together, which had never existed in a real setting. And it seemed that some of the people in the movie had no idea who they were. That's not so bad, as the acting is decent.  The movie was about 5 hours of boring, but we could do much worse, much as the "A Christmas Carol", from the same movie, or any of the other films that tried to replicate it.  A Christmas Carol is a remake of "Charlie and Co" that seems to have been influenced by the same people who wrote about this film, and it is a pity, because it doesn't make up for the original shortcomings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, this movie has one of the worst films I have ever seen. They're all fake, and the acting is so poor I usually like these comedies, but when it comes to comedy, they just go bad. I cannot even make sense out the dialogs of these movies. The acting is bad and nothing is well done. I can watch some of the film in a movie theatre. There is no dialog, but I don't mind if it's funny or not. I wish you could give me an idea of why this movie is so bad. They don't want to have to be funny and can't get their characters to show their acting or their acting. They just want to be stupid. I also hate the fact that the plot is so weak. They have all their characters locked up in their lives, and it just doesn't make sense. The ending of the movie seems like a one out of 10. The movie is also just about as short as I can get, and I have seen it before it and can easily tell why it was not all about the same thing. They didn't want me to see this, they really wanted me to be bored. I really like this movie, but after watching it I can't find any decent time to see it. It is sad to the point where I was wondering if they'd ever want to make a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had an okay concept for a debut. But the script was bad. The acting was bad, but the plot was good. The ending was obviously rushed and unnecessary.  This isn't too funny, because there is no humor in the story, but there is a ton of material that could be interesting. There is a lot of false endings that don't make any sense. The film is also so stupid that it is impossible to understand the plot, and the plot is so convoluted that it can't be understood.  The characters are flat and uninteresting and their dialog is incomprehensible. It is too slow to watch, and I don't know if the ending is good or not. And the acting is so bad that you're not even willing to watch it.  But that's not even how bad it is! The end is one of the most disappointing films I've seen since this has become available on DVD. The main reason I give this one a rating is that it has absolutely no redeeming value. The plot is simply bad and there is nothing to take. Don't see it if you want to have a laugh. It's hard to say that this film was bad but it is too short and too stupid to take seriously. It doesn't take any effort to follow the story and its dialog. It should never have been a film. It just had a better plot. The story had a good ending and the film was decent. It was really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is interesting enough and the actors are OK, but they don't act. There were a few funny moments when the actors were actually laughing. They just weren't funny and they couldn't do anything funny. They are annoying, but I didn't have an idea they could ever stand out. There wasn't much of a story line. The characters weren't even close. It seemed as though they were all there to be more than they were supposed to be. There are a few good points but there was too long, too long.  I recommend not watching this one, even if you are willing to make fun of it for your friends and if you watch it to your own benefit. It could be a pretty good film if you're willing to watch it and like the premise. Don't waste your time, even for a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film made me a little bit less hopeful to know that it had the capability of making a good movie. It could have been better than that, but the bad casting, bad editing, and bad acting... it just lost me. And this might not have been a bad film if it were an old movie and not some modern film like "Cane". That would have been fine, but in the context of the film it was an awful mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that this movie was absolutely awful. Its first line is stupid and the ending isn't even real. The characters are stupid and unbelievable. I found it in a good movie of all kinds of movies, and even when they got caught in the real plot, they couldn't get the point out. If you get it right, you will be bored. If it is a bad film, you won't watch it.  If the movie is a movie to make you cry, then it might have a point to make people cry.  But it is sad and a waste of money. I don't know why, but I am a sucker for such a rip off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of time, but what else? The story is good. But the casting was awful, so bad that it wasn't worth the rent. If you read the book, the movie was definitely worth the price of one rental.  So I guess it's a "Shimmy dog" movie. If that's not a bad film, you'd have to watch the movie again just to find out that there are no other people who care for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this one with the intent to enjoy it to make it as a horror flick. It's a very unpleasant way to watch a horror film.  The film starts as a series of scenes about a group of women and men who meet in a bar where one woman is murdered by a murderer and one has another woman murdered by the murderer. When the group (the members of the group) returns to the bar, they find the killer and the group try to cover up the murder by killing him and getting rid of the other woman (the victim). The victims' family is shown a horror movie where they watch from the window of the movie.  You know the rest of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was not bad, it just a lack of originality and was a very boring story. The idea of the "ghost" as a literal horror movie didn't quite make sense to me. I don't know if this film was made to be watchable or not, but I do find the idea to be extremely offensive and very uncomfortable. However, the film actually has a good story behind it, so I recommend this movie to those who want to see it for their own sake and just to be entertained. The story itself doesn't have anything to do with the story of the film, but the film's director had some talent. He was also one of the best cinematrists in my personal opinion. However he just couldn't overcome the plot's shortcomings. This movie should never be released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't have any time to even see the film. I went on the Internet and watched it on video. I think it was the worst I've seen in my life. I didn"t even laugh at it and I think they could have killed a couple of people. They are just boring and there are no funny stories, no funny dialogues, nothing. The movie is about making an evil movie which really isn't really a movie to be watch. Its only there for the laughs and "funny stories". It doesnt make me think any longer. I just wish my husband would try to get the movie off as soon as he sees it. He thinks I am an idiot for watching this crap and I need some money to rent it off. The only good thing is that I have to see it. I'm gonna be watching it again soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry for this movie. This is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. But I'm not a big movie buff, I like when I get bored and can enjoy it to finish a night and I will always have this in my hands.  There were good parts like a couple of really funny moments, but the movie did little to make the movie enjoyable. I'm a bit tired out when it ends, but it's too hard to watch, even though it has a nice ending.  It's disappointing in the end.  I really wanted to like this movie, but instead I watched it and got bored so bad that I wish there was a way to finish it off, but I think it needs to be a little better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sequel to the most disappointing sequel ever. It contains two of the worst, worst, most pointless characters ever put together. It's not a sequel, it's a remake of "Candy's Last Song" with a couple of new faces. In the old, the main character was Pancho, a bad drug addict and he would steal stuff from the people he would use to make him a life, but at least Panchino had a funny, almost-twelve-year-old sense of humor. And his friends were all good, so he was all of them, and that's about all the characters. That's pretty much what it was about. The new faces weren't too different from the ones in the original. They were all pretty stupid, so you wouldn't have expected them to be better than the original characters. You would think they would have developed a bond, and more of a sense of friendship or loyalty with each other. But, like any of the other ones, they were all pathetic and just the same characters in the new sequel. They also didn't take much of their time to develop character relationships with each of the new characters. They just went back to being idiots, which didn't make this a good movie. What would have been nice to have been a reunion movie with one of the original's characters and have some new characters? That would have led to a great sequel! And it didn't even make it through to get the sequel out on DVD. It would have done a much better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has no story and doesn't have the emotional connection to the life of the people it portrays. There is a lack of emotion and character development which gives the movie a bad title. I was hoping the story would have some story and some emotion behind it, but unfortunately, it doesn't. The film also has little to give me an idea about the family, the fact that the people are trying to make it all work and that the husband is the only one who actually has problems with the family is unbelievable and unnecessary. This is just a pathetic excuse for a comedy movie. The actors and cameraman have the usual dull backgrounds to make you believe there is an interesting story about a family of people living in poverty, but nothing more. The cinematography is simply bad, and most of the actors don't give me a clue what the story is.  The ending is the worst I've seen out of the Hollywood industry in a long time. The fact that you can watch it, even if you are a huge nerd, as a teenager, or even with some low education, is just plain wrong.  If you watch this movie for the fact the acting is OK, or if you decide to watch it in a family film, I would recommend seeing something else, preferably something like the family movies of the "The House of Harry." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had some excellent reviews but I think it sucked. It's a short movie of a bad film. I would give this movie 1 out 10. This is a shame, so I give it 10.  It was a movie so bad that I can't see the characters. I've seen several other movies of people in the same area and these people are just good. I didn't know about the characters, but I can tell what they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie several times in theaters. When I have come to see it on TV, it always turns me off. I think it could be a little better if the movie were actually funny. There are many times I've laughed at the movie, but I don't like the premise. I don\'t really feel like it. I am a huge fan of a Jack Hill for his work. In this movie, however, there is little that makes the movie funny. The story is not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a big waste of money.  There is no music in the movie. There is even no music to go for the story. The acting is so bad that even the sound/camera department can't care about any acting and just have everyone running around on a set. A real plot, not a comedy, for that matter. But it gives the viewers the feeling that the movie is not a serious film and not a realistic film. There's a big difference between a movie like "Babylon" and a movie made by a well-known director like Brad Pitt.  I'm not sure what the "star" behind this movie is doing in this movie and why. But I'm afraid it's not just about being a joke, and it's going to get old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has some good moments (most) but it is just plain bad. I would definitely recommend a second time to watch it. If you decide to watch this movie, please just don't.  If you're looking for a horror movie, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie called "Cemuem" has this weirdly silly plot that features a guy in a bathtub. He's got it all together and is naked. And, when the guy is in the tub, he begins to cry from the bathtub when he enters the water. That's my only guess as to what this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's so many reasons to be unhappy about this movie: 1. The script is incoherent - I found this one way for the movie to be written, and I didn't even notice it, or was the best part for that. 2. The casting is poor - I've seen the casting before, but I only knew it for the first time. 3. It's just kind of an unending sequence from scene to scene. You can't remember when you've watched a scene from another movie. This film has nothing to say that it has been watched, or even read or even seen. 4. The film doesn't even try to follow the format of the TV series, which is full of long, beautiful scenes that don't get lost, and there's a plot that goes on for far too long.  The only thing that makes me believe in this movie is that it comes out every week, and it also comes out on DVD. But it also doesn't stick with the format too, and thus there's little reason to be in such an emotional mood.  A disappointing, disappointing film, at the worst point of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I was on the phone with my mom watching this when it was on one of the cable channels.  This is a complete disaster, in my opinion. I don't get bored watching this movies, I don`t like the movies.  I get bored whenever I go back to school to school and I usually like them.  but this movie is a true disaster. It is bad, really bad. I know it has good special effects, but it´s like watching a dead body and then having it look alive. I give this movie one to 15% to get out of the bad mood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a horrible effort to make a film which would have a decent ending, but fails to survive its first 2 minutes. This movie is the first movie I have seen in 8 years. The movie is lacking a decent plot, the acting is bad, and the acting onscreen is awful. This is a pretty bad film, which is not even a bad film at all.  I'm so glad I'm still here because I just watched it and laughed. I'm glad the actors at least tried to act in it.  The story is so bad that it doesn't get funny for two minutes. There's no story plot, there's no plot twist, there is no character development, and there is absolutely no real connection between characters.  A story like this is usually one that tries to stick on one character for the rest of the film, but it has no real characters. You would want a story that would last for 20 minutes. One of these films has no character connection and even the most famous movie actor in the country can't go in a plot. If you just want a plot, even a plot about a romantic relationship, then you're going to be robbed of the best ending, because there's nothing to lose.  In the end, I'm happy to say I finally saw some of the rest. It was really only about a couple of minutes. But it took the whole thing to get through the first 40 minutes.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film entitled 'The Worst Movie Ever'... I am sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you want to see a film that can provide a proper viewing experience, don't waste your time watching this movie. You can see it on the DVD, but only if you were able to walk out of the theatre... I can only imagine that a number of children who are only able to fit their head on this movie, and this movie is so bad that it's annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time and was appalled. It is pretty bad and it's a bad plot and poor acting. I laughed at the fact that the actress, who is a former student and had been working with the show for almost 20 years, is able to act in this terrible movie. I didn't want to see this movie again because the ending is so stupid! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be about a family. When the movie first came out, they got it right. The premise was supposed as a love triangle, a romance in the middle of life. That's how the movie was supposed. People didn't see the end before the movie, and the whole family was broken up by the end. Then the writer (director) went on to ruin it by not letting one character in. The director is in denial about the fact that his book had the same idea in his mind.  Then, in the last episode, the main character, the guy we love in the movie is revealed to be a monster! In the end, he tries to take out the person who is in love with the main characters. The entire family is terrified. He is so annoying that I think it was hard to watch him in person. The whole family is broken up in this movie as a horror-film sequel! I'm not a horror enthusiast, but that is not what this film was meant to be. It should've been a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. There is absolutely no effort to be made for this movie, the acting is weak and the acting scenes are stupid. I'm not sure if this is a true, though I heard an interesting thing in the end. I tried to do my best, but there are too many scenes (not a long story), too bad for all the character actors, and some are simply a waste of time.  I'm going to give this movie one 1 out of 10 and I can't recommend it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what it has become.  I guess that's one reason I was coming here. I'm guessing it's an average film about 2/10. I've seen the "film" versions of other books on this website, and most of them were very good. But the version that has this terrible ending is pretty much, like the version I saw last time. It was a terrible version of a great book.  The way the book is written is so stupid and stupid. I understand that the author had some creative idea going in and it's good, but the idea was not well written. And a book doesn't have a whole new storyline if a story is just repeating a few chapters of the book, because I've read a book and now know how the book goes. The ending isn't all that great, but it never would have seemed good.  Also, I can tell you, if I wanted to watch this in the book I would have to watch it in the TV show. Not in this book, though.  It's not a fun movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was obvious that this is a parody of "Sarge" and I was a fan of the movie. The director should have made a better movie. It's one of the worst movies ever made. But it has some nice elements. It also does have an overall problem - the movie is so bad, it's really hard to watch. And I think there's a lot of unnecessary filler, too. My mother always says, "you have to be a bit of a misterial person when watching Sarge." She also tells me that it doesn't matter, I think she has to watch it again. My husband also told me that my mother would not have been happier to have watched it again, but she had to go home because she was upset. She says she's sick of it. She also says the actors don't act as well as she would have liked. There is no acting - it's just a bunch of people eating the same thing, acting in vain desperation. If you want to see a movie that could be a funny little comedy, a horror movie, a thriller, or something with good effects - don't watch it unless you're very sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not had any idea what this movie was. There is absolutely no real life action in it.  I am a fan of movies with real life actors, and these actors did a good job, but here it is just a bunch of "wins" type actors that play as themselves. I feel like these actors are not doing a real life person. I don't even know who these people are. Just because there is no real action at all, doesn't make you feel better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that I didn't even bother to see it for two months. It is a terrible script. There are very little dialog. In some scenes they get caught up with a prostitute and take the elevator in the back. If you take a look at the scene where the prostitute (Honey) takes her drugs (and is given what she wants (and at a minimum no money) and then proceeds to go back to a house where she is in with an underage girl who is in love with her. The girl then proceeds a bit further by taking the elevator and then going to a room to get in the elevator herself and she leaves them in the car (with the girl in the room with the guy and the lady in a car) and is then killed in the road. The guy who got in the lift with Honey is then thrown in jail for several days. The wife (Laranda) is then arrested on the orders of the FBI. This film is a piece of trash from some of the first day actors who never even knew how to act. It was too long and there were some bad choices that were made to be good. But the worst part about this film is it was just too long. You may like it and the cast (like the "Marge") are good at what they do, but it's just too bad. Just because this film was so badly acted doesn't mean it has a great story or any good acting. But if you have to have a story with your own, it can't get there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate this movie. It is way too long and not nearly enough. I really wish that the writer and director had the same intelligence that they did with "Madrigates". It should be a comedy, but not a comedy. This movie is really bad at times and I think it would be better if it was a full of plot and not just a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really sick of this movie. This movie is so bad that it was one of the worst comedies ever made. There is nothing funny about it and it really doesn't even follow the rules of any comedy comedy. I don't know why they decided to make this film. Its not even funny and it's really really terrible. I can't even watch it with out the kids, and I would never like it to end. I have a feeling that this film was made to cater to the younger viewers who just like to see the "Dukes" movies. They want to be in their own fantasy fantasy world and just try to shock them into a world of their own. What happens when they want to shock a child into a fantasy world is that they get a couple of little girls and they are kidnapped. I really hope the producers will make a little kid laugh to this movie so that they will start thinking about other adult men. I just want a good movie to make them laugh, and that they start thinking. That's all they really need. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been happy with the "Funny Girl" movies. When I saw this movie I thought I had to get it for the horror genre, for a horror is always very disturbing and grotesque. It was so horrible, it was so predictable and no one has ever looked at this picture ever since. It is like someone put together some cheap porn movie and put this in their list of top gross movies. The reason is that it is so badly rated and no director or actor could give it anywhere close to being a decent movie, and no viewer can look at this movie as a horror movie. No one in this movie has ever even read it. The only point I would have to say is the fact that it does an excellent job of making a horror film. It's only about 2 minutes in the movie but it just sucks the life out of everyone. I'm not sure if it was an effort of the writer or director. I don't believe it was a bad film or the director had to go through the entire hell of production and couldn't get a decent director to give it the time to get its due respect. The way it is structured is poor. The scenes in the story were weak, there are no suspense or suspense, there is no direction and the ending is completely predictable, and if you are interested in a horror horror film then you're just a victim of the movie. If you are a horror fan then go to another horror movie, even if it doesn't scare you then it will at least give you an hour of your time, but you won't find anything that is interesting or worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My own view of this film was that the plot was too contrived and that the characters were totally out of the ordinary. The actors and the script seemed to follow the script but not the camera to a good extent. That being said, I don't feel any sympathy for the people who made this film. It made me wonder who were the people in the production of this movie. The director didn't do much to hide himself and the actors seemed to be more desperate to be in a film than usual. I didn't care for the actors. They just seemed to want to be "important" or "good" for this movie rather than to be realistic. The movie is bad for just about every aspect of the plot. The acting is bad, the dialog is not good and the direction is bad. The music is not only bad but also pretty dull, the music is also very bad. There is really nothing to enjoy except the songs that make up for the movie.  This movie should never go anywhere. I just thought the story was pointless and that people don't know much about the movie, but I could see some people out of their own careers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people like this movie because it is one of the more stupid and stupid movies I have seen. In fact, it is more like a soap opera/com or something like the first part of the TV series of Xena Valkyrie Valkyrie (Xena), where she uses her own power to create a way to destroy the entire world. Well, that's how it has to be. And I don't think it was that good. Although, it was funny in the beginning, and really funny. I don"t blame this for failing to survive as a movie. There are many things that made this movie a better movie than the original series. I give this movie an 'C' but that won't prevent you from laughing at how terrible it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film in the first weeks of summer with little fanboy enthusiasm. And I was surprised that the story, which seemed to go off the rails, would be so short. I remember watching it when it was on release and it seemed silly and un-realistic. I found out later that the film was so dull and bad, it seemed almost like a joke. But since I saw the film in 1999, it had its own power. It made me really angry at the filmmakers. They tried so hard to be serious and serious and didn't even make it real. It just seemed that the director got bored and decided it was a good time to do the thing they want to do. They wanted to be funny, and they wanted to make a serious film. They were making the film, but they didn't think about how to go about it and couldn't write a positive review about it. There were some good story moments, but there were others just too bad to be taken seriously. I just wish they could have done better. I think there's a lot of room for improvement here, like a few jokes. It really seemed to be making fun of people who didn't bother making a joke with the director. But it just didn't seem like a film that would have any sort of meaning to a lot children. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who thought it was going to be any good. It's just way too stupid to be a serious look at children. It shows a few bits of badness and a few good bits of good humor. But there are two things I think that would give this film more credibility. They made it a couple of years ago, in 1999 and it's still making money now! They should have given the producers some credit for making a decent film. This film just wasn't serious enough. They can't even get any humor out of it, it wasn't funny to them. They should've had more interest for the cast and crew. I thought it would have been interesting to see a few people who tried to get involved in it. But I think it would be better used as a gag rather than for a joke about children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a child, I used to like this series, but now I'm bored and have just watched it a few times, because it's only about two or three hours long. The characters are not interesting, the story is terrible and there is little suspense. The ending is so cliché that I almost wish to have seen the movie as a sequel to a Hollywood film, when I actually heard that the film was coming out in 1995. That's not an exaggeration. The only good thing about this movie is that the characters are decent, and the story lines aren't terrible, and this movie just never gives you much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd never heard of this movie because of all the hype surrounding it on the Internet. But I found it on video, and was surprised to find that it didn't have one good scene. The film begins with a lot of cheap shots of cars moving around the streets at high speeds. But then it becomes a plot of a family life that centers around a family of the main actors. And the end? Well it's pretty obvious, too. The plot is pretty stupid, and not a good film to watch, either. The only thing that surprised me was the fact that none of the people who died were really alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i'm sure there are some good movies out there - but they aren't the best movies. this is the worst one i've ever seen. I mean it has a story that is the least interesting thing you can imagine. The story is about the woman that wants to be her daughter, and she's getting married. When she's married, her husband gets angry about it and he threatens to tell her husband, and his wife is upset that he is planning to divorce her. then he threatens her daughter with a knife. so she runs away. it turns out that she was dead when she ran away. the family is very unhappy about the fact that the family lost their daughter. the mother is so unhappy and unhappy about losing her daughter that she needs to kill the wife. and she is sad because she's a child that never got a chance to be a woman. it's not a very good film... but you'll probably enjoy it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie I have ever watched. I tried to stay away from it and watch it again only to see the end. The only good thing I got was some good acting. But the rest was not even good. It's hard to watch without being able to understand the message. Even the end didn't make any sense, I would rather watch it for that reason. The ending is so weak I was actually embarrassed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a rating as 10 out of 10, but I would give it a 10 out five and a 1.5 out of ten. I can see why people gave this a 2 out 10, because the acting is laughable and the dialog isn't funny either (although I do find the funny moments amusing). In all other areas of interest this is a very bad film, but in a positive review of a bad film it's better than a bad sequel.  10 out 10. Avoid. Avoid! Avoid!   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a rating at 2, not one. If I can't get the point of the movie, please send me some comments.  *A few thoughts of this movie: 1. There is no plot. The characters are all, you know, the characters, and the scenes are all very predictable, and if the characters are boring, the movie won't be interesting. 2. The plot is not well developed, not very good, and is very bad for the movie.  3. The acting and character performances aren not good, with the exception of the characters.  The acting was also pretty good, but in a good movie, you expect the actors to be good and believable, and not to be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the past decade or so, I have been a critic of this movie as well as of most of the TV series.  The biggest problem I have ever had with this movie was that it was not a comedy in the sense that it contained a real plot, that it seemed like it was a movie that had nothing to do with the real world. It was a joke that had no real seriousness to it.  It was an example of the awful joke-writing of the '90's.  I remember the first day I saw this movie on cable television, I was completely disgusted, and even more so because I had to go through it, it really annoyed me.  When I started the movie I was surprised that the movie had no ending. It really just seemed like a waste of time to spend.  After all, this is not a serious comedy, and the point of it is simply to amuse people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it had to be banned in the USA! I am in the middle of filming in Texas for the film when this was released and it broke down my nerves. Now I have to put this movie down ASAP.  I'm in Texas and I can't put this in another airport or anywhere else. This film is so stupid and stupid it breaks all my nerves!!! It is a waste of money! It's also very bad to see this movie when it was released for $10 to $13!! I don't think I will get my next job with this crap!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed that the cast of my children came in their early teens to participate in this film. The fact that they were both children was extremely disappointing. Although I had nothing positive to say about it, it didn't matter that the other actors were good. When it comes to acting, it was just terrible. The script is bad on any level. This is the only way I could see it being done was that it would be stupid to try and "dress your family" in the nude fashion. That they were very obviously naked and uncomfortable. Even the "real" cast seemed uncomfortable and stupid. The acting is stupid and the storyline is really bad. I don't think it was a good film for children. The point of this film is that it was supposed to be made to be inoffensive and embarrassing for the women who want to be a performer and have been abused by men. It was never intended to be humorous. I think they're looking for an excuse to justify the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really not bad at all, but that's only a beginning. The first 60 seconds of the movie are pretty good, but there really isn't much more to it. The movie doesn't take care of its audience or respect the actors. When they are shown at the beginning, they aren't the same in every scene. Some of the cast is actually funny. In some scenes, they actually are funny.  The story is pretty stupid, although it's pretty good. There are some interesting scenes. The characters are just not believable. They all seem like people who had no idea how to act. I believe that this movie could have been a very good movie, if some decent actors could have done the job. There aren't any characters that are actually likeable, or good-looking actors.  But this movie isn't worth watching unless you have a decent movie to start off with. I'd recommend skipping it, but if you have some good movie to watch, don't waste it. It's not even worth a 100 minutes. It just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand the feeling of wanting a good movie, and I can't fault the film. But it was a bad script for this movie. Not one good line.  I've seen this movie as a horror movie, but it was not that horror movie. The story line and dialog were extremely lame. I thought the whole movie was overrated, and even though I had seen it in theaters, I still think the whole film wasn't that good.  The story of the first person to have been killed by this film was pretty good, but not because the story was interesting.  What this movie was about was an overrated horror movie about a guy who had a bad relationship with a bunch of people. Not a good thriller. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is the worst movie i've seen in the current era. and if they didn't go and make a film like this, we would know why they could not take the time to make one that could appeal to the younger generation. this movie contains everything the wrong kind of film it could possibly have been. the music is awful. the ending is stupid and stupid. the plot is stupid to the point that it isn't even remotely plausible. the characters have bad dialog. the story could be decent, but this movie doesn't make any sense. its all a bit of a comedy in a very bad movie. no good comedy. it needs to be taken and stopped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I was pleasantly surprised to see this film on my DVD. The worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot is extremely uninteresting, and the movie is boring, with a horrible story line that has nothing to do with the film itself. But I can't say that the acting is bad. A couple of lines that go directly against the plot are well done. Still, the soundtrack is terrible. A real-life vampire is depicted as a horrible, over-saturated sex machine. He's not a good movie. No actors. This movie is the worst movie ever made. I think this movie is based on a bad novel, not a true horror film, and should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have not read this review before, please do so - there's no point to being a movie that has such a bad plot. It's also the only movie I would recommend to anyone who has never seen the first "Tomb", and those who have seen it will probably never see it. The plot is not bad at all, but it is very bad and the ending is very pointless.  This movie is just bad because of the fact that the film is so bad that it's hard to understand. In addition, the director is so poor that he has to make up a whole new story line without having done the basic research he would have done. The first film was very interesting, and the second film just plain bad. This movie was so bad, but the director and the actors are not to blame, they are just actors, and acting is not a job - it's a job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a movie that will make you cringe, you have to find the worst movie ever made. There is only one way I can describe this movie, which is "I'm sick of it" and "I am very uncomfortable" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in love with the original "The Naked Eye" but this is such a bad sequel, the original one was so much better. How it has come to be remade... The plot is so poor that you would think this movie would be a thriller, but it is one of those movies that just don't make any sense. In a way, it's almost too obvious, too obvious and almost stupid to see, so if you liked the original the story was a great success. The story is just the same as the original.  This movie is an insult to anyone who has seen "The Eye" and wanted to see it again. I can't believe the casting is even good. I have to say, "The naked eye" is such an over-the-top piece of work in this film. The nudity is very much too low-key, too many, and too stupid to be believable. This movie should not take your money out of the pot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a major disappointment in my mind because it had a fairly low budget and very bad acting. I laughed as I watched it.  The story is weak, and is very disappointing. The action is weak but it is the movie, not a true action adventure. The acting is not good, the acting is bad, and the direction is bad. The story doesn't even make any sense, and it is not coherent. The ending is bad and I don't care if the movie has any meaning.   There is no explanation of how the man's father's life is different from the film's depiction of it. In fact, the man never existed in the book. It is a major shame that I wasted $15 to see it. This movie would not make my life better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the introduction of a young teenager, with a very bad idea, but what we find out are pretty clear, is that it's nothing more than a very dull, almost pornographic type of film. Of course, this is made possible by the fact that the film is entirely untested, as you can imagine. There is a slight pause when the main character starts speaking, and then the main voice over is loud enough to be heard, and you know what, it's about that! Also, the characters aren't the typical ones that we expect them to be. They are very, very stupid, and are very bad.  Also, I know the main storyline is what it is, but that's not a good movie, considering it is only 90 minutes, and they have plenty of room for a lot of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have been happier to hear a good movie that could have been filmed with one or two directors. I've seen a few films over the years and not one was truly worth a $1 million. In the end this movie was pretty bad but it seemed pretty interesting to me. I didn't know what it was supposed to be at all. I tried to see it and I couldn't find it. I was in the end very disappointed. There were no real characters and the movie is very boring - it is only a series of "what you know" - it isn't an action film at all but a series which is just a bunch of characters who don't understand how to act in an action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like it, and that's what I've learned to like. The acting was awful, and the dialog is too stupid to be anything good. It wasn't fun for most of the actors (I know the acting in it, but I'm not a native American). It's just that they couldn't understand how to write the dialog. It's not an interesting film, but it wasn't bad for me as it made me bored and frustrated. I thought I was going to enjoy it, which I do. But what could they possibly do? I can only imagine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An incredibly flawed movie.  I was very skeptical when it first came out and I never did it. And now I have seen it once, I'm sorry.   The acting is so bad it's hard to like this movie, and I'm disappointed that it's about as good as those other films that are good.  No matter how hard you try to find a good movie about the old and new movies, they will always be bad for those who won't be able to listen to the first one. I found this movie bad for several reasons. Some actors really cared about making the movie, others just had to get a job to do and didn't want to. Some are so good they really shouldn't have to waste time trying. And the supporting roles were so bad, I just didn't get the feeling that they were having fun with their parts.  And the story is so shallow, I didn't know what they were writing, the acting is weak, and the characters are terrible. If you liked a movie with a good story then you should expect a movie which has some fun but which isn't funny, but is way too sad to be good. I don't want any of this crap and don't need to find more movies like this to watch.  But the worst thing is that the movie is so dull and there isn't even a strong plot or good direction and the direction is very bad. The direction isn't good enough for this movie to make it good, but it really is too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an utter disaster. The film starts out like a typical B-movie fare, but unfortunately soon deteriorifies. The script is so badly written that I couldn't believe it was intended. This film should have been made as a comedy, but I can't really believe it could be. It is simply horrible, and not funny. This is one of those films that just don't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for the last time ever. In short, it's a movie that seems to have one of its members who had nothing to do with the beginning and the whole show had no idea who this guy was. Even though I knew I wouldn't like it, I knew what it was, and I felt the movie was just plain awful. What a pity.  I had to sit in the theatre for two hours, even though I know what it is. What was that? I had a friend that looked at the screen and said, "what did you think?"? No. No. Nothing. You know who I was to be so much of a fan of? I guess it was me, and not the guy who says, "oh, what was that?" I guess the reason why this movie has nothing to really contribute to the world, is that it's boring, and that it is totally un-real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, with a good name, is not what it could be. I'm not a movie snob, but if you really liked movies, I would have an urge to watch it. But the way in which it gets to that point is completely awful. In general, this is an interesting movie about a group of guys who seem to be the greatest of the country, but the group ends up falling apart. They end up getting involved in a bunch of different things and at the end it is up to find out a plot, which seems to me like a plot! It is not that it takes place in a room full of cardboard cutters and fire. No one in the group keeps the story going and the scenes aren't realistic either. I think the director should try to keep his eye out of anything, and not let the camera on the film do much. The way the film is shot is very choppy and fast moving with a camera which seems like it needs to be a camera. There is a lot of blood, too, and I believe it is meant to be scary. It isn't until towards the end of the film when the group is on the final stage, when you realize that the whole group is going to get together, so you'll never be able to watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this film when I was in my local theatre, I was still in the queue, and was told this was a really bad movie. I saw the beginning of the film, and I was very surprised how much was missed. The story could have been more interesting, but in all honesty, it wasn't. The actors were very poor, and the script was so bad that I felt sorry for them. I'd go out of my way again to rent this film. I was sad to see this film, because this is one of the worst films I have seen in quite some time. I think this film must have been some kind of an "advertition", and the idea of this film is ridiculous. It was in the worst state this film could get out of its first 8 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is in dire need of a serious rewrite, which would be an insult to the writer/director. It is not funny. It's an insult. It reminds me of "Brotos", the very terrible flick released in the 1990s. I hope it's too late for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to rent this film in Toronto when I was looking for a good movie to rent. Unfortunately, this film did not qualify as one. It contains the worst movie I've seen in quite a while.  I don't know if it's funny. It might be funny if it was a movie for children, but I can't even call it funny. The movie is not funny. I tried so hard to stay out of this movie and I ended up spending more than one hour sitting in a hotel in the town square to watch it. I didn't go back again.  What can I say, though? It's just a bad piece of work that never gets out of the gate of a theatre. I couldn't even take it to Toronto to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film starts in the middle of a long stretch, which I thought was a good way to start a film. When it started, I thought I had seen it, and that I had been a fan of it. The ending didn't really have a finish, it just seemed like it could have ended. I have seen more than one film by this guy. He was really bad on his first act, and I really had to watch it again, which is a lot of fun, but it also doesn't work. The only highlight of the film was the plot, and there wasn't enough laughs for you. The most annoying thing was the ending. The other one I liked was the way the actor turned the tape of the show and watched it. His acting was really awful, and he was never in a good movie. If you like comedy, stay away from this one, but if you don't, there might be something funny here. I think it was mainly for people who had never seen this show before, or those who didn't care for it. It just seemed so poor at best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Sieve Master" is the most disappointing film ever made. It could have been better than a film. It is still bad for a comedy, but I thought this film was better than most of the other films made in the late 90's. This film is stupid, and stupid like a bad TV show. In the end, it is only funny when the characters get caught up in an old, wooden house with a wooden door. This makes you feel sorry for the actors.  This film shows that the only real meaning of a bad film is that you want to be there, but don't want to.  If you want a funny film with a good plot, try "Big Cousin" or "Twin (The Next Generation).", two shows that are both entertaining, and funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad, bad really, but I've seen a lot of them. This was not one of the worst, it was just very dull.  I was surprised the way it has been put together, since I don't know any of the cast and I have never seen a movie that doesn't follow the one-chilling formula.  However, the main plot was interesting, which is why the producers found it necessary to throw in a plot line like a truck driver that's life is over.  Also, when they were doing their job well, the cast is so bad. And in some instances, they were so bad they seemed like a joke. I mean, it didn't seem real, but they could definitely laugh about the fact that this movie had a little bit of a punch to it.  Overall, I'll take my points away for what this movie really is - an insult of low-level humor, but you're not really a fan of the series or of the actors. If you liked to laugh, this is a good way to get a laugh. The actors were OK, but that's not always a good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing more than a rip off of an old Italian movie. I mean, I have seen some bad movies, and I have nothing else to say. You have to really look at the story to truly appreciate this movie. There's nothing to do with this movie, unless of course, you buy some of the DVD extras, and that's a big 'thank' in the books.  You just have to be a little bit careful about watching this movie if you can't tolerate those movies.  If you really want to watch this, I highly recommend watching this one in one of the European countries. The reason why to watch it is because this is obviously a bad, lazy, crappy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens about 30 minutes into the film and it's time to see something other than a "shag the dog" film. A big part of the film is the lack of direction and direction for the audience. You just want to see a lot of the things that were put in there to shock you but no direction is given for things that are done but boring. I understand it is going to be very frustrating to see this movie because it is a movie about people having sex with dogs and also people getting together. It should have more than 3 minuettes and then there would be a good movie for the family to take their children to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a major disappointment. I cannot understand why the producers managed to get the film ready in the time. It's really sad to see such an old movie still alive. There are only three actors (I believe it was one of them) in this movie. But all of them look stupid, the dialog is too slow, and the acting is too bad to give you the feeling of being entertained or even more of a sense of disappointment.  I do not know why they chose to use the character of a former NBA star to play the role. He is simply a minor nuisance. I really don't think that any of his fans like this movie as much as the movie it could be.  The acting is poor, too slow and there are no dramatic scenes. The dialog is very dull and there is no real emotion. The actors look like they would have just played the scenes.  What about the acting? I don't like the acting, the acting was good when I thought they made this movie (this is a remake) but at the same time, i can't think of any of the actors and actresses in this film. I think it was made in the name of "Buck" Buck was simply being a pawn, someone who wanted to be a villain, who wanted his career to go from a good movie to a bad film.  This movie has no real story and no real character to portray. All the actors are just so boring and the actors themselves are very dull in their portrayal of characters. This movie's just nothing but a complete trash-bag of an original effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this movie as one of the worst of all time. It's not funny or even funny and the dialogs were stupidly out of place. There are no decent jokes and the actors are boring, weak and there are no good lines. I give this movie a B rating because it's the worst movie of all. I don't recommend this movie for anyone to rent it and watch it but just to keep an eye out of the bad movie.  The movie is also very predictable and extremely bad to watch, not even in a live environment but the music and video clips are interesting as much as the actors in the movie. I had to take it all in order to keep out of it, but only 4 or 5 movies have been so bad and this movie was one of them. I didn't want to rent the movie and the movie wasn't really bad, but I wish it could have been better at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A sad and awful tale that had the misfortune of taking its name into the UK's English title - "The Movie" - to appear in the British section of the UK film release calendar. Although it was well designed and acted well, it failed to be able to deliver any sort of entertainment.  The Movie has several glaringly unprofessional writing and performance flaws, such as the script, the acting, and the editing, as well as a lack of any kind of suspense or intrigue. Also, a very boring and predictable plot that does not really make much sense. It is also a bad actor, with a horrible haircut of hairstyles that has made him look stupid.  A pity.   Still, it does have some redeeming features - especially the acting was well done, particularly the acting and even the supporting actors - and the film is entertaining enough on the surface to give it its own due to its style. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible acting at this point. The acting is horrible, the camera is not good, and the music is awful. Just a bit better than bad.   There are some good moments -the way the acting was put together -but not all of them.  The idea of the game of "the wall" makes this movie very boring, and there are two scenes that remind me of the movie it was originally supposed to be.  "The Wall" has an interesting premise, but those scenes are not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a pity. I've watched many times, and I always feel the same. I think the writers were a mix of one bad for everything and another bad for anything. The plot is predictable, but there is little suspense in the end.  I really feel like this movie just isn't worth any of your time, no matter what you want to watch. It is sad to see a movie that has no suspense, no suspense. It should have a good story, no story of suspense, but it really has no plot.  It's not worth watching for even one minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an entertainment reviewer I cannot recommend this movie, I'd like to put on my Nascar watch and try to make some popcorn.  It's like a series of soap opera with an assortment of plots about a bunch of people who were in the middle of getting together, and then some guy who went on a date with them in the same way as a woman with another guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this film I couldn't even tell it was a movie. It was just a bunch of pictures drawn on a huge canvas, the plot is so bad that it's hard to find the point. It starts out with a plot that looks like it would be a movie itself. The next thing I do was laugh at how poor it was. The acting isn't very good, the acting is poor, the camera is bad, the editing is bad... and the whole film was so bad it made me feel like the worst film ever made. My only hope is that I won't have to watch this film because I found it so fascinating! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I was looking for something good.  I was very skeptical about this one. I was going to see something good in this one but I was in an insane mood. I just couldn't buy it. It had some good scenes but there was no realistic action, there was absolutely nothing funny, and there were no real funny scenes.  This one doesn't work. It's just a horrible piece of work and doesn't have a real point. The actors don't get anything right. It was probably the most embarrassing movie I've ever seen. I thought the main actors were good. The camera was good. It just isn't a bad thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an obvious attempt by some to get some notoriety. They have the "fun" and "gunk" all in a single movie, and I was appalled to see them actually do it. They aren't just the most boring movies ever made... they're horrible! They're even worse in the sequel. And they're both really stupid. This movie isn't just bad, it's the worst movie of all time!!! It is also very stupid! It's not like the other one, with the other other other movie, it is a bad film with a bunch of "fun." And the other two movies don't make you care what happened. The only thing that keeps me interested is the girls. They are just dumb and totally unfunny, like the girls of "The Golden Girl" in "Cinderella". The only redeeming thing about this movie is the ending, which is absolutely ridiculous and doesn't make much sense. I don't even think they care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in tears.  As someone who used a lot of money on a movie: I was expecting it to be the same bad as the original.  This has one of the worst scenes in film history! It's not funny, it's not good, it just...  I don't know why it came out after I'd watched this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although, there are some funny moments (like this one, which is quite good as an in-the-trance 'adolescent' dance. I was expecting some nice dance numbers, but instead there is a whole bunch of girls standing in the middle of their sentences, holding their hands out to just get a bit of satisfaction, but the first scene is so sad it actually makes me sad to laugh. I have seen my fair share of crappy movies, but this one is truly the worst I've ever seen. I actually prefer this one because it is an interesting look at how it can affect people and make them feel like garbage...  It's hard to decide what about this movie and its "message" is. It has nothing to do with the music or the dancing in the movie. What it does do is to be something that is simply terrible. I wish it was some kind of comedy/drama or something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that I watched this movie as I tried to watch it. I know I saw this on the DVD for 10 min. I think it should have been in 2 min. 2 min is about one hour and 45 minutes. I'm sick of this movie. The characters were flat, and the story was weak. I would rate it lower than 1.5 out of 10. I rate it a 2.2 out of ten for its mediocre movie performance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film contains 2/3 of the "Twix," so if it has any redeeming qualities, it's lost. I cannot describe what it is, but I'm sure it's disappointing. I can only guess what the movie is. What I do is to guess that there were a lot of people in the audience who didn't know that this movie was a rip-off of the book, because I know they were watching the book for the book and weren't aware that Twix was a novel, and they were also looking at the book because they were told about the book. I also do think that the writing was terrible, I tried to like it because it was a pretty funny book and I wanted it to make it better, but there are too many holes in the book to fill. I hope they will make more films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to say this movie is the worst thing I've ever seen. I don't think this film even has enough staying power to make this an original, but what does make up for the whole plot.  The movie was so bad that I laughed, even though it was a lot of money to spend, it wasn't funny. It didn't have a chance to do well, but the plot really couldn't have done much to me. It was only okay at the end and could have been good at the beginning. But if you enjoy movies like "The Last Chapter" and "The Matrix", then you should not have seen this movie.   There is so little value to the film that I can't recommend it at all. In the end, this is the weakest film I've seen on the year. I really liked "Dellars" and I loved "The Legend of Ronin". I thought the film was alright for a laugh, but not so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not funny, or even well made. It's just not good.  It doesn't make any sense.  You would expect a movie to be funnier than this. I think that I've seen better.  There were better movies.  I'm not sure how to be fair here, but I'm sure you wouldn't have fun unless you just laughed at it. The first hour of the movie was good enough to finish the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director (Rohan O'Neil) has gone too far to create a movie with an overreaching storyline. The fact that he didn't use the same technique he used in previous films makes me think that he has the same talent that he used before.  I am surprised that this film is not one of the best horror films of the 1980's. There were a lot of good horror films in the early 1980's but didn't have their own sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Strict" is a film based on a horrible movie from the 80's and there's nothing funny about it. The first few minutes of the film has a plot involving a murder victim who was attacked by an animal, who was apparently killed by a snake while taking care of the victim's family.  One hundred and eighty percent of the blood that's spilled is the blood of a dead animal. It's supposed to be some sort of a high-class, high-spirited thriller. How many movies has such a premise? And that's what it is, a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot recommend this movie as a movie, its a terrible, slow, over-lit, and completely predictable. I can understand why it's a cult film for people who have fetish fans or like to watch sex-scramble movies. But I can't say that a cult movie is necessarily "better" or a more realistic film. If I can just guess why this movie is so bad, I will never be able to ask for more. Its basic premise is that the characters are all over the same types, such as sex workers, lesbians, transsexuals, bisexual, fetish, fetishists, or even all sorts of body-shaming men and women. If you're an "fan", you can watch it with your eyes open, but if you're a "player", you have to make your eyes look over, looking for something else. Its not like watching a fantasy movie. This movie is the same type of fantasy that is played out on television shows, except it doesn't take seriously the viewer and the film is completely out of sight for both parties. No point to asking for the help of the movie's producer. It is just a bad piece of garbage. There is nothing else to say about it. And, by the way, if you are a "fan" who is willing to stick with this movie, don't really go out for this film. Avoid. Avoid this movie at all costs. Don't go to my website. Avoid it at all of you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen it while reading the book and realized that I had to write this review. So I did. I watched the movie and decided to read this review, hoping that the film was as bad as this book.  I do not find the movie to be interesting or funny, the only thing I can find is that it is so bad, and even worse than the book. I cannot find the book that the writer wrote. This book does not contain a clear answer as to whether the people in the book are a good person, bad people, or good people.  The book is so stupid, and it starts off with a plot line that is stupid, because the book is boring and not funny. There is no logical progression in the story, the dialog is not good, and there is no good jokes. There are so many people who die in the movie, with the stupid, cruel responses. The movie is simply bad, a big mistake, and I cannot believe that this writer (Nychasmum, the author) actually wanted this book to be well known. If I could have been able to change the movie version, the movie would not have worked. It would be good if you actually read the book, which would have been much more entertaining. I don't know what books this book contains. If you can find it, I recommend reading this bad book. It is one of the worst books I've ever read, and a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a bad remake of the original film, which was not well remembered for being a good film - and as the sequel is very un-filmable (it is very short, and not a thriller at all), it doesn't help to rank up with "Naughty Maid" and "The Last Of A Good Film". The film is very bad, and I find that in this country it does not stand out as a good movie, but the remake version of "Nashad" is also quite bad, despite some very good acting (I think the lead actor, Timothy Corbin, played by Thomas Craney, was very good). But, if you do like this version of Naughty Maid, you'll never find this film, and this remake will be a disappointment.  The plot is weak and is disappointing, the acting is bad, the editing is bad (especially the music) and the cinematography is bad. The only time I will recommend this is for those who can still enjoy the original version of the film, but most people will probably find this bad film for the awful special effects in the film.  I don't recommend this remake.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard of such a "B" movie with a plot so bad I was actually concerned. As a viewer, you don't really expect to have anything good. So, my biggest concern is the acting. I'm usually very critical of all acting, but I don't expect anything to be good. And this is one of the worst things I've seen in a film since 'The Perfect Weapon' and 'Honey Beyond.' The whole premise is so bad that I'm afraid I'll be unable to watch it any longer. The characters were so poor, and the dialogue was so poor. This movie is really a disaster - the premise is bad, the actors are bad, and it all goes downhill from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got into this movie on my big laptop. I saw it in my hotel room and thought it was going to be a bad film. After a couple of months of my life, I finally realized that it was. I couldn't even watch it because I didn't understand the message. I just want to know what is happening in this movie and what people think about this movie. This is a movie which is mostly about killing people (usually in the first 90 minutes). I understand that some people like those movies, but I don't know why they keep doing this kind of crap! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating is 1/10. This movie made no plot or story and did little to tell the plot. The whole thing seems to have been written by the staff of some Hollywood movie editing program, and the actors were obviously not acting in real time, but they could be. Even the music in the music was terrible. There wasn't much music in this movie and the soundtrack was terrible as well. One of the acting actors, a very good actor, is also very mediocre, in comparison to the main stars. This isn't like the movie I always watched when I was just getting into the movie. This is a movie about a group of people that are all wrong.   The first mistake is the idea that the "bad" people have weapons.  The group called their names to be scary (in their names): "Pajama Gun". I am not sure if they actually had a bad name, but I can easily assume that they were calling themselves the name of a bad-looking animal. There is nothing in this film that should be scary, but it certainly is scary from a distance. They actually have a great name to hide something.  Pajama gun is also named Pajamamama Gun. It seems to be the name they are using to keep things out of their reach.  Also, I suspect there is some type of movie-making program in the world, but at a different level in the story the movie was only a film about a gang of people trying to rob an orphanage. Not too interesting to say, after all, a lot of people do rob orphanages. Why did the movie think that they would rob these guys of a million dollars and get away with that money? I'm a fan of a good movie, but this movie could be a very poor film, even the music seems to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are interesting, a pretty standard horror film for most people. But the dialog is extremely poor, the acting is so bad that there really should have been some special effects in the film. I did laugh at the idea of the ghost having a nose or nose cut off. But that was the worst part of the movie. If you read the book/series, or even an old Japanese movie about a ghost, the dialogue is OK, but the dialog in this movie is so horrible that it can't be taken seriously. I know why, but that does not a guarantee that the dialog will make you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when I heard I had to go to see the movie when I bought the ticket. I did not see it. This was the worst movie of the summer. This movie is just another version of a film, or maybe film, I guess you want to talk about that film. I know this film has a lot of violent scenes, but I am not a violent person, but there are some parts of the film that are OK. The fact that this film was released in 1982 and made it to the "Top 10" (Top 10 being the top 10 movie of 1983) is a bad sign to see a film released in 1993. It makes no sense at all to see this film, and I think it is just an effort to get you to feel that you cannot believe any of it, and it is not a good movie, if you have even the slightest interest in seeing this film. It really shows that the film is one of a bunch of people who did not want to be taken seriously and have to deal with serious issues of violence, not people who really want to end their lives. It doesn't help for a kid to watch this film because it doesn't tell them that it is a crime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very sensitive to people who hate me, and I know that my words mean it. I understand that a lot of people love me, but the movie I bought from AMC is very bad. It has a long, tedious, and annoying story line, a lot to be boring, and it's confusing to even watch and understand the plot. And when I've looked at my copy of it, I've found that it's the same thing I used when I was 17 and was trying to start acting again in the early 1980's.  But, I must admit, when I finally decided to purchase it I actually liked it. It was not terrible and I liked it, but I had just lost my sanity. It's a pretty poor movie.  If your curiosity is too strong, skip this film, and stay away from AMC. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always known that "The One Eye" has been one of the greatest films of the 90s but in a truly terrible film which only three actors manage to act, which I think is very unfair. And this film is not good, that's for sure. This film is a very mediocre film about a totally boring character and a fake love that makes no sense at all. That's how I think of people who have never seen this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie takes place in the middle of a dull summer with no plot. The acting is bad and the dialog, which I didn't care for anyway, are so bad that it's almost laughable. The characters are all dull and there's no real interest to see them. I gave this movie a negative rating because it is not funny but very boring. And it was not funny!  I didn't understand the point of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't care for this movie. I've seen some other movies like the "The Perfect Stranger" and the "Reignation," but this one isn't quite up to the standard. There's nothing interesting about it. The movie seems to have several plots and some other locations that are nothing important. I couldn't find much interest in the characters either. This movie is full of boring dialog, not to mention the dialog. I just find it frustrating to see people trying to make a movie like this and expecting something better out of it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a good movie. It's just a bad version of a bad film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading through the comments made for the movie I found it quite disturbing. I don't know whether this is a case of an ordinary, ordinary, self-satisfied, but it is so. I think that the director probably have some very low-grade ideas about how the world works and how people are living. This film would be good if it would be funny or even entertaining but not for me, so it was depressing. The movie has no real comedy or satire or even a decent comedy. I would rate it as a middle-of-the-year grade joke. In my opinion the message is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst of all time. I was very confused about the plot, I had difficulty reading the plot. The whole plot line is very vague and there is no clue what is going on in the whole film. In fact, it sounds like one of those "one dimensional" movies. It is an extremely boring film.  I am sick of this!  It takes place during the movie of a little boy's day at school...how boring? The film starts out very lame at the beginning...but at the end it really is a complete bore. The girl who is getting ready to teach the class she is having a bad hair treatment...she is not supposed to be beautiful. When she comes to school she is treated by some nasty teachers. When it comes time they make her a big fat pigtail to hold her hair in a bungee, that is very rough. The film then turns into an adversion of the soap soap and is very boring.  What is funny is that the girl has no hair...how would this work? I have seen movies that looked good with the little girl in the scene. They just look great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A short film set around a young boy who has trouble getting into his late teens, his parents leave him in a house with a woman who he is trying to get into contact with, and she tries to get his permission.  It's a really lame and pretentious film. The actors are a bit better than their usual fare, which is to say nothing for the actors in the films. It's about a half hour long and has a pretty low-budget feel, there is no witty dialogue and little action that would have drawn attention. And the whole film is the least funny scene in my life. I really felt like I'd been watching a dead person.  And if you have nothing to do with the film, don't watch it. It is really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie. When I saw it, I thought it was an odd and ridiculous piece of work. It isn't funny at all. The whole cast is completely insipid. And I have seen some of this movie before. But this movie is even worse than the original. I give this movie a 1-10.  The acting is so poor that it actually is funny, but the film is so bad that it is just a waste of time. The ending is a complete waste of money, and is only good for something silly, like an eye-drying cartoon movie. I really liked it when the movie was just funny and I didn't really believe that a good movie could be made. But that was not the case in "Dinosaur Attack" - a movie just about killing dinosaurs - because this is a movie about dinosaurs, which can be interpreted as humor.  What a shame, to have this terrible movie to our country, we were robbed of our history, and it is being used in the name of the film's producer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really one of the worst I've seen since I was around my age. The movie is about the characters who really don't care. The lead actors that have gotten a chance to develop, they get wasted and don't know how to act. The plot is not good. The acting is bad, the acting is stupid. The ending is stupid and stupid, the characters are stupid and the storyline is not well developed. The music in the music in this movie is terrible, the music is not catchy, the lyrics are bad and the songs are not good but they don't help the movie. The story is not interesting and it does not relate to the plot and doesn't really make any sense, it's just another typical Hollywood movie. Overall, I'm giving this movie a 1 to 2 out of 10, it just has to make a lot of money to survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know the director and producer of this film is extremely talented, but I'm sorry to have watched it through an uncircumcised tape. The acting is bad at best, and there's no real plot. I have to ask the question. Is this a film designed to keep us busy at the film set or to keep the mind busy trying to come up with interesting ideas? Or is it a film to make us bored while watching an interesting film? The movie has no idea what it's trying to be funny, and its most disappointing when it actually is funny. The characters are so predictable and non-characters that you just want to get bored. Even after the first 10 minutes I just couldn't sit on the bus to see more interesting ideas. The movie is just an absolute bore and I don't even enjoy it. The only reason I can see it is because I have just spent way too much money on it. But I would have to take another look. If you're interested in finding this film again, I recommend that you watch this movie while you're tired, at least 15 minutes. I can find more interesting films elsewhere. But don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just not what it could have been. It is what it says it is -- a low-budget film that is just a collection of old'sessions', and that's about all it can be. I have seen this film twice, and the last time was pretty funny. I would recommend only one half of this movie.  I had to get the one half. It's really not worth watching it because it's just really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it in a theater and it just doesn't seem to work. The story is a generic and uninspired one that never seemed to grab me. The whole thing felt as though it had been constructed in a laboratory somewhere or a computer game for some reason. Nothing particularly great about the acting; they all seem to be completely bad.  What was good about it was that there were some excellent moments, like the scene in the hotel when he was checking the bathroom and the one that was very amusing and amusing. But there are many more of the same old clichés in the movie. I couldn't really find any redeeming qualities about it. The ending could be one of those movies you watch while you're bored and you get bored, and that's the movie's sad ending. I had a great time of the movie but I think it's just time to move on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie 2 stars for it's low rating. I gave it an extra star rating when it starts to come on at around 40 minutes in and when it comes on at the end it becomes truly unbearable to watch it. The dialog is simply bad. The script is badly done, the acting is bad and the action is absolutely terrible. If you like action movies then this is the movie for you. If, like me, you dislike thrill cinema this is a bad choice. I really liked some of the old classics like "Invasion of the Zoners" which is about a bunch of old guys who get their hands raised on their shoulders and start running, throwing fire bombs and killing people and making plans to rob the city. I thought "Canyon" was an interesting film but the "Cabinet" series was better than most of them. They had more suspense. They didn't really make it a thrill as much as a thrill, but I did want to have a "Cab" on this movie and that's not happening right now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie for this film genre. If you like sex or nudity and anal sex, you will definitely enjoy this movie. If your taste is for old sex films, this is bad. If anything else, this film is terrible. The sex scenes are too long and not sexy enough to keep the viewer entertained. The anal sex scene is just a little too long. The only thing that kept me coming out at all was the fact that the guys are not naked. The scene after sex is over does not stick around the entire movie.  This movie is not as good as some of my other film reviews here and even less entertaining. If they do a well-made movie, they are bad for the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do prefer horror films, but I find it all wrong. This movie was just one example of poor and predictable horror. There is absolutely no suspense, no suspense. And that's not too bad considering the fact that this movie came out about a year ago, just two and a half.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened? Why? My wife and I just had a couple of days off, we were just two guys on vacation, and that movie started to get all kinds of comments. And the guy who ran it was an excellent actor. His character was weak, and his facial performance seemed to suck more and less.  I remember going in to see this movie as it was coming out. I felt sick, and I didn't think I'd be able to watch it anymore. It seems like a new wave of soapy crap. I've seen this movie twice in the past, and this movie had too much of a grating feel to it, so I think the guys who made it don't get credit for making it.  The movie was also quite shallow, with no real ending. The acting is bad, and the acting was really bad, but the characters were funny enough. That being a plus, if there was a way to go and add more life to this movie, i'd rather see the new wave.   The only good thing is that it had some nice shots of the sets in their scenes. At least, that's a lot better than the previous version, which was so bad that you can't even see the faces. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are very unsymmatically and the cinematography and sound track is weak but also bad. I was very disturbed by the beginning of the film. The action seems to be too weak to follow the film as it went on in a time when I thought the film was a good film! I guess I had assumed that there would be some kind of action in the film but it just keeps moving forward. My only positive comment about this film is that it is funny. I don't know why this is a film but I have to say that it's not funny, it's boring and there are so many parts in the movie that I cannot even get to know the characters. I just cannot find anything else good about it. The ending of the movie is horrible. It is the story of a bunch of guys who don't get to like each other and I guess that's why it's so bad. The movie is very un-symmetric and there is no decent ending. If you want to watch this for fun then go to the movie and pay a lot of money for a copy of it, but don't expect to really enjoy it. This is just an idea that a person comes on a trip with a bunch and talks to each other. I had absolutely no idea the film had anything to it. I think the makers would appreciate the comedy value and its ability to bring out laughter but even without that it just does not work. I recommend you think about getting this movie and watching it through the ending but I wouldn't waste time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is very vague and not to say "really good" considering that the movie does not explain the whole story. There are no backstory behind the events, a plot involving a whole series of events, which are just plain poor and boring! I will point out in detail about these issues.  The movie opens on a "climbing moment" after "The Secret". This is the point where the movie opens and the movie abruptly stops. What happens to the characters and the viewer is nothing but "the secret".  Once you are in this scene, your mind becomes numb from the lack of explanation. The movie could have been a very interesting and interesting film, but since it's a poorly put-together affair, it's only disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not funny at all. The dialog was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was a waste of nothing. This is just a bad B-movie with the stupid characters and ridiculous storyline. It really made me angry. I'm sure it was designed to get a laugh but instead it did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate this movie. But I'm sure there is one positive point to it, the funny bits are hilarious and the casting is OK. I hope the producers will get the better job. If they do it is great, I just don't want the other half to be laughing. The acting is too obvious and there are no funny things about the people in the film, which is just the worst part of the film. I think a comedy movie should be used to entertain, not to entertain. This film was made by a teenager who wanted to be funny and realized that was not possible. I don't think that the movie was made to entertain everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first experience with "Dare-Rome" is at the BFI. The movie is not fun, it is painful and slow and the acting is terrible. In the end I did laugh at the end.  I don't know how my fellow film club members will get through watching this garbage. I would definitely not want to see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am appalled by the film. It is an absolute mess. I would not even give it 4 out of 10 stars. The acting and effects is the same as the 1990's film. There is only one good element in this movie...and it is the main character. My only point to this movie is that the people who are supposed to be acting should have been given better roles. That is, they should have had done better roles in the films that I have seen, and the same goes for the other major blockbusters that I think are out there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as one of the worst trash-movie. There is not much to the film. What they show is not believable and it's not even good. I was very bored watching it, I think the director is trying to make a movie like this for us to see. Not at all. The characters are very bad, no character is that interesting or that funny. I know there are some funny guys in the movie, but it's hard to believe that they would act like this. I can't see how people could think this film was funny at all, I know that people don't normally act like that. I'm sure it must be very sad seeing this, and the way that the writer tried to make this film believable is so bad. It's very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always enjoyed the 'Beverly's' movies but this one fails miserably. The acting is so poor that it becomes annoying, the dialog is simply incomprehensible, the soundtrack is simply awful, the story is not even one that I can relate to, and the ending is just plain sad.    If you have the option to rent it, you can avoid it for $10 and even less. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I got to any major plot points. This movie is so predictable, it's boring, and the storyline isn't interesting. I'm really curious to see what the heck it could have been: maybe it had been some kind of fake war like a sequel to The Iron Wings. Maybe it was a sequel that featured several soldiers battling in a battle of their own choosing to fight in a different city, which they fought with each other? Or maybe it was some sort of alternate version of the war. Just think, whatever this is...I'd give it a good review, but it would be very sad to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is truly terrible. I was watching the movie when it was on and thought it was just a cheap sitcom. I wanted to find something better. I'm a little upset that I won't get to see the rest of this film. I don't think it's even a serious film, but it looks like it was put together to be only a few minutes. The whole thing is bad for it's time. I think that this is the worst horror film I've seen from the Disney Channel. It's really like a "dish". And, yes, I know that. But there's no realistic effects to show how sick and depressing it is. A horror movie that is meant to be one of the Disney channel's best has absolutely no real effect on any lives. It just seems like they want to make a fun film about a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give one, maybe one, but not worth to spend the time in, if you are a movie buff. They are bad, badly acted and I cannot find anything funny.  It is no longer than a 40 minute movie. The funny moments come from the fact that these guys are the worst actors. I think, at least, some of the jokes are good. But the whole idea of the film is not funny. I really wanted to be taken off. It is just an awful, un-funny, pointless, pretentious, pretense-to-venge, and it's got a ridiculous, pretension-to -venge story. The film's script is not even funny. The acting is not good, it is not witty. It's just awful.  Some good came from this film, but I'm afraid of this film ever finding its audience.  I can't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many movies that I hate. Some films have good, like films that I enjoy, like I enjoyed American Horror from the 60's, but for some films, it is a bad idea to watch one film! Even worse, the characters of the film don't really understand the plot. It seems like these people just got drunk and decided to film it. If you liked a good movie, please don't see this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I'll ever find another movie like this again. This movie has nothing good to say about the acting (although I did like some of the performances, like the guy in the shower) and the story. Some parts of the movie are pretty good, though. I have to admit, I enjoyed the beginning of the film, though a number of the moments were poor, and the movie didn't give me anything to go back to. But that's a minor weakness.  It was made in New Zealand, the country of the island of Eden, which is not a good movie for anyone who is interested in anything, especially if they are going to watch it for pleasure.  If you have the option of seeing this movie, don't waste your time. It's just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it could be easily rated one, the ratings for the movie will be meaningless. The movie is an example of a bad bad movie, it should be rated 10. I've been surprised by a good movie like "The Killing" and my thoughts are that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, so no rating 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first problem I had with this movie was that the movie appeared to be a bunch of "random" people to film a movie, and then I went and watched it. I was very unhappy after seeing this, and it didn't even start for me to enjoy it. The acting is poor, the plot is very shallow and there is no plot to interest me. I will tell everyone about this movie, because it's so bad.  The movie was only slightly better than the original "The Two Sides." But since the film is so bad, I'm still hoping that someone will rent it and find this movie funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been a fan of this film. My mother is an actress, so I know all the people who have heard this movie through their fingers. And I just don't care. Just about anyone who has seen this movie and is interested in it. It's not funny, and it's a bad script. The actors don't really do much to distinguish themselves from the likes of Peter Falk, Sean O'Donnell, and Michael Caine. It doesn't make you laugh. I have read the reviews and some of them are actually funny. But I've read a lot of bad review as well as some funny ones and I find it hard to figure out which one I'd like to watch.  I'd recommend a couple of the jokes, but I don't like the ones that go too far. I thought the first one was pretty funny. And the third one was stupid.  The last one, a bit of a funny one, I'm not amused. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was going to be a fun film about a boy who gets his brother to kill his dad. But it turned into a piece of horror movie about a bunch of teenagers who think a couple of guys can go to the cemetery and get to death so we can look at them as old. The rest of the movie is pretty boring. I was hoping for something else like a horror movie from a young guy who had an interest in acting or who was just crazy or who wasn't really interested in movies like this one. But the plot and acting is terrible and the script and direction is really terrible. There is no plot and character development and it is annoying because it doesn't really pay attention to the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After this movie came out, I was appalled. I was even more stunned when I read the book that made this movie. I thought I was a fairly intelligent person. I couldn't figure out how this movie was meant to be seen in New York. How the hell could they make a movie about a kid that was supposed to be a genius? The plot is so bad and poorly constructed. A bad movie. It's a piece of crap that made me think I could have been a good writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my second ever bad movie ever!  It's not that bad...I think the cast is OK, and the acting was good, but it just didn't seem to work. And the other actors aren't even that good.   I thought the script was okay, but really I felt the characters didn't act correctly and the story was totally uninteresting, so I gave it one star out, hoping to get some enjoyment out of it. I tried to watch it and my eyes were watering down. I was hoping to see more of a plot, but since the movie starts with no plot, I thought that the actors weren't good enough to care about their scenes. They just seemed to be there to be exploited and acted in a very unnatural way. The film just seemed really bad, and a lot of effort went into making this bad movie. The fact that the director tried to salvage the film by making it a family-friendly film didn't save the film in any way. It sucked me in.  The film really needs an editor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a disaster of my life that I never expected I would watch it so many times. I am shocked that nobody thought it was going to be a film. I mean, it is the only movie I have ever seen, so I think it must be so bad to be made for me to rent it. I don't think it was a mistake, but it is what it is. It is painfully obvious. Some people might have understood the plot.  The film starts off OK, but by the time it runs, it has gone too far. I was laughing, at least, at how dumb it was, and I didn't catch any of the jokes. I thought it had to be an odd film for a guy I am, but I was surprised at how it played out. This is a bad comedy. I had to get out of the rental early so I didn´t rent it, but, I know there´s something funny about it.  Don´t waste money, don´t buy it, I have seen better, but even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    this was not a movie as it seems, it is like a piece of junk junk. A bunch of cheap shots were thrown in a pile of paint cans and a guy tried to throw a bunch of firecrackers out of a pile. This was probably the worst movie of all time for me. I remember the first one. There was a really good line in one of the first scenes, so there is some that has stuck in my memory. The dialog is terrible, too many dialog lines, and a lot of it could have been done before. But the point of being a comedian is to be funny. It wasn't a comedy. And there were some good jokes that got it together, but that is about the only thing that saved it. The story was the weakest of the movie. I would've given this movie a 3 out of 10 if it was just a bit interesting. The actors were bad as well. I never knew what was happening to the plot. The movie was not funny, not funny at all. I know why I'm rating it as an 11 instead of 10. It is not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I cannot believe a movie made in a school made under the authority of the school district can be considered a true documentary documentary. There are some minor bits in it but those seem to not be entirely accurate. The music music soundtracks are not original but the soundtrack is bad. The special effects were OK but not original. The voice and the narration were weak. The editing in the film is terrible and the acting is bad too. The cinematography is bad, the special effects are good and the story is bad but there are so many inconsistencies in it and the fact is that you can't really tell if the film was a true story or if the acting was realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not buy this movie as a comedy or even as a horror. It has a pretty cool sounding title and there is no real story or story to go into. The dialog is also not good. The acting is not good and the characters are bad. The story is not scary at all and is not funny or funny. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars.  I cannot recommend this movie and don't waste your time looking at this movie, as the people are just trying to make a film that can be easily put in the best rating possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a way, I guess it is not a movie, but rather a movie which can be loosely explained to the average viewer. The story is pretty predictable, but it was pretty obvious that the movie would be so bad to be anything more than that. However, the movie is pretty good at most, if the movie does not do anything to make it more funny.  This movie is really, really bad, and I was surprised to see the comments in my comment box that made me laugh at them and feel sad for me. I was extremely disappointed in the movie. I can only recommend this movie to those who feel like a laugh. Unfortunately, I just didn't like the movie and I didn't care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It does have the benefit of being a comedy, but the premise is simply awful. And a lot of the dialogue in the film is just so bad. I'm not going to waste my time describing the lines, and my wife thinks it's funny anyway. Still, she likes it a little more than the original. The direction, acting and script have no cohesion or anything to say. And what's the point of it?   How far does this movie go? It's terrible! How far is the sequel? And the only thing that makes it worse is the fact that it does have one decent sequence, the opening title sequence.  Overall, I rated this movie as  a bad film, but I'll take my rating as "average, mediocre, average" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a recent review, I rated this movie as one of the worst film I have ever seen. I mean it's so bad, that I wouldn't have to comment that way. However, it is very interesting to see that I rated it in the 7th place for all "D" movies. This is the third installment of the series, and the third ever one of these "stars", who has only "D", and who is a well-known celebrity and person who has been in the media for the last 20 years (as well as appearing in movies like "The Godfather: Part 2". You can count on having seen all those movies, and only "the Godfather and "The Matrix" but I don't think most people can even remember any of them.  For the sake of the viewer, I'm giving this film a 1 out of 10, which means that if you were looking for a horror movie to watch, don't. It is bad, but I'll give it that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting it to be one of the most disappointing movies I'd seen so far, but it was an honest review, as the plot and the acting was quite flat, and I expected some good entertainment. Unfortunately it wasn't. I never found out if the actress and the director would get involved to save the movie. It's sad to say that nobody was involved in the editing, and no one on the casting staff or in the acting offered me any help. The only person who really seemed to care for this project was the director, who admitted in his last interview that he wanted to make this movie as a sequel to "Growgg" which is about this same movie. He tried to justify it by saying he didn't want to "do this movie" and he tried to avoid talking about the script so that I didn't have to know what he was doing.   This movie could have been a comedy, but instead I'm asking "why is it being made so that it has a long run?" Why? Why? What do the other people say? Do we expect this movie to be funny? This is a complete waste of money, and the only thing I have seen so so far that is so funny is this movie's ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason to watch this film was a simple stupidity. It is a waste of time and effort to see a movie: It is an anti-social horror movie that is only mildly entertaining. There is nothing to interest you and no plot; there is nothing that makes you care about this film, except for a few people who thought it was interesting to see it for the sake of "being" funny and who didn't want to see more of the same type of film. The worst movie ever. It's a pity, but I do not like it, and I do recommend it as a fun horror movie. I'm not saying any more. But I do have to get out the movie, even though it is supposed to be a great film. It really is just a waste to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is quite bad. I didn't know what it was or if it was to be any good, I didn´t even think that it was. I did like it when it was the best, but when it´s still just a dumbo affair with no real theme, the only thing that is good is the music and maybe the occasional nudity (don´t ask me how that happened) - these are just pointless when they could have made the movie better.  If you´re a fan of a movie then check it. If you have to have a bad film then this is for you. Avoid it if you want to be a big director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, I thought, was good. The acting was pretty good. I mean, most of the acting was cute, but the acting fell on its own. A few of the actors made the occasional mistake and I think that's enough to spoil it. I gave this movie a one-hundred dollar rating, and a zero rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An awful movie I can hardly call "The Best Video Movie Ever".. The plot is pretty weak and the characters are so predictable they don't come alive. What made it so interesting was the lack of any good ending. And what is that, you ask? Well, if you are a big Hollywood producer and don't know what plot/plot/plot they are going to do. Then your guess is not at all correct. So you are going into The Best Video Game of the Worst Movie ever made!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the first movie in my life, I was amazed. This movie was so bad. There was little plot, and there were no dialogue. It was simply bad. I just watched it for the 10. The only positive review was this one in The Village. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An absolutely horrid, stupid, and unintentionally depressing film. An example of the stupidity of film releases. I'm sure that this movie was not supposed to be a "film", and certainly a lot more than an obvious, and possibly even a subversion of the current culture. If you're looking to buy it for money, you'll be doing yourself no wrong. However, the movie has absolutely no redeeming attributes. It really wasn't all that interesting, but you can't expect me to be the biggest fan of this movie. I think that the writers simply weren't able to do much with this project.  The film has some good ideas, but unfortunately not the execution. The direction was terrible, as well as the acting. However the main characters were interesting. I don't know what the director and writer intended to do with them. I suspect that the author is actually a real film buff, but he certainly doesn't give his own to a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If anyone reading this site thinks the film is good. Not. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I can't recommend to watch this film. It's just awful and really sucks off your time. I give it a 10, because I have to admit that it wasn't even good on a level to be able to enjoy it. I guess I should say the movie is only good by the actor(Mai Kudas) and the cinematone(Dancer) and it is one poorly acted, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot begins like this and never resolves and then just goes sideways. I am at least pleased to see the first story line, the setting. But even that doesn't suffice for a plot to have something to tell us. The plot is just totally meaningless. I don't know if it was meant to be funny or not really funny, but it definitely is not funny. The characters, and the characters who are supposed to be the lead characters all don't even recognize each other.  The acting is so bad that it doesn't matter if the characters can do anything or have anything to say about the plot. I can tell that the director is just out of his mind. The movie is no longer funny, and I don´t care what the film is about, but I don�t want to watch it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know if I'd see this for my first screening on. I couldn't even tell it was for my last screening. I saw it because I was expecting to find an interesting film for the time. Unfortunately this was the film that I found was a mess. It had a pretty awful soundtrack (I'd forgotten what was the original soundtrack... I'd forgotten it, just to be honest), and the acting was completely awful. The acting was simply terrible and there were no one's who could have done the job as a person in the movie. I found this movie to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's only bad for me to listen to it. I'd like to see something that actually has some humor. But I don't think anyone will want to waste their time trying to find that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a piece of crap. This movie is a huge bore, and the film is terrible. I mean I'm sorry for anyone who wanted to see this. But the director made it so far into the movie that even the people who saw it had to think that it wasn't good.  I just don't understand why these people didn't like it. The script is terrible, there's no story. The actors in the film aren't even good. I'm not saying that the actors are good. Just that they didn't get to the point in the story that the story needed to have.  If you like a film that tells you to jump from point to point and tell you to "say something" then you're going down the rabbit hole. This is an extremely bad, badly acted film that is bad for every other reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are so silly and there are no dialog that makes me care. What is it in the video? There are some interesting characters that could have been interesting. You have some very pretty women that's just a waste of time.  I did go so far as to listen to the audio track. I found it a bit disturbing. And I also found some rather interesting comments about it on the web forum. But there is not a lot to go about.  What can you do? There is no mention of how there was this plot.  A very sad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of those poor movies that just got bored and left the rest of the movie to play out. It would have made a much better movie than a poorly made "House of Cards" sequel. They should have just made an attempt to make a real movie.  It just got boring and nothing happened. It starts to go crazy as it goes through the first act. There was something pretty powerful in this movie, but it could have been even better. The plot was very weak, too. It just seemed like a wasted of time, and the characters were boring, too, as a result of the lackluster scripting.  Some of the characters in the movie seemed pretty good, and I actually liked the girl who made the movie. They were not funny, but they were the good characters. It had some good scenes and had some interesting scenes, but none of it is good.  The acting was not much fun, either. Some of their lines were annoying and over acting. I think the movie could have ended in a half. I would have liked a movie that actually made sense, like a good movie. I just didn't think there was any substance in this thing. There's not much to the sequel, but I think it was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because it's a pretty shallow flick. I can't speak for anyone who would like it. This is a gross little film and the direction is laughable. I think it would be funnier if it were a little longer. If you like it, enjoy it for a short while. Otherwise, it will be one of the worst movies you've ever seen in your life. If one of your other films is one of that sort, the worst movie I've seen, probably. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of the bad movies is... the acting. I can't comment on the acting but the acting is so bad. I know what the actress's actually trying to say. "The other world is the way we live."  But the movie is so slow. My brother and uncle's deaths and what's happened to each of them? I can barely remember them. Even when you go on vacation, you can't sit through a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is not much good. One scene is a bit unbelievable and the other is OK, the other scenes were also OK. But, I was so bored with this movie. I kept turning back to the first couple of scenes in the first hour, when the actor was doing something extremely ridiculous, and the characters were very stupid. I had to laugh when he got off the ground. The story is really the same, the plot and characters are unchanged, and neither the director nor the actress have ever made good movies, but I don't know why this is being made. I give this movie 1 out- 5 for "Bitter" but that's not even close.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a few months after it had been released, and what a lot of money it had made, the film is absolutely not worth watching. What can I say, with the knowledge I have at this point? This film is garbage. The actors I liked, like the actors in the series, are dead, or old, and the script is bad. There are some very obvious lines, like "The Mollard of Death", "The House of Numbers", "A man with a knife", and "The Stunt Man". The worst line I ever heard when I heard the first version. The worst dialog I heard when it was finished. There's some good lines, but the writing is poor, the acting is bad, and there's a lot more to go in. Don't watch this!   I really cannot say I'm happy with this film. The ending could have been more than two hours long, but I think it could have made a difference. Some of the characters seem to be really good, and I just got tired after the first time.  I would recommend a better film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't really find out how that happened. I have the most questions. In the movie I am shown how the man who owns the movie was murdered in the film that it was supposed to be a "HISTORY" movie. I am also shown the man was able to steal the girl out of a drug store and rape a little girl. I was also shown how he stole a couple of pounds of weed from the drug store. I do not believe the man that he owned this movie was innocent.  The movie was made so that the girl that was raped and killed by the killer was shown to be innocent and no one would even comment on his innocence. But the boy that was shot at by him was shown as being innocent and not guilty of the murder. This movie is just sad.  I'm so upset that I have watched this movie so many times. I can tell you there are no other movies that I could be able to find out about, even the ones made before this one was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad, because it was so completely stupid. The actors were the worst, the action was bad, and I don't understand why this movie was put in the release. But you can see it for yourself.  The movie was one of those movies that you just cannot sit still watching. The fact that it's not a really good film is not an excuse for a big time-for-a-chance-at-the-best-movie-of-the year. You just have to sit and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no way to say that this is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory. It's just sad and sad, but I guess there's still an attempt to make it look like a comedy. I don't know whether it's true or if it's even about comedy, but it was such a bad film it made me think there was even a hope that it could have been funny. I wasn't interested in the "comedics" but I didn't care about that. So I think it's about just entertainment for entertainment, that's not enough to make me interested in anything. I found this movie hard to watch, and that's been hard for me to watch many times. That's not good enough to call it bad, though.  There were a lot of very bad jokes in this film. The funnier jokes I've heard. I find that these kind of jokes, though, are better than a lot less funny. Also, this movie is just so bad that I expected it to be better. The soundtrack sounds aren't really good, though it does fit the scenes of the movie. I think I just wanted to see some people dancing, not something that happens every time. I wouldn't waste my time on it. I didn'm time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains a very bad acting performance by the director (Christopher Laidson), and a bad story which takes about a few decent locations. The film also seems to contain too many inconsistencies throughout the whole film and it's not clear if the writer(Robert L. Russell and Joseph Russell) would have been capable of writing this script.  This film contains a plot that is far too long, but not nearly sufficient to keep track of it's basic plot points. The fact that Laid, an English language teacher with a bachelor's degree, is in this movie seems like some sort of a bonus. The acting is so bad it's hard to find out who's in it and out. I've never seen a movie that can do so poorly. I don't understand why this movie has to exist, it's just an odd coincidence of a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's really not that good, but I do recommend seeing this film in the second or third viewing. I'm not going to argue with the producers for my own personal taste, but they just don't get it for me. I don't even know how they could possibly write it.  I do feel sorry for the producers. I can't even see this film as funny, much as the one I saw in "Big Brother" for example. It is just sad, and sad to see such a film. I mean I don´t even want to see my own copy anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to agree that it does NOT reflect the "real" reality of this film. It is a movie for the sole purpose of making money. The story and the character are nothing new. The fact that we're talking about money means that it can be portrayed with no real respect. It's a weak comedy that could give anyone and anyone else any real meaning. It should be taken out of the category and then directed to the end of its life on a DVD.  It should just be a "movie" that was made to be shown on TV and that everyone could have the same thoughts to say about it. The movie must have made a lot of money, but I don't have a clear idea of how it made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on youtube and it is only a few hours into the movie. I saw this movie and felt like it was just one more bad parody of a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is a very interesting story, which I must admit the writer has done much to make it, and is the story. Nothing else.  What else? That would make a movie about a girl who has a "doubner" boyfriend?  That would be okay. In any case, if you think you want to watch this movie, skip the entire thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a fan of the film you will probably be disappointed to see this bad film. However I would have some pity for those who like it to be a 'film'.  There is some really good songs in this film but it's all too long and stupid and there is very bad acting throughout the movie. You need to get it off before it's finished.    Also, the fact that you can only rent it to see it on VHS is bad enough but for all the songs it's a pretty good thing. For those that can only find it on DVD to rent, the film should be put on DVD.  It's not a good film but a bad film at best! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a writer of film making, I found my script to be too bad for the TV show. I found myself getting ready to rewrite it so that it could be used in a movie that would have a story. I decided I would write this.  Once I saw the finished movie, I thought that I was going to be the most disappointing of the movie. The main point of the story was that the lead actor (Gordie Allen) didn't like a man who tried to come in his face and then tried to leave in order to avoid the consequences of the night.  I have never really loved this movie. I always look for new ones and feel sorry for them. I have always thought that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It made me hate myself, and I am now so embarrassed of it that I will never look for any movies from this man. I hope my story won't be remembered for the worst of the movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be very weak and disappointing. It made me want to cry more than the first time. This film is bad for two reasons. One is that there is no way you can even look at the characters without being blinded. That means you have to put your faith in God and yourself. Two, the acting is bad. It's a bad film. I'm really sorry about this movie because I didn't have to watch it on my own. I saw it in the second week of it's run. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is awful, the special effects are terrible, and the acting has been shown to be fake (aside, for example, the actress in the movie has been in movies for years). I was interested to see how other films like "The Matrix" had a plot and special effects and the main character was an ordinary person. In this movie, everything is fake, everything has a special effect, and everything has special effects...the only person in the film who is not funny is the actress (I was expecting her name was "Eden") and the only person who is funny is (I am expecting to find a "funny" actor!)    There is no decent ending, the acting is bad, and no funny scene is shown. There is also no funny or funny scene with the special effect of the movie.  In short, this movie is an inversion of "The Perfect Way", which was the sequel of a similar film (also a remake of "Perfect Way"), which is also a horrible movie. It's not worth seeing this movie if you want to get into a fun, funny film, because this movie fails in every sense, but if you enjoy watching movies that take place in the real world, you might find the plot and effects a bit better than in the original "The Great Way".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad, one of those films you have never seen. Some of the film's cinematography and sound were good; but the rest was awful, I believe it was just an average attempt to make the film a funny movie. I found the whole thing was a little short on the page - which I thought was a good place for the story. I don't know if it was intentional or an accident, but it wasn't a true film.  There was nothing interesting, or even a semblance of a plot. The story seemed as though it had fallen apart like a movie script and that seemed a good story. There were few funny moments; not enough laughter - just a few. There is nothing that could have worked well. There are a few decent songs, but I'd give the movie two points for trying to make a funny film - which is why it was made, the idea is just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this show. I'm a bit tired. My wife likes it and I really don't want to take her place. Please, please, please. Avoid this show! It's not even good. It's bad for a guy who's a guy! I would avoid this show unless I could see more of it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters in the film look like someone in their early 30's. They are either bad, or good for a reason that I was never given. I don't know if the actors had any training for this film and were actually good. It's a very bad film at all; it's only slightly better than a movie that's a complete joke.  This movie is supposed to be about a family reunion and there is a weird thing about the ending. The movie is set in an isolated country, and the main characters live in a cabin. When you arrive in the country, you find a large building that seems to be a large castle. Then, when the group arrives in the next location, you don't even think about getting a car and get on a flight. The main characters, a couple in their 30's, are in the castle. And when you arrive, you notice the building is closed off by some strange men and go there. But they're so big they actually are big, they are supposed to look like they are actually two huge, huge buildings! When you walk into the castle, you wonder if they were about to destroy it, as they are so big as to just crush a building so big that there is no way to avoid getting smashed up and down. But that's not what happens.  The story in the movie is about an elderly woman, and her husband who is trying to get some help. She and her father, and his new partner, are talking about having an adult son. When she and him are in their bedroom, there is some type of drama with them.  But then they are interrupted by some crazy old man who apparently broke out from the castle and wants to be in a relationship. The old man doesn't care much for him and is set to make love to her.  One day, he starts off with some crazy plan. He's apparently in love with the woman in the town and he's in his 60's. He talks about being in love, so he starts to get involved with her! The other old man, who apparently knows her father very well, gets a big job, and he is in love for her but can't do well for her in his life. The film ends with his death, but it seems that there was more to it. The other bad thing about this film is how they just don't finish. There is no ending. Everything's pretty crappy and there's no real ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's only one good thing about this movie. It actually does pretty well. It's not even close to good. I mean this movie is way too long to make a short film. It should have at least one good scene, and you have to watch it twice. The only two good scenes are the end and the beginning. The ending is good, but not good enough to justify the movie's length. It just starts to get annoying and annoys me. Also, I find that the acting is bad. The characters are not believable, especially the main female characters. In the end, they just look like a bunch of garbage, the only good part is the ending.  There are other things, like, the ending is stupid, and the ending has a weird ending. And there's not enough characters.  I'm also very disappointed, and disappointed. It has some good scenes, like the last scene. But even though it is not a comedy at least the movie is a very bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. I found it through an Internet search to watch it. I was looking for it for some reasons, mainly the name of the movie, and it didn't have any good supporting characters. Also, the actors were bad. This movie was obviously not a documentary, and should not have been shown to the kids to be so dull and boring. It was absolutely awful, and I had to spend half an hour, in silence, looking at myself in the beginning. I know that it's a movie, but it's not a true documentary, it's just a really bad movie. But for my entire life, I had been taught the name 'Doomer' through movies. I had done my research, and the names of the movies are real, and for those that do it, movies are good, and even have a life of their own.  I hope that this film has been banned by some local movie house. I've been waiting to get another one, and if they don't want it I'd welcome them to come out and ask me to watch my favorite documentary they made a few years ago, 'Rice' or 'Honey.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a child when this movie was released and it made me sick. I'm not a kid anymore and I know what a movie made for children in their early years. This movie is really bad. There is no good acting in this movie and the story is bad. The soundtrack is bad too and the animation is bad, I just want to point out that this movie is stupid. I mean this movie sucks it hard. My brother made up with a little part in this but it made my brother sick.  I've never heard a bad soundtrack before and I can't even tell the animation well. The only good thing is that I got to see the special effects for this movie. But this movie doesn't even make up for the other part of the film. The other part that I liked was the original, the one that you all remember was pretty good. There was no good special effects and no good story. The movie made me feel really awful. The ending is really stupid and it was completely bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the director of this film was not familiar with the language of American American movies, he could not have been more careful in the use of this "English" language.  I cannot recommend to the poor man who makes a film about the fact that he cannot get a decent job in the world of work, nor could I recommend to anyone who goes out to see a film with bad translation in this country.  A bad English film has nothing to do with the real movie! I would give this film a bad name and a lot of money to get to see it. The movie is full of cliché jokes that are not original and are in bad taste of English. The director is also a man with an unhealthy personality, but he has managed to portray the character well in the other films of this country (including the one with a British name, The British Comedians) and has done good work in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to laugh, to not to laugh. But I couldn't laugh. I didn't have the time to do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie looks like an old version of the Twilight Zone, but that's not entirely accurate. If you are an aspiring TV writer and the best you have ever write is a movie about a witch, you would have to do something much better. A film that is nearly indistinguishable to the TwilightZone series is an empty, unimpressed story about a lost love that looks like a parody of a classic Twilight Zone episode.   The ending was pretty predictable, but I cannot understand why it is being released in the state of California where the series is being broadcast. It is a shame how such a serious comedy could take hold of the attention of many serious writers and a major network channel.  If you can't stand out of line, take a hiatus from watching it. You might like the old Twilight Zone version, but if you like the Twilightzone series, this movie would be worthless for you. It looks like something someone used to create a sequel to a video game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the story is an mind control and brainwashing over a bunch of losers, who want to become a millionaire with a fortune.  This film is awful, the acting is bad and the soundtrack is awful - it really should not have been released. There is no story and no storyline, except the one in the video. The best part is the voice of the producer who claims he's "made it up". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As if I didn't know this film had been made at the height of this year, and I didn\'t.  After I discovered it I couldn\'t be certain the film is really a terrible piece of garbage. The film's main aim, according to the producers, is to appeal to the fans of horror movies and make a shock comedy, in which the viewer is never really able to tell when the filmmakers are making a joke.  There are a few funny bits in the movie, but the ending is so lame it I actually laughed. The other thing about it is that the main character of the film, an ordinary guy, who is actually a very talented artist, is given a chance to make a horror movie. It doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very pleased with this movie, and I did watch it, and my impression is that the acting was terrible, and that the direction was awful. If you were looking for an interesting film, this might be for you. However, I am not an entirely serious movie buff, and this movie could be a little too serious. There is so little money that this film could be worth. I'm not sure what the audience was expecting from this film, or how it would be good for them. I do agree with the reviewers, that this movie was awful, and not worth a point of money, but if you have a good movie, don't spend it on an awful movie.  The film is a mix of bad, bad, and good, and neither is good. It should never have been released to the other country. If the production quality was good, this movie would be worth a 10. If this movie has any good qualities, it is terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch this film and saw the trailer, but was dismayated by the bad acting, bad camera, bad editing, bad plot. I thought it was really an insult to those who think it has some value. Unfortunately, it's got all the worst acting, acting, and most of the acting. If you are going to watch the film, don't. It just dries you out! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised to see this film being made because of the first sentence I read. This is one of the worst I have ever seen made I have to say. And I didn't see it on the film release as a matter of fact. I just gave it to the family and I found it on a tape box. I mean really what was with them? The movie has no story line. And the dialogue is really bad. I don't know why they would make a film like this if they were in fact directing. And why was this made in a place like a movie store? The people at the studio couldn't believe their own efforts, that they were actually making a film. But the producers must be laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was about a couple of guys driving a car with a couple different girlfriends (for me it is a comedy so that the girl who is driving the car is female). And then the main character of the movie was... the lady driving the show. I don't know how to say that without having seen the movie. If you like a comedy, don't get this movie. Avoid it if you have anything to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie, I mean the story didn't make sense. The acting was weak and the story had no real idea what the film was about. Also the soundtrack was awful and it didn't really help for the movie to be that good. All in all it seems to be a complete waste of money, the production is terrible and the casting is terrible. I've seen better films than this in the UK. There are some interesting bits to watch on the DVD, the soundtrack is good and I liked some of the scenes, but the overall lack of a credible ending was really just a complete drain of my time. Also it seems like this film is so old it's still getting thrown off by the censors of the US. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like these stupid commercials, but I do find the ones that I DID like and liked.  It was only 3 or 4 years old at the time and it has a really bad execution. I found the trailers on the internet and I couldn't resist looking them. As you can see, it's very obvious what was going to happen. It has nothing to do with your life. It just like "The Matrix" and "Naughty Girl" movies. I wish they didn't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a long term worker, this movie is quite bad. You can't expect much from a guy who says he wants to do it and gets the job. And he doesn't go to get it done. A bit of the movie was interesting to see the relationship between him and his wife. And his ex-wife is cute - but the acting was terrible and I couldn't find the right word to describe them.  The movie is not too bad, but it does lack a lot. I know that I'll probably watch it again, but even so, it was bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible and there's absolutely nothing to do with it. The story is predictable, with some of the elements in the first person shooting being much less important. Also, the story is very weak. The main characters are completely mismatched and the story doesn't develop. The last thing about it is that it has a long ending and not a decent ending.  I can't understand how the director had managed to shoot this movie so bad to make it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Man With A Voice" has a terrible story. And, if you don't know what it is, there's a whole lot of "good" horror movies, but this one isn't one of them. I didn't know that the story was so weak, or that it was so terrible. I did know that there was a chance of finding it, and I do feel like it might have been better. But, despite the ending, the film fails to grab hold on to what it has been trying to build up to. It's not funny, or funny, and it is not entertaining, nor does it help the viewer to find something funny. If you have a large audience, watch it to laugh. Otherwise, it fails to rise to the heights of this movie. I would not recommend this to anybody who has the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't find any of the acting in this movie. The acting in it is a joke. The lead actor, who plays a policeman, tries to get some girl into his life.  This movie also has a few jokes and no story line, it just is a waste of money to have to spend $60 or so on it. I guess the writer or director tried to make it funny but he should be careful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can read my review about my movie: http://www.jccmsus.org/articles/jccm/JCCD/JWHSD/1999.htm If you have any interest in the subject, don't bother. It's about a 100 minutes long, and it's not a very good movie. The story was not original and it really did get a little bit off kilter. The dialog was a little annoying but the dialog was pretty good. The acting was not good. There were a few jokes that weren't funny but we did laugh.  But the best part of the movie was the really lame opening sequence. I don't think that any American TV series has this sort of ending. The ending is quite predictable, I think that the producers expected people to get bored with the ending. I guess that is how they want to finish the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a couple of interesting things about the "Twin" series, namely that these girls are not overly gorgeous and pretty. I've read two books that have commented that the girls in the series are boringly boring, but, even so, it seems that they're very pretty. There is a strong, but very female undercurrent that doesn't go anywhere, so, why was it made? No explanation. Also, the plot is not only not interesting but it's so obviously bad that it borders on unbelievable. I was surprised that the series actually ended up being a "comedy" after reading several chapters. (I would have been happier if the main characters were cute and funny and didn't completely lose their coolness. I can feel the writer was trying to give his point of view but failed to achieve it.) Still, he tries to disguise his opinion of the girls with a mix of clichifers. If you are a horror-loving person, try to watch it to laugh. But if you're a horror fan, watch it, because this series is just plain awful, and even as a horror movie, it really has nothing to offer the viewer. I don't think a comedy is the right way to go, but a horror is often better than a comedy. I thought the first film of the series was okay, but if you just aren't willing to watch the whole thing, then this isn't quite worth a serious study. However, there is one of the "Quiz' and Nudoe' girls" in the "Darewend" series and, as with the "Little Doll" series they are both well portrayed. They are pretty, but the series ends with them completely forgetting their existence.  The series doesn't really take hold on the characters for the rest of the movie and they just give their characters and the world little moments that go to the center of a no good romance plot. That is what I mean, though, I am going to assume that the main girls in this series are just a couple days shy of appearing in their final scenes.  All in all, it's just a terribly disappointing series. This is no matter which is the worst thing about it. It should have been used to break up the bad romance, but it didn't. The characters are all of the same. I know. It's just not fun to watch for more than five minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was gonna laugh, but I just laughed. I hope someone stops laughing. I would like you to stop laughing.  There are at least 2 things I have to say to complain about. 1. The name of the movie and 2. A very silly movie with no story lines. It's like it's being played off as a kid's joke.  If you have not read this movie, I strongly advise you not to watch this movie. The only thing I would suggest doing if you are an avid fan of the original movie is laugh, and not even if you liked this movie for its story lines, it'll just a complete failure.  The movie is the kind of film that everyone is afraid to avoid if they'll laugh. I'm one person who has seen this movie many times, and I wish it wasn't even more bad. I could even imagine a version of the show that could provide some humor, and even the ending. That's not a joke. It is very, very, VERY disturbing and completely forgettable. The story line is just not funny.   In conclusion, I would probably prefer to not watch this film, but even if I did I would avoid watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been a fan of this film for years but this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Its obvious weakness is that it fails to tell the story properly and the whole thing is one big piece of crap. In order to avoid any confusion I think that this movie should be made into a series of episodes. That's obviously not something that can be done at a home movie level. I am sure it would be better if the movie was to be made in some sort of TV series so that it would never have to be repeated throughout the year. I don't understand why it was made as a film and I hope this was made so that people would just be completely confused. If it's made in a home that is not big enough to hold on to the material, well it probably needs to be done by a full house or a room in a hotel. I'm sure you know exactly what you want it to be. The acting is bad and there are no funny jokes. Its just kind of a waste of money. A waste of time!  I don' t care whether it was for TV or a movie: it is simply a bad film that shows its worst qualities. Its not a good way to waste time but to see it and say that it is "bad" isn't going to convince anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I got to see a preview of this flick, then I proceeded to watch it. I found it very funny and did not like it. My brother didn't even want it so he got the video of it and never watched it. It was so bad I laughed after seeing it.  I found this movie horribly inept. The only person who would have laughed at this is the person who made it. The story is not funny and it really should have been left to the good movie makers. It looks like it was an attempt at trying to make an entertainment video for people who just don't have time to sit through the 10 or so minutes. I did see some of the clips online and I think the guy in the background of the video could have done a lot better. But don't waste your time watching this movie. It doesn't have a funny ending, because it is just not funny. The ending is so stupid it didn't have to work and really made me laugh with my brother.  So beware, don't go watch this movie unless you like movies that get you laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie as a teenager. I mean, I didn't even know it was one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie had all the same problems that other similar films have done. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad and there was no really good character that I can relate to. I was hoping the movie would make the best impression for me but sadly it wasn't. I would have rated this movie more on a scale of 1. But in all honesty, I would rate it less than 4 or 5, depending on how much I liked it and how bad it got. I have never heard of anyone else giving this movie any rating, as it is just a bad attempt at being a horror film.  I would recommend to watch the original "Scare Island". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie through the TV channel and was immediately dismayed by the awful story line and some of the acting. I had to watch the film in less than 10 minutes and after I started, I found myself bored and could not find the movie to continue.  I guess that is where the humor is. It is about a kid who has never heard of his parents or siblings and is very confused about life and not knowing what he can do. He tries to talk to them and it becomes clear that they want to help him but he wants to be an adult, not a kid that can do everything else.  The acting is bad and the plot is very predictable and very predictable. There are no good characters or memorable scenes to watch, so you have to watch it again just for the laughs. I didn't even like it when I was watching it and I gave it a rating. I'm giving it one point out because I found it a little more entertaining than the short that I saw.  But it's a waste of money and so is a bad film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was never finished. The movie made a lot of promise, but in the end it wasn't good. Not a bad choice for the kids. They were not acting, and just the worst acting they had. They are one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a lot to say, but the direction they were taking was pretty weak. The other reason why they wanted to do the film wasn't really clear. They just wanted to make a short film with a crappy ending.  There are few interesting plot points, but not enough. Also, I found this movie annoying. The dialog is pretty corny and nothing realistic.  What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film didn't exist before "House of Cards" and "The Soplemonos," it would have been far more enjoyable than an American film. Unfortunately, it has sadly turned into a very predictable and derivative version of the same material as "The Hangover" and the "Six Days" of the Hangover"(2).  I am still enjoying "The Six Days" and am pleased to see that they are being directed by a great but less competent film-director, David James, whose directing talent was well ahead of his time, but I would have rather chosen a different film to watch.  I have seen it twice already but I cannot afford to go on to watch it again. I wish to see some good films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a few good things in the movie. There's the decent and witty dialogs, but they're not what I expected. I expected better from a movie than I did. I didn't really like the ending. It felt like a bunch of really bad jokes, which I never laughed at. A plot line that drifts past too long to end didn't help me. The fact that a kid who got a gun in a gun store and had a lot of guns in a house wasn't a good movie. The characters are bad, and I think this movie might just be the same for all of us. I don't have the tapes or DVD tapes. I think it's time to move on from bad to bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are terrible, the editing and sound effects are bad and the editing is bad. You can feel sorry for it if you watch this film.  Overall, I rate this film as 4/10 or 7/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was it about? This is the movie that you want to go into. I liked it, but this was a huge disappointment. The acting is bad, and the acting is very predictable. I expected I could be killed anytime I want to be killed. Even if I'm going to meet a very good actor, it wasn't realistic to me that I could really be dead. I'm a big fan of TV shows and I really liked this one, but the movie isn't worth any money or effort to make. If you are a fan of television or film, maybe one of the shows from the early 70's, the 60's, or the late 1980's. Or maybe if you want a zombie movie, like the ones that were made for TV, for TV or for a film: The Zombie Apocalypse, "Dead End" and "Raptors." (Yes, you can read about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The American Way" is a bad American soap-themed movie. It's boring. You get all the plot and you get the worst actors. In the end you get nothing.  It's a pity, but I had to waste my time watching it.  I'll rate this movie as 1 out of 10, not the lowest 1.  There are some decent parts. A few funny parts. I thought there was a lot more comedy. The dialog is kind of boring. It has some funny moments, but the dialogue is just awful. The plot is also too predictable. I can't say that enough.  You really have to get the "American Way" in the bargain you can find. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand that the guy who made the movie had fun with the idea and he made it with no idea or inspiration.  I don't think it was an original idea, but it was all of the same sort of crappy, over-the-themed comedy that everyone else on this movie had. I feel like it just had too many of the show's usual pitfalls (like the fact that this show was designed to be "straight forward" and not really a comedy). In the meantime, I am looking for a good, real comedy that's a little less pretentious and fake, but lets me take it for granted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film that has apparently been made in the UK that makes the world feel a little bit less interesting. Even with two pretty young actors, the story is basically about a group of guys who just want to make it so that they can get laid and get dates. That sounds a bit worse than most movies made in America. The worst thing about this movie is that it's about the guys who can't do much but just want an opportunity to get laid. I mean, you're a guy? Are you really an animal? This movie is not supposed to be funny or interesting, it's just an awful film. There's some parts that get a little funny, and it takes you somewhere. However, if you're one of those guys who want to see a movie that isn't so bad, you should definitely avoid this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the most horrible film I've ever seen. It's just so bad! The storyline is bad. Just terrible. The dialog was bad. The acting was bad, the acting was stupid, and the dialogue and characters were simply bad. And there wasn't any funny moments. Just awful. I don't know how they got this in the DVD. The story is terrible. It is hard to follow the movie. I guess it was because they tried to hide the fact that it was about to be made for a lot of money. The only funny moments were when the other characters laughed in a movie: (1. the whole movie was about making money. 2. the other movies were bad.)  The story in itself is pretty much true. The characters are stupid and there are no real emotions whatsoever. The people aren't real characters. And the story is very disappointing. The ending is pretty stupid. I have to say, I can not recommend this movie.  I would highly recommend it for its sole purpose, which was to get a good review about an bad movie. If you want to watch this movie, then don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i'd like to say this film was garbage. i found it on video, but after watching it. i find the acting was bad, the story was predictable, and the characters were all annoying. In this film you have to listen to the soundtrack in the movie and expect to find your heart stabbed or you die at an early stage of the film. I don't know if it was supposed to be a comedy, or a movie for anyone, but the premise is just too bad, and it was hard to watch. The acting was awful, and I have to believe it is a huge mistake. It seems like one person doing everything wrong, because she made it.  I understand some people like this film, but if you like it, you should be able to see that it isn't even good at all. It is a shame to be so bad at a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie I was dismayed and angry. I was a bit shocked to see such a movie. It was just as awful as I expected. And I was even more so disappointed when I saw that I had to watch it again in order to endure. It's just one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I do not want it to ruin my life. This film is so bad that I can't even call it a family film.  I don't think my family really like it because it's so bad, but they were hoping to watch a sequel, just like their father did. It sucked because it was so bad. It also sucked because I didn't care if it was a sequel or not. I didnno matter how I thought. My brother's family should have been better than me. I donth mean a great big family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a very poor version of "The Matrix". What's wrong with this movie? The only way I could find a way to describe it is that it's full of awful dialog. The movie never ends, but it has the worst acting and the worst special effects I've seen. I really liked "The Force" and this movie just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the same as the first film version. In fact, I would go as far as calling it a bad '80's horror film. The old way of using an '80s' look to scare people into believing that nothing has ever been wrong in the history of their species to make a horror film and then terror them. The '80′ look doesn't seem to work with a modern look and the film's special effects are not up to date (even the '70′) when it comes to today's technology. They have to be in their place when they need to be scary (I'm not kidding, it is pretty scary when you start to look like a '60′ horror). If you are a horror fan and don't care for horror, please be careful of this horror flick. This movie needs to have a good director and a better script to make it better. This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen and I can see why it wasn't even made in the 70′s. This film was never released for the benefit of the great actors who have made it. The director did give two great performances but they didn't do anything to redeem this horror film (except for the great John Wayne's performance). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the most disappointing movie I have seen, which is the first thing I expected from the first episode. I know it's not the "bashing" family comedy it's supposed to be, but it would be easier to watch for one of the first time. It's pretty sad, with a very silly story line, and the rest of the plot never seems to make much sense. Some scenes are cute (I'd like to compare them with some of the Disney Channel movies of the nineties), but most of them are so contrived. A good movie doesn't necessarily look like it, but when it's in its third hour, it becomes boring and fails to do what it has promised. It really does help to watch this show for awhile, and it has some cute moments in its second hour, but if you look for a good family comedy, watch the Disney channel's Meg, Teen Cow, or Puck, or some of their previous shows. Avoid if you like a family sitcom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie since i was about 11. It is very bad. I can barely see half of this movie and the other half is barely worth the time. I do not like this movie, I cannot even watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as a result of my recent obsession with all things pertaining to "the Matrix". It seemed to me that all those things were just added to the very large pile of crap that this movie was about. I really wish I could have seen this movie for my money. I don't mean to be overly positive because I'm a nice guy, but it didn't come as close to being a "great" movie or even "great". The film seemed to be as shallow as it could get. The acting was bad as usual, and the special effects were bad as well. Most of the characters were stupid, and were supposed to be good. They were stupid and had no emotion whatsoever, just as the characters are supposed to have had. If anything, the characters could get away from the "Matrix" to the big set of "Matrix"-themed game. It wasn't even a decent film, but still looked better than many of the cheap "Matrix 1" films. It just doesn't matter if you like it or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not really a bad flick - as much as those of you who have already seen it will remember it as bad. It is rather bad because the movie is based on a ridiculous fantasy, an unbelievable excuse for a movie. This is also bad for the acting, for there's no effort to hide what the actors' are really doing and the dialog is terrible - if you don't understand the characters then you will get spoiled.  The only thing that has made this movie good is the acting - I'm not going to comment about the acting or the acting in this movie because those are not my words - the movie had some good moments, but unfortunately this movie has nothing in the end.  I really do not want to have this movie. I know why - for one, I'm an actor. For another, I don't have the heart for it - but if I could I would have been satisfied with this movie - what a horrible movie! It is also not good for the fact that it comes out. I hope the DVD edition will get released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to experience some of the more brutal aspects of the world that has been witnessed, then you'll get some thrill from the blood and gore that the movie has put to the film. But, if you want that, you'll suffer the disappointment and feel your blood boiling up.  The movie takes place in the 1980s, and there's no mention of what happened with the film when it was first released. The film is set in the fictitious land of Mexico, but the movie is clearly set in Los Angeles in some sort of dystopian future. This film fails for the simple reason that it's so hard to follow what has happened and what hasn't happened.  I watched the movie on my own computer and I had to put on special effects just to see it. The only thing I got from this movie was a sense of frustration in the viewer that the producers had chosen to "let us make it look good on the surface, and at least that's good for viewers.  In the end I did see the movie. And I was annoyed by it because it was bad. I don't even care if it was supposed to be a horror movie, but if it were made to be "funny" it is more likely to be the "sooner then you will find yourself dead".  This movie is absolutely bad! It fails in several places and could be truly traumatizing the viewer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say that this movie is extremely bad, but it is very entertaining. I'd even take my own money. I didn't know that this was not the end-of-the-year film for the year.  I can tell from seeing the film that it was supposed to be an amusing review of a bad film, but that would only be because the movie is so bad. It is hard to tell how it could have worked on the script and how it has worked on execution. In short, it is a bad, boring, but not particularly good movie. The only thing that makes it an example of bad movies is the fact that it is the only one that I can see in public, and the other 2 movies it was directed by other companies. It should never be released to the public, even if it was a "wackoff", but if it is, it should be played by every movie club that has any interest in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's always been a few good movies around, but this movie was a complete disappointment. Some of the best scenes in the game come in the sequel and I feel that the movie would have looked better if this movie had been a sequel. At least I've learned from the last movie that the best scene in the movie is when the pilot gets hit by a meteor blast. It is a really stupid scene that I wish they had remembered and got rid of it. This movie is only good at two parts. If you're looking to get some serious entertainment, don't do this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad, disappointing movie. And there are plenty of funny parts that could have been used in the end. But none of the humor made for a laugh. The film is so stupid that it's really hard to understand the plot without the fact that there are two other guys with the same name. The script is also terrible, with too many unnecessary jokes that don't take place. I was hoping to enjoy this movie because there is nothing to say for an hour, and I tried to convince myself that it was funny, but that was never going to happen.  A few funny moments, though, like the line that pops up after the first scene. The ending isn't very funny, in fact, it really doesn't make much sense. There are few funny jokes, though. Overall, the movie could be saved from the time that we are having. I'm not going to watch this again, but if I did, I would probably just watch it to the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this for my first time of seeing this film. I was really annoyed by it and I wasn't pleased with it, but it was too fun to watch. I laughed at the bad jokes that were made about the main character. It wasn't funny enough to make it funny. I am still not sure if this was a Japanese film or a Japanese movie because it's just plain awful. It seems to have gotten the word "mock" from the beginning, and has a bad ending. I'm not sure who made it, it was made in Japan or the Japanese, and the ending doesn't work. It should be remembered as an awful movie that had nothing to do with me and my love of video games. I don't think it will ever work to bring anyone down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few things that have brought me to this, but most are merely the same as what I wrote. I've even gone to school, in a school that had some of the same people that made this movie. A lot of them were good, and some were bad. Even worse were the people who made it, especially the actor who made this. He just can't get any actors in to direct, he is bad, and he plays nothing good. The movie was made by a bunch of guys who made movies with their friends in their own way, with their own vision of cinema. They did the same thing for a while, and then made some other movies. They thought this movie would be good for them. Then they made it.  The most obvious thing was the idea of the girl who is in love with her mother.  You would think she was in some sort of trance, as she sits on the porch looking at the sun. But no, it turns out that she's been in an abusive relationship, and the movie shows her as if she's in love like she's crazy for her mother, as if love is what it is, she's sick, and she's having to go back to the house and she doesn't want to go and she has to go.  I mean, that's all it's got to be. She should be in a love marriage, like the girl in love in the show. Or they could get her married to him, like his friends who have the money to rent the house they'll rent for her and that's what they do. Then, the girl comes to the show and the actor is there, and says "what about my mother?"  They decide to rent a house for the girl to rent it and the girl doesn't go with it, and that is a major disaster. She doesn't do anything with the boy, and her husband finds a job that would be better than his. So she comes up with him and he asks the landlord for a place to rent for him to rent. She puts a new address to the landlord and he agrees to rent, but then he says something bad about the landlord.  How was the movie made?   The next thing I want to do is say the same things they did in this movie: the characters acted as if they were in love. The characters act as if a couple of losers who didn't care about the people they're talking about,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script was good, the cast was good and the scenery and lighting had some good moments but it's too contrived. They are all good actors and they were good with the actors but it takes no real effort to make good scenes in the story, like there is in the other versions.  There are some decent performances by actors like Kaley and Lee and even some acting by the girls who are both girls and dummies. But I think it is pretty hard to watch these girls because they have never been portrayed as the acting type, like they were in "Tallysend" for example.  Also the acting is pretty low and poor. I have read some commentaries of some other versions of the show but I'm afraid the ones I've read didn't make the difference, it just seems like they're just copy and paste of some of the old episodes.  I don't think this is a bad show. I donno see it as a bad, but I think the way that they choose to do things with it is a weak thing in the effort of making a good story about a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    i got into the film and found that it was very boring, and not really funny. I thought it was just a waste of time and money to waste. I hope they make a decent sequel soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie because it was so interesting in the first half of the movie. However it's not very good at all. They were totally messed up. The main female lead (Sheena's wife) is always annoying and annoying. I was really hoping the movie would finish out like the one from "Big Fuzzy Bear". This movie ended up being a mess of many parts, all over the top and some of the best acting I've seen since "Rice Goulploy" (I think the best actors in this movie were those in that movie). The worst acting is when you get on the plane with some girls who are having too much fun to film. There were other parts that were funny at times, but they aren't nearly as funny when you see them. You are going to miss all of the characters because you realize that there isn't enough time to catch them. There wasn't enough comedy in the movie and there was no funny jokes after. I know what the movie could have been before it was released. I guess the director wanted to make this movie, but I don't think they have a genius and have done a good job.    There were some good laughs in the beginning of the film but you are just waiting for them. When the movie finished, I was extremely unhappy. The acting was awful. I don and say I'm sorry, but it was too long to be happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film which was to be in some ways entertaining at the beginning, but was the most awful sequel of the last decade. Although I had the impression that the plot was somewhat funny, I thought this film would have made more of a case of bad film than most "entertainment" films. The film is not at all entertaining. I am sorry, this movie just sucks off a lot of money - so it is a waste of money. It does make money for a second time, so if you have a couple of weeks left to catch up on it, but don't waste it if you can't afford to go through the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a pity... a bad sequel.I had to really pay attention to this! I mean a sequel for nothing,and when I read this it is an action movie - the story is about a single house with a man (who is a drug addict).the character who is played by a guy that looks like a kid... and I guess that looks very similar to a guy who looks like kid. And the woman looks like her wife - oh, and she has a "happy ending" and the guy dies at a nightclub... and the acting is bad. The film is so stupid that it didn't make it any more fun to watch! I don't even recommend it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Living Room" is about a bunch of people who keep their heads on a wall, and people who sit in their seats and listen to music on a loop. When a man loses his head and his brother goes in the same room as him, he talks to a man who was formerly homeless and asks if he can get a new job. In the meantime, he tells a woman that he's having problems with the boss, and she buys him a new house. But because the man's name is on the same wall, she forgets about her own room and spends the night trying to find a new man to rent his room.  When she turns in on him, she is attacked by a man she's never met in real life. The scene is pretty ridiculous and very contrived, especially if you decide to see this movie. In addition, the characters are really poorly developed, with no real motivation and no obvious motivation, and the actors aren't good actors. It's a very bad movie that shouldn't have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure I don't have to ask, but it's probably the second. A really lame film which focuses too far on the acting and just not enough to engage the audience. The plot isn't all that great, and the characters are all uninspired, or just plain stupid. Some of the dialog is interesting, and some of the camera-work isn't that good, but overall the film is nothing to write home about. The soundtrack is also quite bad. If you decide to rent this movie, don't even buy it, and save yourself, as I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The thing has been so boring with the animation so much that it was annoying. The whole thing was awful! It's just two guys walking away from the woods...and then they're walking through the woods. It is just the same as the first one...with the same animation, same dialog, same voice, same lines, same scenes, same all-round scenes, and so on...the same old scenes.  You get bored watching the whole thing and then get bored again, just by walking away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen many of the people I have worked with say the same thing to me. The acting in the film is so bad that you are crying and shaking in the middle of a shower. The way the film plays out, and the way the story is told without really understanding it, leave you wondering what the hell it is. This movie could have been a really good film but unfortunately, it is a horrible and completely lacking in any substance. The whole thing is completely pointless and it just doesn't make sense. I don't think you can really call this a "film". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is bad, and the music doesn't matter either for the acting. this movie was supposed to be a musical musical adventure movie, but this is an absurdist, silly excuse for a musical adventure! and the director couldn't have any idea! and this movie fails to make any point of entertainment at all, which is what you do with a musical comedy! I guess it was because the director got bored, because they were using their own musical special effects. But still, I'm still hoping for something good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although the good moments in the movie make it a fun viewing experience, I still cannot find any of it worth any consideration. In the other hand, there is also a tendency to make the movie less interesting by trying to "play" on its central idea.  For example, the film includes a lot of bizarre dialog lines with one person talking about a "jizz-jacking horse" as if to "talk about sexual harassment" with the "jazzoo". I'm sure you could imagine this if you had read the movie.  The movie also features a disturbing scene involving the girl who is having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Unfortunately, this is one of many scenes of the film, and I am unable to find out what it is about without some thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you enjoy the "Lord of the Dead" series, you will enjoy this movie. If you've never seen the series, it won't be a shock to see the director's fingerprints here. He tried to shoehorn the ending in a very clever way, but the ending is too predictable and unnecessary. I'd take this off if the first 10 minutes of the movie were even half interesting. Also, the movie is boring and the acting is bad, and some of the dialog is very uncharacteristic. I'm sure there are some people who would like to see some gore scenes. But I don't think these are typical people.  It just does not seem like a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good movie in this movie was the one featuring the young and beautiful Nanae Nain. A sad twist to this movie, and a truly pathetic movie. I'm only a fan of the first movie, so I'll never recommend this movie. But i'll just add my 2 cents. If you want to rent this film, you'll need a lot of money, and also watch a TV broadcast broadcast. This movie is very stupid, and it's not funny at all. It has not one redeeming feature, nor does it even bother to enjoy. It would be nice to see Nanaa Nain in a movie, but unfortunately, there is a whole load of awful characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the people at Disney studios should be careful. It is not a good movie. The acting was awful and the acting was poor. I don't think that you could find any redeeming factor in this film. The fact that the movie features a female cast is the worst thing of all. It doesn't seem like there was a lot of female characters in the story. It should be a man who gets a house with a housewife, and a manager for a grocery store. That's all we know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first noticed this film in the first video review of it in early 2005.  It was bad and I liked it and thought it would make for a good movie. In fact it was really bad and the story of the movie was so bad that I decided to stop watching it.  This movie is actually pretty well done by what I considered a low-budget movie of no real money. The plot is poor, the dialog is poor and the movie itself fails to make any sort of sense.  There are two plot lines, with a couple of cute little lines and a bunch of totally ridiculous scenes. The first is a flashback where the main character talks with a prostitute. After he sees her, he goes on a date with her and then takes her to a place of where he then takes money for her and he's never seen again. That doesn't really make any sense. Then there's a scene in a bar where she tells her boyfriend that she has seen him, that she thinks he's got drunk and he is trying to get her into his hotel. When she is in the hotel, the taxi driver drives up and tries to get into his car but she doesn't know. She drives away, leaving her in the taxi as he gets in his car. When he arrives at her house he is very disturbed and she takes a good bath with him.  Once he's in the house, she begins to think he's coming to get together with her. He gets into the room and it turns into an affair. The sex is much less exciting then the previous scene. The best part of this film is when he gets a huge chunk of money from a large gangster who has several million dollars in his pockets. But the rest of it is just a bunch and a very annoying storyline about a guy who wants to get drunk, get money, and screw with her friends.  The worst part about this film are the acting. The acting was not good, mostly because the acting was the same between the two main actors. The other bad part about the film was that it seems like it was the writer's idea of having the main cast all act in every scene. They were actually trying to make this movie look good and the fact that the movie is so short-shored out with no dialogue, with no real direction, or plot, didn't really help it. It's like one of the goofs of that "fancy" acting style. The actor in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why I saw this movie. I mean it's not even a bad horror film at all, but the plot is really bad, the acting is terrible, and the acting of the characters is poor. I like movies that are not predictable, that have some of the most interesting character actors on the planet. I donut wanna be a good horror movie for me. this is a complete disaster of an effort. i recommend watching it in the third grade (not for those who are scared of the movie). The story is not even interesting, and there are a few scenes that should have some sort of suspense about the events. I could see more suspense in a story that is not scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this film when it was first released as it was one of the most stupid films ever made. The acting was bad, the plot was awful and the soundtrack was no good. It wasn't until I was in my 30s that I was able to finally watch this film that I realized how terrible it was. Since then, I have only seen it twice but the only thing I could compare it to is "Wicked"! What a waste of money, nothing good to say. The only good thing about the film was a good cast of actors. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be able to call it "awful" but what about as a film? It is like watching "Unforgettable".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to have a good movie: I like it! It's not quite as funny as I thought it was when I first saw it. The acting is very bad, the editing is bad, and the sound is just bad. But the story is OK! It is a sequel. It is not an amusing story, nor a stupid one. It should not be used to generate laughter. But at the same time, if you think that watching this movie is hilarious, you may do so. If you want to have some funny movie, this might just be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a good movie to watch and think that it's great, then you'll be disappointed. I watched the movie because I am a die-hard horror fan (I've seen this movie over 10 times, but only once was it actually good) and it was so bad that I didn't bother watching it. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 and the only reason I can give it that score is because it is so bad.   The most disappointing horror movie I ever made. If you want a horror movie, you will need a copy of "G-UEN!" which is a great horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even begin to understand the thought-that a guy would expect a movie to take the seriously. This movie is not worth watching, it's boring. I didn't even like the end of the movie, i was sick to go through the ending. I think that the acting was poor, but the plot is very predictable and not that interesting. Some parts were interesting, but most of the time it was simply the same scene repeated in a couple of scenes. I also felt that the music was bad and the soundtrack was just plain bad. I thought the movie could have been much better. It is one of the worst I've ever seen and I didnno want to recommend it to anyone.  The next one I will recommend is this "Cauterita", a movie which does well to fill in that role. I found the movie very annoying, the ending was predictable, and the acting in the film was weak. I give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best parts of this movie were the people who were supposed to be working with it; those who seemed to be having fun. But there was nothing at all to enjoy about it. It's very disturbing, and I don't expect anyone who has never laughed in a movie to enjoy this one. This movie starts off with a great premise, but as soon as it becomes something more interesting, it's hard to watch (even with a decent soundtrack). That's my point of it.  The main storyline is about a man who has a girlfriend named Amanda who was in a car accident that leads to him getting drunk from his alcoholic girlfriend. I wasn't impressed, because the story is very boring and not in the least interesting. It does not lend itself as a funny movie, but that can't be said for much worse than it was. The only funny thing about this movie was the end. The girl is supposed to get involved in an interesting situation with her boyfriend, who turns out to be drunk, and he goes off to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know who else this guy is in this video. This movie doesn't have a decent ending. There's no climax, and there's too many scenes. It is a mess that it doesn't end, and the ending seems to be forced on the viewer.  There's nothing good about this movie, and a lot of bad material is thrown in. This must be the worst movie that ever made. It could also be my favorite of all time, and it's just the worst version of "Twins" since 'One Shot' (2000). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this film has made it to the top of the heap as an American film.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I could even think of what it is about except the bizarre casting of the main actors. Some of the scenes were funny, but other scenes were pretty lame. As for the plot, I think it is bad, although this might be a fairly good way to amuse myself as someone who watches "Jeopardy" (with Richard Dawson and Derya Waller), since they are all similar to each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised that this movie, with a good acting, had an 8.5 score. But there are some flaws here. The story isn't too important and the end wasn't suspenseful, but the end has nothing to do with the film itself.  The story is pretty simplistic, and the ending is bad. I know I'm probably one person that believes the whole story is actually a dream or a nightmare, but it's not. If you like a fantasy film, that's fine, but this doesn't mean that you can't enjoy it.  There is no suspense in the story or the ending. Just at the end, the characters are killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate seeing this movie. It's so bad it breaks me up, especially since I'm already sick from a bad film:  There's so many pointless plot points and the storyline is so annoying and the whole thing just falls apart in the middle. I was so bored and it just gave me a laugh. The worst part is when it shows a person killing someone. I don't even have to know if it was just a movie or a tv show. I guess it was like they make movies like this one everyday, where it just has a very bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard any of these actors before. But now I'm reading all the comments, so I've seen the reviews that the show is based on. They're really awful.   There's the whole family on their farm. It's not an interesting family. There's no animals on the farm. In the middle of a picture, we see the farmer, his wife, the farmer's son, and the mother. They are all in a row, so you can't tell what their lives are.  This movie is terrible. The movie should have been banned. It is stupid to expect a farm farmer to act like a farmer, and that's not a farm-related comedy, but it is a pathetic excuse for a movie.  There should have also been some decent dialogs in the film. One line in the story says:  He tells the farmer that he wants to go home to the town to get a wife, so he stops and buys a motorcycle.  I wonder what the hell the guy is thinking in the middle line, but, the dialog is so terrible, I'm not even interested.  In the end, I'd be surprised if a movie like this made it to the bottom of the most-reviewed list of all American comedies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one is a poorly done piece of junk. The camera is pretty bad and the acting is bad. It looks good on paper, but it doesn't so on screen. I don't know what the plot is. In any of the books there are magic words that can only be invented or used a few times a year. I want to read the books and the movies I read to find out what these books are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this movie? No one who has any sense of the movie world is allowed to see this movie. Its an utter disaster, what it has gotten into. The premise is to paint a bleak picture of a lost world, with no hope for humanity. It's nothing but an anti-narrion film in which nobody gives a thought to what is the situation in the world, and is so bad that people have to try to convince others that it's OK to do so.  I was surprised that no one is actually listening to this film, but at the end of the review I still cannot understand it, because I'm not a pessimist. I give this movie 2/10. I just wish this movie to go straight downhill and die. The only redeeming thing about this film is that I liked "Kiss" but didn't care for it and still wanted to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would never recommend this film to anyone. I can never understand why a movie would be considered "good" at this point. I think it needs to be recharged. This is a bad film, and there is no redeeming features here, not even in the first 60 minutes. The whole thing is a plot of a typical type of horror film and is so badly directed that even the first 30 minutes of it has a hard time acting like a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading a plot synopsis for this movie when I was watching this one and I didn't even look at the plot before watching it. I didn'miss' that one which I couldn't even read the last part, so I just turned the movie off and gave it to the screen. And even I didn' find the story after reading the plot synopsis. It would take a long time and a lot of the movie could have been ruined by it.  There are many things in this movie that aren't to be taken as seriously as you'd expect a story to have been. But I just can't justify this one. It just feels like a piece of nonsense. It has some of the characters who I liked watching, but not enough of the other characters. And I just hope it doesn't turn into some kind of soap opera like The Piano.  I hope this movie will eventually fail, because it's really not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm getting to the point that this film needs to be put out in a different way. This is so bad and bad. My opinion is that the director should be removed from the movie, and the film should be deleted. The film is so thin that there should be no film that has the ability to inspire any good feeling. In the film, there are no funny moments. It is one movie, not a film about a movie, so I cannot recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was terrible, the story was bad, the acting was bad. There wasn't anything to say. It was basically the same as "Silent Heart" except that this movie had no decent girls. There are some decent bits, such as the music in the beginning. But, as it comes, it gets worse. By the end I was laughing, wishing I could have gotten something better. I just didn't care about the people who laughed and who got killed. I knew the main goal of the movie was to have me falling in love with the hero, but it's hard to make me do that. I didn't even get the satisfaction of wanting to go back to the movie.  There was absolutely no closure. The ending was pretty much like a little "draminated dream", but it wasn't the same way and it made me want to go on and write my own review about it. That's what makes me sad. I wanted to say the story had some interesting and I was surprised that I couldn't find anything good about it, but I thought the movie had a lot of really bad moments. I don't know if it had any significance or if it was a parody, but after watching it I still feel the movie could be used as an example of bad moviemaking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no real way to tell this movie isn't a true documentary (if you want to see it) but I'm sure it's better than the "American" version. If you watch it without knowing anything about how it actually depicts events, it's the worst thing a documentary I've seen. The ending could've been much less scary than some of the earlier films. I don't think it was meant to be scary, but there is absolutely no suspense at all (the ending had me thinking my father had to be dead!).  The plot was terrible, as usual. Most of the movie consisted of a few small parts. The one that got my attention was the one where the woman talks with a man in the crowd who has a large gun (they were both carrying and shooting at each other). I had to stop the film before I finally stopped watching it.  Also, the acting was awful. The male actor seemed to want to be James Bond, the female actors weren't very well-known and even the male actor had a better name than the girl. The female characters were extremely unsympathetic, the women seemed to be just sad people. I did, however, enjoy the supporting roles. A lot of the acting is good and some of them are funny. There wasn't any character development. It's just like you'd think that everyone on the show had a really deep and emotional bond that couldn't be seen.  The acting could never be done right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is very bad.  It's very easy to dislike a movie, but it isn't anything that can be enjoyed, not really. I was very upset watching it, so I was hoping that the plot would have been good by the writer.  This film wasn't good, not in the sense that there was a lot to like it or that the ending made me laugh. I had a sense of the plot that was a plotless, and it was obvious to expect that they would make it so that people would laugh at how bad it was. I did not want to see the ending, because it would make the film much more depressing and depressing. I just wanted to see a plot, some decent dialog, and some action. The other problem with the story is that the actors were so bad they didn't even want to be in this film. There were no good actors. There was no good dialogue or performances.  The acting was bad, as usual, but there were some good parts that could have been made. The acting is so bad that there were no way to have too much drama.  Overall, I don't think this movie was intended to be a comedy. It really is just a complete garbage-bag filler piece with a big fat "I'm not sure about whether I like it, but I'll look for some good movies that I think we can get into. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a couple of days in the movie I was still not convinced. The story and the characters were not very interesting for me to find the story and character that would actually make me interested. The acting and dialog were too bland and didn't go any deeper. I didn't mind too much because I liked the actors. The movie was not that bad. It's really a waste of time, time and money to watch it, but I did see it as it was just two hours of nothing. You could have watched it in the film class if you had. There are many other good movie's out there like "The Ostermoth of Time" and "The Legend of Merlin". But this is a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an unmitigated horror that is a complete failure of all of the gore, gore, and blood that you can really feel at its core. If you like gore, blood, and the occult then go into this movie and get a freebie, because they won't kill your girlfriend and run out with you, go ahead. Don't buy it if you like what it does, but don't take it seriously if you do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen some of this movie because I was sick of all the crappy movies that these guys are making. The plot is very shallow and I wish they were a better actor. It's an awful movie and I just find myself wishing they were making it. I was expecting something better than the horrible, cheap Hollywood movies that have so much crap for them.  So, I finally decided to get this one off. I got a good movie to watch. I even ended up spending $10 to buy it. But even after watching it I still find it incredibly sad to see this guy at the end. I can't say anything nice about it but if they made a good film they should get nominated for a award. But that's about all they really have to be nominated for. They just need to make a good horror movie about how lousy it gets. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has an average runtime, but I'm very careful with it. You get into an hour and 45 minutes with no resolution, plot and character development. In short, the movie is the opposite of a classic 'hero's revenge'. This movie is absolutely awful. It's basically a "plot, but not the plot" movie. The movie is nothing interesting and the acting is so poor that it's laughable. I'm disappointed that I had even read this book (by the person that wrote it) because it was so bad! I gave my all of my books out of this movie, but, it's pretty hard to make sense of it without reading the book. I understand some of the points that I've cited in the book, but please tell me again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible film, especially when it is supposed to be about a family, and I think the writers should be ashamed of the movie. I had a really good time and laughed at it, but the plot is really stupid and the characters are the weakest of the bunch. The whole movie had one, but other movies have much better lines. If you're a fan of this movie, don't watch it. If something like this happened to a teenager in the late 70s, the person would be killed. If the movie becomes popular, its people who will never be happy to go through life again. They will soon lose their precious time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie two stars. the first star is the first director and the second one is the main bad movie actor. the director is one of a small list and his name may be unfamiliar to those who have never heard of him, but he is not the first film director and he has never played more than one line of bad music since.  I am a movie buff, and I'm not interested in "discovering" this movie, but the writer of this movie is probably a genius. He is not able to create great music or films with a bad idea, but I cannot find any good reason to have seen this movie. I tried to watch this movie because I liked the original (the one) and that was my first video. Unfortunately I ended up getting so depressed I didn't even see the movie again. I'll probably try to watch another movie but I doubt that this one will be better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know this is not an extreme criticism but it might be. But the general message isn't that good. I am sure this is a fairly typical movie for me and I do not care how many times i watched it.  There is nothing at all. Just a few random lines here and there. I think this might be one of the worst movies for me. I did really enjoy a movie called "The Adventures of Dr. Zebro (The Adventures)". My bad movie is one of those so I do think if you liked that movie then please check this one. But don't waste your time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the original on Amazon and this is my worst review. The story is interesting enough, but when watching it I was annoyed by the lack of action sequences and the plot was really poor. The scene in the first movie was so disappointing and I found myself wondering why they were taking it.  In this movie, I thought the "Mimi" was the main attraction, the young girl was the most interesting character, but the character who appears in the beginning was the worst. If you liked Mimi and the family, you will not find a single thing to relate to the story in this film and you can understand the rest of the film.  It's hard to believe a movie has that many problems and then you get the ending.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked it, but the plot and story are the main reason to get me interested in this movie. And they never delivered an exciting story. But it's too short and doesn't give any suspense. A couple of scenes at the end of the movie are quite good, but it's just a disappointment. I don't know what a person that actually works in acting can do if they are never told the story, but if you don't have that background knowledge on the acting front, you'll never get to know a person who's acting like that person.  I wish someone in the theatre told a lot of interesting and funny stories, but there are not enough movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two problems here that I can see in the beginning. The first one being, it is a movie that contains the first half of the series in a movie without a hint of suspense, which I can easily find no clues to this movie.  Another problem was not seeing the other half of this series (with another one coming next year), which is a show that is nothing but a bunch of boring and unimpressive characters. The second issue is not a lack of suspense but rather a lack as well. The movies and the plots are interesting and well written but the characters are poor and the movie itself is not good. In the end, I really do not understand what these people did with their life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an extremely bad piece of work. I'm a fan of classic movies, but it's just a bad script with bad direction and some of the best cinematography. There are so many bad aspects of this film. Don't watch this unless you want to be sick. I could probably have been a little sick with my jaw, but that's not enough to make me like it. I just don't think it could have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised by how my friends had enjoyed the movie, particularly the ones who had given the movie a chance of their life. Now I'm the same person who was in my first reaction to the movie. It was absolutely disappointing! In the last 30 seconds of the movie the girls who we know are going to be playing were going to show themselves as pretty good players and we don't know the reason why they would have played such a small role as they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie, and I think I am surprised at the awful ratings. I don't mind to admit that it's a piece of trash, but I don' ugge it. I give my rating, 0.25 out of 10. I'm just plain sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't think this movie made it's own. There is absolutely no story line to this movie. This movie could have been so great if it had one good story line. I mean we could have had a good story to the story line, but it didn't. This is a complete disappointment. The movie has one of the worst plot lines. A couple of these stories are the plotlines of the previous films. It just got a little long, which is annoying. But then I think the actor didn't understand that they were making a movie about a story line from a story. A little bit of the acting is OK, but not at the level it's used in. In the end, I think there was no story to this film. There should have been a better story line than what they did in the previous two films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a good opening scene, and the beginning has a few holes. I'm not sure how this movie could be redeemed. This movie could also be an action film. I can't believe that people who were willing to spend their time watching this movie to earn money somehow ended up making it a worthwhile movie.  The ending doesn't work for me, the way it is presented makes it very uncomfortable to watch. The way the film was presented was so poor that it is no longer funny or entertaining. The direction is so bad it was uncomfortable it could break apart like an old bad movie. This would have been a funny film but not a worthwhile film. The story is not realistic. I cannot find the funny or the entertaining side. The characters are not the heroes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to see a funny film but I wasn't disappointed. What was wrong? The story is simply boring and there's not even enough plot to make you understand who the lead is. And the ending is just annoying and disappointing.   This is not funny and it really made me feel like I was an idiot and I can't take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So it is a movie which doesn't even have a decent plot. There are several things which seem to be connected to the plot, but none of them seem to make sense. But that's not enough for a movie to be enjoyable. In a movie made by one of the many fake movie makers, the plot and plot are actually based on the real world, and I can't even figure out what was happening in the real World. So, as I read the book, it seems like they are made out of one big room full of mirrors. Also, the voice is not good, or bad at all. I just think that these people just couldn't get up for a script that has nothing to do with the real life. But what is more troubling is that the people in the book do the opposite as well. There's an odd ending that is very long and there's no time for things to happen. The ending is the most disappointing of a book made by an original writer (I read this book in a high school English class, and he was so terrible that he needed a book like this to be a decent novel for his students), and the book is even worse than a movie. There isn't even any suspense. There aren't any really dramatic endings and the whole book ends around the same time. The end doesn't follow much up with the book and the movie. It is hard to even find out who the ending was. I did eventually find the story of the book to be interesting, though. It's really not a good movie. I don't know if the book writer is responsible for writing it, but I don`t know how he thinks about it. The book is full of bad jokes and pointless dialog.  So I'll keep looking for some good movie or video, and will see if they make any good points. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to rent this movie to watch for the first time and decided to rent again after my first watch was canceled. The movie takes a few years to get started and I really didn't want to watch it again. There are not much funny moments. I felt the script was an insult to the people who saw it. I don't think this was a movie directed by one of the writers, or the producer of this film. I think the director had no clue how to make this movie. The actors who appear in this movie, were not good actors. The soundtrack was horrible and the music was very bad. The cast were terrible too, especially when the band were in it. They were like a comedy band. I thought the movie was about a parody, but I really thought it would have been better if it were about a comedy song. If you're a fan of a bad comedy, watch this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for about 2 minutes and decided it was terrible, I'm a guy with a kid, I had to think. I'm not a big fan of this movie, but I'm going to say that for all reasons.  It's not realistic and the actors and music are not believable, but if you just like a fun, cheesy, action movie this one is the worst of them all.  The plot is absolutely horrible, the music is bad, and I'd prefer a sequel instead. I just saw some people who actually enjoyed the movie.  I've given this movie 2/10 because I think that would be honest. It's just not a good movie. The ending is the best ending in movie history, with a really bad ending and awful ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first 10 minutes of this movie, and I thought it was really bad. When I was ready to watch the last 10 minutes, I couldn't. They were way too boring and were not at all funny. I was hoping that they were more like the original (My Name Is Jack) but it wasn't.  This movie was bad and awful, and not worth watching. If you have a large spare room to rent, or even rent out for one night, or if you rent this one, don't even rent it for a single night, and just look at this movie to get something.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would just like to point out that this movie is terrible. There are lots of good reasons why this movie has not been released - this movie had some great acting (I think the best acting was in this movie.) Also, there are some things in the story that are disturbing (like the ending.) I find it disappointing that Hollywood has been so stupid as to want to be original with their movies. I know it is hard to believe that this is a good movie, and I think it probably hasn't been that good - it was so bad it was hard to watch. The storyline was so stupid - it's really hard to understand and I'm scared to have to pay attention to it. The ending is not all bad - it is just a huge chunk of junk.  I really don't think it was necessary to watch it - I think this movie really needs to be taken as seriously as it deserves to be. The movie doesn't work because it has too many clichs. The film is terrible, and it just isn't smart enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An un-realistic portrayal of the love and the courage of a former slave, the film has not seen the light to make this movie more interesting. The way the women are portrayed and the story seems as if it had been done in a real life movie.  There are some nice scenes from the beginning to the end but overall the film is a waste of time. The film had a decent story line but not much in the end. There is not a clear line and it seemed like the viewer was left wanting to see more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Might of God" is a pretty bad film. It was the worst version of "The Bodyguard," but I thought that at least it didn't have the usual "gentlemen of good old British England" twist. In any case, this is a complete lack of any redeeming qualities. The story is so poor that it was only slightly amusing. The actors (I particularly liked Michael Caine) are simply bad. The acting is so badly done that you just want to get the movie out of the hands and into the air. It seems like some teenagers are learning the lesson that they need to make it through the entire movie, so they try to act in their own way. But the ending is fairly funny, though not funny enough to merit the rating. What else? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard of such a movie before. There is no explanation. This movie is just pathetic. It is just a waste of time. There's no real plot. This is just boring, no suspense, no story. It doesn't take the time to get to a full story, and it is pointless to try to figure out what happens, especially when the movie begins and you have to follow along. The movie is only so bad it is scary to the first person to try and do something like this. There aren't enough endings. There also needs to be something better to look at. This whole movie should be a real effort to stop people from looking for the truth. It's not that hard to get your money back, but it's a lot of money, and there aren't many good movies like this, either.  There are also a couple of good parts in this movie. I like the dialog. Some of the dialog in the movie is good, and some is bad, and the acting in the movies are not so good. I'd give this movie a 7 out of 10 if it was the first one and hadn't already been so beaten up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand a bit of why this movie was written but this is a bit disappointing. I guess the writer was just bored by the idea of making a movie to kill the monster, even though he has used the monster before so many times, and it could happen again. Even with a new storyline and some decent acting, the acting wasn't that great. I also feel that the story was poorly written. The story is so bad that you can't even really figure out what's happening. Even some of the acting isn't that good.  What makes the movie worse is that the people in the movie don't really act well either, and the characters are so stupid that even I didn't care if the movie worked, and that the characters were in dire need of redemption. The plot is so poorly written that it is hard to follow in and out. The characters are simply the people we had never seen before and they are so annoying that I'm not even sure if they were supposed to be characters.  Don't expect a great, though, because I'm sure this is better than a bad, action movie, which is also pretty good. I have some hope that the author will make a sequel and it's a good movie. But, in the end, this movie is just a bad piece of work and I think I cannot enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disturbing thing in this movie is the fact that this movie had been produced after the release of "The Fugitive". That movie never existed and, of course, it never really did. And, if you were a fan of "Gungi" and "Goro", this would have been funny but not as good as the new film, which is a very stupid action movie. I've seen better versions of these movies and I didn't think they could have been worse. This movie was not only bad, but it's just plain boring! The acting is bad, the dialog is stupid, the cinematography is bad (if that were the case at all) and the story is badly constructed!  What really matters is this: a big fish goes on about getting caught by a giant flying pig and taking his place and killing a giant squid in order to get out of the way.  But it's not a perfect movie, and, for a movie about the future, it's too boring to be good, so it just doesn't work. I'm not sure if this movie was done in response to the outcry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very annoyed at how the plot was. I couldn't figure out what it was about until I watched the entire series of episodes. The plot is not that bad, it was the acting that got me off. However, I really was unhappy with the ending. The story becomes convoluted and pretentious. It's annoying. The ending could have been so funny had they had a person in the character's life that was actually funny.  If you're a movie enthusiast, maybe watch this for a moment, but do NOT watch this! It's just an ordinary and stupid, pointless plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the other section of the movie there is a "scavened" sequence which the kids are sitting through the movie. There is no indication of this during the scene. It seems as if the kids were put in the middle of the action while the adults are waiting for the car to drive off. There are other things going on which are not in the film. This movie should have been a lot more entertaining than what it actually was. It doesn't have any plot or drama. In fact there was nothing that was even remotely funny except the ending. The movie could barely contain any dialog. The ending also does not stick with the ending of the previous movie which made this movie an especially bad.  This movie is a big loser as well as the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this review from the movie, and it seemed to have been written about me or someone else.  I did read the movie online because I was interested in other film of the same movie, but I cannot even find the movie on its own. I am afraid it will never be shown again.  The only good thing in this movie was the little good bit of "funny" acting. Not even a person to laugh, let alone laugh at the joke. I think this movie should be taken to the grave by the people who made it, and that's about all you need. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it's not a comedy, it has nothing to do with the plot. This movie just repeats the same story twice and the plot is just rubbish. I found this movie a bit annoying since I usually enjoy some of them and some of those movies were great. But this movie is a complete fail and I'd like to warn you so you can try it without the guarantee that you won't enjoy it.  The ending is so unbelievable that I could not understand why the writers thought it was a good movie. You will never find the end. There are some very good parts, but overall the movie is not good. There's too many wasted of fake "graphic" and unrealistic shots and special effects. I don't even recommend this movie because of its ending but I would recommend it if you are expecting a fun film, but only if you're expecting something really entertaining. The acting is bad, I couldn't find it anywhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am having trouble coming back from this movie. I am going to start asking questions. I would just watch and wait for it to stop. I don't like the concept of a movie that is so bad. You know how much I have been disappointed by "The Matrix" and that's how I feel. I think this movie is so predictable it is unbelievable that it was such a success. I mean, what did the guy do? I think it was just an excuse for a crappy movie to get me interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was bad, but it was good at times. I couldn't believe it to be a 'feature film' at all. I'm not a movie buff, but I'd never played video games before, so if it were me, it would be very difficult to start. But, it was well acted, it's probably an enjoyable way to kill a few zombies.  I don't know if it was directed by the same guy who directed the original "Hollywood Black-Schmidt" film, but if it is, I would like to see it back together for all the scenes. It would then require more effort to complete, and more time to find the proper ending. Also, the fact that it is in a movie is a big distraction.  If you liked the first movie, the plot is pretty straightforward. Nothing is too much, and there are no good dialogs or 'nice' scenes. There are no real emotional scenes, no good real dialogue, and no'real' horror scenes. The characters and characters are just plain unemotional and pointless. You have to get bored and just be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been happier with the kind of film that I can easily sit and watch. The story is horrible and the action is not strong. It just a horrible, self-indulgent horror film.  It should get some work done in the next step so it can be turned into a real horror movie. Don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a very serious fan of the great late 70's films.  The first thing about this movie was the lack of a decent acting actors. They were all over-acting and just flat out boring. The acting was good only for the fact that the guys were not as awful as those on other films. It was pretty unbelievable that people could expect this film.  There is not even an excuse for this film, it's just not funny, it has no comedy. I'm surprised that the title of the film was "The Wildest Villains!" It seemed so stupid. I would not recommend this movie, but my opinion on this movie is not based on anything that happened in the real world. I didn't even like the movie, and I found the soundtrack a bit dull, as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating is about 1/2, but I do rate it about 2. It is an action-comedy about a family of drunken drunks who get involved in the world's lottery. Everything else is a mix of "Cinderella," "Big Dog" and "House of Cards" -- with a handful of silly jokes thrown in.  I could see how this is going to end, but that's just the start. The humor is about average. If you're the sort of person who likes a couple of the jokes, you'll be sorry for yourself.  It's not worth a chance, but if you're tired and not interested, you might be a bit bored with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an extremely shallow, boring, stupid movie. It has some of the best lines and some of them could have been excellent. But it's so hard to find the good parts. It also contains some of most horrible and worst lines ever. I had never been able to tell anything remotely intelligent or funny or funny. It's all inane and completely predictable. It shows the world as it was in the 1980's and tries to be funny, and you're left wondering why the writer has to waste time on this. Don't bother watching it, unless you really believe in the promise of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting an interesting film with a decent cast and I didn't know that it was. I just got bored and didn't want to watch. I think it was a film that tried to be funny, but just not funny. I don't think it could have made any funny comment.  I think its just terrible. I wish I'd watch it again to get my mind off of things that were happening. I did like when there were all these crazy things happening. That's what I said.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad, and there's only one decent scene. It just plays off the premise, and doesn't do the acting to any degree. The ending is weak, and I am not sure if I even cared about it, or if this movie actually has any redeeming qualities. I don't know what this movie has to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "In the Name of the Stars" is not an impressive movie. I thought this is a horror film, but it has been turned into a horror movie. It is not a horror at all. It's just a plot. It was not even funny, which made me wonder what would become of the director of the movie, if not for the fact that it had the best cast members and had the most horrible stories. I saw the first trailer of "In The Name of The Stars" last month, and it is not too scary. The director of "The Name of "Thighs" did a very bad job in the film. It seems like an amateur film made for a horror director, and as a result of all this I give it a bad review. I hope someone learns from this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this movie to be better than it was, but I was not. I think I watched it for the first time on the movie channel. When I finally finished watching it, I was really depressed. The acting was bad, the story was a weak one and the ending was anticlimidious. I'm only 13 years old and I was very depressed. I give this movie a 1 out a 100 for a bad attempt at entertainment and the fact that it's in the first place doesn't mean it's not a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you haven't seen the movies before, or the original one in the 80's, you probably won't like this. The original is pretty good, but this one isn't. It has terrible acting and the ending is unbelievable. Don't waste your time watching this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story begins with the title being displayed on screen, but most of the film features poor script writing that lacks cohesion, characterization and sense of direction. The acting is also lacking, which is compounded by a really bad, one-dimensional villain. The film is so bad that it needs to be banned entirely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I watched this movie, and it looked good, it wasn't that good. I'm not a sno-snob, and even after seeing it, I was skeptical about this film. In fact, I'm one of the people who made this film, so I was expecting to be very excited about it, but unfortunately, I didn't get to see it.  This film had one good thing: a nice, but dull, beautiful film that could be good at times, but didn't quite deliver for me. Also, there were many scenes of people (worse) getting into it, and the other parts I couldn't find out.  My advice: don't waste your time on this movie. It's bad, and not worth seeing in your home. It may be good for you to have a few beers, but don't expect to have any real fun when you watch it. Watch more from a bad film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An ugly little film. I don't care how much these actors work, they are all too bad. But the actors (Nancy Williams) and Jennifer Walters are amazing, and the music (Martha Brown) is awful! I'm a fan of this movie, but it is really a bad sequel. But I do appreciate the work done by the cast and directors, because it has something to give you some insight into why this movie has such a bad message. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie once, twice, and I still cannot find any other words to describe this movie. And I have not even found the DVD before I'm willing to buy it. What is this movie? A sequel to another bad movie which features Michael Myers, the original Michael Myers? A horrible sequel which features even worse Michael Myers. I can hardly believe that a movie with Michael Myers' trademark Michael Myers is even worse than a sequel featuring Michael Myers! The only difference between the movies is that Michael Myers was better in his own career. The new movie is based on a book and features a plot with the same plot but a different actor. The story is bad, the acting is poor, and the plot twists are annoying! I'm glad it didn't take the time to change the name of the sequel to something more like a movie, but I don't expect this film will get any good reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was terrible, the dialog was poor, the editing was terrible. I'm going to give my last word, it was about 30 minutes and it was that bad. I really enjoyed the movie because it was so short, but you have to know there are a lot of long moments that go in the first few minutes that I would never have believed. You have to believe in a movie they make or you're not a member of the "Wahh!!" group.  The last half an hour of this movie was pretty good. If you can't stand it, don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is supposed to be the first movie of the Star Wars series. A young female astronaut is in the cockpit of her new space ship. She is supposed "to be in the first person to ever fly in space... but turns out to be in her old self, so she just gets her license. She soon finds that her mother is in town, so the movie starts with that woman, and we get a few scenes that have her in tears... but it really starts with her getting into the bathroom with an awful movie director. The scene in the bathroom is very bad and the scene of one soldier in the locker in the space is pretty silly, but you'd have to sit for hours of time and just laugh and say, "Oh hey, how are you guys?" or something. The female captain isn't able to fly with her but has her pilot partner, a man named Luke Skywalker, who apparently never fly for his country... but she never is able to land him. Luke is in a lot of scenes with poor quality, and there are a lot more films in the series that have worse actors.  It seems that the whole thing has been made up to give the first film of the series something of a special focus because it is about this girl and not the others. The reason I was upset was that the people who write this movie were actually trying to create a space opera film, and they didn't bother to make a decent one, which is why the movie was made. The acting is just too dull, and it is obvious how stupid they were making the movie.  The movie was bad, but it wasn't as terrible as some have made it look, which I thought made the film good. The movie is very short, and didn't start making sense until about halfway through the second hour. The ending seems a bit silly, though, considering the fact that it ends in a scene where you can see all the main characters get in the same pool together and all the guys in the "good" ending get into the water fight in a lake. I know, I know. That's how it works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean it is one movie with two pretty women who get drunk, a bunch of actors, and the soundtrack. The girls are all pretty terrible, with their hair and hair and nothing else. The only good thing about the movie is that there are a few bits of light. But those are at odds with what else the movie has to offer. I don't know how to be honest. I'm a guy who likes movies for their beauty, but I donuts need movies for some kind of reason. Maybe if you donuts the stars a little better, it would be good, but most of those movies aren't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The concept of this film was interesting at first, and it was entertaining at some times. And there was at least some humor. But there were very few funny moments. And the most disappointing part of this movie is that the direction in the movie was not actually good.  It should be obvious that a movie starring a major movie star like John Candy would not necessarily be a bad. It's just so hard to believe that this is an attempt at a film which we have to watch in order to understand what it actually is. What a stupid idea? The story and story structure is extremely disappointing, and the characters are flat and stupid, making all of the characters less interesting than they should be. There is nothing at all that makes you think the film is a fun movie, and that the film has so many problems that it has absolutely no ability to convey any idea about how the film should actually go. There really needs to be a lot of work on its plot. There are so many holes in it that you can't even tell what it's about.  I can't give you any suggestion how to improve the movie. I can only offer my opinion on the plot and the story, which I cannot say anything about, but I can give you some ideas about what the movie really is about. This film needs to get the first half of it together, and then it's finally boring. It also needs to finish with a complete ending, and one half of a great movie, which they won't get if they do not have a complete finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to go out and give this movie the worst review ever. I can honestly say that there were more serious problems in this movie than most Hollywood movies. Most of the cast were bad, the story was not that good, the characters were not that interesting, and the plot seemed to go straight downhill. I guess this movie is a bit of an excuse to have something of interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised that this movie was made. I didn't know how to expect any of these things, even the main theme is not being used. Just the people who didn't see this movie before reading it, it was kinda amusing. They never found a real ending, and I think they just left to go back to the next movie. I can't believe they didn't do a real finish for the movie. The story is really bad, and the ending is very weak, and if they would have found a way to finish it I would have been able to see this for one of the better films they made. They would have done a decent job if they didn"t done a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'm a person who has never played the movie, I can see it as a 'waste of my time' or something. I think the movie is simply a mess of things thrown together like there are points that are unclear, and there are other points which are not even clear, like the scene where some children take pictures in the water fountain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on one night in 2009 and never again. It's a bad way to see a movie. I'm sorry I watched it and didn't finish it. The plot is too shallow and the ending is too predictable. It was bad for the whole movie, but I did enjoy it anyway. The ending was pretty silly and I loved the film so much that I didn't know what the hell it was about and my head was at a swivey. The only thing I liked about the film is the voice. The voice is OK, but the way it sounds in front of the camera is very irritating and I couldn't sleep with it for the rest of the film. I can't even recommend it to anyone. It had nothing to say that it was a good movie and I could tell it was better if it was made by someone who actually knew what it was and didnno.  I'm still waiting for someone to make a movie about a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the '60's. It has a fair share of that, and there are many things that have gone wrong in the story. However, '60 is a movie that just doesn't have anything to be proud of. I understand that this movie was a remake of another movie, which is why it took me so long to see it. There were few decent dialog lines, and the acting was awful, but the other side of the movie was simply bad. If you're looking for some gritty film, I would advise you to avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a rating and a rating.  this movie is simply an attempt to make money by selling it for a low budget, and fails miserably. the acting was atrocious, the characters were weak, and there was absolutely no redeeming redeeming or interesting characters. the soundtrack was bad as well. but it was better than in the first movie which was also very bad.  1/10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the people in the Hollywood office do is this! It's just that bad! The movie is an hour of pure low-grade garbage! If you have any idea of how to watch this movie, you'll know it right. You need to watch it because it's the stupidest Hollywood script ever. If you actually watch this crap movie, don't even think about going to see it. Avoid it, and find yourself a good movie: a loser who doesn't know who he's got. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker, and I'm obsessed with a little, but this movie is not the same as the original one. This is not a movie you would want to watch, but it isn't the same at all, as the first one was. The storyline is predictable and boring, and the whole film is a piece of nonsense that had no suspense whatsoever. This movie would be only OK if you wanted to see an episode of a horror movie, but if you want to see a movie with a plot that is full of nothing but the characters and their dialog then this movie will most likely to be a complete waste of time. The only thing that can redeem this movie for me is the performance of the actors. Don't look at the stars and be happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main thing that made this movie a bad is the acting.  I think that it is a very short movie, and it shows that there is no idea of a connection with the film and the characters. The acting is very so so so bad that most of the actors were mediocre at the time. I mean, the actors did a very good job, but most of them just didn't act well.  The movie was about 3 minutes of screen time. But what matters most is that most people are expecting that the movie is a horror film, which just doesn't happen. I found out there was no special place for a movie that had an attitude or attitude. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a couple of days ago and have not seen it. If you have watched it with the subtitles, you will know what I mean. This movie is just about the most awful movie ever. There are so many things in the film that you can't figure out, and I am so tired by it. I just watched it two times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really terrible to me. There are quite some scenes, but there is nothing to show them. The acting is too stupid to be funny and some of the actors are just bad. The movie didn't have a funny premise and I didn't think I would enjoy it.  I did laugh at the beginning of the movie, but the ending had the worst ending. I never laughed, and I can't believe that it ever got to that point. I'm not sure if this movie is so bad to watch, but it was so bad I could hardly stand it. What would have been a good movie to watch? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film isn't great, it could be funnier than some of the video found on the internet. Unfortunately, the main characters are pretty bland, not in the extreme and the ending is pretty stupid.  The movie does get some decent bits of humor, but not really. It's just a shame of a movie that could be taken for a few hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is simply an insult to the very good acting of two talented actors, one of which is played by a very disappointing Michael Caine, who appears at the beginning to be very good actor.  The next several pages of the plot do not follow the script, but we were very surprised that it is supposed to be a sequel to the original, which we thought was supposed to happen.  There is no real ending, and the plot is so stupid that we could not even begin to get involved. In the end we could only laugh. The ending is supposed "real" but in the real world, nothing can be real.  It is hard to find the funny moments for some parts of the film, but what's there, if anything. The dialogue is laughable, and most of the time we laugh, and I couldn't even find the words. I could not find any humor in it. It is just plain awful and so sad, and we're just wasting a lot of money. I am sure that the studio is embarrassed by it, and that a true fan of Michael Cyle would not have done something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst I have seen in my life. As a producer who made this film and I have worked with the producers of it, I was absolutely surprised that it has been given the low rating it has in the media. This is the most pathetic film I have ever seen. It's absolutely disgusting! I wish there was a more pathetic film than this. This film is a complete lack of entertainment, it is unbelievably stupid and should be banned from existence. The fact that I have to wait to watch it again, I must say. I am completely dismayed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting the plot and the story would at least make some good points in the plot, but I did not expect that, i think the movie was too poor, just the plot was really bad and the dialog is bad and there wasn't any tension at all, not a very good movie, it's pretty obvious that the whole plot is totally pointless and stupid, just pointless, I think the director and the actors did some really good job in making the movie, the dialog was good and the plot itself just a bad joke, even the ending doesn't make the movie look nice or even entertaining at the least, it should have been made for younger people, but unfortunately it was not made for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good reason why this film was made is that it has been very well known since it was released in 1993, it has more than a million dollars worth of good acting. Unfortunately, the director and screenwriter, Steve Lipburn, had neither interest nor passion for this film, and when it was finally released, I was very unhappy. The movie, in addition to all the cheap crap it contains, is about the most depressing of the worst movies ever made, and you can't even hear the end credits. The acting is not good, the dialog is very poor, the plot is incoherent and very simplistic. The dialogue is so bad that it's hard to believe anyone actually thought it. I don't expect you will have trouble with this movie, but for the price, you might.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this film, it sounded as if it would be a film straight out of some other '90's "scary" flick. I have only been living in the last few months of the film and have come to accept that there are some very bizarre plotlines and there are absolutely no real clues to help you figure out how to get a grasp of it. Also, I don't know how it is, or if this film is a parody of a horror film, or whether it's actually a real movie or a joke. The director doesn't really care about being funny in a comedy like 'Bunny Girl', and there is no suspense and no real plot, making the movie far less fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad on every level, starting with the plot, which is a total of 2 minutes of "reality" or what ever was real. The story itself is not good, it has not even been plot-wise, and there are enough problems to have the movie at the least entertaining, even though the end doesn't even make any sense, as the storyline is not a story, but a story to be told. And that's not even a spoiler, the movie will probably have a story. This movie should never have been made, even as it was one of the worst things I've ever seen. As a man I can't even watch this movie because it looks so bad, even in its very worst form. There are no real emotions, and the characters were terrible, but I'll say that is because the characters are good, the actors are good. There is absolutely no chemistry, and if there was a plot it would have been better.  The only good aspect about this movie was the movie's acting. That's pretty lame. I'd say the actor is a "fan" but I don't understand if he's a good actor or a bad one, but if he was good, what would the rest of me say? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen several movies, but these films are always good. This one was not. The acting was terrible, the acting was bad, the editing and editing was bad. The dialog was very weak and most of the film's dialog consisted of two-coloring sentences, all in one line. And most of it was incomprehensible. The film is based on a really bad movie called "Murders in America".  What I like about the title? A movie made for TV, or a movie that someone wants to get into a movie thinking that there might be a sequel. They want to create a sequel, and this is where the money comes. They don't think much about the ending and do the job they could have done, and then these people who want to get involved in this movie get involved and end up hating on them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not a documentary; it is the video. There are no cinematography/movies being made. It has got a few decent stories to tell and that's all there. The acting is awful, the acting is stupid, and the story is boring. I gave this movie a 4.2 out of 10. It was disappointing that this film was so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i can see a few good moments (i.e. the opening scene).  But the rest was a complete failure. In other words this movie is a waste of money... and its a pity. It is not even worth watching, considering the time you spend at this movie. i would recommend watching a movie on a bus. You can laugh at it but you won't spend more money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a very short and dull ending. If it were supposed to be a "drama" film, it would have been much better.  What's the point? It's just a bunch of characters, a little storyline, and one pretty good looking woman.  If it's supposed to follow the history of the whole universe, then I think it's disappointing. The story is pretty pointless, and there's no good way for a person to make the movie better than the "dark fantasy" series that makes movies better. That's not to say that the characters in this movie are all good, because they're not, but it does give a very unpleasant feeling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Laid is about a family who grows up in a suburb of one state, with a daughter who is the only child of a dead dad and a mother who lives a lonely life as a single woman.  This movie was not the best one I've seen in the first few years of my child's life, it was too long and too short. And I didn't see the family in the movies before this movie.  There wasn't even a lot of action here. I guess this movie just isn't funny in any way at all. The movie has a weak script with some funny lines, like the one where the dad's sister is so upset about the other woman who's daughter was killed. I wish I could have given this movie more credit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor sequel to an abysmal film, featuring a weak supporting cast that is actually pretty good at the beginning. The main character is a girl who can't seem to be interested in anyone. Even though she comes out at a good age, she's really the only girl that stands up in the end. This is a really terrible film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not recommend watching this film in a movie theater. Instead I recommend watching it in a video store or something. If you have nothing better to watch than the film in the video store you can't really expect to enjoy this. I've been watching this for about 15 minutes and found it impossible to stay involved in it. The acting is flatly unimpressive and there are two sets of actors in the film and no dialogue. The movie is very poor and it does not even make any sense. There's absolutely no suspense. I'm surprised that there are even any witty or entertaining moments in the movie. It should never be viewed in the same theater as it is shown in the DVD store or anywhere else. I don't think it was even that entertaining. It has some pretty funny moments but nothing that is funny or funny, and that's why it was banned in the beginning of the year. It's just an embarrassment of the fact that it's so bad it could not be given a rating in the US. Don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few parts that are well done. But they would have done better to take the time to completely edit it, and most of the parts are not funny. I have seen some of those kind of funny scenes in other horror films. If they could have just edited it so that they had some good scenes, then there might have been some funny scenes. But this is a pretty shallow-dark story.  This movie is actually a very derivative of a very bad horror genre. I could easily get bored if I saw the trailer and it is not as good as the trailer. The only thing I liked was the fact that there was no real indication that these guys are really bad, but there were plenty of reasons to be very, very annoying and funny. They were supposed to be the very scary, scary clowns, but unfortunately, in the horror genre it is all about the characters themselves.  The point that really got me was that none of the characters are actually really characters, and they all have two personalities, rather than one. There are actually all kinds of people that are in this film. The people who are in the film are basically "a" of the film.  There is a little bit of plot in this, but the people who will be the main characters are annoying and the people that will be supporting them are all too stupid.  And there are two girls who are very good friends. And there's an army of ghouls. But these characters do not seem to have the same personalities or personalities that you would expect. They are just characters, who have different relationships with each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to see some great films and this is not one of them. It was so bad in my opinion and I couldn't even finish it. I had an idea about the plot but I was not able to discern it. What is funny is that one of the other two "revenge" stories is a really good one. But this movie doesn't even qualify as an "cane film" it lacks the sort of wit that you get used to on screen. If you are a person who likes the humor in this movie, you might be entertained. But in the end, it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the title pretty funny. I can't believe the movie was supposed to have any plot or a plot. A guy is at his apartment, getting ready to be at work, and is talking to himself. "You'll never be here in this town. You're going to die here, and there are several reasons why you'll die here.  Then he leaves his room and walks to the elevator to the lift and turns on his radio.  But his wife comes in and shuts the door behind him, because she's gone with him when he goes back. She keeps having to go to and and fight with him.  Of course, the acting is bad. The girls are all mean, loud, and not very good. The guy has trouble with his boss, and she says he's a Nazi. And he keeps saying horrible things about the town.  The film is simply a bad gag. If you want to see this film, watch it. But don't watch it unless you want a laugh or a good laugh. It is very annoying, and don't try to be funny, it's not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for maybe an hour and then realized what was about to happen. I don't mean to go on the Internet to bash it. I just want to say the fact that it was based on an actual movie and no one seemed to care about it made it even worse. The movie had an average plot, a very bad acting and the film was terrible in almost every way. Even when you liked the characters, I just thought the whole movie had really begun to fall apart when they were in "real" relationships with each other. I guess that is why a lot of people don't really care for a comedy to be funny, because when something is not funny it can just be a disaster.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may think I have made too severe a comparison. As it is, the acting and the music is very poor. The music sounds like it was put in a high school song that was so bad that the school board was afraid to put out its latest musical project. I can't really blame the producers of this movie. The director, Gary Basset, is not even interested in making a great movie. He has been doing this kind of thing since the '50s, so he has good instincts. But for the most part of my point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely garbage. It has a very weird look, and doesn't fit together well as a film.  Also, I was surprised to see the title of this film "Estranged". What was the name of this project?  I think it was about a group of women who were all mentally disturbed and struggling with each other. This film was about an elderly man who had done a little bit of work with his son and wanted to work with a younger man. The idea was that they would use his body to hide his daughter's nude body from him, and that they were taking his son away.  The film begins with an introduction of a couple who had just gotten together. The husband is seen holding a book and is talking with his wife about "Things to Do." It is then revealed that the husband has had an affair with some women in the last weeks, and he and his wife are involved in their relationship with this woman.  This is a really bad film. The characters are all totally predictable and boring. There is absolutely no plot. This is also the third movie I have ever seen that I really liked - all three. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read reviews for the movie that say this film was funny but it wasn't funny at all, and it was downright sad when I found this movie.  The movie starts off at a very low level. It is all about a lot of pointless dialog in which the girls act very stupid and they have not developed enough character development or story. The end of the movie seems to be very short, but the movie is not long. This movie is only three hours long, and I could feel better watching it if I wasn't bored. There is not a lot to enjoy about this movie and i would not recommend it to anyone.  I was one of the people who got the movie for the film's festival, which I saw in a video review of it when it was first available. If the movie wasn't so bad, I would definitely recommend it, but it didn't help much.  This movie doesn't look like a funny movie at all. I don't know how anyone would expect it to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that this movie is a mess. The story is bad and the acting is weak. I have never seen a good movie since. I was really surprised that they were even willing to make it. It is so bad, that you cannot take it seriously. I think the director really wanted to make a sequel as the first film wasn't that good. Maybe he was just desperate for money and wanted to keep this as a sequel so he just kept cutting out all his scenes so he could have a sequel. He tried to keep the story interesting but it just wasn't going anywhere and he finally let me in the character who was really funny. I mean I liked the movie because of some of the characters but they just couldn't stand the attention to their dialog.  The acting is bad. I understand a lot of the acting but the story itself is bad for me. They have not properly established a connection between the characters. The way that the story goes is so inconsistent and the way that they deal with the world is too predictable. It's like when I watch a bad sequel movie and all the actors have their lines and there is nothing special about the story. It makes no sense to me that the writer wants to give a plot twist and make up a story about a guy who is so depressed he sees his friends get killed on a bridge and he gets sad about the news about a girl he wants to have.  It really is just a very stupid film. If you like to look down through the characters in movies, watch this one if you want to hear about a low-budget film that only has about twenty minutes worth of film and it doesn't matter. Don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really terrible. The first episode wasn't even an interesting story to watch, not one of the many movies it has. This movie is so shallow that it is truly boring. There are no good jokes in this movie and it is so bad that it can't even get past an hour or two. I've seen this movie before, so I can't comment on it properly. I have to see this movie at all costs and then I'm not sure what it would do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if I was one of the people who decided to watch this. I'm sure that I was too young to have seen this film. I was about 8 or 10 at the time. I know why it is so hard to find this movie. I've never seen a movie that isn't a porn parody. The ending is unbelievable and the only thing that could be worse than this is the movie that makes you believe. A sex slave with a dick! How are you even watching this movie? It's an unbelievable movie. A man who gets stuck in a bathhouse with his dick. Oh yeah, I'm guessing he is in an old hotel somewhere in Seattle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was shocked that this movie was so poorly edited and I didn't even think it was supposed to be that bad. If there was some sort of irony in the movie, I would like to say that. What was the point of this movie? I wasn't sure...the premise is pretty much the same as in other "jalassic" movies, which seems like it could be something funny... but this one just fails to have any funny. It wasn't funny enough, and I'm not sure that there's enough funny here...but it was pretty stupid to see a dinosaur (like this one) and not be able to realize that he was a dinosaur, and just not knowing that there is no dinosaur dinosaur(s) on the planet.   This movie doesn't belong to this genre, nor does it really belong to the other genre that this kind of dinosaur movies have been made. There are other scenes that are a bit better, like the scene involving the dinosaur, but for me the movie was bad at almost every point. It has a really bad premise. The dinosaur's brain was too big and it didn't fit in with the rest of the scenes. The other dinosaurs looked too human and it just didn't come across like this one was supposed, which I thought the movie needed to be more funny.  There is something like a video board in this movie that you can see all of the dinosaur scenes and it's just a blank, but the video board is still quite blurry. It also contains some good camera work. But overall it just seemed like a dinosaur porno movie, which isn't funny. I think it had to be made to be a dinosaur sex-movie. I'm never going to see one of those films, because I know that it has to be cheesy and completely unsymmotdic and it hasn't that much appeal for a younger audience. If you're a dinosaur fetishist (this is the movie), you'll get bored very quickly...and that's where this movie starts becoming a drag-in to the movies it is made to only make money. It just works against the idea that you would even go into a dinosaur movie just to see this movie, not even because you were laughing. I would have laughed about the movie and would probably be upset to see it, but you're looking for your parents' dirty DVD of the movie that someone rented for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of this movie, but this movie just isn't the fun I've come to know. In the end, it just becomes so sad and depressing that I can't even sit with my sister. I know why people have to do such a "cringe-inducing" movie; it's hard to watch and take the time to make sense out the plot and the acting. But what's wrong with it? I know it's the biggest problem ever - the movie is so disappointing! It is so bad that you won't even remember it if you have just one or two days to spare. There's no way to even begin to feel sad. It is just so bad! I had the opportunity to watch it on some other television channel and decided to watch the end in the movie alone, so I just sat on my bed crying. I really like a good movie - I'm going to rent it again. The acting is pretty good. I like it, but I just find it so bad for me. It's sad, though - and I didn't even care to watch this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is so bad that I'm going to be embarrassed for saying that it's actually the best "junk" movie I've seen. I've never seen one that can't even come close to the movie I used to watch. This movie is so stupid and stupid and the acting is so horrible that it is truly an insult to watch this movie.  Also, I've heard the other actors in the film are pretty good. I want to know how stupid they're acting in their interviews.  The funny thing is that none of the people I saw in the movie were in this movie and I was glad to see the director (Eunice Lee) make this movie without any acting or acting skills whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really can't say what was wrong, though I've seen a number of things with this plot that seem promising. And this movie is not worth watching or watching. There are no logical plots and there are no real purpose to the plot. The film is full of the most boring movies, but that's not what bothers me. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and the movie was never released as such a cult movie.  If you see it for some reason, I warn you not to see it. It's just the kind of stupid film you have seen a million times and you just give it a few minutes so you can laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of money, and didn't even start with the plot. What's there? There is a lot of wasted, empty space, and there are some scenes that could be so funny that I couldn't even count them. The movie takes place in the mid-1940's, so I thought I'd just enjoy a little nintural slap in the face. I was very surprised that it was this film. I also didn't like it because there was no one funny or witty character and just a bunch of weak jokes. I didn't know why people would even think of this film after reading the story, which is all about a couple of middle schoolers who had a bad day at their job and had to take the "B" test. The film is pretty thin and could be a good family film, but it was nothing like an animated feature film like "Carnet". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If i were to see this film, I would not want to. It had the greatest script of all time in the history of the world. I can only describe it as the kind of garbage film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the movie as the first of the trilogy and even enjoyed the ending. However, the third film of the series fails to deliver any action at all. The plot is very lacking and it does not go anywhere, and not even an ending.  The worst of this series is the first installment and the most despicable film ever released! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first problem I encountered with this movie was that it has absolutely zero acting. The characters are simply stupid. It's just as bad as the first "Iron Man" movie.  I would recommend a good one which you cannot watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a poor attempt at comedy by the director of John Cryley's previous work, the sequel to "The Fugitives", and a few other minor tweaks. There are a few minor things that make this movie seem more interesting than the previous one. They're not like the old "The Naked Gun" movies. They are not like "Dirty Harry" movies; there are some elements that are almost "true" but they seem to be unintentional.  Still, this movie looks good at times, and the cast is decent, but none of the cast here in their prime years.  The fact that it is a sequel to a film makes this movie feel even worse than usual, and this is not only a bad version of "The Dead Zone", it's actually a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some fun clips of the'real' version of the "Shenker" series. However, some of them are much worse. The series is the most poorly conceived film I've ever seen. The main character was the main character in the previous version of "Skenner" but in this one it was done to much less effect. The 'Shenkers' series is not a story about a female spy in a real life, but a fantasy adventure about a woman in a fantasy. There are only a few plot lines that were interesting at the beginning. There's not enough room for a serious plot in the series. That's bad for me, but I know what it was supposed to be. It was supposed this was a funny film, but there are too many of the funny jokes that were thrown in the first episode.  The series didn't have any proper ending that would redeem it. I didn't care to waste my time. It could be better in its version of a 'film' but not as good as the original.  If you want a romantic thriller, don't watch "Sinkers". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i like my parents.they've always loved me. but the movie they made in the video store that i bought when i was 18. the first was a poorly put together piece of a story, and later on a much less interesting and well scripted animated movie. the second was a piece of an old anime that only existed because of the internet. the third was a movie that was totally inappropriate for a child and probably would've been best for a 10 year old. the fourth was an old film by a famous anime writer named Yasuko Yoshikawa. the fifth and sixth movies in this series are the "BumbleBumble", an ad hoc sequel. i was not happy with this series and was in fact not going to watch this film but my girlfriend and I did like it too much. the seventh movie was "Honey", and it was so bad that it ruined me. i'm not sure how to describe it, it may be as a kind of horror film or a weird soap-operations. i do get used to this kind of thing after I see it. i didn't care that my mom and girlfriend both went through this movie but didn't really have anything left to do for them. and they did a better job than most.  I don't know where my sister was going or what is it about. i can't even imagine this is what my family would've sold in a video store in Japan. i like movies with characters that are real. I like the ones with real voices. the people that make these movies seem more real and less surreal, even though I cannot understand why they do it. the ones that make me laugh are usually not actually actors but actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know I know about most of the movie's cast. The thing about the movie is that none of them was really strong. There were not enough characters to do much with the movie. And I think that the characters didn't really develop and were just stuck in their first place. The lead actor was not too good. He seemed to be in his early days. His acting was OK, but did not come close to the top of what would have been good at the time. The direction was not good either. I understand there was a lot to gain. But there was too much of a bad feeling when the film was about to be finished. There was too long. It would of been good to just take one hour to see the movie, but instead, I just turned it off. I was really shocked when the first trailer came out.  The other funny thing is how the original director was given credit for "making the film" by making a film with a very interesting plot and some pretty good acting. How could the director have done such a movie if they were to do the same for real? I really didn't like this movie, and I didn't think it was any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as a child because I was a kid who had been scared by the ending of The Matrix. That movie is garbage, and its ratings seem to have been good for the fact that it was the most brutal film in history. This movie could only be used to ridicule the movie-makers. As a child, this movie was way to boring, not really scary but its horrible, awful, and it just wasn't scary. I found it extremely distressing. It is just so bad that I couldn't even finish it without crying.  I gave this movie two stars, but I give this movie zero score for a number of reasons. 1) It doesn't make much sense that this movie is so bad it could be a movie, if there were an actual person behind it. 2) There is absolutely nothing funny about it, and the characters are too stupid. 3) The soundtrack doesn't sound like a music video track, which is good. The music in this movie isn't as good as the music in The Matrix, which was also a great movie. 4) The movie is bad for anyone, but the characters aren't so weak that they need a second actor. 5) The acting isn't strong. There is nothing funny here, but it doesn't really need it. 7/10: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with an overly-wacky ending and no idea how the plot ends. It is also unbelievably stupid to have a female character who is really good in a movie, so she starts shooting her sister, who is acting in a good way, and kills the entire world. Then the other women in the movie starts shooting a gun to her friend. And then the scene abruptly ends and she and her sister starts in the bath and get raped. I didn't like this movie. I mean really really bad. I can't even tell you what a good scene it is because it was just so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting in this movie is unbelievable. A major problem in all the other movies was the way the characters seemed to be acting. For example, in the movie, a female character seemed to want to have sex with her brother, but the only person it seemed she could speak was in the other movie. The other movies have the same kind of problems. A female character has just a shallow and manipulative nature. The characters are so shallow that it's impossible to find any emotion.  The only one that does get some of the feeling of love is when the heroine is talking to her mother. That's supposed to be pretty sad.  It just falls apart when you start watching it. I didn't like this movie because of all the bad acting. It just never gets any real feeling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movie I ever seen. I mean I'm a kid who's got teenagers in the house and I want to watch them for my 18th birthday. This film is nothing but rubbish. I just had to turn it off and don't want to see more of it. It's just one piece of crap after another. I don't know why. I'm sorry, I think it's because I've never seen a bad film before. And to be honest, I don against this movie because it's not cute. The characters were awful, the music was annoying, and the soundtrack was awful. The only good thing about this film was the little time it took me to watch it. But when I watch it again I don"t even want to look at it, and I can't see anything else on the internet. I'll probably waste a couple of weeks watching it because it won't matter to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie about 10 times, and that really sucked me out. It's just so bad. I mean, I didn't even see this movie because I thought it was so good. I didn a lot of things in the movie, like the plot, but the acting was stupid and stupid. I think the actors had it together, but they weren't good for each other. The plot didn't make much sense, and some of the scenes were so stupid that I couldn't even watch it. I tried my best to get the funny scenes in the scene where the man and the girl are fighting on an escalator. I felt like the characters were fighting each other, and I was annoyed with the fact that there wasn't even a scene where they were fighting. I also felt like there wasnno reason to put a "happy-go-m" scene in there, and the scene when the guy in the diner is talking to the lady was just sad, and unnecessary. I was just a bit surprised that there aren't any funny parts in the film. The movie seemed to be made by a single person, and there aren'n any funny scenes, or any other characters. I can't even talk about the acting, because the acting is so bad that it's boring. The ending is a total waste of time. I liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as the previous ones, which was even a good-looking version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad movie, the acting is terrible, the pace is slow and the story is a huge crap. The acting is not good, the dialogue is poor, the cinematography is bad, the story and the casting is stupid.  But it is a good movie, so don't pay much attention, it really sucks and don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have the same reaction to the movie as I did to the one time I was in this movie. This is bad! I never thought I was going to be in this, but now I'm pretty sure I was. I am sure I'm not going to get it to go anywhere. The plot was pretty crappy, the casting was poor and I wish I had just one movie to watch. I can't even count my own words.  I give this movie a rating:  1/4 out of 10.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was really bad! I was really disappointed. This movie was terrible! It was very uncomfortable, it was really slow and there were three plot twists that were too weak. It should have been 10 hours to an hour of film! It took way too long to get there! The whole thing made no sense! It seemed like it was all meant to be a really good movie, but it was too bad. The director didn't understand how to do it. I didn't even get the chance to see the other two films that it has been paired with. I was too bored with the movie.   I can't give this movie any credit whatsoever as a film. It's not a good movie. There are some good stories in this movie, they just weren't put to proper context. It is just really annoying! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot is badly constructed. If you really like watching old American films, this movie might not be a bad choice. If so, you might have an idea but I doubt it will be any good watching. If we're being selfish, it could be good watching for one of the "best" movies of the period.  The point of this film is to bring the movie out of its own time and start making it an entertaining, not a bad one. If they could have just a little taste of the old American movie: Don't put this movie on with the rest of the American films. It's just bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Black Cat's Revenge" may be considered the biggest bad movie of the whole series. I've seen this in an off-camera review once. I can honestly say that it wasn't even the worst in my entire life. It's really the worst, and I've had the misfortune of being the one who had been in my youth. I found out later on some of the video clip that this movie was never intended to be a "femme" movie. In my defense, I'm not sure what "feme" means to an adult. A "fems" movie is made of people who are, as the title implies, fem(es) and people who think their "femies" are evil monsters, and nothing else. It never takes on an ending that really gives a meaningful ending to the story. The plot begins with a murder, then a revenge killing, then an attempt to kill the Black Cat. The villain in "The Dark Cat" has been dead for years, and has been brought back to life by an experimental scientist, who is apparently in possession of a very good long-term contract to take over the Black Dog. We see her talking with some kind of creepy-looking black cat in a movie like this and proceed to do some kind a torture scene. Her body seems to start to change to something vaguely resembling her underwear, and when she has her mask back on her, she is wearing it again. I do not understand why she wears it, as she is the most intelligent creature in the world. It is then that she comes back to find her mother, and she is put into a cage. There is a whole lot of nothing, and there is no explanation. Just awful. The movie was bad, and terrible. I'm glad it got canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I was reading some reviews of the first one and they were asking me to make a negative film review about it. It's really bad for the fact that it relies on cheap thrills and cheap horror. It fails on so many levels and I'm not sure if this movie was made in the 70's or in 2016. I'm even less sure whether the director is an actor or if he is a stuntmaster. In my opinion, he's probably the worst actor he's ever seen and he has the worst taste in acting I've seen. This film is just a series of nothing and it's not even a scary flick.  The only thing I found of interest was the fact the characters are named after each other's names, which is a very bad habit in filmmaking.   The best part of the movie is the fact this film is so bad, but I do not recommend it because I can't afford to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got off the elevator on the first flight and got very annoyed. I started crying at my dad, thinking this was ridiculous. In addition, I was also trying to get my kids involved with this movie, so I asked my girlfriend to give them the idea. They were going to watch it with me, and I thought it was ridiculous that they were watching this on the airplane. So I made my dad the "director" of this movie. And I thought, oh wow, no one should pay to watch this crap, so there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at some college where I lived and the one I rented, was, not even at all. What was it? What was this? This one is the first of the low budget comedies I've seen, and I'm not a fan of those. I'm sorry.  If you are like me, you will probably find the title, "The Unholy Cult of the Holy Father's Holy Spirit" hilariously funny, and there is an abundance of gross humor in the title. But when it comes to a sequel, it's all in vain, and in truth I don't think it is, much as a sequel anyway.  There are some great ideas to the sequel. For example, the way that it was supposed to happen in this movie was to go down the water in the holy man's mouth, but the way it is supposed to have gone there is not as well, it is more like a swimming bath with the holy water and the holy spirit, but there are some people, like the church's priest, who do nothing but walk in to church with the Holy Spirit. They would then walk straight to the church. As for the church priest, I have some sympathy for them, but unfortunately, it seems as if they are trying to go straight to heaven, too. The problem is not that they are doing this, the problem is that they aren't having the courage to get there and then put on proper steps. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was going to be one of the best film I ever saw of the year. I thought it was an action movie. And it wasn't. I guess it's a kind of 'who' film. And I know there are some great movies, but they aren't so great when they're terrible. I'm not a big fan of action movies like this one. What I was surprised about this one was that it was so bad. It was bad for a number of reasons. For starters, there is a really bad story. There is no good story or plot. Also, it wasn, as usual, totally unnecessary.  There are enough times where there is no room for a movie with characters. There are also lots of times where it could have been funny to watch because you just don't care. The dialogue is just plain bad, the character designs are stupid, and most of it is so badly acted that it could've been funnier. But it wasn''t even funnier if they hadn't acted so badly.   The most disappointing movie of the week is this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed at the awful acting, acting and writing. In retrospect I might have been able to find some magic from a few actors and maybe even some dialog. But in this movie there is no real magic to be found. The characters are so bad that I really didn't care for them anyway.  I must note that although I have seen all the films in the series (including the original) and enjoyed them, I cannot say they were worth seeing. I've seen many other movies so the series really is just a bad thing. It just keeps you sitting there, stuck in your seat and wishing it could get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i found this movie a bit sad to see. the first act was a little too sad to be over the first half. the second act is a much better example of bad acting than the first, but at the same time i still cannot give you a good rating for the second half, so i gave it one.  it seems that the movie is supposed to be about a man who becomes angry because of the lack of time to kill off his neighbors. so why did i think it was about the time? i just wanted to see something. i mean, it was one of the few movies i had seen before I saw this was a very bad movie, but this one had been even worse than the one I saw. the acting was very weak, and the dialog is all too sad. the direction was not all good. i still prefer the first movie because it was a nice movie. so, the only thing i can recommend is some good horror movies and a good horror movie, which is not too far from the original one. i have to say that I did like this movie more than the original movie, and was surprised that the people in the movie were much happier. I still do not think i would have been pleased with this movie if they had just a couple of laughs.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watched this film last evening, I was appalled by the most terrible film I've ever watched. I've never been in movies before, and I was left by the very beginning, so I can't tell what the heck I had in mind. But, if I'm being thorough, I'm probably guilty of watching this when it came out on DVD.  The camera was bad, the acting was bad (especially the female actors were really awful) and I'm certain it wasn't even worth picking up the DVD before I rent it. I was surprised that I found the director's name and number from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The concept is interesting, but it's just annoying, it's predictable, and it never really gets a rise or excitement. There are a couple of amusing moments, like a brief scene where the lady takes a shower topless and is in the bath with a pretty boy. That's pretty corny. The acting is mostly mediocre, though, I admit, I've seen many of them better. It's a shame that the movie hasn't gotten a promotion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie again for about 2 minutes and decided it was so bad. My girlfriend was very disappointed, since we had nothing to do with it and since I could tell that it was based on some other film. We bought it and saw it again. I didn't enjoy it and we didn't even want to see it again, it was really stupid. We had the chance to rent it again at the end of my visit with him and it didn't work very well. It just didn't make sense, in the slightest of the time. If I saw this again, I would think it was just an awful bad film and not worth my time to see. I think it needs to be taken out of the store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would recommend to stay away from this movie unless you really love the old movies. It's pretty shallow. I just want a little character development, and nothing to get you into the mind. Also, when a movie comes out it should have some decent character development. Don't get me wrong - some of the characters are interesting, but not good for their own. That's the point of this movie. The director should have been smart enough to come up with a story that works. If you liked the TV series or some of his later films, you would be fine.   This movie could have been made in the middle of the teens - just about 6 months or so. I think it's just the kind of film that could have done something funny with some teenage characters. That would be the only way to make this movie more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete mess of stupidity. It was so poor, as a story, that it seemed to go straight to the bottom of the barrel, and then slowly rise back to its head and become relevant. I have watched this movie several times in hopes to find a good story. I wanted to give it the first 10 minutes and then I'd be sad. It had the worst plot I have seen, ever, on television or anywhere else. It's absolutely pointless. I found myself in tears over the stupidity of the premise and the writing. And I've seen it again. It seems like a movie to go for one minute to be an interesting story, then to be completely stupid. I was expecting the movie to be so cute. But it is so poor that I had to drop it quickly, before anyone could stop me. It is the worst kind of movie I've ever seen, in my entire life. It doesn't help that there is no video, it has some decent visual effects, but there is too much nonsense and bad acting, too much trash. But the good parts were still good, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst of the 70's. I give this as one big piece of crap! A man who tried to get out of a local drama in the middle of a play.  In this play he meets a local farmer named Jadupa (Kara). He also meets a mysterious, mysterious man named Ousuji (Ousu) who wants to sell him a story to the other village. The story doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've come to a movie in which one thing will be repeated over and over again - that it is a very boring film. I thought the plot was okay but the acting and dialog were terrible, and it did not seem like a proper film. The cinematography was bad, and the editing was bad. But there was also a point to be made in it - the story itself was interesting and I had some moments with good scenes that made me laugh, and some moments that made it sad. But it seems that all of it was for some really big reasons. It is the sort of movie where the story is just a little bit longer than usual, and everything is just left out. I do not recommend this film to anybody who is looking for a low-budget film: I do believe that there are a few good times in it but don't go too into it. Just stick with your usual low-priced horror movie: this one did not provide any entertainment whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first hour of this movie I thought I was going to be disappointed. After about 40 minutes of the first 20 minutes, I had absolutely lost interest. I was very surprised. This movie is not only bad but it also really sucks. I didn't like it because it wasn't funny, but it just flatly sucks off the first time. The acting was not bad, but there wasn't enough good moments. The whole thing just had me annoyed. The movie was also pretty stupid. It doesn't make sense to go on with the kids. The ending could be funnier than most movies of late time. I think it needs to be deleted! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading this movie after watching it and I was stunned at how awful it was, I'm not a fan of bad movies (I'm the kid in the movie, just liked the actors) but this is far from funny and far from entertaining. It is far less funny than the original movie! I guess that's why the book has been so popular! I could not find it on Amazon or a copy of the book, but I do know that all the actors are terrible! I hope they get cast in a film to earn their due share of the money, but unfortunately, I thought this movie was just an insult for a friend of mine who enjoyed it so much.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a film that attempts to bring up the notion of life from some non-existent entity, the film has to be the worst horror film ever made. It is absolutely pointless to even say that this movie is a "funny horror" but in a way that is just one of a few things that can be funny or not-funny. In fact, it looks a little like an attempt to make a comedic horror comedy, but the script is too long and there is no real direction in the film, which makes the movie a complete failure in the comedy department. It just plays a straight horror thriller.  The reason why this movie was so bad in the horror department was because of the fact that the plot is basically an exact copy of the script that is supposedly "real". All the people are actually acting as a mix of real actors and actors, making it look as if it's some kind of comedy/slasher/vague horror. Just like this film, Scream 2 and 3 may have a few laughs, but Scream 2 has a few far more.  What's interesting about the plot, the fact is that the actors involved in the plot were actually paid to the film's studio to keep their work and didn't even want to be there. This means they are acting as if they were just a part of a "reality show" which they obviously don't have to act for the characters.  But for all that, it just doesn't do any better than the films of Scream 2, and although it has some funny jokes, it still leaves a negative impact on everyone involved in this movie.  All in all, the only good part of this movie for me was the ending. The ending is pretty funny and I found myself laughing about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of John Paul McGeorge and the original "The Three Dead Prowel" for many years. The script was disappointing but well written and directed. I think that the directing team of McGeorge was the weak link in this film, but a lot of the directing was excellent. The main weakness was that the script was not well structured and there was no real story line. Also, a lot a lot more dialog was missing that the story wasn't strong enough. There was no character development, but there was character development in the film and it wasn't realistic. The film had no real plot development and the dialog was stupid. There wasn't really any story or suspense in the movie. Also I didn't like the direction of the film. It could have been better and I'd recommend a better script. There are several good scripts that didn't fit this film.  The only good thing about this movie was the acting of Richard Russell, Jack Lemmings and Jack Knightley, but in other cases it was bad.  If you see this film as a "ghost movie" or some other form of horror film, you'll be annoyed, but if you like it then enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason for this awful movie was that they chose to do a sequel. This is one of the worst horror movies ever made. As far as the plot goes, the movie wasn't quite scary, but it was a lot worse than the original, so much like the original. A lot of the plots, characters, and the storyline could have been something more interesting. But it wasn't until the sequel that made the "scream" film a more interesting movie than the first. As the movie went on, I felt like watching a video game instead of watching an actual movie. I have been a horror fan since I was younger, and this is not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like horror movies, but this one just turns out really bad. The camera is awful and the story is bad. I really like the new zombie movie. I was surprised to find a sequel of this. It seems like a bunch of old zombies. The new zombie virus has created more and more zombies to fight it. The zombies are bad too. They are slower than normal, but don't use much a zombie energy for attacks. The zombie virus seems to be using an energy source to fight other zombies. Then there is the zombie queen, with her little zombie brother, and her creepy female co-host, as well as the zombies. They seem to be in the movie because they were designed to make money.  The zombies have the ability to kill everything they want. The queen seems to kill the guys for fun.  There is nothing in this zombie movie that is funny, but the zombie movie is stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director seems to have forgotten what he was doing when he decided to make the movie. He wants to make it an interesting story with a strong plot and a lot of jokes. And instead of doing so, he tries to be funny, and becomes funny by making a joke about how people are getting ready to find it so that it's about a plot that has already failed.  I'd say that maybe the people who are laughing at the jokes in the movie are too young or they are just really, really stupid, but i don't understand who they are. And they also don't know why they laughed at the joke. They just just look at the stupid jokes they are making and they don't think it's funny.  The jokes are not funny. In fact, I don't even think they are funny at all, and the movie doesn't have any real humor to it. It's not even funny when they say, 'We don't need to waste time for this. We've already got it!' (Apparently, one of the jokes being made about this plot) and the other person says, 'Let's go, we just don't have to waste it.' (as if they wanted to waste something like that, which is pretty stupid) while the other guy says, yeah, you need to get away from this and then find something more interesting to do.  They aren't even good actors, which makes me think that they didn't really enjoy this movie, but they're not bad actors, so don't pay them any attention. If you're a fan of the movies of The Simpsons, The Goonies and The Three Little Pigs, or any other cartoon, you don't like it. And the only person I can believe to be enjoying it is Bill Murray, as I said before, one who was funny but was just stupid. He has nothing else to say, and he is actually quite funny, which I think he was the only funny guy in the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd been looking for a horror film, but I was a bit bored to get one of the "found" films. I was hoping to find an interesting and interesting movie to get my opinion of horror film like the "Alien". When I got my eyes open, I saw the video and I thought that this film was a major failure in the horror genre. The first act (a flashback) was completely unbelievable, as the first act of the film is about a house. I had to go back to the beginning again and the video looked great, but the ending is just pointless and the plot is even worse. There are no clues and you don't know what the characters are. They all just sit around their house. They're not really actors but rather just a bunch of "fools" sitting around a house with a few "dressed up" people. If you want to see a true horror, you can't watch a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My name is my name.  When I got home in December of 2005, my friend, Chris, was an avid viewer of the series, so when I was looking for some way to watch it, I looked in the title. It didn't even have a title, because when I searched for the name "The House Of Nude Love", my search was in the "House Of Nudia" folder, which had the same title.  My friend's only suggestion was that the title was "The Bride of Nudice". When I read the script, I was expecting the movie to have a story about the relationship of the wife of the main character. I was hoping for an adult romance story with romance and sex, but, as it turned out, that wasn't the case. Instead, the film is about a guy who has to fight an old man called Chibs, a magician. When the man is ready to be married, he is in the house of Chib, so he is married to one of his old friends, who wants to see the guy's wife. That's not love, that's just a fight.  After Chib is sent away, the lady asks why the man had to fight. After a lengthy conversation about this, the wife is in one of the scenes.  The end of the film shows the main woman being killed by her husband.  There was no scene with the husband shooting his wife, and no scene where Chib's wife is killed by his lover.  I just did not like the plot, and I wanted to get it off as soon as possible, and didn't like the direction of the story.  What's interesting is the ending, where a major villain, the villain who has been in this film for many years, gets shot by Chib. The ending ends in his killing his wife. The wife is then in the place of the movie, but she is in pain from being in the same situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard the story on the first part of the film. It was a terrible film to listen to. There was no story to begin with, then a new plot was introduced and then I was left wondering what this movie was about. The actors were terrible, and the dialogue was terrible, so I stopped listening to the story. There wasn't much interest for a good story. The story is simply not good enough. I would recommend to skip this movie if you can't take a shower in the water, or if you're sick and can't go to the bathroom.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been a little skeptical on this one, but I think it's an interesting documentary to view. The thing is so bad that it's not even funny to even begin with the introduction. It seems to be an idea that the person is on their own with some degree of control over their behavior, and therefore can't do anything in the real world without making a lot of effort. I don't think that's a good concept for a movie: the person should be able to act on any given occasion, and most people have failed to learn. It is clear that these people had no idea how to behave properly if they weren't given the chance to learn how to act. There are too many questions for such a simplistic, low-budget documentary. I'd recommend not to watch it unless you're ready to learn something. It would be a much better film if it's interesting to see, but the story could have been much better. I'll try to stay away from it, but if I could see it on HBO and I'm happy about it, the way it went was a complete waste of money, and I donth for anyone to waste a half hour of time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell if this is an original or not original script to have been played out. In my opinion it is nothing more than a typical American drama. Although some of the scenes are interesting. It is about as pretentious as a piece of film can get. It starts off with a rather silly plot and then goes on to the same plot line and repeats it. And then it repeats the plot a few times more. It's a waste of money and time. A better movie for two stars: the guy with an annoying girlfriend, the lady with a snappy mouth and the guy in the back of a hotel bed. The first time I saw this movie was around 10 minutes into it, but it could have been 10 years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought that I would never get to enjoy this movie. I'm not a huge fan of this film, but the first hour of the film was pretty good. I didn't even care for the ending. I was scared. But what did make me interesting was the opening scene. The film starts with a girl (she's in a white dress), who I don't care for. We get to meet the woman that wants to be with the main character, and we meet each other woman in a row. There are a couple of minor characters, and some of them are interesting, but then this goes on and we get to see the story being told from the characters that are never even known to each other. The characters are also all in the kitchen of a local restaurant, and they are getting into an argument with each other (a couple of them go to the restaurant's kitchen, while the rest leave in their hotel room). There is no dialogue between these two characters about how they feel about each other, and there are no dialogue with the characters about their friends and friends.  The film is really just awful.  I don\'t really know what happened here... but I have to guess that the reason why this movie is a bad film is because it has been so long since this film was made. The first hour is a good movie about the end of the world, but in the middle of the next hour, it's just a bad excuse for a bad flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's one thing that always makes me feel sick. It's a movie that puts a bunch of people in the background who just don't have any real intelligence or anything else that would matter.  This movie has nothing to show me. It is just another Hollywood "scratch and bite" type of drama from Hollywood. What happens in the movie is just the sad sad tale of a bunch, who were once good for the first-rate "The Big West". The cast here are just bad, and the story is totally devoid of anything resembling a story.  I'm not saying that they're all bad, but most of them really weren't good for a movie, even when they were interesting. Some of them were cute, but that's not a positive thing to watch.   The fact that this movie has one or two really good actors shouldn't be considered a success, nor should it be made even as a film, but it just won't go anywhere for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie as a gift from my parents. I never actually expected anything else, but I was curious to see what a video rental would have. I have no idea who this is, what kind of movie it is or what type of movie that it was. I'm a little bit disturbed by it. I don't know if I should even ask.  This movie had one of my worst 3 movies I have ever watched, and I was already on it. The best 3 movies in the end? 1) The "Kafookies" (1995), 2) "Trolled" (1999), and 3) "Seal" (2000).  I hope that the producer (whoever made these movies) can find some way to make this movie better, or that he is a talented musician. He should try and produce some way for him to make the sequel to this movie look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An extremely boring movie to anyone who cares about movies, but I guess it's more like a sitcom. The plot is boring, there is no chemistry, and the acting is bad, to say the least. This movie should be burned to the ground. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on the first 5 movie series ever created. There are 3 major problems with this movie. The first one is that I have read this movie twice, and now I'm sick of it. Second, I believe that the movie is lacking some important elements in the world that have proven to be true throughout the history of mankind, which are, that is, if you are not a Muslim Muslim.  The third problem is that it is impossible to be both a follower and a follower of a specific religion. This is bad because the message of the film is that there's a difference between those that follow each religion and those that do not.  Third, I just don't think anyone who lives in the west can follow the teachings of these religions. What does this mean? Well, the answer is that these people are going to be treated like the "other" religions and they'll be killed off the same way. This means that they're either bad people, bad people who are trying to make it look like normal society, or good people that have simply come up with the knowledge that's good for them to live in their faith, like a non-religious person. The third of all these problems is that you've got one main thing that they must do, and you can't tell them that, if there is no difference in the two religions, that religion is simply NOT allowed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband's "Pistachison," and I found it in a box of bargain-basement garbage. It's a real pity, and no matter how the movie is filmed, you still will find yourself in constant agony. I hope it didn't have to be that bad for those who are not familiar with the movie, or just think it's too long. There is a huge difference between a movie that gets off on the wrong foot and a movie made with a very long-winded-and-slow beginning. And I'm really surprised that I could see it. It starts off slow at the beginning, and then the story goes on without much progress. At least a third-rate remake should have some plot to add to the film, but in this case it never does. A very low rating for one of the worst movies of the summer. I was very annoyed at it, and even more upset with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was curious to see what sort of film this was going to be. I was hoping for a true horror-film film with some kind of gore, and horror. I had seen plenty of people who liked this movie and even some who were not fans. This movie fails to stick to any genre, even though it does have some of the best gore I've seen in a movie. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad and it felt like something for a film that didn't necessarily have any story, and the special effects were bad, even the actors weren't in character, and there were no suspense whatsoever. I don't understand why this movie is so disappointing. The main reason I was interested in this was to see for that film a sequel of this movie. I think it's because some people don't think for horror when watching horror movies, they just see it for a horror movie. They like to go to sleep as soon as they finish the movie, so this was a very depressing movie. It could have been a good movie, but it could never have been. It just had too many of the wrong types of scenes in the movie that made it a chore. The actors were just plain bad, and it just made me want to move away from it and leave the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It really sucked me out. It was a bunch of stupid stupid acting, bad writing, and a couple of really bad plot lines. I have to say I'm a fan of Mr. Anderson and Mr. Shekkenks, but this just wasn't funny at all. And I didn't like the way the ending was supposed to happen.  The two people I really liked in the film were the actors, who were fine but I just couldn't find any kind of connection with them. And it wasn't all so bad on those actors, although they were good. I just felt sorry for them. I really wish I could have seen some good film in this one, because I really despise bad comedies. I'm not even sure how people could see this one. I think the two people who are in the movie are not even the best actors in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie I wish I had never seen in my life. It is completely uninteresting and boring. It never gets any action and has a very bad acting. It seems to be based on the first person to read it. It's probably the worst movie ever made!  I'm hoping it's not too large. I don't see anything that has been put down this bad. I'm a movie buff and you just can't laugh, you have to look for a laugh. This is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I have seen the movie before it was released, I must note that most of the movie was a complete waste of my life, as the acting was terrible. The film starts off promisingly with a good start but then quickly becomes a complete mess. The storyline is nothing exciting, the characters are annoying and boring, the special effects and special effects are bad, the soundtrack is bad, and I would not even recommend watching this movie unless you have some tolerance for the music in it, or something really good. Overall this movie should be rated somewhere between 1 and 8, and even with the great special effects I can't even guarantee that it can survive in my opinion. I didn't know how such a terrible thing was possible, but if it was for my money it probably wouldn't even rank in the bottom of 10 or 15. I'd recommend avoiding the film, if you find it in a video store, or just see it on YouTube or Youtube, for an example of the worst thing you can find in a film: the worst I've ever seen in a horror film, with some good ideas but terrible execution. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a great premise and interesting premise in the concept, but not even that much. When the whole movie came crashing down at the start I was very confused and I couldn't understand what it was about. It's a movie that's simply not worth watching, that's boring and not entertaining enough to keep you interested. I was surprised that this was supposed to be a "great film" and I didn't even find out that it was a movie. This movie was just terrible, absolutely awful, and it had nothing in the end that could convince me to go back into the DVD. I found out that the whole cast was not in the world of good. I gave this movie a zero rating because I was just surprised that it had an audience. I've never read any other review about this movie and even heard about this one in the film club so I couldnno make a comparison with another bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you read the reviews on this movie, then this movie will be a disappointment. There's a couple of reasons why this movie is so bad. The first reason is the acting and the way the people are portrayed. The second reason is that it shows the only good movie on American TV. There was a nice family on the screen in this movie. That's not all bad, the acting is pretty good. The worst part about this movie was that it seemed to be all so desperate for money and there was so few other parts. That lead into a rather depressing and depressing movie. If you don't like films then spend your time watching this movie as a distraction. It wasn't for me, but for me it just seemed to bring a whole family of people to watch it. If that's what you want then just don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a bit of rubbish. The acting in this film was OK, though they weren't exactly good. I would think that the actors were just good, though a little bit too cute to be "smart". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even care about the characters, because this movie has terrible acting, not to mention bad writing. The people are all acting as acting for the stupid show they make. And even the main character is one dimensional, if they're not totally off their chops. That would mean the movie could be a good horror movie if the acting was not so bad, but it's too boring and has bad writing in a nutshell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely terrible in my opinion. The only good thing in this movie is the "Ranger vs. Fighter", which is a bit of a laugh when the plot is completely pointless. The movie seemed to be at least funny at times, but it had some of the worst dialog I have ever seen. Also, the first few minutes were a bit slow, which could have been easily fixed if the acting was better.  The other aspect of the movie is that the "Majura" story is a complete waste of time. You would expect to see the ending. Why was this an option?  It should have been an option for some people. It should get deleted. It could have easily been a comedy. It was very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish I was able to give the director credit for not making this movie a good one, for I'm a movie director (I'm a film director). I'm not a film fan of movies, but this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I mean there are things that are good and there are bad movies.  This movie is simply the wrong direction for a horror movie to be made, and I'm embarrassed to see you make it. Don't waste your time, get a decent movie: 1-4 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons why a movie this year cannot be made. 1. It has bad story lines. 2. And the acting is bad. And that is a problem for the people who like it. The story is about a teenager who is raped by a prostitute. (It's not an accident that the actress plays the prostitute.) One of the main characters has no real interest in the story, the other main character is a girl who falls in love with the prostitute, and the two main characters are both morally and physically incompetent. It seems as if the story is only the people.   The acting is so bad that it should be used for a joke, but if you use it as a comedy, it's bad enough.  The other problem with the movie is that there's no continuity between the two major moments of the movie, so the viewer cannot find out what's happening, especially in the middle part of the film when the rapist is in front of him. The other bad aspect is that it's not possible to predict what will happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never seen the first movie of this series before it was released and I was amazed that it had only 1 minute. I could not believe the writer and director actually wanted to make this garbage to be as horrible as it is. I would have just as much for the other parts of the film, but that's not what I'm interested in.  I would never go for such a terrible film. I really want to stop watching it if I could, but it won't happen soon. It's really a poor movie, but there's still some value in watching it because there are good things to say. There are only a handful of moments where the movie comes alive, the dialog is good and the story is not a horrible disaster like they made out in the film.  It would be a good idea to watch it, if only because it's not bad enough. I hope to see a better film with a better plot and story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of the same cheap gag-inducing antics that everyone complains about. I think the director should be fired for using the word "spice" to describe the movie. The movie is a complete disappointment, mainly because it does not provide a convincing storyline. Most of the scenes are simply a collection of people who pretend to be victims. The scenes are supposed to be part of the game but the acting is bad and the direction is poor. I can easily describe the plot as a lot of empty and pointless material that has to be explained. The dialog was also so bad that the characters didn't even speak. It's just bad and sad, but don't you need to see the movie to realize how awful this is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's so hard to believe that such a movie can be directed at the same price. The cinematography is simply horrible, too much of the same old stuff is just too much for the original movie. And what's worst, the special effects are awful, even if they were good in the original version. The music sounds like someone's taking the music seriously. And the sound effects, also, are terrible. I can't get any enjoyment out of watching this movie. There is no good score. A bad movie, and I'd suggest that you'd want to spend your life watching a movie with a bad soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst video I've ever seen. There were too many parts. A little bit of humor and an overall lack of humor for an otherwise good film, I can agree with, this is probably the worst I've seen. I can't really say I was a big fan of this film, but I did watch it once. It wasn't that good of course. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read the comments posted about this movie before I even finished it. I am very disturbed by the acting in this movie and the dialog. In some of the dialogues I believe they could not be understood by the narrator. The acting is awful and the acting is bad enough to be annoying to the people who want to sit through it and do a lot of things. The dialogue itself is horrible and the ending is bad. There is absolutely no room for progress. This is a film which could never been great. The story is weak and the people are not good, so even if you have seen it and want it again, it is not worth buying the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were plenty of good moments in this film. And they just don't work. The acting is weak, and the scenes are awful. The plot is so bad, so bad and so badly developed that it is impossible to relate to the film.  I really like the first film "Norman Sardu" and that film was a very good film. The film "The Lovers Of Heaven" may not be as bad as it is.  The acting here is just awful. There is too many things that are completely useless, and I am still trying to find a way to break this film down to even an inch to reveal what the film really is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film follows a man who has been hypnotized by his family (not even a teenager). He has a terrible control of every single thing, and he thinks that all of the people in the film are too stupid. He also finds out that his wife is having an affair with another man. Of course this is not a realistic story; but the guy is a fairly capable actor. The film is a disappointment, and a very bad way to end an otherwise interesting film. The whole thing is just a joke, and the movie is only at its most embarrassing when it starts in front of everyone on the street. The movie is also so bad that it becomes a caution against anyone thinking it is a true story. It doesn't even really make sense; there is no suspense, no tension, no suspense; and there is certainly no suspense.  If you want to see a comedy with a couple of "hits" that aren't "true stories", you should steer away from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking for a "scary" movie, you have to look at the "Bumblecorn" remake. I have been reading this book for years. I thought that it was an "fun" movie. It was pretty stupid, and stupid.  I was not impressed by this movie. I'm not expecting anything to be positive, even if it was for the time, but my guess is that it is completely pointless, boring, and just plain horrible. I think that it has a certain degree of success in making movies. I've never had such a bad film before, and I think it needs to be an average film or something like a "wastly" movie to go to the stage. I don't think it's in the right direction, because you aren't necessarily expected to enjoy watching a film like this (but that's the way to be entertained if you're really curious about a "horror film" for the first time).  I can't say that "Buffy" has anything to do with the "scare" genre, but it just isn't scary, and it is pretty dull. There's just nothing to do, and that's probably why I donth love it, although there are some moments when there is some sort of action going on. There are a lot of really bad jokes. This movie has some really bad actors, and you need to see more in the direction the movie was in (if you can see that) to get enjoyment out of the movie.  But the rest of the plot and the story is pretty weak. A lot of the dialog in the book is quite vague, and the characters in the books are a complete waste of their time.   It's not even worth taking a star rating, for it's a small movie, and even worse for a children. A pity, because I was really interested in it, and could have just been bored. It just has some good lines but no really interesting things happening in the movie, which does nothing to bring any enjoyment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a collection of four different movies, including the ones I listed above. I have to agree with those who thought the director tried hard to make a funny movie. He tries hard to fit humor into a script, but his writing is so bad that it's not funny.  I'm not sure if the director is still alive or if he's trying to make funny films, but I can't answer that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can only take one person with a bad film, and you will probably find them in the comments below.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched, ever. What's that? The first one I gave my review is "Stacie's Love" where they showed that Stacie was a little bitch.  The second one is "Mama's Revenge". What happened here? How could Stacio have gone so far as to kill her husband? This is another awful movie. The best part about the movie is when the women and Stacian go into a room together to see a movie. When Stacial and Arie are on the couch, they get the idea that she is using them to watch movies. In fact, she is so desperate for money that she asks her sister to buy a new TV. Then, she shows them how she's playing the movie. It is so bad that you are afraid to walk in to it when it is playing.   The third one is a movie about a couple of high school students that is supposed to be a drama for the kids, because the students' parents are in the room and want to get out of the movie quickly. What happens? The students who are in on the show have their hands and feet tied to their mouths. The couple that has "a big nose" that has a nose stuffed with a nose and a small hand.  They end up falling into the television. The woman is screaming about the horror show that is about a girl that has never wanted to be good. This is a horror film about a woman who has never been good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't comment on this bad movie. I was hoping to get a decent review and that I can comment on a good movie, even though it was just a few minutes in and was fairly predictable, I wasn't really sure what was going to happen to the acting.  But it wasn't just bad, it was downright disappointing. This isn't a bad film at all, in fact it was quite fun to watch (I just wish it would improve). I can not comment on the acting, I would rate it as a decent, but it really wasn't a movie. The whole movie was just annoying, I couldn't think of anything else, that's how bad this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst. It was a bunch of three scenes. The ending didn't make it seem more credible, but it wasn't a major disaster either. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad and the whole thing was lacking in a good-movie sense.  What's up with that?! Oh, the story is very weak, and the acting is so bad. The dialog wasn't that good, even the characters were weak.  There was the scene in the restaurant when the characters tried to get the money back, and then they didn't actually get it. It seemed like they were trying to avoid getting it themselves, and that's where the magic comes in. It wasn't the case of being drunk or having a car accident. The scene where a black man's hand is on the table, and it seems like the hand was his or his wife, and he had his wife and kids in the car too. They were in the diner, but why was he in the kitchen? It seemed pretty strange.  The scenes with the black man who gets away from him and gets robbed are supposed to be a horror movie, but the movie doesn't take from the film any real meaning. This is just a horrible script. The best version of it could have been a better version of the movie.   The scene when the black woman and the men in the hotel, where one of them was in the middle of the scene, is ridiculous. What was the point of the story? The black guy got away from them, and they were supposed to get mad because he was stealing his family's money, and made the people in the phone hotel mad? This is a long, un-made film, why would you want to waste time here? And, in the end, it's pretty weak. It's one of those horror movies. Some people have commented that it should have been an hour longer and less depressing. That's the only thing this movie has good for is to remind you that you're probably getting ready to vomit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've wasted the last few hours of this film's existence, with my hopes for the first time to finally discover this film and learn from its own flaws. And I'm going to hate the film, which has been, as I said, awful. But this film has more than one flaw, and I'm even less interested in seeing this movie's existence and wonder if I'd like to go and buy it on Amazon, where I'll be forced to rent one of their movies or watch them from the convenience store.  This film is not only an unsatisfactorious piece of film-writing that fails in even a rudimentary way, but it's also painfully boring. This film could be easily relegated to a film school, so I'm afraid I'll get sucked into it, and find myself falling into the same rut again. But I don't even need that kind of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole thing of the original Star Wars is this plot and special effects. I've seen that movie 3 times now, and it wasn't good. This movie fails because there is absolutely nothing left to the story, no plot, no special effects, no dialogue, no even a special effects for the scene at the beginning. The main reason is because this movie is so weak that it takes itself seriously out of shape.  I have only one word that sums up the badness of this movie: "Why?" It has nothing to do with politics, or religion, or what anyone really says, it is just a plot, nothing more. That's it, and if you are going to see this movie, don't. It's awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fairly normal film fan, and I am only mildly curious to watch the new "Unofficial" version because I don't think the other people seem to care much for this "film". But the first thing I've done was find out to watch it in movie theaters, then go to video store (I can easily rent it, even though it has just 2 minutes of "fun" in the middle of it), and then watch it again (I'm very lazy). Since then I decided to see it again, but I guess I was only slightly curious. The other problem with this movie was that it had no dialogue whatsoever.  Now that I've seen it, I will have to report back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie's a poor excuse for being a film, but the reviews at the end make it look like one of a bunch of low budget films. It's full of clichs and clichés and it doesn't work properly. Also, some scenes are surprisingly not funny, which is probably the point of a lot of this film. It is a very poorly directed, extremely boring, and a poorly written story. But it does go for an interesting premise, though it's too slow and disappointing to be funny. Also a lot too quickly falls apart, and it's very pointless to have a story.  The story and characters of the movie are not funny enough to have anything to do with the film, and they're too slow, too slow to get a rise in interest. The plot and story is pretty linear, but not very exciting.  This film has two interesting qualities, the first one is that the movie has several pretty big names, and the second one is the fact that it has only two main characters. Two people who are very different from each other. I didn't mind, but I thought that the film would be better if there were more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been listening to all the reviews about this film for the last 5 years. It is not a comedy and it is not even a thriller. It just feels like an amateur film! I was a child when I saw it on my 8th birthday, and I still can't figure out what it is about. The story is so bad!  I think the actor was the biggest obstacle to this film, and you need to get out the whole thing and have a look at it, and then you need an hour to watch the film again. This film must be very expensive, and it's not as good a film as a comedy or a thriller, but it has one or two good scenes and it will not give you a big-picture feel. If you want to see a good movie, like "Babakni" or "Makni", or "Yayali" or whatever other horror film you want, get it before it. It's not a great horror film and it should be made for the Indian film critic but if you want something like a film that actually has some idea of the film's greatness, then it's good to watch. And the last part of the movie is so disappointing. There is no story, and the lead actor is nothing, but he is able to act better than the other leads in the other movies.  There are too many jokes in it, but the ending is so weak! If you like horror or comedy, then you may enjoy it, just not a horror film.  I am a big fan of horror films and this one doesn't fit for this type of film and doesn't even fit for Indian horror fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An awful film, the worst I've seen from a good film was this one (not the worst as the others, but still way to go in the "crazziness" category). The acting is bad, the dialog, the plot is stupid, the camera is bad (the good camera work is good, the good direction is good), the acting and the camera work are not good for the series, and the acting is laughable(and some of the characters are ridiculous). The plot is not good either, and there are some parts that are very good, but don't expect much from the actors.  What else?  I am absolutely delighted to have the series on, the acting, the scenery, and and the art of the series. I cannot recommend it any further. I did, of course, enjoy the series when they were good, and still wish to see it again, but it is just plain bad and disappointing, and I'm sorry for all of the stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to see more of this film before seeing it on my DVD purchase. When I was watching the movie I thought it would be good, and it is pretty bad. I get the feeling that the movie is just bad, and I can't see a positive review about it, so I gave it a low rating.  I can only find it on a 10, so i guess the video is not good quality, but if you like it for any reason, it is definitely not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title indicates, this movie isn't very original. It is a complete disaster.  However, it's not really a horror movie. It's not an action movie, but it has a few good thrills. However, the plot doesn't have enough substance to be suspenseful. There are too many pointless things about the plot, and the actors don't do well. Some of the dialog are poor, but most of them aren't particularly funny.  There's a lot of false advertising. There is an entire chapter about a woman who comes back from the dead and is sent into an old house to die. Then her children have an accident and the wife is set to die again...then there's a plot about the wife's mother...then a plot concerning the old man's daughter...then another plot about a dead woman with a dead daughter. All these plots are just one-jokes and they don't create much excitement.  This movie lacks the qualities that are usually reserved for horror movies, like gore and gore; the acting is also weak. It also lacks even a hint of suspense, although the movie's director had an eye for a horror film that wasn't a horror.  Some of this movie's plot is clever, but the overall movie has a disappointing ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director and screen-maker, who actually directed this film, had to create an entirely different storyline to this film. The plot, where the main female characters are in their own apartments, is the very story which was supposed to be the focus of the film. It is obvious that they could have had a better story than theirs. It's clear that the filmmakers were never going to have much creative or creative thought in terms of the characters' relationships and the relationships with each other. It shows that they were just trying to create the world of their story, and that they weren't able to develop it, which is obviously the worst film in that genre.   It is hard to believe that the directors actually had any idea what they were doing, considering the low-budget film which made the case so well for its genre. They should be embarrassed by this kind of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director tries to do something that should have been done before. Instead of this "real life" film we get a cheesy "I'm really sorry for my sister" ending. The characters are bad. The script is not good. The director is bad and is not interesting. The movie is boring. The lead actor was in a very bad movie. The supporting actors are okay, but there are a lot of them and they are not good actors. They just repeat a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is interesting, there are some funny lines, some of the scenes were amusing, but it's just plain terrible. I was hoping that it would have a funny ending, and even a few funny moments. I thought that it had at least one good scene.  But the rest was terrible. It is about the same quality I feel when I look at a bad film: really stupid, without some funny jokes. I couldn't laugh, and the scenes are just awful, and I didn't know if it would affect anybody.  Overall, I don't recommend this movie unless you want to spend some money, even if you really like the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if this film was based on a bad Italian movie, but it is pretty amusing to see the actor's acting. This film was awful. The actors are all really bad. I can't believe they were given any decent acting; the one that was interesting was a little bit shy and a sad. The other actors were not so good, either. And the movie was made in the late 1990's, so there isn't a lot to enjoy in it.  If you want to watch this film, don't. I'll tell you the answer if you get the answer to the questions in the film--I've seen two or three people who have answers on this--but this doesn't make any sense at all. I'd be curious to find out who is in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this movie in the late 1980's and have been trying to make it better and better. It is just too bad. I have to agree with all other reviewers that this movie isn't very good, but it is interesting in its oddities. If this is an example of bad comedy I would give it the first five years for comedy in Japan, if it is the worst comedy of all time, I think that would be the worst.    For this movie, I would like to find some of the old classics (as in the beginning of the 19th century) and give this film as a bad comedy. It needs to be rated as one point, if for some reason this film is a comedy (and I believe it would be one point) but I would not give it this rating as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a good movie. I'm not going to give it credit for having one good movie, but I will give this movie a 3 out of 10. There are no funny dialog, no funny characters, and no interesting plot. The character that is being portrayed is an obnoxious and pathetic person. The only reason I give this film the 1 out of ten is because the actor is really good. Still, if you enjoy this movie, I would recommend you take it, but don't watch it if you're looking for a good sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand the premise. A woman takes a bath. Her partner is in the bathroom with her, and then suddenly takes off. He gets in the bath with her in front of his house with his daughter. It plays out like the film from the 1940's. A nice woman gets a bath and suddenly gets in front and leaves on the stairs.  The film starts with a bunch of teenagers who are in a bad situation. One is called "the slut" for all her life and hates her. A guy is called a "rat" for her life, and he is in "the girl" for a long time, but now he has got the girl back. She doesn't want him to leave, so she goes to him in the house with him and his son. They are in the kitchen, and the door is locked. It doesn't make sense. Then the mother and father meet and she is given the "the bitch", the only female who thinks she can do this sort of thing. She gives her husband the bath, but she never gets back in the next step, and it ends up in a fight over him, then in an argument over her kids.  This is the kind of crap that parents would watch together. It's not like the 1950's where you have an hour to watch a movie and it's over before you have finished. The girls are all in their early 20's, and there is no real drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a movie to make no sense at all, don't read this book. Avoid all of these stupid moments. Avoid the pointless parts. If you don't see the movie at all and can't take out the book, don the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Inception" is a pretty decent comedy, but it's a complete disaster. The movie starts with this plot line. There's two different people that take the lead roles. One of them is a drug addict, another one is a killer. One person gets stabbed, another gets chased into the bushes by some guys who want to shoot him. He's dead, then they decide to have him to see his buddy. That also leads into a plot. The plot is pretty weak, the characters aren't even able to act, and the storyline is unbelievable.  There's a bunch of stupid, pointless dialogs, and even some bizarre facial expressions. Just what the hell did those people think was going to happen?  I think the acting is very bad, but that's just the beginning. I could see an improved film, but I don't know if this is one of the "best" films ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is fairly predictable and predictable but the execution is bad.  It just goes against the spirit of the show. I don't find any funny line or scene, just horrible jokes.  There were interesting moments to be found in the pilot episodes, but not much. The plot seems to have no real substance and the acting is terrible -  I have to find the ending of the movie and I do find it a bit amusing, at least for the second half of the film.  I was watching this show as I were watching the original pilot for the series, and although the plot was decent enough, the execution were a failure. A complete waste of money, no funny lines or funny ending, and a poorly written script.   I only rated this movie because the pilot was interesting to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure what the first step would be here, i'm not a big fan of this one, but it's funny. the movie is nothing great, except there are some scenes in the end, and some of the music (i think i get it for most of the movie) is very bad and very sad. it can't even be mentioned that the actors are pretty good, except for the lead girl and the other girl who are quite good. i'd prefer to have this movie somewhere else. don't watch it if you hate like gotham-gotham. I don't know if it was released in the early days or it's not gonna be too good. it's bad as a plot, it's horrible as a gag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never really got into this movie, and I was afraid it would be so bad. The story was pretty good and not really bad. However, the director managed to slip in a bunch of stupid jokes that were half-hearted and totally unintentional. I don't think that the film was totally bad, but it was definitely a disappointment. The acting is pretty poor, and the acting was fairly predictable and so bad that it was difficult to believe that they actually could take a breath and think. Of course, it would have been great if they were actually good actors. I feel that the director really needed to see what was happening. I really think that if you like the concept of this film, then you would like to avoid it. If you like this film then, enjoy the rest of the films it comes with. But this isn't really a film at all. It really isn't like a great movie, at least not like a really great movie. It isn't a good movie, but a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After all the hype for the latest Batman film this movie looks like a rip off from the Superman movies. The plot is bad, the special effects are bad, and there's nothing at all to recommend it. In contrast, the newest Batman film in its own way seems to be much better than the previous one.  I think there's a lot to recommend this movie. Don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I'd be more surprised if the director had gotten a job somewhere, with a few job offers and a new life under his leadership. Instead, he should have gone for the job in Hollywood. The film doesn't seem like a film to me, but it is about as good as most modern low-budget movies. If there is nothing else, why bother? Maybe it is just a few days before the movie premieres, but my guess is that the movie would go under before the premiere.  I would have liked to see some good action sequences and some dialogue. But, the movie fails miserably. If I could just look at some other movies from the same studios, I would rate this at a 1 or 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie 2 stars for its mediocre-to-average performance. It has a bad ending and a disappointing ending. But I still have a hope of the movie. The acting is not good and the acting is bad. You have to watch it with the intent on being a horror movie, but you don't know that! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that keeps you from really appreciating this garbage movie is the wonderful and charmingly portrayed characters. But there's a couple of problems. First of all, the script is fairly predictable and nothing funny is shown in this movie, so your mind gets into some serious mess. I'm sure there are some interesting parts, but it just doesn't make it through. I also didn't really find much comedy in this film. This film is supposed to be a comedy, but when it is, it becomes pathetic and disgusting. The most amusing thing in this whole mess was the end-caper scene when the two guys put on their sunglasses and show off. You won't find anything funny after this scene, because this movie is just one more of those depressing, brainless comedies that don't have a chance to break out. What a waste of time.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you like watching funny movies, then you might enjoy it. But if you want to waste a few hours of your life and go see some good movie like "My Wife Is Getting Older". Or, just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was some kind of a comedy with too many problems. The acting was a mix of predictable and unoriginal; the story is not really a story, and the story would be a story if you could figure it out without being too much of a clue. You could get lost by it.  I didn't care that I was wasting money watching this, I felt like it was so bad it would break me, that I would have to watch it. Even the good part of it had problems. I guess it has probably gone through some revision or rebalance. I'm looking to see the new one, which I hope will be pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst ever I have seen from the horror genre. It is one of the worst movies I've seen since. I would not recommend it as a horror flick, but I think it is bad as a comedy, which is something most people like don't do.  The script and story are just flat. I cannot believe this was the director of this movie. I know I'm not gonna cry about it, but it would be so funny if it was a comedy. I was not expecting much of a scare. I knew the film would never make it. I really liked this film for a few weeks, but after seeing it, it was way too long. I'm hoping it wasn't one of some DVD extras like the Paranormal Thriller in its review because it was so bad. The soundtrack is bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although the film looks interesting, it is not worth watching as it is a short treat from the late 1980's. This film is an example of why it is always been hard to get a good film out of an industrial-studio, especially at the hands of a German director. As a German film director, you have to get used to the film's dull production style and make sure not to follow the script to the end, because there is no clear indication about what the script is or how to proceed. The screenplay is devoid of detail and simply does not make sense. The film starts off so badly and takes so long to develop. You can't see what happens, you cannot see the next scene, and finally you get bored with watching the next 10 minutes and have to start cutting away. By the time you have seen the last 30 minutes, you are bored by it, and want to go on with another movie to end this movie. But it would be nice if this film was actually a "smart" film. It is just one of the many stupid American films, this one among others like "Honey Goes to Country", "The Incredible Bodies", and "The War Of Nood". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never expected this film to be that bad when I read the reviews. This one isn't bad as a horror flick, but it really comes off as one more long attempt. I'm still trying to avoid watching the whole thing, but I don't have to. I'd like to see the film's story to be more coherent. It's still bad. I donut want it to be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading this movie as it comes out. When I saw it, I thought that I was watching one of "The Family" movies. I didn't know that it was really "A Touch of God" when I saw the title. My boyfriend didn't have to watch it, and I was really surprised that I actually paid to rent this movie. It was so bad that I didn´s think I had to watch this one, I was worried.  I think it's bad because the actors that did this script are just plain bad. This movie sucked, and if you watch this movie, don´t think I can hear you, if you are a fan of any good film, then I´ll have to say it was crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can think of several things that were supposed to be there, and I'm not sure why they decided to include one or not. A movie with the only actor to carry on the narrative, that's the one whose name made it famous, was never released in the US. And one who was supposed to carry the story on, also has to be included in the film. How did I think about it? The story is pretty convoluted and boring and there's no redeeming factor at all, except the fact that the people involved in the plot are very boring, but they have other good points of interest. If I'm being nit-headed, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever watched. What made it worse? You know the only way to end a movie: the viewer has to sit through all the endings and find out that the story is very weak. Then, after you watched it, you have to sit to think why the characters are so flawed that they can't make anything useful, or why their characters can't have anything in common with each other. That was about a 30 minute film, which was very disappointing, because I can't recommend anything about it, because it's not only terrible, it's practically unbearable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie for years, and only once was it. And it's only been a couple of times. The actors did good job. Some are good, but there's no redeeming quality in the cast. I cannot recommend this movie, but I do find that the ending was disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping to watch this movie for the movie of this year. I got bored for 4/5/6 of my life on this movie. I was very disappointed.  I am so angry with this movie as it is so bad. I would recommend it to anyone who's hoping to see a bad, but don't. I wish the director and producer knew what their mistake was. The plot is really awful, but the acting is very bad. They are all acting as usual crap-juggling the people who the other characters are talking to. The female actor was not good, but I'm not going to write anything positive about her acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard the name of this film before. The name is "Dice". It looks like a typical B-movie. The only problem I have with it is that it looks so bad. I think the movie is so bad because it is a little too long and not paced well. I don't know how I could have even gotten bored watching this movie. I would have to sit back and watch it again just to forget it. I just didn't like this movie for the worst movie I've ever seen.  I mean, I can see a few bad things in movies, but this is one of the worst. What I had hopes to have in this movie was an entertaining film about a girl who was kidnapped, and then released into a museum. But this movie isn't funny. If you're interested in that, you can just skip it and stay away from it. This is a typical kind of B-genre fare. I'm a huge fan of the original "Dish Your Dreams", but that wasn't funny in itself. It's just like an obvious plot twist. You can't even laugh about it, since you are already bored.  The ending is pretty unbelievable. It could have been the funnier in a few scenes. The movie made it sound like a soap opera with a lot of gore. A little bit of good humor comes in the final credits. The ending credits are annoying, but don't expect anything else. There are no real surprises. It should have a decent plot, but it still falls apart due to a lack of a real story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why I thought this film was such a good movie when I saw it. It starts with a really silly scene. They are at a restaurant with a bunch of strangers and there is a very obvious sign of racism. It seems that the guy at the other table is the only person that isn't white. He has black skin and he's probably in a lot of debt. I really had to agree with the sign in the diner sign before I saw this movie. There was a lot worse racism in this movie than in the first one. There is absolutely no racism. I give this movie a rating of 1. This is not as good a horror film as many people think it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I recommend taking an hour or two to go watch it again. Unfortunately I only had one half of a good movie in this movie. I didn't really enjoy it. I think this movie was just a poor attempt at making a cult movie. It needs to be a parody. It was very disappointing to see some of my favorite actors and actresses do this. The plot is pathetic, it is too long and there is no payoff. And it has the unfortunate of being a comedy, which is usually the most predictable comedy in the world. I don't expect anything positive from this movie because it fails so bad as a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish I could find out an movie like this one. I'm not even a horror buff, but these guys don't know how to make horror movies. This is like some of the old, out-of-the-way horror movies that are just plain bad. Some of those have a very good soundtrack, but most don't.  I'm also afraid of the kids in this movie, though they were OK, but they were terrible actors. They didn't know what the hell they were doing. The acting is bad! I was pretty upset after watching the movie because I couldn't see any of the characters. The first act was the story and the second was the chase scene, and it was way too long. There were many times that the film went straight to an interesting chase scene with the hunters, but that was not enough. They had their own rules to go to the chase. It's not like a movie that could make you watch it without losing interest. The only time I enjoyed was the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first film I ever saw, and I never had any reason to believe it. The main question seems to be whether the film should have been made. The movie starts off like a movie of late teenaged boys doing stupid things. They don't really do anything! Well, the way this movie is structured is very predictable. There's not a lot of suspense for us to guess. The story is pretty stupid, but not really funny, it just a bit slow and very pretentious. The acting is not that good. If you're looking for a straight-up horror film, I'd skip it. However, if you're going to enjoy a low-budget horror film with a lot action, you're gonna get lost, because nothing is quite as suspense-filled as this movie. If this is actually a comedy, then don't even watch it. Unless you've seen "Gore" (The Real Life of Gore), you're definitely going to get lost.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching one of those movies I can't even call it a "true story", I cannot even have that idea. This was truly a waste of time, money, and money that I could only imagine. I hope this movie will never get any higher than the one in the video below.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie of the whole year. It's all done by a group of comedians, who I don't understand why they are still using their names, even though the first five minutes of the movie are worth watching.  They try to go for all of the clichés from movies and movies, and the result is not only bad, but extremely bad. They try their best to make the movie less funny than the TV show in the first episode. That is a complete mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd just got a hold of the movie's first preview when I looked at it on video. I'd say if you watch this flick to "spy" in a school or for a school with children, please don't watch it and just watch it on the DVD. I'm sure it'd be funny, but it's not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the little girl with no legs, who is a major drug addict, and his father, with no arms, is the main interest of this movie. The story is so bad that I think it's more like a soap opera than an animated film. The only way I found out that this was so bad was because I thought it was an animated movie.  There is a reason why so many people liked "Beggs" when it was a live-and-play film. However, the way it was here is so poor that it could not stand the test of time. This movie fails to deliver anything close to what Beggs was intended to be. I could have done a better adaptation to a soap or drama film, but the fact that this movie doesn't have a story and plot at the same time as it was filmed has made me think twice about this. There is no good story, no good ending. You never get any hope that the characters would ever get through the drama. The characters have problems that they want to fix, and they want the problems to solve, but it's impossible to make them happen, as it keeps going. The little girl who was in an apartment that had a broken door (I think it was broken because it wasn't there) would constantly act like she didn't want to live or that there was an apartment to go in with her, so the drug addicts would just leave the apartment. If they didn't pay a little something to the building's inhabitants, you couldn't get them out of the way and be on the same page with the girl who's not a drug addict. I didn't see a lot of that in the original, but that's good enough reason why people liked it. The main character was just a typical small town kid, who wanted to be an addict, but a drug dealer was just waiting to get his drug addict father to buy it for him. This is not a movie about anything, just a story, nothing, and not a good story. The ending had just the ending, and there wasn't even a story.  If you liked it before and still like it, I warn you to not see this film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although, I don't think that this movie could be easily made to be any good movie. I don'cha think this movie should have been better than the first one, which was so bad I didn't even bother to watch it. There are many things in the film that were wrong to see. For example, the voice of the main character is quite loud but at the same time it is hard to hear him and he's not the kind of a person that you would want to see in the real world. The movie also failed in other ways, like the music of the opening song was wrong to be in this movie. You know, I was a little kid and I wanted to have a music that was pretty well done. I can watch all songs and give myself what I want so what am I to do? How I'd describe it, the music is not loud and it has an average tempo, not high. And it isn't good as a musical soundtrack, if you know what is to happen when a character is listening to a song.   The character who has been acting in movies since the days of the silent days are not doing much acting. His character, in contrast, is a very weak actor. This would be just the same as a person who has a deep psychological problem.  What would be good if he wasn't in pain. What would good if we didn't have more problems like this?  The main character in the movie is a psychopath, and he murders people in his basement in search for the cure. He can't get what he wants.  His parents want to hide from him and to kill his parents. He kills the first person who tries to use his parents' place in life.  If you want to be entertained, try something from Hollywood or the TV show "Lucky Man" instead of this movie, even if you're not willing to watch something stupid like this movie and go through the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie from my apartment in Vancouver, when it was supposed to be about the "Dramatase," and it seemed to get so out of my expectations. I figured it would be an epic Hollywood film of the '80s. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to that level. Instead, it seemed more like a bad remake of "The Matrix," and even worse, like "Iron Man 3," that movie is about the same thing in one way or another. There was nothing resembling a plot. Instead of the film's plot, the story and dialogue were really boring. There were some of the best lines in the movie and the movie's voice acted was decent, but the scenes were not well-drawn, and I don't even know how anyone would expect a plot line to be that good.  Even after watching the film, it was really annoying and disappointing. The best part about it was when the guys were in the car and they were all laughing about how they were going to pass out of the tunnel and be able to drive the whole night in one car. They laughed and they laughed and laughed about how ridiculous they were being. That could have been one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie. It just made me wonder how this could have happened.  There is absolutely no explanation of what they did or why it was happening. The movie was supposed as a romantic comedy. I did not even understand why, but that made it so much worse.  The most disappointing part of the movie is the ending. They don't give you an explanation of the story, so you are left wondering what the hell they are doing. They then go on and remind you that, it is after the car explodes, and that the guys drive off in their car, and the next thing you see is a guy with a gun.  How much of that was actually made? The movie just had some "dramatic" music tracks at the end.  It was one of those films that have been remade, and it has been made to look like a film and nothing more. It was really the only "realistic" movie I have ever seen that has been so far. The story was pretty bland, and there was nothing about the ending, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film features only one good scene, this being when I caught up with the scene where the other characters all get to see this character at the same time as the person they were dealing with. I have a feeling like this film is full of crap. I understand some people have probably just been fooled into seeing it as some "unreal" film. But if you have nothing else, you might like it as a horror film... but don't just like it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happens with a movie: you get sucked into a very dull plot and then proceed to find out what is going on in the real world to make this movie, i. the world actually doesn't have an end. That's not even an accurate description of the world, because it is a lot of the same stuff that has been happening to people in real life; the same things that are happening in a world that is going to be completely different from the real one; such as the weather, the scenery, the weather patterns, the country's politics, the race relations... all of the things that happen in real-life are different from what happens in a movie. If the "film" is so bad that I could describe it as a "real life movie" then I'm sure I would be doing a lot worse. It's also a very bad way to go into a movie, since it involves a lot more drama, and since it's not really a movie you can watch and it doesn't need to have an overall narrative.  In a way, I can just assume that people in the film have the same mentality and mindset as the people in Real Life. They have the exact same mentality, and the same psychology. The only thing that has made them a true cult is their attitude towards the world and the world's attitude towards it.   I do find this movie annoying, as it is, and I think that it should be put down immediately. But it's funny, though. It has a few nice moments of humor (like a couple of silly jokes that one of the main actors says at the beginning). The other problem I have is that the actors and some of the other characters are so annoying that even I cannot see the actor in it. They're just there, sitting at their hotel with all of these characters at their tables, acting in their scenes. I think it would be better if there were a way to let the actors use their powers of their movies to do something. It is so hard to get into the mindset and attitude of these people that I can't see them in a film. They just make their characters look and act stupidly and there's no real emotion. It seems that the film producers of this movie have also failed to take the time to use the actors to create interesting and interesting characters. They don't realize how hard it is to create the kind of scenes that make the film work.  The film has a pretty weak
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a 7 rating because it had some nice moments. However, this film just seemed silly. I think the actors were good, but just didn't do any right things. The acting and the story were okay, but they were so bad that they didn't matter. I gave it a 8 rating because the story was good, although it seemed to be out of nowhere and the characters were just plain awful. Overall, it's a total waste of money, no story to this film and really didn't entertain anything. In the end, it probably wouldn't even make up for the 4/10 rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dressed in black" has to be one of those awful films that we've seen many times before. I remember a movie that had this same problem in the 90's, and I'm sure I'll see a movie like that one if I saw it again. A little girl (the one that was supposed to be dressed in black) has been killed in a car park with her friend, and her family is concerned about her mother (and her partner) and the kid's dad is killed in their car. The girlfriend at the park is a stripper (who wants to get a big job in a nightclub or club). After a few months of this, the kid (whose name is Tessa and is kinda like the blonde teenager you probably recognize) is killed and killed again. But you have to have patience because the rest of the movies of this series is about nothing but garbage, so no one can blame you for wanting to see this movie. I wouldn't even care if they were only one out of a million. And I mean the movie is about a dead boy who is in his own house and is sleeping alone. Why are you surprised if they had been dead, or if they did? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An exclamation on a bad Disney film:  A terrible adaptation of the popular Disney fairytale, which is full of cliché jokes, low budget, and a bad, disappointing sequel.  The movie is based on a novel by Richard Curtis, a Canadian author who wrote the book on which this film is based. This was supposed to be an original work, but it turns out that there wasn't. I really did like the book, but the DVD, in particular, is a disappointment. The movie begins with a scene of a "winchester man" who is a fireman, and his brother, "a fireman". It then turns into a scene with a woman and a man in the woods. The next scene is a man's head being severed, which leads the two women to believe that the man had died in order to preserve his head for some reason. However, there is no way to prevent the men from finding out about the dead fireman and his family.  We get two women and a woman in a firehouse in Maine. This is the start of the movie and the plot seems to go back to the novel. And, apparently, we don't want to see how that plot works, because the women and their father just arrive at the firehouse where the men are looking for a dead body of a fire guy. It then goes downhill. The women have to face the fireman in order for him to kill off the body of fireman.  In a scene where the woman is in the middle of making an escape, a fire engine is used to get rid of the police that are looking at the scene of the fire, and the police is suspicious about the woman. However...a man with a fireproof hat is waiting on the fire engine with an unusual weapon. This weapon is used by the man to strike the woman, and it accidentally knocks off a fire man.  You get a couple of flashbacks of the man's life, but they don't work.  When she returns from the fire house, the scene is nearly a repeat of the scene with the woman in the wood shop. This time there are two women with firemen with the same fire engine coming to the woodshop. The scene is interesting, but not particularly realistic, since it takes place in a wooden house with no firemen.  But...there are two more things that do not work. There is a scene in which the woman and the firemen's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst thing ever. I mean it sucks as much as an original movie. The only thing that makes this movie interesting is that the actors and the actresses who have played the role of a child are now in a coma. The story is so sad and so stupid it could be funny if they were just a child.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie somewhat interesting when it was first aired in 1993, but it's no longer cool. This movie is even worse than the one that was made by a movie studio named the "Dixie Ruck." It just has the name of a movie producer and I don't think that's much of a difference. I also believe that the film is a complete insult of the male (and female) audience. But it's the worst movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has no redeeming qualities of anything. there is no plot or dialog to speak of any real meaning. it is simply a simple'slasher' movie that could be described as a 'horror movie', that is not even remotely believable. and that's not a mistake. i am also a big fan of the 'Twister' series, and that is what it is really about - just as 'blood-filled' slasher films go, there is nothing at all to this one except to expect that there are consequences, and there is little more than the usual'slashers' - which were used as little as possible for the entertainment of anyone. this movie just makes slasher/sleders look pathetic in a way that does not even warrant any rating, even for a low price. but it doesn't hurt for any of it's effects. I don't know why this has made such a'slash' flick, but I have to give it a chance to get some 'playtime' money for it, since the 'blood' series is one of their best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story has a lot of elements, and the acting is weak at all. The only good thing about this movie was that it was pretty entertaining, and that the story was good.  The overall performance, though, I found the movie somewhat funny, and I didn't like it. There were some funny scenes, and a good one was the scene with the little girl playing around. But it just wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life. The movie starts with the horrible ending at the beginning. There is no plot, no plot plot, and no plot twists. The plot was so weak that I almost laughed. I was hoping that they could get the time to finish the movie and show a good ending. I also want to see the director (Stephen Wolf) make an attempt to make a movie like the original. The guy did a great job in making the original, but he failed in making this sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really shocked that this film was released. In the beginning I didn't know what it was. This film has absolutely zero originality. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, and there is no story in it to speak about the future. There isn't even one story, just one ending. This movie is so badly acted that you don't know how the hell you're supposed to feel when you see it. It is also really bad in the editing. I don't understand where this movie is supposed to take place. It's all wrong to be in this movie, since it should be in the movie. It says nothing about the world, the future, or how it is going to be, since its very fucking scary to see how many horrible things are going to happen. And the other person in the film is in his underwear, and when you do the first scene it is really scary. This is also bad in a lot of ways. I really don't believe that anyone would like this movie and I think it was an insult to a lot more people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film with my girlfriend, who is an aspiring film actor (who is also a writer). Her first line with the writer was about how it would be best to avoid the obvious obvious ending; i think it was just a bad line. She would have liked it if the writer and the actor didn't make a horrible movie. I give this movie a 1 because it is a lot of bad and just a bunch of recycled plot lines and awful acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can say it was disappointing but what made me laugh was the fact that the script reads like a soap opera type thing.  And the worst part is that the movie is so bad that it's impossible to enjoy. The story could have been better. But for this to be a movie to get any respect it has to be very bad. To be fair to the guy who made the movie it must be worth its own...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea why they're taking their "film" of this to "play" and i'm sure they don't mind me and I'm not a huge movie buff. They are not a great actor and that has to be the case. They don't have a proper acting skill to have that feeling when they don' get to "face" all these strangers who want to show off their skin. So I guess they just thought they'd make it interesting. The fact that the people in the movie all do "the scene" in the story is also stupid and the scenes are a complete waste of time. I was listening to these two guys and their conversation when i first saw the movie and their characters are totally contrived with no real plot lines.   What makes me think that they're a film studio, not a video company? I mean they're just playing a movie. If the fact that it is "filming" doesn't make them think that it's good, then why don't they "play?" It just makes them annoying and there's no reason for them to go off and make movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the film in New York, and was surprised that it was so bad - I was about to turn it out of my hard drive. I couldn't believe the people that would rent it. I paid the rent for the movie, and then I was off to go to New York and see the film for its own. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly look like a horror film. I was hoping that it would be at least mildly entertaining - but it was much worse than that. A horror film is, of course, an excellent way to watch an old film in a slasher, but this isn't even a slaset, it has an obvious, self-conscious tone and even an obvious plot. The scenes are poor, the direction is poor, and the acting is bad. If you really want to watch this film, go for the horror of The Evil House, which is only half of The Dark Eye, and even then. Otherwise, you will see yourself being annoyed by the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good moments. "A Real House of Pain" is a pretty bad, but it contains some good jokes and one good gag. Some people who didn't like "A Really Bad Movie" may like it, but most people didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really surprised when i saw this movie. What was the worst thing I have ever seen of this movie? And what's the worst movie? I have to be honest, the movie is bad as all...  I'm guessing this movie was meant to be a shocker (if so). There is absolutely no plot and there are no plot.  The entire thing is to be made as cheap as possible. It's supposed to be scary in some way... but it's not funny at all and it's really not scary. I can't even sit in a theater and pretend to watch it because I'm so embarrassed. And I have been warned to watch this movie only after it was released.  This movie is very annoying and extremely bad. The music is awful, too bad. No story whatsoever, no plot, no suspense. The acting is bad, too, and the acting is absolutely bad. It is simply awful. The movie is just so bad that it's hard to watch and will make anyone look back in dismay (the movie actually contains a lot of money and movies like this one should have a screen).  The best of the horror movies made in Hollywood was "Halloween" (the only one that can compete with "Scary movies). There are no more movies like that. This movie has absolutely no story, no story whatsoever. The best horror movies in the entire world right now are "Cenac, Moom" and "Tarantino 2". And, in fact, this movie has little more than three actors. They are two of the actors.  But in any case,  I really don't recommend this movie as a horror film. This is a big bad movie... and I can not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about 20 minutes long and the last 20 minutes are mostly just an insult - The plot is not good, the camera was bad (only a few minutes) and the acting was OK.  I just have to believe the director is responsible for this, not the screenwriter.  So why did I even think about this movie? Why did I think about it in the first place? Why? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is, at the worst time I've ever seen in my life. I just think, if you want to see a movie that has a bunch of plot twists and not much drama (for my tastes) then this movie is what you get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i was really hoping that i could go out and see one of the "great" films in my own little cinema box. But it was a disappointment, it was not one of my favorite films. It is like seeing an old video game that had one plot line, another line, and one plot. I wish I could have seen it in the movie, and I never did. I tried so hard to see more. I think it could have been good, but it wasn't. I was in awe. I could not figure out what it was about, and my boyfriend was a skeptic. They just didn't understand what it would mean. I guess it's like a bad version of "the wonderful" movies I used to watch when I was a little kid. They were so unauthenticated. The dialog was poor. The movies were not even good. I just watched the movie for two weeks and that's how it was when I rented it for the kids. I know it's not one movie, but I'd prefer to get it for their 15th birthday. I'd like the movies, but they are not interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Body Safe" is a bad little movie. I'm surprised how the other reviewers have rated it. There's an ending, and you're supposed to be interested in the idea of a story. There is no story and there are no characters. There are no real characters either. A major problem for this movie is that the story is very lacking and it looks like it would have been good if the other actors were involved.   I'm hoping the people who commented on this are the critics who liked this movie for the fact that it was interesting. Unfortunately, it is not at all amusing, and it's also not funny. It is painfully long, and not funny at all. It doesn't really help to have one of the other "Honey" characters in the cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of '80's movies and there's something else I've never seen that will do. '80′ and '85′ were both good, so this one isn't worth watching for any reason. It's an utter waste of money and there are so many bad jokes that it's impossible to follow. The dialogue and dialog is so stupid that I actually laughed at the ending. I was expecting the movie to be funny and I was relieved to see it was rather dull and very unfunny. Unfortunately, it got progressively worse and worse until it was just plain awful. I think they probably weren't really interested in making money off the movie so I hope they'll try to make good films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are few funny jokes, and almost nothing funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Untouching" is an uninteresting and unappreciated piece of work, a poorly-thought-out sequel to a disappointing movie that isn't even funny.  The plot revolves around a family that has just returned from the desert of New York, so the story is pretty vague and not particularly dramatic. Some of the plot lines seem to be vaguely plausible but the end is convoluted and there are a few too many twists. Some characters are just flat and nothing really happens, so there's a lot of wasted space. The movie becomes about just a lot more of nothing than a film: some of the characters are simply ridiculous, the actors are weak, the plot is just plain stupid, and the camera is not even as good as it had been.  What is interesting about this movie is the idea of the "Untouching", a mind control drug that has somehow been developed from the very beginning. It is so bad that I'd say that it needs to be seen. This movie needs to have something to go with it and needs more creative thinking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot begin with the idea that this movie is actually "for me" or "for them." It is only "for anyone who is only interested in watching this movie for the most part and doesn't care about the quality of the movie, and therefore doesn't expect a second life. And it is the same thing with the sequel. The story is nothing, and there are some funny twists that make up the plot. But nothing for me.  It does not contain enough laughs in the first 6 movies of this series.   However, the movie is not about any of the previous movies, so there is no way to compare the two. I am not sure what the premise is. It is too obvious to make an intelligent point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot express the amount of guilt and contempt for the people that took this movie for granted, which would make me have no idea why. Of course, it's not in any way like "Cannonball 3", which I believe should be taken into consideration when making a comparison. But it does seem to be almost as bad, though in the worst of all its attempts. I cannot believe it was meant to be a satire, but it is more like the sort of sitcom you could watch and be embarrassed. I feel like it's going to be some sort of parody or parody of the very best comedy of its own era. It should be called "Custerball 3". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do not care for this movie, I just want to see the whole thing. This movie has the worst acting I have ever seen in the history of this movie. The dialog in the movie is so bad that it would be an interesting exercise for a few hours, if there was even a decent plot. I've never seen a movie that is so stupid, that is, at least, boring. I don't mind, in fact, I didn't mind the first movie, so I think there's at least one movie out there for this very low, but I'll start watching this as soon as my husband asks me about this movie's name again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, this movie is not a great one, but I do feel sorry for those two actors. When they get on their first jobs in Hollywood, the movies they do are not quite as good as the movies that are currently made.   I'm really sorry for this one, because I have come to understand that most of the "jokes" are comedies, and the acting is terrible. I'm not sure if this movie was made in earnest or whether it was the intention to make a comedy like this, but the idea itself is pretty dumb, and it is a pity for a comedy. There are not too many laughs or jokes in this movie, but they are too slow and there are not enough jokes. I've even seen two of the jokes they tried to use in their sketches (a couple of times, the jokes were not the jokes) and I can tell that they were not funny.  I was hoping to be able to comment that the comedy is OK, but there is not too much humor to the film and it really isn't a funny film. I found that the movie did not contain any jokes or jokes, and I found it hard to watch. I was surprised to find out that this is the last movie I was able to watch, which is why I made the comments in this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has very poor pacing and is very uninteresting. However, the acting is well done and there are moments in the film where the actors do good acting. However the film fails in the end and the end-view of the story is very disappointing and very disappointing. The movie lacks a real ending and the film does not reveal the point. Also, some of the actors were supposed to be in the cast but were not.   So this is a very disappointing film. I did see it in the stores but I did not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hope that this movie doesn't work so well, but it's too bad to be a parody of some classic films. If this is a spoof of some of the best movies of the last century, it's bad. I'd be interested to see how it compares to the very good, timeless (and hilarious) films from the 1980s. If they can come up with a better sequel than this, I'll be a sadist. This isn't a very good film, but I'm not trying to spoil it for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some pretty good moments in the movie. This is an otherwise unremarkable feature-driven story. One is simply left to wonder how this man has achieved something so terribly terrible that it must be an insult to the audience.  This is no surprise given the fact that one of the main actors in the film was so famous for his late "self-dramed" role, as a man who'd "never stopped drinking". A case like this is, of course, an exceptional actor with a talent to perform a movie with every imaginable variety of stupidly offensive dialog, so you are left to question, "Why? Why why? why???  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film was released in 1990, and it is only half of the way through this time. The plot is bad and the actors are very inconsistent. I don't have the faintest sympathy for the actors, because they were forced to make it in order to keep this film alive.  I can imagine why a writer would make such a film, and even more than that, the film is not the best at any movie. It is a pity to have so many actors and actresses to act without giving any emotion. The only time I'd recommend this film to anyone involved in an industry and involved with a bad film is when you find an extremely good actress like Olivia Fox. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a movie with some interesting action sequences. I wasn't disappointed as this film had pretty poor direction and a confusing editing. That was only the first problem for me. In the end I couldn't even watch it. In my opinion it was really disappointing and I felt like the actor was acting as the person.  What was the point? I can't figure out what the point was? The actors just didn't get that right. I've never seen actors like that in real life. What happened?  I'm not going to tell you the whole story and what is to happen in this movie. But I can tell you some of the plot, and I won't get into the details. I'm going to try to figure out how this movie played out. I'll be posting below as soon as I finish watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are very few people who still support this movie, and even most of the actors. This is not a movie that makes me laugh, but it does it again and again and more. It's an odd choice for a movie to be made. When this movie comes out, I ask if anyone still believes this is funny, and don't laugh or with these guys. The movie is stupid, and there's only one redeeming element of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Little American" is another case of poor acting and acting to go with the worst, low budget and very, very low budget. The storyline is very predictable and there are several problems with the acting. The story is predictable and a few lines are just stupid and unnecessary. There's not enough room for suspense and there's not even enough room to develop characters. There are no emotional moments to the characters.  The only thing that I can add is that the movie looks like it was made in the middle of the 1990s, which means it's about 30 years old. "The Great American" was an interesting movie in the late 1970s and looked pretty good at the time. "Wething Up" was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film for years, but it never gets boring. Even with some decent acting, I really don't like this film. There are no story lines, no real plot, no story arcs, no climax. And that's not even a true story. What I would call boring is that it is just a bunch of stupid excuses. The director didn't even care for any of the characters. And there is no suspense in the whole thing.  The movie is so bad that I would not even consider it worth buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for some time and I have never seen the name before. I mean, it's never been published so I'm guessing that the producers put some of their money back there to make it look like a movie. The whole thing could be made into a TV movie, not even a documentary of a murder that could be filmed on camera. If you can't stand the silence then at least get the DVD and the soundtrack so that you can listen to it without the music. I'm not sure how that's supposed to make the movie funny, but I don't think that they intended to make this movie look funny, not just because they aren't really serious about it. It should have been a series of horror films. The only funny thing in it was at the end when the cops and the killer have a conversation that sounds like it's been really a scene. But in a real sense this could make a decent horror movie. It was just an excuse to have a bunch of guys make movies. And don't expect to be successful. It's not a good movie anyway and I wouldn't even recommend it to anyone. I think that if you just want to hear your name and pretend to be a better movie, you might as well have watched something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, this is a pathetic excuse for a comedy, in what I consider it to be the weakest half of the series. There is an attempt to keep this part in its prime position, but it fails in the end to be anything more than a half-baked movie.   There is nothing else to it but a horrendous plot and a very low-budget to boot, so even the producers managed to get some comedy in there.  There were also moments when this movie appeared to be actually about a family's problems, or the fact that a child is having trouble, but that was quickly forgotten as soon as the movie ended.  The actors didn't get much of a sense of the movie, but they were all pretty good.  However, I have to say that none of the actors here were capable of being much better than their counterparts, or even much worse.  For example, William Foyler was pretty good in the first few minutes of the film, but later he had to get a bigger role in the movie in order to improve his performance.  It's not enough to be able to call one person's problems over the movie. In the end, it seemed a pity to have made such a weak film as this one. It's hard to watch the final scene as a simple comedy and it is hard to look at for many parts of the show.  I'm sorry, and I hope I won't get another second or even third chance of this kind of movie. It wasn't as good as the last one, but I'm sure it was supposed to be a funny film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a great, if that makes an advertisement for a movie: a horror movie about a family. The family is very unhappy and very unhappy with the very poor woman. But what the heck? Just keep your hands and ears shut...  The ending happens because a plague of worms causes the family to become very sick. I just think that the plot is the worst thing ever. And this movie is so bad! The movie starts off with an obvious plot, then it has more of the same sort of plot thrown into the final scene. So, you really don't get to know what the hell is going to happen. Also, there's no real emotion, no real meaning. If you just go through the movie in a little slow way, I'd recommend to pass.  If you like horror movies, check out "The Amity Experience". It's about as good as the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie for one reason, it was not a great adaptation. If you want to make a "big action film", this movie should never happen. The characters had no real development in the story line. I didn\'t care about being happy as the hero, I had my life, I didn\"t care if anything else was going to happen. And all of the actors were completely unbelievable and over-acting (the women).  The story line was very simplistic and predictable and there was absolutely no chemistry. But this isn't a movie which is supposed to be a "great" action film but is only a soap-opera type movie.   If you don't enjoy this movie, don't waste your time. But if you like it, I can tell you that it is very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end, there is nothing left to the mind. The ending is all over-the-top ridiculous.  It's all about the sex with the other women. But the way it plays out in the story is quite ludicrous. The entire premise is wrong. The women in this film get ready for a sex scene, and they want to see the other men who are ready for sex with her. But she doesn't want to do it, so she decides to get in the pool with the others. Then she gets dressed up in her swimsuit and gets ready for it. But then she leaves them and gets in the swimming suit to hide herself, and she's so embarrassed that she cannot hide it anymore.  She tries to do a sex act in a place called the Bathhouse, where the men and women get drunk together and she has to get a bathroom room where she can do a dirty bath room. The other women who are waiting to get into the bath room for a shower get ready, and their bodies are so dirty and wet that they smell like dead people, so the bathroom is locked down and the room is locked. Then they start up at the bathhouse and talk about how the women want to go in the bathroom. But when she goes in, she locks the door of the room, so that she can't go in.  The woman in the movie gets naked, and the woman next to her has her sex partner, and now he is all alone in the bath tub. And then the other woman puts his arms around her and the other guy who is in the water room gets scared so much that he locks him out and he can't get in either but at the bathroom table. And the other man who is sitting on the bath bed turns out to be a man named Gary.  Gary decides to leave. When he gets ready, he goes in the tub and turns on the water fountains, and he gets a bath room key key key. But he has the bath key on his belt and so he doesn't get undressed for a bath. And when he gets into the room to see another woman, the other person is naked and he doesn-  The other woman is a very small, but very aggressive, and very much into sex with one of the other males, who is also in the Bath House.  That's about the end.  When it comes to the final scene, the women put their plan out and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I opened this box, I was amazed that I found it. I was dismayed that it was so poor. I found myself in tears trying to figure out what it is that they call this movie. It is so bad. It's so bad that it has to be banned. It makes me angry and depressed. And the only reason I gave it to being banned was because my child was a child. That's how stupid it was. It was a horror-film. The only good thing about it was that my child had fun and so, so, fun! That was the only thing that made it tolerable. It should have been banned by the authorities and the police. The rest of it was probably the first time I ever watched a horror film. It has to get banned by someone else. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again unless I want to see my daughter play in it. It needs to get canceled and its ratings should probably drop a lot. That would hurt the feelings of the children who are struggling to accept this movie as a good movie. And that's only part of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is a true bad movie.I'm not a big movie buff, but I found it very hard to watch.I was a little bit embarrassed, I was in tears at the beginning of the movie. The ending was very disappointing because of the lack of closure.I don't care about the actors, and I don't even care about some dialog.The ending is so bad, it makes me want to see something else with the movie to finish this movie. But after watching the movie, I found the ending somewhat amusing, the actors seemed to be funny, and the scenes were all pretty stupid, not good at all.The plot is so boring, I just want to go back to my life and enjoy it again, but instead I just sit in the theater, wondering what was left behind. I had to walk away from the movie and put it away, but the movie was so bad that it must have been a joke!  I'm not going to waste my time reviewing it. I wish it were a real movie, because this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and there's not a lot of time for me, but it would be so good for some of you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was better than this one. It was very predictable. I couldn't even hear the name of the person it was about, or even the name mentioned. I mean, if you are an experienced movie watcher like me, this would be a good thing. It didn't make the same sense as a film.  It was so stupid and predictable. It wasn't a good movie to be watched for a long time. It lacked some things.  I'm not interested in watching this movie. I'll be watching something else, like a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i.I think my biggest problem with this movie was that the movie makers didn't come up with any real story.They just throw something at you, and say there is a story and there is nothing to the plot. This is one of the worst movies I've seen since my school years (I used to watch it when I was a teenager, and now I have two sons, aged 8 and 10).  i hope this movie doesn't have a sequel. I would love to see a sequel to this movie, because I feel the storyline that they are going to tell is absolutely awful. The ending should have a story line, and not just a bunch of people talking random things. I cannot believe that there are even more to be in this movie. I've even got the title of "The Death Penalty" because the film is about a penalty in a very real crime. What does this movie say?  It doesn't matter to me what anyone thinks about the ending. I'd like to see something better. I just hope they can make more movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Shenzhen" is a typical fantasy of an upper-level Chinese family, like all other film-making and television films.  The movie starts with the introduction of several middle-class men (not too famous in my book, but a typical American) and the plot begins with a man who is a drug addict, which begins by his brother (whose friend is a heroin addict), so he's really a loser, but then the movie starts and turns into a bunch of teenagers, who just want to be with other high-paying men.  I don't know if these guys were trying to be funny or funny in their dialog. The movie really was annoying when it came out, but it had a very amateurish atmosphere and it seemed to have fallen from being the typical "family entertainment" film.  It wasn't like anything else: it's so terrible, it really shouldn't have been released. I really have to see it for the "B" of "Bengal".  The plot itself was so bad, there was no real purpose for it to appear in a film. The whole time I saw this film, I was thinking the producers and the director must be having a problem with the censors. They just want a movie to be boring, and as they keep trying to create something "funny" and interesting, the ending is becoming a very fake ending.   It was about 2 or 3 weeks after I was finally able to watch this movie. I didn't really believe it was a true copy of a movie, but I had to give it all the credit due to the movie. There are some decent jokes and a good "fun" ending, but overall, I wouldn't recommend it, as this film really isn't enjoyable unless you're a total idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some good things about this movie, such as the opening song and the ending. However, what is the worst thing you can watch: a very dull plot of the characters on their relationship with an all male man named John. There are no other women who talk about John and how they are supposed to love him. That's about all you need to know. That doesn't make any good movie, that's the truth. A few of the supporting characters have some interesting qualities, but they're not good. They're just boring and don't make much sense. The characters and their love for each other is stupid, like when they go to an animal shelter where they're going to watch a movie about the animal kingdom, but I'd like to say they're interested in the animal world. But what makes it awful is when the actors begin to make it up. The actors are doing so many things that make it unbelievable that we can't tell whether they are in love with John. I really wish I had seen some of those actors. That is what I think the movie needs. And even if you have the feeling to see some of the film, it's hard to see John and think he's in love. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the least good horror movies of the year and the worst so far. It was OK in the beginning. I guess it was alright because it's like this.  It was okay because it was a horror film and was scary, but I think that it was pretty bad. The story is a complete waste of time and that has been done before. I feel like there should have been a new story line and at least a new actor. There should have had a new idea of a story line. There were too many things left out. And the characters were just flat, not good for actors. I wish there was a new storyline.  This was a pretty low effort horror film. If you like horror movies, maybe try to see something else. It has some good gore in it though it wasn't as good as "Necromancy" and the zombie movie is kinda like a zombie movie.  If you are a fan of the horror genre, and this is a horror movie then you won't be thrilled.  I think this is the worst horror movie of the whole year. I just wish I had some good horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie through a screening print of it, but was unhappy with it. I think the film director is too desperate to make a real film. I mean it needs to be sold off on video tape. It's not good for a person to watch it like the kids. It takes you out of your ass, so you're stuck in a situation that you cannot do anything. When I was watching this movie I was hoping it was a film that would get some traction in a movie like this. I thought it would have a few great scenes, but it was just the wrong kind of film. It was really bad for me, even the way it is, and a lot of the dialog. This movie is a film about a couple of guys who are going to lose their marriage just before their marriage is all set to fail. Then when it goes on to the end, the husband is actually having the best life of his life, all while worrying about his kids. I wasn't impressed with this movie. It just does not make sense. This is the kind of thing you can get bored with. I don't recommend this movie, because I think it was designed to get in the bargain store. I have only watched it once. I can't recommend it, as it is a pretty bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, I think, is too short to be funny and I guess it's not very funny. The special effects and the special effects were pretty good and the ending was OK but not funny. In the end it's too long. The ending was one of the weakest parts of the movie. This movie was not a bad flick but it's a complete failure. There was absolutely no plot and the only thing that makes this movie a bad film is that the ending. The movie is a complete waste of time and it should not even be considered a comedy. I recommend you watch it if you have a time-off in the store and then do nothing. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this movie because I saw it in the video store in Vancouver and decided to rent it. I didn't really care.  I can only speak for the movie: I watched it to find myself and my friends, who were all interested, but to see it again was just an insult. I don't have an idea why I thought this movie was directed by a man, or even a woman. It could have been put together in a few seconds of time and it didn't take much effort to actually complete the whole movie. I wish the movie was more like a classic horror film and not just a cheap porn flick. This movie just wasn't up to the point. There was nothing remotely like a horror flick. I cannot tell if the man was really a fan of horror films, but if he was, he was terribly disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was annoyed by this movie. This movie is not so funny, it's not so interesting and its just plain boring. I don't know what this movie was about. But, I think it's so stupid to see it. I wouldn't get into this movie if I had a big mind. It just didn't make me laugh, and it didn't even make me want to see other movies. I mean the funnier and funnier movies, but this movie is bad. The people in the movie were funny, but they didn't act properly. I was really annoyed with this movie, but the good ones made me smile. But it must have been a pretty big joke, and there is no way I could take this movie seriously. If I were a crazy person, and I was going to see a funny movie, I would try to see "Sucker" instead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good moments in this film - the first one being the bitsy, funny and funny but mostly one-dimensional. Other scenes are quite bad - it seems that the writers really want to scare us off by making us laugh, but the film is so awful it has no punch.  The only good thing about this film was that there were some decent dialogs in it.  Unfortunately the writer was probably the hardest element of the film to watch, the one that got you a little bit of sympathy.  But not even that happened. This film has just about half of the screen time. The acting is not good either - the actors are so bad, they could do better. Overall, I really wouldn't recommend this film unless it had some comedic and/or entertaining moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I liked "The Little House Of Death" quite a bit but the first couple of episodes were pretty entertaining. I even enjoyed "The One Called Madriggy" which was a really good family comedy. I also liked "Kicking the Eels" but in this series it's worse than the former. The acting in this story is extremely awful and the only ones that are actually good are Paul Belize and Liza Minerva.  I had hoped that "The Last Kiss" would turn into a pretty decent, if not good, movie. It didn't make it that far but still I didn't expect much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can a movie have done that made it such a bad choice to go out with? Well, the first few minutes of this film are quite amusing. If you have any interest in seeing this movie, please take it in as the last one. It's terrible, as a plot and the dialog is totally stupid and the direction is terribly dull.  A small amount of time is wasted in making this movie about a cult religion, a bunch of men and women who want to kill each other. I mean, who cares? I don't care if a cult does not kill people, but who is?  The story is pretty standard. There is nothing at all, not even a new twist, but it feels like there is one. I'm just glad to get the last word out of this movie.  Other of you may see this movie if you really like fantasy or if you just want to see the story of a cult (like Cult of the Zog, Cult of Zob or Cult of Voodoo). I don´t care. It isn´t for me either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In any way it's a great movie for the first time, it was really bad for the second time. The plot is not good and the ending is so stupid that it is impossible to understand what the people involved were thinking.  I think the best version of "the black eye movie" was in a movie with a lot of violence.  There was an interesting character with a nice face, a guy with the looks of a thug, but he didn't get any of the scenes he would have done, like a scene in a grocery store.  All of the dialog, especially the dialog in the film is terrible and the storyline is unbelievable. The acting was OK, though it wasn't the best, but the ending was bad. I think this is a major waste of money. I can't imagine who these guys were. It was just the weakest movie of the whole year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this film is about a love triangle involving a guy who wants to be his brother, who wants a love for her, and who's brother wants her to be with him and who wants the girls he has been interested in.  It turns out that the three people who want to be together are all in the same line. When this happens, the two girls are the most loving girls who happen to be in the area of town together.  What happens to this girl?  She is sent to the town by an unknown person (John Corbett), who claims to be her friend and has already sent her a woman.   What do you do with your friends?  They take her away from this town to tell her what happened?  It's not all that much.  She goes to the bar to get a drink and is given a drink with which to go into. She then finds out that she has something to do with her new friend. When she is left in the tavern, she finds it and goes off with the friend who she hasn't met, and leaves the bar. They then proceed to some hotel in the town to buy the girl and leave the movie to go back to her place, but soon after she arrives, she realizes that the hotel is being robbed of it.  When she and her friends meet, it turns out the bad guys are in the hotel. The two women are given money to use to help with the robbery.  John Corbett and his friend are sent away to prison because they are stealing the money for the town and are using it to get the women he's in the bar and they're going to a nightclub together. The gang of robbers are going to the nightclub to use the money to rob the nightclub of it, and the gang will use this to get revenge on them.  The woman and her friend find that out, and tell the gang of the girls they've been stolen, which is interesting to find out why they would want to go to this town, and why they want to rob it. There's another girl who is in the wrong spot for the gang. She decides to go in and help this woman, but it turns against her. After she and the woman's friend break for good by her, a lot of people come in and take their money out of their debt, as it's supposed they won't be robbed.  They also end up having a good night for their friends. It
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters do not even have any characters to speak about them; there is not enough in the film to justify the existence of the characters.  This film has no real story and the ending is so unsatisfying to me. The plot is predictable, but the ending could have been better. I am very angry that this movie is so bad. I'm sick of seeing people in their underwear! The fact that I have seen this movie twice and have not seen it again is frightening! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked what the previous writer was doing, but this movie really got me out of the loop, in a bad way. The first hour of the movie was a good mix of stories. After the first hour, the film started to drift down to the bottom level.  That was about the halfway of the film. What happened in that half was even worse.  This movie seemed to go in and out throughout the movie. It's really one story of a soap opera that got stuck on a specific plot line (again) which would have been interesting to watch in a soap film. I thought the writing was terrible. The dialog was bad, and the acting was bad. It was the worst thing I've seen since I watched "The Naked and the Dead". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife loves "Tango,Tango", and so does her friend who has loved the "S.N.I.M" trilogy.  This movie was so bad that it could not pass an ordinary rating. I believe the director actually wanted to be able to charge me to an "X" rating. The first couple scenes are an insult to my wife.  They seem to be "the real" version of "Sibena", the cartoon that came out in the late 1970s. The dialog are very poor, and there is no emotion whatsoever. The characters are annoying, and I think the acting is not good at all. The movie ends with the movie showing the characters in their "vita" mode, and then after their lives are shown, they are shown in their old "violet" scene before a "courage" scene where they finally find their loved ones.   I've tried to find out if they actually are supposed to be the people who are in their families. I can't even hear them anymore. I'm thinking that's how they get along with each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story line is terrible, and the acting is terrible. The movie ends with this pretty small plot of a movie being done.   I was disappointed to see more than a few dozen people willing to watch it, which is a shame for me. It was a shame, and I found the story line very disappointing. The director seems to be an aspiring director who has seen all of the classics and has nothing left to do but copy. This movie didn't even come close to the high end of the genre, and most of the actors have not reached the peak of the film.  The acting is not even worth a 4/10. If I had any comments about this movie, please let me know how bad it is and how far you can expect it to go. I don't have any interest in this movie for a long time, but if I could afford to sit again for another few hours and come back to it, I would be happy to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure this has to be the "most depressing movie of the year" since I've not seen it before. It is a really disappointing, boring, and pointless film. The premise is pretty bad - a high school teacher and two students, a school teacher, and a friend with a girl who is a student and they're both friends.  A stupid girl wants to get into a movie theater to film her school plays, which she's only accepted in the end of the school year with a bad boyfriend. Her father was never told about her request to film this movie or told her that she had no idea what was going to happen. But the movie is so bad that it's just plain scary.  How was it supposed to be funny? I'd think it could have been funnier to make a movie that would be funny. It could have gotten funnier if it was supposed to get rid of all the stupidity. I mean, that's a good movie, you know!  I don't like this movie, because it really sucks off, but what a great shame to be so bad at this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of money, no action whatsoever, and very bad acting. I would give it 5 out 10 and would start the series over again. I mean if you were expecting to watch a movie about a movie that could come from the same author, you'd be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    An over-inflated, derivative, derivative piece of trash film, created by the producers and other directors of another hit movie is finally getting its own sequel. A series of ludicrous attempts to make a new sequel, such as 'Unmanual' and 'Gunga' have been done repeatedly over the past few years, but this latest one is just downright awful. If anyone wants to be a director, you would have to be absolutely terrible. It's not fun to watch, either. The dialog is unbelievable and the direction is simply horrible. The director (Dan Boulston) is clearly a poor choice. You can't find the movie on youtube; it's not just about a film, it's a collection of misdeeds. If you don't like it, don't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In another review I would say "I am a fan of this movie - but I'm a diehard fan and it has nothing to do with me. The acting is very poor and the plot, the story, the dialog, the acting is poor - it's really an awful movie. I hope the actors are going through a major crisis in their lives - if they were just trying to make money they might have done good for them - I hope they are going away from this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's not in the world.  There is nothing to see - but it's in the book and you can read the book.  You just sit and get bored - if you are a fan like me I'm going to watch it because you think it's going to be good. But it isn't. It's just a pretty awful movie with no entertainment, no plot, no direction, no story - it has absolutely no plot whatsoever and no story whatsoever. I don't even care if it's a good movie, but it should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a movie is so terrible, it's funny, but the acting is bad, so poor! I've given it a rating ranging from 4 to 8 because it's so bad.  But I still recommend this little gem of a movie to see if you're into films at all. Unfortunately, it turns into a zombie-like plot and there are no good things about it. I've read some of the comments here on this movie and they're all pretty funny. I also think that this movie is an anti-feminism piece. Of course it's a comedy but it's full of stupidity. If you're looking for a comedy, it isn't worth the money unless you're one of the zombies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen some of the "somerities" on this site - you have some of them. "Wickness" is not a true movie: The director was very good. He never put any effort to make it look more interesting. The actors are pretty bad, but they are very good in the movies they make. In a real-world movie, it would have a chance to be interesting. This movie, in other words, does not qualify as a "real life movie". It is full of crap. What is the point of making a movie? It is a very amateur, and obviously false, and a bad, and it doesn't do anything to the real world. And to my point, it is very weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this movie, which I was expecting more of, especially with the high budget of course. There was absolutely no story or plot; the plot was poor and unbelievable. In the end I did give up watching it, so I didn't have to watch again, but the overall effect was horrible to watch. I've read reviews from many other people, saying that they enjoyed this movie and the plot so much better. But that is a gross exaggeration and I don't think that is the truth. The movie was bad for me, and the acting was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie was very unedulous. I am one of four or five people to watch this movie on my way to the end of the movie. I have to say this is the worst movie ever I've seen, I have seen much worse movies than this one. I was so bored and uncomfortable that I left the movie before even finishing it. I didn't understand the premise. It didn't make any sense whatsoever. The movie is full of stupidity. I don't have the same feeling with the acting and dialog and even the acting isn't that good. This movie doesn't make even sense and I don' believe that the director was trying to be funny and have good music either. If you see this movie with your own money, don't watch it! It just don't work. Don't think about the money. I just wish there was a way to get rid of this movie. It just doesn't work out. I would advise anyone to give this movie a negative rating and don't even waste your time to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it quite unbelievable, but there were some very interesting moments. It was pretty pointless, but a lot of the jokes in the comedy could be appreciated. The story is interesting but has little substance, and it seems to be just a waste of time. I am not sure that this would have worked out as a TV movie. I don't know what this is about, but I'm sure the movie would have made some fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. The story is terrible, and the characters are simply awful, even if they're not actually acting well. The whole film was very stupid and pointless, and I felt like it had been designed as a porno flick. I'm not sure if this is a porn parody, but it's definitely not worth paying to rent. If you are lucky, and enjoy a good porn movie, I highly recommend it for you, but most porn scenes aren't worth watching and I don't even care if they are. I don against things like this, but I do hope it gets a release, and it deserves to be replayed for more time. However, I'm hoping that this will get the life it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is extremely disappointing. It isn't even funny at the start. Its only funny when the characters were funny. It's also not a comedy, it has really awful acting, and it's just plain awful. the director/writer is the person who thought the movie was funny, and that is what we should be looking at. He's not funny, nor does he have any decent sense of how to act, or he's not good in the acting or even any kind of a comedic way. The acting is horrible, the dialog is terrible, the story is bad, the characters are terrible.  all of these are horrible, and there is absolutely no redeeming factor here. Just awful, just awful.  and if the writers/directors would like to make another movie about the same concept, they might have a couple of months to try and get the concept around again. It won't happen though, because this is just an awful, bad, terrible, and completely unoriginal movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that people like this movie, but they like the other movies in the same way. And, they like many bad movies. It was just a few minutes long and, in the end, I'd rather just take out some of their badness. The first scene comes and it really starts a fight to the death. This is the first scene you get to see.  Then, what the hell was the next scene?   Oh, and this is so bad it could be amusing. I am so sad. It really should not be like this film. I think there should be more money to put into it. Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A mix of teenagers, a lot of music by a guy with a guitar and a bunch of teenage singers. I didn't even care if the movie was good, I didn. The plot was a bit disappointing and the acting was pretty poor, but they were OK. I would give this movie a C+:  I was really hoping to like it, but I did. The film was absolutely pointless. The only thing it does is that one of the guys, has a stinger and is obsessed with masturbating.  The entire movie felt like a car accident. The soundtrack was awful, the acting didn't seem that good, and there's no point in making this movie any more entertaining than this guy's penis. I hope there is a sequel or something. I just can't see how people with a stalker and a sex addiction can be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the actors start shooting the first scene, one thing bothers me - the character was supposed to be a character from the first film.  I've never felt that way. I've had a hard time watching the whole film, ever since.  The film starts out on a typical summer vacation, with a bunch of family members, friends and their kids.  It seems like the rest of the film is about this person, because there's no story or character or character and the story is so short.  We're told about an American, who was killed by terrorists, and that person supposedly started shooting the main character's family members.  Now, the family members were all in the same room with the guys. They weren't alone, the two guys were together, but the whole family went on vacation.  As it turns out, the guy who was supposed and killed to be American comes on his own, and the family does something to hide it from the main characters.   The two guys have two children and they want to get away from their loved family and get some money. I'm still not sure if they did this by accident or if the kids did it or they wanted to hide their families from the terrorists and the parents.  They don't talk about it, and it becomes painfully obvious that they did it. This is a total mess - no story, no character and no characters. This film just plays one character's anger and resentment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing to say that is not a "fairy" type movie but it is very bad. This movie was an absolute waste of money. I give this film two stars because of his acting but also the acting in the movie was so bad it was not even worth mentioning. The acting and the acting is so bad that I think it was also not worth showing us the people in the film. And the acting was very poor and I think the producers made a lot of money for nothing.  I have one major problem with this film. The ending is simply terrible and I was hoping it never got released. We cannot afford to waste money, especially on something this bad. And even if they do get released, we cannot afford the ticket price of the movie. But it is for sure not a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure this is the name for the worst movie ever made by the world's most talented but incompetent film makers. The plot is a poor excuse to fill your mind with a fake film. I don't know if any of the characters have any good qualities, even for their character designs. They are extremely un-dwarred, and they're the weakest actors I've ever seen. They do not speak properly either. The ending is quite stupid and unbelievable. I believe that the movie is intended to take over time to understand and accept the meaning of the story. This movie is a disappointment. If you know a good movie and is also bored with it, I won't waste your time, because there is nothing to say that it's a really good film. For the last few weeks of my life, it has taken me more than one of those days. I'm not saying to watch it, because it is not a very good movie. But if you are sick or mentally uncomfortable, try it before you get tired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of this film is quite ridiculous. I could barely believe it was being made in the days of our last century. The character of Kaeli is the worst I have ever seen in a film, and I found it laughable.  The actors, and the screen writers, don't seem to realize that this film was an advertisement for a movie. It was absolutely pointless and completely ridiculous and unbelievable. The ending is not even necessary or really interesting. The dialog, and some parts of the film seem to be from a different film altogether. I don't have any words for those.  But the movie also does have a fair bit of comedy, but I found the movie a total waste of time and effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was fun but not that great. Some of the dialog was interesting, the acting was not that good, but a little bit of humor was welcome. However, the story was poor and the whole premise wasn't well developed. A young man turns into a man with a giant robot he created in a garage; he gets into an argument with his roommate. The problem is he loses his house because a little girl is in his house. His roommate then goes to live in a hotel with another roommate that she has in mind. We're then taken to see the lady that runs the hotel. We get some info about how she lives in the room and what the girl does in the hotel and see how they're using their computers to look up her friends. Then we're back to the house of the woman that rents the room. And so she's very lonely to have them back to her because she's not there in the house and all their neighbors and her friends are on the internet chatting with each other. The woman is very unhappy because they can't get to get to her and she decides that she'll go to a nightclub to sleep but instead she goes to sleep with a few friends. When they get there, she turns her hair yellow and she's wearing a big hat and she looks at a woman in a black wig. She says something to the lady but she doesn't know who she's with and then the girl is sitting in the back of a hotel. The lady starts crying and she leaves her to go with him. The room becomes a fight. The women get into a fight in the restaurant and the woman is in the middle of the fight and she doesnno longer carry around the lady in the door. The wife gets into a taxi with a group of strangers and the women gets in a taxi to go on to another place. She tries to make it look like a movie: She's sitting in her pants and is dancing with her, then she puts a bandanna on her legs to cover her face. The guy doesn't understand her but they take turns it off and go with the truck to the dance club. Now they get on the bus, the ladies go there and the gang of men in the club go. They get on a car and the ladies chase her and then she turns it out that the truck is carrying her and the girl takes off in a car with them. This is then like a horror film of sorts. The ladies are talking
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this film is bad! Not just a bad, but not a good movie either. What makes this movie so bad are the bad acting and bad casting. The bad scenes are a bit funny, but it's hard to take the seriousness of it for the film. In addition, the music is terrible. If you're going to watch a film involving some actual human beings, this is not worth it, but I wouldn't waste any time on it. I just can't get over how poor this movie really is. I think it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would just take it away for a short time, and see it again for about another minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My expectations are low. I was hoping the movie had some funny jokes, but I was disappointed. As a guy who has had several of these movies before, I'm hoping that this one doesn't become a R-rated comedy about the movie that ruined my life. There's no humor whatsoever, the movie doesn't have much of the old "funny" humor that was good when I was growing up. The movie is pretty much a slap in the face of a country that is known for laughing at the "B-movie."  The plot and acting are bad, and if you are willing to laugh and have no desire to sleep or enjoy your sleep, you might be fine. I know the cast is good, but you don't care about getting laughs and are willing for your life to be dragged through the deepest parts of your life.  I give this movie a B rating based on the lowest rating ever possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Ceces" is what we thought this movie was about -- a gay romance film that never becomes a gay rom comedy. It is the very worst romance movie I've ever seen, that ever has been rated below two. I really hope this movie is a flop. Don't even know what the title is? I didn't see a clue. Just a few months after I saw it, I thought I would be able to recognize something was wrong. Now, it's a few years later, and I've started to realize what it really is. The story is a simple story, that has no real theme or drama to it. It's just the kind of film that you watch when you're bored. This is just plain terrible.  I don't even want to talk about it, it doesn't matter. I'm sick to death. What did I want out of this movie? What was my life's worth?  I'm hoping my life is worth more than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst script I've ever seen. The characters are totally boring and there is little interest in the plot. I would recommend watching something else - nothing else, even a movie, for the one time of the year it was good. It doesn't even have a great soundtrack, although there are some nice tunes, even in the song song.  Don't buy this movie unless you want to, like all the other horror movies out there - because if you watch it for fun, don't miss it, or even watch it with your kids. The director is so bad that I'd call him the king of the "fun" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea seems obvious in the early 1980's, a couple of teenagers walk up a beach to the beach with some money and a couple dozen people. When these people were all drunk, the two people who come ashore with them leave the scene on the beach. One of them is the wife of the drunk guy. The wife is very angry and upset and the husband, apparently, has a drink of the day.  Other couples have their problems and their problems get worse and worse as the film unfolds, with the women giving up to the women and the men getting drunker and drunker.  The first scene is when the men go to the pool with the woman, who is upset at the men. The woman is very sad because she lost her husband and she has to stay with the other guys, which leads to tension between them.  Then the women go to a local bar and the guys go there to buy beer and the woman asks the guys about the price of the beer. They ask for the price and the women give it to them. The two guys don't really think it is that price but the woman thinks it is because the lady gives her a bottle of spirits and the two of them try and drink it. When the woman leaves the bar, she throws the beer bottle at them and the alcohol gets into the bottle and it explodes. The next day the drunk guys put the lady in the shower and she's able to escape, but she's so soaked and so depressed that she can't get out of the cold. The guy that is supposed to be her husband is able to get his hands inside the shower so he gets hold of the bottle of liquor and carries it back to the bar and they go to get into the shower to see if it's ok for the two guys to go in the bathroom to get out and drink.  When the women is getting her clothes from their room, she is so upset at her husband. The scene continues on and the wife goes to a pub and is able see the other drunk men drinking with the guys there. They are able to fight in the pub to distract her from the alcohol. The alcohol gets the better of her and she begins to throw the guys out at the guys and she drinks with the men and leaves the two men alone in the toilet. She puts the people in the bath, as a way to distract them. However, the people who are on the toilet drinking are so drunk that they keep throwing water in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the video on one website and didn't even start watching it. I got so much disgusted by it. The acting was so bad! The acting in it was just bad! My brother was so disappointed after seeing it and I had to laugh! I mean, they really wanted to be over acting their acting and not in fact doing what they are saying. The fact is that the guy, like the guy I watched last time, had no idea what was going on. The guy had no clue what was happening in the movie and the guy's brother was in tears.  It is such a bad thing to see a movie with actors that didn't understand what the people were saying and didnth not understand the situations. You cannot let the actors that are really good actors to play in that kind of movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is quite unbelievable. It is nothing more than the same guy who won an Academy Award with a script that made no sense. What happened with this movie?   I was hoping that the film would be well written, but it wasn't. As a director, the director could have gotten much better. The script was awful. It's not like any of the films I have seen. There were scenes where there were no dialogue. The whole thing was just incomprehensible.  There were no real emotional scenes or stories in the movie. I didn't really care.  If you like good acting, you won't find a movie with no real emotion in it. You will find the movie "Carmack" or "A Man You Love", for example.   All in all, I would recommend it, but don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I have been watching this movie for maybe weeks, and I'm a huge fan of this movie. However, what I've been noticing is that the director doesn't care about what he's doing with the plot, the actors, and the overall story. He thinks that he can make a good film. He wants to create a "plot". However, he's got a problem. The fact that the movie started by having this one character, that he's always acted to be bad, doesn't matter. It's the characters, the movie, and it's the viewer. That's how movies like this are supposed to be. If a good movie is, that's the end of the movie. The first hour is about boring, then boring, and then boring. The next hour is just about as bad as the last. The characters are flat, and don't even interact properly.  The characters and the story are good, but the plot is bad. The ending is, "the end." You end this movie at your own house and you walk out to your room. What a movie is it becomes, just to take a break from it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many great movies, and I've even seen several horror movies. Some have excellent acting. Some movies have great writing, some movies are good but they don't make much sense and don't have the kind of special effects that movies that are actually fun to watch. Some films are good for certain purposes, some films are funny but don't really make a sense, some have good action scenes but nothing special.  All these things are done so bad in this movie, there is no special effects whatsoever, there's no funny, and there are no suspense.  There is just a short, boring movie that is absolutely terrible, and that's just the tip of a rotten iceberg.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I just can't even recommend it for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to be in denial about the premise that this movie is a piece of pure stupidity, but this sort of bad movie does demonstrate some of the most primitive of cinema clichés. I am also not going as far as to praise the acting in this movie because the acting is bad, and the characters are so flat and non-relevant, that it is difficult to believe that they are capable of acting in character. I have to admit that, for some reason, I find these characters laughable. I'm sure that they're capable of a few acts, but the ones they do are so bad that I'm not willing to try. I've given this movie a rating of 4/10, but they should only be given a low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time on TV. I thought it was terrible! I mean it had horrible acting, awful special effects, and awful special FX. But it was OK, if you really liked it, and wanted to see this film. I didn't like it because I wanted it to end. It is a pity it could not have ended sooner.  The movie is so bad that it's really hard to watch. I mean, really bad. Not a fun way to finish this movie. I would recommend watching this movie, if it was just a straight look at a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best point of this movie is that the director got a little bored with the first hour of the film and that the ending is pretty corny.  I don't have to say, that's all fine, but if it was a serious drama it would have been a more interesting story. As it is, it is just a dull, disappointing film. I'm sure the only thing it is worth is the acting. It just doesn't seem like any good way to go anywhere with this. I think there is a lot to be done in this film. It's just disappointing. The only good thing about it is that you get to see some of the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very bad. It didn't seem to have any real purpose. This film would have been better suited for the time for one film. I find it insulting when people say they're going to see a film of a dog fighting competition or sports or something. The dog in question is obviously not a bad dog, but the ending is terribly dull and nothing is in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit, I was expecting some of the things in this movie. This movie is stupid, really. It is a weak movie and I wouldn't expect anything from it. Even so, I thought it was funny.  The characters are pathetic and the plot is not worth the film. I hope they are good and I do hope the movie doesn't have much plot to tell.  If you want a little time to go and enjoy some of these films, this movie is not for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just another "Naked" version of a very lame and pointless sequel. The plot and characterisation is so poor that the original title is not even a hint about the film. The special effects and special effects are not bad, but they are simply not "naked" enough. What it does not have in terms of nudity is a very, very bad film. I find this film very disgusting and very poor in comparison to the "Darker" sequel. This movie should be directed and marketed more like a "nasty" version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In his own words I thought it was pretty good, the storyline was not too original or scary.  But in the end I couldn't understand why it had this problem. I don't know why, there are no good stories in the book, how would a writer have used this story? Maybe the author was in some kind of drug induced haze, like a psychotherapist or even a drug addict, that would explain the story in some ways. In addition to the fact that it is completely unadapted I'm convinced that the book has suffered because a lot of the authors have never adapted for their own sake and have not adapted for the world and the world around them, or other cultures to which they've lived, or they have not learned any of these lessons in a more modern sense. This makes for very poor story telling and bad writing, the book is about the story of a very primitive society, not about a modern society. I found the movie so stupid in its portrayal of primitive human behavior and it is absolutely horrible, I didn't like it, it was completely disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got bored with this movie. I got nothing to do. This is a horrible film and no one cares. The only person I remember who got killed was a young black girl who didn't even know who her family had ever gotten close to her. I have the film in my mind and the first day I watched it I was laughing for the film. And now after seeing the film I'm annoyed and sick of the film so I won't even want to sit through it to watch it. The film is also terrible in a really stupid way. It should not even exist anymore. There are even a couple of weird references throughout the movie. There is a huge line where you can see an old couple and then you see the old man saying, "Your grandfather got killed!" (And if you had just seen that line, you'd be sick.) It also seems like one of the many movies that people have ever created but I would say this one is the only one I've seen that was so bad in my life. I've never seen any better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the film listed as "the best in the mid-section of the 80's", but it wasn't good and pretty much sucked me out of my time. The plot is so awful that it's difficult to suspend and that most of the scenes were totally pointless and the actors aren't well supported. I just can't get into it; the film had some nice moments in the end and the acting was OK, but don't get me interested. The music is not too musical, not too silly, but the rest of the music was pretty stale. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 2-4 hours of the film are as long as any I've seen so far. But it is interesting to note that it does not take place in a single location but it is set in many locations. The story centers around the death of a local reporter (Logan). The reporters and her wife are supposed to be working in a country bar when they are attacked by unknown people. They are in a room and a guy at the front door says something to the wife and the reporter. It turns out that they are the victims of a mysterious man. In the room, we also see the man and he is in a black mask with a red face. He begins to make a negative reaction toward the reporter and the wife.  The next few hours are quite convoluted, with the first 2 hours being a story about the mysterious man and the rest being a thriller about the wife's new boyfriend.  I was surprised that the "plot" was not about the "story" but, considering how bad the movie was, it still should never have been a film. The film does NOT contain a plot, but the plot is interesting and, at least, it was fun to watch, as it was for me. The "plot," however, is just a plot. It is not even funny.  If you look for plot, you will find your own ways to interpret the story and make a case for it not to be a real film. This movie is not an interesting film. It's just a weak effort to make something not so fun to review and to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not the worst movie ever! If you liked this movie, don't expect to see this one. And, if you can't find it anywhere, you might as well buy a copy of this movie to get it in a decent box. I can't recommend it as a movie but it does make some fun as a series of low budget fare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have to agree with my friend who has already heard me say that i was the best movie he was ever seen. Well i was just watching it and I don't know what happened next to this. There are many parts that have been done before and after in a movie before. What is interesting is the fact that you have to pay to see this movie to get it. That is a sick way to spend money, and what's even worse if you have a job. It is also really sick to go and pay to watch it and watch it for the chance to get some money. i guess people do like me for me because they can understand why the movie was made so bad but i didn't like it nor did they make it that bad. I wish we had made a better movie like this one. i really did like a couple of the scenes, but I do feel the ending was a bit strange and I believe that it was intentionally made. This is a movie that has gotten a bad reputation as a horror movie and people seem to like it for their own interest but i don't think it is a true horror movie. I think the writer is trying to show something off or create a shock, and it seems to me that he is not very good. He has done all kinds of horror movies in the past, but don't mind; they are usually the ones that get the best reviews. If you want to watch horror movies with violence you will have to watch this movie. It's just bad. It just a sad movie, and the fact of watching it makes me angry. The only good thing I can find about this movie was that it had a very funny song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've all heard my bad movie review. What with all I heard, there must be some good movie review here.  If you read the review, you will understand. The movie follows two girls, one of them named "Carla" (Mira) and the other one named "Caster" (Liza). What with those two girls? This movie is a huge pile of rubbish. I never expected it would be like this, I thought it would just be a cute little film to have. If you haven't seen the first 4 movies before, you should start watching the first one first.  I would really recommend a movie to someone who didn't get the 4 movies, because, I know I wasn't going to see one of the 4. I know they were good movies, but don't get me wrong, I'll try watching something else.  The movie starts off with a scene that starts off very confusing, as if it is a fantasy about a girl. It becomes pretty clear that there is an actual person in the world named "The Great Lovelady" who is being hunted by a guy called "Mura".  That gets progressively worse as the movie progresses. As soon as "Mima" is chasing "Castor", the first scene is a chase.  "Mira" then disappears, and the only person who can hide "Muras" is in front of a mirror, looking at her father.  Liza (Carla) is very excited to see her father, so the chase is on. The chase turns out to be "Curious" (The Mysterious Great Lovenger), who is called in and is so crazy that he has "a bunch of dogs" with him on the run. The next scene is "The Amazing Adventures of Madman Lander" (Cameo) and "The Cat, Dog, Horse, and Rabbit", a little story about a farmer (Caster) who hunts rabbits to become one of Madura's pets. The hunters come up on a cliff and do a little hunt. After killing a lot of rabbits, Madura (Lira) gets into an accident involving her father and a few others. She is injured by a bad horse, and he is saved by Madura, and Madura gets his head cut off.  It is here that the movie really starts to become stupid. The whole plot revolves around Madura chasing "Maura", and the chase
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is possibly the worst I've seen in my life so far. I was really surprised to see this movie was on HBO. This movie has to be banned for the sake of our children. I'm sure there are a million and a million times worse movies out there. I hope that someday we can make a better movie than this one. It really needs to be stopped and made so that it doesn't affect children. It is not a funny film at all. It's really a sadistic, over-the-front-shoulder kind of film. It should not be played on TV and even worse. We can't afford to have a kid in the house for more than 15 minutes. This is the first movie I ever was sad to watch. It just really sucks. But hopefully it's not gonna get me out of my job, so I can just keep watching this movie. I've heard this movie's name from my brother, so if I can get him to kill me, I'll probably do something good for my job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't care how big of a film this was. This is the weakest movie I have seen in the past 10 years. I am sick of the direction and sound effects. The actors' voices were so loud and tinny and they weren't good. They did well on the short that was in the "Dancing with the Princesses of the Kingdom" but it was so bad, so I would rather watch one of the lesser movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is so bad that it should have been banned from all the other major film studios. It has to be banned to be made by the powers that control the film. The problem with this is that it would be like an anti-cult film. In fact this movie is a joke. No, it is very serious and very stupid. The story is so badly acted that I thought I was crying. It is like a plot to kill a guy, or a plot for revenge. Like a murder in a movie! It is nothing less than a plot, and a plot that is just like a movie. It should not be made. There is no excuse for making this film. It really should be banned from the all other major studios, including Sony, which has the money to make it. Also, it was obviously not true to the film's story. A lot of the action in the film is in the beginning and at the end. I have to say that I was very surprised that the producers were willing to let the original writers and directors of the film finish their movie, because that made me think that it was too ridiculous to even admit it. The actors didn't act very well. I just want to get out and go home to see this movie so that it doesn't kill our faith. I was also very concerned with the fact that the movie was so bad, the director/actor talent is so weak that they don't help the movie. The film starts off with a very long and boring, and very very slow, introspective chase of a guy who goes from being a teenager to a senior, with him trying to find out who he really is. It takes about 45 minutes to get into the main plot and just at that point the film starts out really slowly and the action is so slow.  The movie gets progressively worse until it finally comes to its conclusion. I can't understand why. This is just a movie, but it is way too long to be funny. And the ending is pretty lame. I wish I could have had a little sympathy for the movie, and my expectations of it are so low that even I didn't believe the ending. I think it is an intentional attempt to get people with only one purpose, and this is obviously not good. It must be an attempt to take away the religion that I'm a part of. The movie is just about as bad as it can get and is not worth it.  I must say that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a trash version of the original 'The Big' Story' series, but even those movies look interesting. I think that it was just a few minutes longer than the original, but those minutes are wasted, as the director decided not to use the old style. I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this for my eighth birthday and thought it was the worst movie of my life. I was crying like an idiot when I watched it. This movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. This is not a film at all! I was really surprised that it was so long. I'm afraid I didn't want to watch it again, because I couldn't really stand what they said in this film.  I was watching it again and I wanted to get some help on the way out of this bad movie. When I got to my room, I just gave it to the door and ran outside and told them it was a bad idea to watch. There were no words to say that this movie was so bad. I'd advise you to just turn it off and walk away. Avoid! Avoid!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are just one or two of the most annoying scenes in the history of the movie. The whole storyline is an insult to people who actually enjoyed the movie itself, in which the main characters are the most despicable, yet are strangely believable, and very unfunny, as I have just been reading these review. The script is atrociously bad and the acting is so bad that it really should have been deleted. But it could be saved, but in the end, even after the actors were reduced to puppets, the movie is only interesting and not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A plot line which seems to be about a couple, turns into a self-indulgence of ideas and not even a coherent plot. The characters are completely unrelated. It's also not clear if there is a main character. The acting is terrible, and the dialog is even not funny. It turns into something not even worth watching. There is an awful number of cuts to the film that seem to be unnecessary. The story ends, and then one of the main characters (the girl) ends off at some point. I don't know what happened, I'm not even sure whether she had any intention to stay alive. It should have ended already, but it didn't. I'm so tired after seeing it that I just wanted to say I hate this movie so bad! I'd hate it if I had only one of those scenes in the entire film. I'd love to have the film to finish, because it actually is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised that the only person who actually commented on this movie was from an email to a friend of mine in a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, the acting and the direction are bad. The actors are too inexperienced. Some characters get away from the screen because of their inexperience or something else. The acting is bad, the camera is bad and the scenery is bad. It is like watching one of the old "whip" films. The film is not funny or funny, it is not really a romantic film but it has some very disturbing lines. The "Cock" (the lead) is just so stupid and it is just plain old. The only person who does a good job is the actress.  The cast is not even good. You need to be able of listening to the audio tapes to understand what the film is about. The performances of each individual actors are bad, and there are no good characters to be found. There is nothing to make the movie interesting.   One of the three best things I found in this movie is that the actress/s are interesting. Those actors aren't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Good One" is an attempt to get a positive review about the best movie of the year, that would have been an interesting review. But, it's not.   It's just a shallow, pointless plot, with a weak acting and too-long chase. I guess you'd have to be a genius to see this movie. And it's just sad that it was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie once, and the first few minutes were great, but the rest of it left me wanting. I thought the movie seemed to have a bit of a plot, and a little bit of the story line was alright, but everything else was disappointing.  I really wanted to watch this movie. It was not enjoyable at all. I hope it doesn't happen to the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most frustrating movie I have ever seen. If I was a cynic, I would say this was a film that made a lot of money, but if I was an optimist, I'd still call it a comedy. It's a very bad comedy with a bad twist to it. I'm not sure what the movie is about, but it certainly isn't funny. What it does have, in its present state, is the fact that the cast is bad. It is disappointing, and I just don't know what the fuck this movie is. Maybe it's funny for people who take the humor standup battle seriously. I really don't believe this movie stands out as a film with anything serious appeal. It could have been easily made a comedy, but I think it's more like a joke for a cynical laugh.  The acting is flat and boring, even worse when it comes to the good-looking performances of the actors. One of the two actors is even an actor of a soap opera! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Myster" isn't a great horror movie, but it's got a very bad reputation. I thought "The Exorcist" was great and scary and scary. This movie, unfortunately, isn't. I have never seen any of the three "Darker" movies (Darker, Darker, and Darker), and this one doesn't count. But it does a decent job at being a horror movie. The acting is bad, the dialog is poor, the locations are poor, and the effects are just plain bad. The music is just OK but there is nothing to get excited about. The special effects are bad, but you have to see them for a few minutes to understand how to feel. If you are a horror buff, look at "The Darker" instead. I wish I could say this movie was a good horror movie with a nice twist to its story and it ended up as a horror. Unfortunately, that's not true.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a really bad movie. It's just a bunch of cheap, no-for-the-life characters, a bunch. There is no direction to the story, and the dialog is not good. I saw the movie on the VHS and it just seemed like a bunch and a plot was just thrown out at the first scene. There are not even proper dialog in the movies. It is very bad. It has no premise. The only funny moments in this movie is when the characters are talking and just do not pay attention to the characters. They don't really get to know each other character. It seems like a different movie. I really liked the original, "Fading Away".   The main reason I gave this movie was because I didn't want the sequel, "Dirty Little Things". There is a great story about the children of a couple in California who are in their fourth year of marriage. The husband's friends decide to keep the kids out of their lives and leave the house. The wife's friend comes back and decides that it's time to keep their kids. The kids go on the trip. The mother is an alcoholic, and she loses interest in the kids because the husband, who is a drug addict, smokes to keep her alcohol fueled. She and the kids go to a hotel where they go into a fight with the husband. The son and the wife are looking for a hotel that is not the place to stay. The woman is in a hotel in California and the kid and the father meet her and the son meet her again. The kid and wife are taking the children to another place where there is more alcohol, and that's where they meet the son and wife. It doesn't matter if it's true or not, they never go back together and then go to the hotel. It would just be a bit better if they never went back to California.  This is the same old "Cluber's Dead" show from Disney. The characters are dead, but that's OK, not the reason why. What a lot of money can't make up for, but I'm glad the character was there. This is really a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie, I was like, it had a few positives, and I thought that it was good, at least for one movie. This movie was really bad, if you can see some good points, and most of them don't, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It starts off like the movies of "The Fugitives" and "Nucky Mallard" and I was so annoyed by it that I kept watching it and never even bothered to put it down. It was just bad. I was in the middle of my life in the 60's, and my mother, too, was a big fan of it and has gotten the DVD's for it.  I have to say I was very surprised. I'm an old man, and these people didn't even know that I was a fan of this movie before the time I saw it. I hope it has some good parts, but there's nothing.  If you're gonna watch this movie with your friends and family, take a few years to review it, don't put it on your shelf. If you just watched it and didn't finish the movie, skip it and stay away from it. Do yourself a favor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing movie ever produced in a small town in California, about half of the time, that it really does NOT have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is just an old, nasty sequel of some poor American drama that could have been made in the 1960s, but that's not what it's about. It starts with a simple premise, a simple shoot of a man named Jack, a very bad guy. Then, Jack is killed by a truck accident. The other bad guy is, of course, a man who's been killed in a similar accident, the only difference being that he's not dead, or at least he's alive. We follow the rest of the movie, mainly involving an over-simulated chase scene, a little bit of a chase, a car chase, and an apparently fake chase to a mysterious old lady in an old lady's house, who we eventually find out to be a member of some sort of cult. But the only thing that is interesting at all in this movie is the very lame car chase scene at the end, in which you're expected to believe that it's Jack, and that you'll never see him again. Of course, that's pretty much predictable. It's absolutely NOT about being a good movie. It should be a comedy, but it's very flat and there's no semblance of suspense. This movie is stupid as hell, and would make people believe in the truth of a car wreck. If you wanted to get a big car chase at some big, loud place, you might be willing to get some decent entertainment. But you'll probably be better off for the car chase. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie in it's original version, but I did like it in the remake. I was upset. The script is bad, the ending is bad. The idea of the main character was good, but the ending was terrible. They can make it sound OK, but you just can't even recognize the character when you see the ending.  I think it must have been made out of an era, because no one knew what the hell it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor movie at the height of the late 1990's. In the video, this was a poor film for anyone to get into. You get the premise, but it's just awful, and the direction and writing don't hold up. In all, it just doesn't hold. Some movies, such as "Ghosts" and "The Thing" don't necessarily have the same level of originality, but these movies do provide some decent thrills. In my opinion, "Lazy People" is just a bad comedy with no one actually playing the part. I don't even have the slightest idea how to watch it, and my only suggestion would be to watch another movie in the vein of the old "Bigger" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is disappointing and painful to have the show only one day in the year. I really wish they could make it to make me laugh. The acting and acting are very bad, I think it was better in a play.  It really is not worth to the time-free time it takes to watch this episode. I hope that it is not going to have its own sequel on the other channel so that I can keep watching this horrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director was given the script to make a documentary film. The film was never finished. As I said in a positive review about this movie: "You have to have a very big nose and no nose, no nose which you could smell, or at least smell. A long time period and no story of a story, just a few minutes. A very big waste of time, a few $800. This is no way a good film. This film is NOT worth a serious time to see, no way to go on it unless you need to rent it. The movie is about a man who was in love with a woman who was a lover of a prostitute who was no longer in love and who didn't want to have sex with a man. There is no story or ending and not much to do, but the film gives off the bad parts of the film. A lot of the dialogue is simply awful. The camera is terrible, bad camera work. The actors are not good. Even the actors are bad. You have to pay $5.00 to see this film and I don't think anyone will like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although, I'm surprised that this is actually one of the best horror movies to have ever been released. It's just one of many of the worst horror movies ever made, and I've seen some of those on the internet, so you don't need to be shocked when I get home from work.  Even worse than the film itself, the special effects are bad. I can't believe anyone actually tried to have any hope of seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disappointment. In the end, I was thinking they had made it good. They didn't. It is a bad sequel to one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. I will try to avoid making the same comment if anyone gives me money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a bad version of the first "VHS". You find yourself in a weird situation where your child is dying from a stoned father and you start thinking about what would be happening to your father and the man who will be taking care of your child.  What happened to your child was that he had killed a man. He was in the same condition as your father to the extent he would want to go off into his drug fueled life and drug fueled activities and your father went into a coma. How did you find out? Well, I guess that man was dead. And so you decide. You decide how to go on with your child's life. That's where the story begins. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was reading the book "The Secret Weapon" before I even saw this film. It was very bad. I think the director didn't care for the special effects and the special effect was bad. And then there's a story! I don't know why but I thought that the storyline was good. There's nothing that happened after the story and I thought the dialog was okay but it wasn't interesting.  I really wish this was a video game or a movie. I'd like to see more good action games. I also think the cast was not that good but the story sucked so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd really like to cry out to those who have watched this show for the first time ever, because if you knew how to look at this film, you would have known exactly what to say. One thing that could have been a positive point is that this show is supposed to be a comedy, but in its own version it's just so much an incoherent mess, that it makes the point even less funny. One of the most annoying parts of the whole thing is the scene where the girls are chasing each other, which just gets lost. Also, a lot of the scenes in the movie are the girls getting drunk and chasing each others, and it turns into a little comedy when the people in the room don't catch their attention. They're not very good at all, even the girl who acts like a flimter. In short, this show really needs to have some good jokes, because there's nothing funny about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you had to see this movie: you have to have seen the first "real" version before watching the first sequel.  In the first movie, it was a horror film, and the second movie it was about a horror movie, and if you saw the first film you might have thought it was OK, but it wasn't.  I was hoping that the sequel would have some of the same themes that the original was, but unfortunately, it fails miserably. I tried to see the first few minutes of the movie, but then I really had to pay for my ticket.  After watching it again, I decided that I should try to see some of those that were good. There were some good moments, but not so many.   There are two different endings.  The first ending has more twists than the second.  As a movie, the main plot element is about a ghost, and he is the primary villain. The first movie is about him dying his ghost, but the second is about the ghost dying his body to become a ghost herself.  Both the first and second endings are pretty weak, but they are good for a time.  Some of the jokes are pretty bad.  There is no one joke that makes it look good.  Overall, I thought the movie was really disappointing and I thought that the movie had no potential for a sequel. I have to say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. I didn't care for this movie because I was interested in the first one, but since there is not one good movie in the world, I give it a bad rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a 2/10 grade, with a rating of 1. There is nothing positive in this movie, at all. It is the worst movie I've ever seen. I have seen it, I have loved it, and I thought that it was okay, and it's still quite bad, but in the end I thought it was just awful, and the acting is so bad.  I don't think I can ever recommend it to anyone who watches it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to say that this film is one of the worst films ever made. Some of the actors are good actors, but others are bad. Some actors don't get that much needed money in the movie, and the acting is so bad that they can barely even act. I wouldn't recommend this film unless there was a decent plot. It's so stupid, I laughed at the line that said "I'll be on this boat". You'll never see this in the first movie. It makes me wonder how the hell would they be able to keep making films. I think it would be good to see a new film: a story of a bunch of drunks who go around looking for a boat and then go off into the water to find it. This film is not only stupid, it's really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second movie I've read in a few months and I just wonder why is it so hard to get a good movie: i can only guess that it's like "Pinegrocer", except in a real movie, they would be a bad person who would do everything in their power to make everyone's dreams about their dreams and nothing would come true. This movie is the same thing as that movie. I'm hoping to see some serious acting out there and maybe even some nice one-line characters. But if the only thing is good is that, then it's disappointing to me.  It's funny to see a movie about a man with an attitude who is just trying to find a way to survive. He looks like he's got some ideas and tries hard to find some way to get out of the darkness he lives in and try to get some new place where he's not alone and his dad is there to help him. But when he gets there, his dad comes along to help and to stay with him, and that's when his dad goes from an alcoholic and drug addict to a nice person who doesn't seem to really care about him. There is an ending that is so poor, it's so bad, it really isn't funny and I don't think it could be funnier than that movie, considering it was a remake of a bad 80's movie: a movie that doesn't take any of the real actors seriously and really doesn't deserve it's sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film for many of my friends and they have looked at it and they find it to be an insult of sorts. It does not belong to the show and it is so predictable that I had to look at the video to see how it would affect people. I cannot figure out what it does to me. I suppose it is a remake of a bad horror film but I think it has taken its place and I cannot find the same on. I am so angry. If you are in love with horror movies, beware of this movie! You might be surprised if you find the truth about it, but you won't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe the producers had to spend millions of dollars to make a movie about a high school romance that has absolutely nothing to do with any real school in the city of Philadelphia. There is no real plot, no real story, no clue that anyone in this school has anything to do besides going to a prom. This film is like a soap opera with no plot. The acting is terrible, the dialog is poor, and the storyline is terrible. In a real city, you could do better.  If you see this film, please see it with a big box label, and throw this off the shelves and watch it instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I thought the acting was bad, and some parts were good, but that's just because the director messed up. You have to watch this movie for 20 minutes to understand what it is. I didn't know who the cast was, and I couldn't figure out the story. I also know that all of the women are totally unrealistic, and there are all kinds of special people who get paid to appear in this movie, but i don't even know what they do. And the acting is not good. It's like watching a soap opera.  I hope the studio decides to make another movie like this in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films ever. Its not too bad. It is just a cheap excuse to use for a low budget film about a young boy who is married with the family. Its really not a true documentary, but it still deserves to be an in-film movie. I had to watch it again on TV for the first time as part of a tribute to the young. The acting is so bad that it would be just plain bad if it was a real documentary. This film was a big embarrassment, so I don't know why you would rent it to watch. Maybe you are wondering why you watch it?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a great movie, the best one I've seen since the last time I saw it. I've also seen the original "Naughty Girl" but the remake had it's own problems. It was terrible to watch, not worth even as a single title but to get into the plot I had to sit for an hour and a half of the movie. The first 2/3 of "Nasty Girl" was okay, but it was way too long and they didn't make the whole movie. This film should have been made for no one who had the intention to watch it. Its not like a cheesy film, it wasn't like a film at all, just a film with bad ideas. The director got bored and got some good work on the special effects, but the acting was terrible, the characters were annoying and the plot was boring.  I hope this will never get released. But it wasn''t long, and I've already watched 10 movies of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised this was so low-budget. I'd like it to be a bit better, but this movie is so badly done that it needs to be rated as a 10. The story is so thin that if you get bored and don't really enjoy it, it's not worth watching for its own sake. If you're interested in anything else, watch something else, or even just one good movie: the first two movies are pretty good, but you could get some interest from the second one.  There is no discernable storyline and no real emotion, so I really wish they hadn't been wastedfully ripped out for me. The best way to watch this movie would be to avoid it altogether.  I do wish it were a horror film, but that's about as much as the best way you can get to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is a sequel to the original, I can't even be sure. But I'm sure it isn't, and what is this movie anyway? If the sequel is in fact "The Matrix" and all the scenes in this movie were supposed to be the same as those in the original movie, then this movie really is a complete failure. It is not a good movie, in fact, it is absolutely awful, and I'm afraid to the first thing that it has done is to make it worth to anybody who is actually serious about science or something else. There's absolutely no plot or characters in this film, and there's only one character. If the film is supposed to have some hidden elements, I'd be very concerned. But it's absolutely pathetic, it's not a great movie nor enjoyable. And I don't expect anyone to like it either. It does not hold itself together, it doesn't take itself seriously, and it just goes downhill in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this movie has a lot of problems and this movie really does not represent a true story! I would like to put it down as a comedy but I cannot. The acting in the movie is also bad and there is no story at all. The way the story is told shows a lack of realism which makes the movie very bad. I cannot get used of this movie. I hope that the person who is watching this movie is going to see it as a joke and the rest of the world will understand it as nothing. In the mean of course, it would mean that the world is too stupid to be happy and that's what this movie shows.   If you want to have a good movie like this, please watch this movie if you liked films with better story lines, and if you have no plot at all, then you will most likely die of the hell out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of this movie. It starts on the very strange premise that there was an explosion in London. There were many explosions in London and the story is that the mayor of London, Arthur Hays, was very obsessed with a bad bomb in London, which was so bad that Hays decided to try and make the bomb go off.  The story begins when Hays and his gang of men make a bomb for Hays to get rid of the gang's boss to eliminate the problem. Hays goes in and has his team of men detonate the bomb and the bomb goes off in a very weird way. I think it was very bizarre and should have been better. Unfortunately, there are no plotlines and the movie is completely devoid of all the classic elements of a good story. It's just horrible and there is no sense of a plot. I have to say that the acting is bad. It just doesn't work and the actors can't deliver any scenes. The story is about a guy who buys his girlfriend and goes on a date with her and then the guy goes on vacation with his girlfriend after he has all of his friends come to see him and he decides to break up with them. After he's gone on vacation, he's back in town and is getting drunk and starts a new relationship with his friend (Kai) in which the main character of the movie decides to run to a bar where they are having a drink and fight with him. They then meet the main characters in the pub where the guys are drinking and he has his girlfriend that has taken off to get a drink. I believe that he and his girlfriend are drunk and fighting with each other in the scene, but it does not escalate to the point where the main actors are actually fighting. At the end of the story, the main bad guys kill the guy and try to get revenge, but there are many bad guys in the movie who are killed and there are also other characters who have to kill each other one. I'm not sure what the point was to killing them, but I assume it was to scare the mayor from making the explosion of London and not to make Hays do something bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I got to watch this film, I was expecting to like it and was disappointed. There are no plot or characters in this movie and the acting is terrible. The best way to get a feel for the movie is to see it with an adult, preferably with a friend. If you have friends, don't let them watch this movie.  I gave this movie a one star rating because I didn't understand what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After this film was released I was quite shocked to learn the fact that the story behind this film is an absolute waste of time. I mean there's no story. There is no story, no plot, no story and there is no plot. The whole film is a complete failure in the most pathetic way.  The plot is so lame that it would be funny if it could actually get from its start. As a result I think this movie could have been totally forgotten and the DVD box would have been sold out again. It is a waste of money to buy, an insult to those of us who really loved this film. It would be a shame if this video was released for free so that millions of people would lose their minds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was one good moment in the movie when some really good moments were present. The ending was so horrible I couldn't finish it. The way it is portrayed could be dangerous. I've watched this movie twice and it hasn't helped me to sleep at night. The actors were so poor. The dialog was awful and the storyline could be so badly done. It could have been better for the filmmakers. The movie could have made a better ending, but it didn't. It's just a sad ending of a poorly done movie. I'll never watch this movie again. I don't know what other movie this movie might have been like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend's sister and I were both crying when the movie was showing. It's just awful, and it has no appeal to me. I'm a big fan of all Disney movies and have watched every one of them, and I feel like that's wasted time. This is the worst Disney movie I have ever seen. I've even given my mom an extra hour and a half a chance. My wife and brother laughed, and there's a reason why. They want to be sad, and so did my brother, and we watched them together. I never saw them after that. The movie doesn't have enough plot or characters. It has an awful cast of actors. I can't find the name of the cast, and not only have they, but also has them go through the whole process of finding a suitable actress to play them. They are very bad actors. My sister and me both laughed and they didn't care. What the hell did they do when they found us? Do you know what happened to them? I can hardly even understand it. I want to find out more about it and I'm not going to watch it again. This has to be stopped for the sake of my girlfriend, the person I know most would get lost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could have been funny, but it wasn't. If you know that the last of a series of TV shows was a sitcom, you are already well acquainted. In this movie, they are in full on "The Good Wife" mode. They didn't even get the chance to be in a "Amerty" episode. The idea of this show was that the actors were in serious pain, as they were in their 60's and 70's, so they would be in serious danger. That idea failed.  In the beginning, the cast is all over the place. The camera was bad as usual, the sets were bad, but the actors weren't doing themselves. The first scene was when the character Chystal said she was in some pain and was going to die. Chystol was in that very brief scene (as usual, it happens every time a character says something like that). The scene that didn't happen (I'm not sure which happened) was when Tung Kee, the female singer, looked up the clock and then told her to get in a good bath. Chrystal was clearly annoyed at the fact that she got a bad massage, and her hair was very dirty. The hair and skin looked good, and there was nothing wrong.  Tung Lee and Kee are in the same group, but they also had problems.  I believe the movie could be a sitcom in the true sense, and that would be a pretty good place to make a movie. However, I was surprised at how little the movie actually is. It was simply the old model of TV sitcoms, or maybe just a bad sequel. And the actors are never in a mood, and the characters are so badly scripted it really is hard to follow. The main theme is just another plot line thrown out there, and never actually delivered. The viewer should be able to follow the characters, and even without the drama, the movie is actually very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a movie buff. I was looking for this movie to go, and was disappointed. It was a very bad movie, and I can not recommend it at all.  I will only give it one and a few stars. (2 out of 10) I had some problems with some characters, but all of them were good, with the exception of the old lady. The lead was fine, but the acting was not good. The old lady was not in the way and I think that they were supposed to be more than just good old ladies.    Overall, it is not a great film. In any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A strange choice to make a horror film for a film editor's "Horror Film" label. The main story focuses on a group of strangers who are just trying to survive. The plot is very strange and is pretty predictable. There are many mistakes about the plot, characters and the ending. Even though the movie is not based on the book, the book itself is not done well enough for the movie to be scary. In fact, a lot of reviewers prefer to have it labeled as a horror movie. There is not one horror scene that was scary, and the main character, the girl in a black sweater, is not scary, which is why we have the writer of the movie, which apparently had a very good writing talent. There was a time when people in the world would not even know who she was, and she was just a little bit of a freak. The movie is bad at it's own end and fails at its own end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie seems to be about a "Possession for Life" film with a plot twist. The only problem is that it never really has a plot, even though there is a lot of blood that appears to be thrown at it.  All it does is give you a taste of the life that these people live. I've never really got that feeling. I'll give it two out-and-one for it. It doesn't matter though... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad in every way. I'm very sorry about this movie. It is the only thing that ever has worked so far. But you have to love them to have nothing good.  I hope it's gone out for good. But this movie is NOT worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first problem is the premise. The premise was the typical Hollywood formula for a high-profile movie. This movie doesn't even start with the same premise. In fact, this movie didn't even have a story line. This is all the way around and the main character, Michael Soruk, is never shown in a movie before this.  The film doesn't go on for too long. It's really quite predictable. It relies on an ending and then takes place. The end was pretty predictable. The story takes place in a small hotel with a small population of people. The hotel owner is an old couple. The police force, though still very dangerous, doesn't seem to be a danger. The leader of the police force is dead and there is a car theft. Nothing happens in the next few minutes. I think this movie is really bad. The only thing in this movie that matters is that Michael Soruku does some work. He's pretty good in that role. But the rest of the acting is awful. It is hard to watch without knowing why your favorite movie is so bad. I don't think a "Michael Soruk" movie is good for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It starts off with a brief scene in a movie: a man finds a mysterious man in a gas station in the desert. There is a huge firestorm around, and the movie is about to end when he meets the mysterious man who is supposedly the greatest of the world. I can honestly say that he was the worst person I have ever seen. And even if I saw the movie again at a later time, I wouldn't be able to sleep with him.  The next time I saw this movie was the first time I had read about this movie.  I was so upset, I left the movie at a movie store, and even though I still got home and was watching the movie a second time, it still had to be the last movie I watched. But it's not the only bad movie, here is the movie with a female singer. The singer is called "Lela" and she wears a very sexy black swimsuit with a crotch cut and a crotch strap. When the male singer is coming on stage, the woman is in the same outfit, but she is naked.   This is a terrible movie, with a really bad script and an awful special effects. The only reason I can remember seeing it again is because it was a fairly decent movie, but this movie needs to be used in a fire-storm situation to make you believe the actor is the best actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie a couple times, so I know exactly how it feels to me. I think it was very bad to be a "Carnack's first movie", and I am embarrassed to say that Carnack did everything wrong to this movie.  I also know that his first movie was about the "Woo to be" film and that he tried to imitate the film. But this film is very bad, in my opinion, and I can understand why, if you watch it, you won't find any enjoyment out of it. It is terrible bad.  If you are expecting a great movie, watch a great film; if you like a horror movie, read a good movie!   If the makers of this movie tries to replicate "WO to be", they'll just get an even worse movie. I was hoping to find something good in it, and the movie is really good, but unfortunately, I cannot find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've come a long way back to see this film in the theater and i'm having a lot of fun, but now it looks very bad! I know, it is for those of us who have a huge passion for acting, and this film just doesn't have the same quality as an actual acting film. That is a real shame! I don't care what they put in the cast. The acting is just the bad. This is one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. It really is like a video game, with all the same animations and animations, with the same old plot from the previous movie, but without the fresh new ideas.  I really tried to see the last version of this film, but I gave it a chance and I didn't find anything in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of some of the "Holes" films. They often contain a lot of great acting and make for very entertaining films. I would suggest watching these movies before seeing them in their intended context. This has not been that case in this movie, as well as with others. The director is obviously unaware of the fact that he was working with two different guys. In this movie he keeps trying to go for more laughs and it shows that he is a complete idiot. There is nothing remotely funny in this film and it was just plain awful. The plot is absolutely pathetic and it is not funny to watch. The characters are just two guys and one day, they are having a sex party and they all go to bed to get undressed, and they soon realise they're all sleeping together. A guy called "Big Bad Guy" is there to fill the gap in the story with an action scene where one of the guys is lying naked in a motel room. He is accompanied by an old man who is acting as a manager, with his wife, who goes to an insurance agent to get him a house to rent. When he arrives home he is on the lookout for an old lady with a young boy, who has been sexually assaulted by another guy. The young boy has done such a dirty thing that he gets arrested and he has to pay to have her bail.  The old man is not as funny as the other guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was appalled watching this film, I did not care for anything to do with it, my family didn't even think much of it. My children have been watching this movie for about 4 or 5 years now, and I thought I was going to like it when they would begin showing a video to their parents. I did get a kick out when it ended, it was horrible! The story is so bad and it's not even a good film, there is no story line or plot at all. There is nothing to like about this movie, and when I watch it I can't understand why my children feel like they are so bad. I can only assume this is the same thing as a movie about a teenager that tries to be "strong" and get all the girls to act. If you want to watch a movie that is bad, you'll find something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie the lowest grade. It's not even funny. And, like a lot of people have said, it's not funny. That's the only way that it could be funny. It is really a disaster! I have to agree with the people who liked the other part of the movie and made fun of it, it was a bit hilarious and funny. If the movie is to be a low comedy, it should not be. It should never be funny and really, it shouldn't. It has nothing in it to make any funny scenes. It isn't funny in fact. It was an odd film. You would definitely think a movie made by the writer of "Cannon's Last Dance" would be funny but here it is! It is so bad it is really painful.  I don't think it's even worth to see this movie. Maybe the only good part is the first scene where the woman gets in the bath with the men from the movie. But if you want to see it and laugh, you will have to pay for the movie, because you won't even get a decent joke from this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is basically an excuse for a bunch of people to dress like an elf and get into an alien-themed world. this was easily my worst movie since "Alien" was released. It has absolutely zero action and has no plot at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that I didn't even want to rent it because it had terrible acting. This movie is about a guy, the main character, who can't speak English. It has a very weak storyline, so the acting is terrible. It also has bad special effects, but I don't think the special effects could be good if it was to bad. There were so many stupid moments that I just laughed out loud while watching it. I can see why the filmmakers tried to create a character that could act. I'm a writer, too, and this movie just shows us as a joke. I donno know if this movie is a comedy or a horror, and I think it could also be both. It really needs to be saved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I lived in San Francisco I remember the bad movie that I saw in the late 70's, called "Kali" or "Sangen." The story is a plot of a young woman, who becomes pregnant. The pregnant woman (Susan) falls in love with the young man (Mark) who is trying to become pregnant and is assisted by the doctor (Kali) and the doctor's wife. However, the doctor encourages him to "do what he'll do" - the most stupid move a person can do. Mark and Susan are in love, despite the fact that they have both dated two very good people.  The movie begins with a montage of an elaborate scene showing Mark andSusan running around, with various scenes involving Mark and his friend (Jill) and even briefly appearing as an actor, who plays his father, and Mark and the baby sister. When Mark goes into the clinic and begins to give the doctor an injection, he gets into a fight with a guy named "The Boss." The two actors are dressed like a firemen, who are in the process of pulling Mark and Jill away from the doctor and away from them. Then it is time for another montage showing Mark on a boat as he is attacked by an octopus. It is not enough to see the plot and then have it happen, and the story goes off without any kind of plot or plot.  After a few scenes, the actors are killed and the film just gets lost, but it comes with no real direction or direction. It would seem that this would have been a very good movie to go with for a young teen-film, with some good music to accompany it. If you liked the music, you might really have a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not quite as bad as other people might expect, but it definitely falls far from The House of NIMO. It starts on a very lame story premise.  It is a waste of money and it is just plain bad. In my opinion, this film would be lost to the whole world. It is disappointing that it's the only movie that I have seen that has a positive review about the original House of Nemo. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many things that make the movie seem like a plot of a fantasy movie. Nothing is truly realistic about any of the characters. Just the fact that the cast members were acting and acting in the movie didn't help. And the acting was extremely boring, very corny and completely disconnected from reality. It just makes me think that the writer has nothing to do, they could just watch TV and write it. The acting is also so bad that I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who is actually looking for an enjoyable film. It's just not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. A plot with a plot twist never realy got the job done, the ending never really ended. The ending seemed to have something in it that made it more interesting. I think there was a little more going on there than this whole thing, though I have to say there was really something going on with the ending. You just got a sense of the whole thing without even knowing that the thing was supposed to be a film. A very bad movie I'd recommend to watch if you're bored or if you have nothing to do with it. I can't recommend this movie for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie has a pretty low budget for a horror film. It isn't scary, but that just doesn't matter in this case. It is sad that it took 40 years to have this idea made. I do wonder if they could do it again and I'm not sure if they'd put this down. A horror movie isn't good, but this is even worse than a film which makes you sick.  There is nothing in this movie to scare the heck out of anyone. There are scenes, but I don't know if they were actually scare enough. I'm sure if you want horror, you should look at the next two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not for anyone who wants to watch the sequel to the original and/or just want to see the original. This movie doesn't do anything to do well, it's worse than some of the Disney films from the Disney Channel. This makes the most disappointing film ever to be released in the US. The first installment was just a horrible little flick, but then the sequel was even worse. It didn't do any things that were right, but that didn't mean much. There was an incredibly bad storyline, the acting was awful and the editing and special effects were horrible. This film had to be put down. There were no clues whatsoever about what this film was about or even did. If you're looking to see this movie, you won't. Avoid the whole thing. If the director and the producers think their work is to be made for the American market, then you won''t find out anything about this movie. There is no plot, no mystery, no real mystery to the characters. Nothing about this is worth anything. There are a lot of things that have been done better in other Disney films. I am not sure that any of those other Disney movies will provide any better movie than this movie or any of the other Disney classics. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been many years since I saw this. I can't tell what it has been now. I just watched this movie in the theater. I think that it is just not to good. I would not recommend this movie unless for the fact that it was good for one person, but just because it is about a few old women who are in their seventies like me. It is about nothing but trash and gross. It's not funny, and it's not even funny in a gross way. It should not even be considered an "fan film". It has more than 60 stars on it. I don't think it was a good movie for anyone. It didn't have any meaning. It was just a way to be really bad at making movies. It also doesn't have a lot of value. But what's the fun of watching a bad film? It was like watching an animal film. The only thing it has got is a really bad ending! The ending is also really cute! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was horrible from the first frame. The whole movie looked like it could have been from the '90's, and the plot lines are ridiculous. The entire cast is terrible, the acting is bad, the plot is poor and the ending is awful, which really should have been the most entertaining movie ever made in the history of Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so unbelievably bad it should be regarded as "Pimping". I can only describe it as a "bad film" about a crappy, possibly illegal, movie! There are a handful of plot twists, but most of the things don't matter much. The acting seems to go by the book. The script seems to be about every character having some major flaw, or having a "scream" about an awful movie. The best part of this movie was the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad that my father went to see it again on a film festival. I did not have time to finish this movie and even as I watched it I tried to think I'd be entertained. I was so scared. It was horrible. In one area there was no good animation and very poor special effects. I had to sit through a lot of the film so I couldn't really feel like watching it. There was nothing interesting about the plot. Some of the images were bad but by far the worst was the hair changing scene at the end. I don't think I can understand how it happened. Also, some of the characters were horrible but by the way they look, they are so silly that I just can't have any respect for them. They were supposed to be older and they were. When they are older they don't do their funny bit of humor. I just don't like how they act or how they interact. And in the end I did appreciate the fact that they are really people. I think this movie is so bad it probably won't last. I know I'm in the middle of the movie so I'll give this one 3 stars out of 10. That could be the best movie for the kids who like a bit of horror but they could also be an enjoyable movie for kids like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be a very poor idea to waste some time to see. Some scenes were badly made, the camera had no idea what it was going to do and seemed to be completely lost in the middle. The action is absolutely pointless and boring, and I think the film did an hour or so out. In all, the film had the potential to be better than the original. Unfortunately, I think it's just a few minutes short of your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first came to see the movie I was skeptical, and I thought the movie was cute, but that did not help me.  The movie begins with a short scene that shows some of the characters, and then things go off downhill. The film is basically two guys playing with the same two guys that played in the previous movie, in a completely uninteresting way. If you want to watch the movie for the sake of comedy, then I think it is a pretty bad movie. The characters are completely boring and one of them is gay, but the other two are gay with each other guy.  There are no characters that relate to the movie properly, and the dialogue is poor, and although I can't find any funny dialog between the two guys.  If you have nothing to do with the movie, watch the original DVD: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director, Mr. Stairley, is quite unhappy with his script, the actors are not to be surprised with the film, and the story is boring.  I would like to point out why the story was boring, and why the film ended so early.  The only one who gets it right is the actress, Sharon Stone, a veteran actor from many years, although she is no great actor. She plays the film with no chemistry whatsoever, and she has not a chance to win, but she has to earn the viewer's trust. She does not earn the trust of the viewer.  Sharon Stone is a woman that lives in a small town in Texas, so her acting skills will be completely wasted in this film, which is bad enough on its acting skills.   Other than Sharon Stone's performance, all the characters are bad, the dialog is bad, and a poor film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, which I read about for my kid, turns the old way of cinema! It's basically an action movie in the worst way possible... not even a "real" film.  I was hoping to see something that would not be so bad, but sadly I did not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I'm a movie-obsessed and obsessed about that. My brain can't make it out that this movie was based on a real life event (I'd like to see this thing as a series of episodes with some plot). It was bad enough to be an overly depressing movie but the badness comes in the form of an even worse movie. The plot is really bad and the characters are weak. I think the main reason the movie was released is because there's nothing else to talk about, so nobody would really talk about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading a lot of positive reviews of the film, I was surprised at the fact that I had never heard any of this movie. I was shocked and perplexed when I opened this movie and I was so sick of it that I actually decided to rent it.  It was a very disappointing movie that really needed an ending. The movie starts out nice but quickly becomes annoying. After about 20 minutes, I found myself just one more reason to leave.  The worst part about this film is that, although the plot is interesting, the characters are so predictable that they are uninspiring and unsyntastic. The acting was poor and the dialog was poor, although I did like some of the cast, especially the actors. They were just plain bad and I couldn't even finish this movie, much more so when I saw the sequel when it came out, which I liked very much.  I would be interested to see some reviews about this movie that I would watch because it is so bad. The only good part is that the ending is good, although it was a weak ending and only moderately entertaining. If you were a lover of the book, or an aspiring actor, or someone who likes a good movie, you will definitely not enjoy this movie much. This movie is a very bad movie that should have never been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had been so happy with this movie - it had a good ending - but it just wasn't great.  So, I can't imagine that this was any kind of film at all - it's not even as good as the ones I remembered seeing from the 70s. It just really just a bad comedy that doesn't work.  There are some nice lines that remind me of some good things.  But it's just a terrible movie and there are no redeeming qualities. If you see it, don't even watch it and don't think about it - you'll just waste half of your time watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What did I see out at my last viewing were these three characters that are supposedly all in their own head! (1.) The wife and husband are apparently twins, the husband was also married to a previous wife, and it turns out that the father's "son" is married to the wife, then the wife then becomes pregnant! (2.) There is no reason whatsoever why the husband and wife's characters should be in this movie; it is a very amateurish film. Some of the dialog is bad but it is mostly in line with the plot, which is really a poor excuse to a lot of lazy viewers. 3. There is also a scene involving the brother's girlfriend at the previous movie, which does a decent job of keeping this movie's message fresh.  4. The scene is of two women in a bar, one of them is naked while the other is talking with another woman, who is also naked. The women then take turns of a conversation and have sex with each other man, then they all go back to the bar to fight in a brawl. The guys have sex in the bar, and the woman is screaming at the guys and then leaves.  If the husband were in the house, his friends would see the woman on the floor; that would be the most shocking scene.    5. There's also a lack of plot in this film. The husband does his job well and doesn't even need to be involved in the scene with the woman; he is simply a "family friend".  However, if the husband is in the family's house, it would not be such a big issue; the girl still gets to have sex, the woman still gets a fight with another man, the men and the other woman finally have sex then the women have sex together, and finally the men walk away after their fight, so who knows who gets the money?  8. There are no believable scenes in this flick, I didn't even think to review it to tell my friends because I couldn't think of any plausible ending. I just gave it to a guy who had seen this flick and he said he found the movie a bad effort. I had seen the movie in my high school and could tell that it was just an unimpressive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was horrible. The cast was terrible, the direction was bad, the story was stupid, the camera felt very dull. All the good stuff in this film was not. The idea of the "film" wasn't that original and it seemed pretty silly. The other side of the story is interesting but the storyline is just plain bad.  I have never seen this film twice and I was sad about the whole thing because I would like to find out if this movie is getting a low review and not only for the obvious bad acting in it, but for the stupidity of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about it was that the director was apparently competent. It's just the worst film I've seen in this entire year. The acting is terrible and the story is pathetic. The fact that it's a comedy film doesn't help.  The acting in it is laughable and the stories are boring, boring and the whole story is so thin that it needs to be put to sleep.  I can see a great actor, like James Gandolfini, in some of the films but this one doesn't even make me believe. I'm sick of these movies because they are so poorly executed, they just aren't good enough. The only thing that saved this movie was the song of the song. I think I was the person who tried to make this movie, because I had just watched one of my favorite movies of the year, "The Incredible Borings." I was very tired and didn't want to waste any more time. It had me crying and laughing after seeing the song that was played. The song was about a guy who has gotten himself beaten by a pig and has eaten the pig's flesh, and he is so drunk that he is throwing his own weight off. He throws his weight to the pig and that's why he doesn't need his pig flesh anymore. A pity, because it was the only song I can hear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only thing that I can say with any regard to this movie. I don't know what to make out of it, if it is for me. I mean, it's got a whole lot of stupid stupid acting. I get bored very easily. I just wish someone took more time and thought about how to write a positive review about this movie: because it's the only movie I've seen that I actually really like so much.  So let me just go on and look at the stupid parts. But don't even watch this if you can. The story begins with the narrator taking an ice break in an ice skating rink and they get into an awkward skit for a few minutes. Then the narrator is involved in a murder, so the police investigation, and the narrator gets involved in the murder. When the narrator finally goes to the scene where the murder was committed, the scene starts with the camera rolling. There are a couple of stupid moments that would have made this movie laugh out the whole thing, but if you liked it don't get too attached.  But, for those that do enjoy it, there is a really good skit where the narrator has a few beers and gets into a confrontation with the murderer. But I really have to warn you, just because this movie is so dumb, it can easily throw off your patience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is one thing that makes this movie bad.  The film is full of all kinds of nonsense and is very boring, i.e. the plot is predictable, that it's not funny.  I would have to say that the acting is poor, the film is badly edited and it's really bad. I'm not saying that the director is bad, but in a way it's so obvious that he just can't write well.  It has some pretty decent actors but those actors just don't make it worth watching. And I thought the director should have at least tried to improve the acting in this film. I don't understand how it happened and I think there's a chance to improve this film, but it's just really bad IMO.  Other then is to watch this film in the 3 or 4th grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many movies I like better than movies I hate. Some might have been good, some not. This movie, to me, falls into the awful category of 'crap-on-the-a-bed' movies. The movie was simply a poor imitation of a good movie; I saw it in two parts and couldn't figure out who would do this, even with a big screen and a huge camera. When I saw my 10-second viewing of this movie I couldn't understand what it was about. I didn't like the movie very much. I don't know where it came from, but I know it wasn't anything good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a huge disappointment as a horror/throbble film about the world. It's not a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was bad. I found myself very dubious about this movie. I did not expect the characters to be as annoying as they were. I'm still hoping they would improve. I've seen a few of the other movies, and they seem to get better. The dialog is not good. If the movie wasn't so bad, it would be better. Unfortunately, the plot was predictable and seemed to be very predictable. This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story begins with the three main characters, all of whom are very stupid. There are two guys named "the first person" who is, as you'd expect, a very rich man who lives in luxury apartments on the edge of the city.  The movie begins with a series of plot lines that do not make much sense. I believe they are trying to shock you out, because the people who write this are trying, but I don't see how people could be surprised by this sort of stuff. At the same time, the movie starts off with the most obvious example of a character being completely stupid. The first guy is named "Mr. Dang" and he is a guy who does not care about his wife, but he does not want to kill a deer.  He wants to buy some bad-looking fur coat, and he does a lot of things with the girl he's going to meet. He does a job for his friends and he gives a lot for rent, but does not pay anything and the girl leaves to meet with him.  One day he is sent to a store where the girl buys an animal, so he uses the woman's clothes to get the animal, because he thinks it will be used to hide the animal from the police. It does not work.   At some point, the main character begins a "work-in-progress" plot with his friends, and then he starts a firefight with the police to make his life easier. The guy's friend, the girl who is wearing a fur coat with her and is named Liana, is killed in an accident.  Other villains get involved in a similar sort of plot, and so the story goes from bad to good. I had to stop watching because I didn't want to take it all the way.  There was a scene involving an office manager who seemed to be very good at his job. He told me he was planning to take a job, and a few minutes later I thought I was watching him getting killed in a work-in progress. This was the only point I was really interested in watching. I didn an evil cop.  It was so bad that I stopped watching again. I don t get frustrated about it.  I did have to admit that this is probably the worst film I've seen. In an excellent way, there is a scene during one of the characters' turns in and the first person is shown. However, the actor turns it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, if you know any American or Japanese people who have never seen the Japanese version of this movie, you will undoubtedly be surprised to find out that the Japanese versions have been much more interesting than the Japanese ones.  This movie, for the purposes of being an amusing Japanese film, had two distinct problems. Firstly, it was unbelievably horrible. It was just awful and so disappointing to see a movie that has such a bad and so predictable and disappointing ending. The second problem is that there is no connection between the two main characters, both of whom are supposedly "smart" and "smart-like", and this connection is never established, even in the Japanese translation, which, as usual, is so bad and disappointing.  The movie itself is also terrible. I am not a big fan of this series, but if I was, it would be one of my first few hours of watching one of the Japanese movies.  It could have been better if it had more funny scenes and better plot. But, that would be a bit boring, and so sorry.  Still, this movie is interesting from the Japanese point of view, but the Japanese view of it is so stupid that it is unbelievable and unapparent. I don't think this is an example of the worst Japanese movie ever made; perhaps the Japanese would like to produce an American version of the film. The Japanese have had this movie for 30 years, with only one small improvement to date. I do hope it won't be the worst film ever made by Japan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really thought this movie was a piece of rubbish.  It really is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I just hate it. This movie is based on a very shallow, totally pointless character. I can't believe that the people who thought this was a good movie are stupid. It's such a horrible film that I really wanted to tear the guys apart and beat them up with it. It is really hard to understand who these characters are and what their opinions are, and even worse when you do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found the movie, as I was bored, at a DVD rental center. I thought it was a film made for teenagers, because I wanted to try and laugh. I was really annoyed by the acting, as they were literally all badly acted. The acting was terrible and the dialog was awful. Also, I found out the ending was totally predictable. It wasn't funny when I read it, but it was really stupid. I found myself getting bored watching it. I'm not sure if it was an 'C' or 'K' movie, although I do remember reading it as an 'E' movie and even 'A' movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Vengeance" is a movie that is so bad that I have to give it a 10 out 8 for "weakest" in comedy. I have also seen the DVD and the audio commentary on the movie that are actually quite useful. Still, I still find the movie a bit funny. But that's all a bad thing. If you want to watch a movie whose sole purpose is to appeal to people who want to be funny, this film fails for its own sake. It is obviously a copy of "The Fugitive" but it just has a different style and a worse script than the original. It would be interesting if one actually saw the original script to try to salvage some of the humor in it. I really don't know what was going through the mind of the original actors in the original or the actors in this film. The movie itself has nothing interesting to offer but is so dull in it's execution that it's hard to enjoy the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I don't know why the writer and director were so surprised. They should have known what was going to happen. It's a pity of the time we live. The story is about a teenager who comes to a stop-bull with a bunch of hounds. You can't even understand the story when she arrives, the gang-joke, her first reaction to the stop-band, and you can't tell what happens. I can only guess that it's going to be some sort of horror movie with a horror twist. She then turns into a serial killer who starts off with a shotgun aimed at a poor kid. A series of bloody scenes then ensues which seem to be a fairly simple thriller. I'm not sure what is going on. It seems to be mostly just a bunch, but I'm afraid to say, it could be a film with some creepy scenes. It could get in the dark, and I guess there was a woman with a knife inside her pants just recently. The characters are not as interesting as they would have been. I don, however, enjoy her scenes. I think there were also some scenes that weren't so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for an interesting movie that could have me even remotely enjoy. It wasn't an excellent film, it was a pretty bad one. But I did like the movie and got a few minutes into it. I was not thrilled with the ending, but it was very interesting and pretty good. I just got sick from all the bad things that were in the movie. My favorite thing in the whole movie was that the guy played in the beginning of the movie, had just moved to an apartment in the next town where he had never heard of anyone else. He had fallen asleep, had nothing to do with his room. The movie ended about 90 minutes in. It would be nice to have seen it again, but I don't want to waste any time and buy it. It made me angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this movie was a part of the MuppetVision 2. The main problem is the characters' performances and the lack of good performances. I don't think I'm able to call this movie entertaining. I think the Muppets have been better than the Morkie's in their debut.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave it 2 stars because of its rating (I think I gave 4 stars only because of the fact that the actress is a popular actress, and I think that if you watched it without seeing this movie you'd be mad to find out. I'm sure the writer was nice and probably even a genius, but it's not funny, it's annoying, it looks like it had a million dollars worth of money, and it was hard to watch. The plot was bad as I would expect from a movie about a movie with a writer who had no idea how to use the plot so he wrote a script. There was no clue how to handle the characters and the acting was bad.  The actor was not even funny, but there were other important characters in the movie, like the two policemen, the guys who were supposed to be "the bad guys". The girls were probably the worst ones in this movie. The only good character in the whole film was the girl, whose character was kinda like a teenager, and her role in the story was more than likely to go to hell.  I've always wanted to see a good movie like this, and although I tried to watch it I gave up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the version I always thought I could not expect from this movie. It seems to be just another stereotypical romantic romance that doesn't have any romantic tension or anything to the characters. One side of this movie is that the girls are totally stupid - they just pretend everything happens, that their parents have made them friends, that they're in love, and that they want to make some nice friends. And when they want friends from some random country they are not, even after having them a boyfriend and having good sex, after they made them some time, after the end of their relationship they want them to have sex with their friends. These people, although cute and funny, they just don't like sex to be so much. And, just like the rest of the movies I've seen, it is not really funny or funny. It is really dumb and sad and depressing. I don't even like it that much, I'll admit, but the actors in the movie are not the great actors that I'd expect. I just want it to end right. I'd recommend this movie to people who are tired and sad for their lives, but most likely will give it to those who enjoy a movie from the other movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, this is a poorly scripted film with poor acting, a lack of visual effects, and the actors have bad voices and a bad script. The film also has some good moments but the overall quality is not good. Also, this film suffers from an overall lack of tension in the film.  I think there must be some kind of censorship in this film. Otherwise, the story is boring.  As a viewer, you will probably not like the film, but if you go in to see this film, do NOT rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this one I agree with the description, i'm not a fan of these kind of movies. If there is a good one, I would really like to see it. I don't see why the two movies that make the list are so popular, but there are a few excellent movies that have been more popular than the original movies. So, I'm going to say that all those movies don't make their own ratings, but I do understand the intention of the producers to present their work to a consumer, but this particular version of "The Matrix" failed miserably. It wasn't even funny. There is nothing that makes you laugh. I won't watch it, nor will I ever rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Wash Your hair for life?" A guy gets to an expensive dance with his date. "Who's gonna get it?" The girl's friend is at his house. The girl is the only one at his place. The guy leaves and comes to a couple's party at the beginning of the movie, and starts to smoke with his friends.  I'm not sure what he's smoking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it when i started watching it on 4/6/97 and was dismayous. It seemed to be all sorts of "nothing special" when I first saw it. I was so disappointed. It seems like the actor's back is no longer in the best movie lineup. It must be something else. I've seen many movies that have made me laugh and laugh, and movies that I've never laughed. They just seem to be a lot. But this movie is about to make me cry. I don't know whether it was one film, but I don\'t know. I found the movie really depressing. I find myself really annoyed by the acting and characters. I just wanted to see something that didn\'t seem to contain any humor or wit. But when I saw the movie, I was really relieved to see the end. I hope that this movie will be made to become a bad sequel that nobody wants to see, just to take away the things that made it so funny. I thought it was so funny to see an actor as a character, especially one that seems so weak and incapable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is one plot.  In one episode, the main character, which is played by Robert E. Montgomery (who is the lead actor in the movie, and who played the main lead character in the first film), has been arrested on an accident in front of the bank he had with his associates. He is then released, with the help of the assistant at the bank who is an employee of the Bank who is there with the main protagonist. This is the same Bank he was employed with, and so the movie is just a joke. A plot and a story is nothing without a script. It is just another story of a couple of people who were arrested and are being pursued by the police. The rest of the movie just re-traits the events of the first movie. The director should have stuck with his first movie rather than making another sequel. The plot is the worst I've ever seen. If you have to watch this movie, you have a very weak excuse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just isn't funny at all. I think the writer should be in jail for something more than an hour. I'm serious. I'd like to see this movie brought up to the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am of the old school - an 80's style movie is not a film at all. It's just a simple story that does not have much story and plot. The camera doesn't work for a true horror-fest.  I think it would be a better horror than the typical American horror films, and in my opinion the producers should make the effort to make it interesting. In other words - it's boring! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even close to the original, as it contains a much worse story line than the original. And if they were that sort of person, they would've been in for a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the premise, which seems to be the thing that bothers me. I get that it's supposed to be a comedy movie with a little lighthearted material about how women should be in relationships, but instead it turns into a horror movie. I really think that this movie should have some good themes to try to get me out of its funk, and I want it to end sooner rather than later. But unfortunately this movie didn't have any good story to go with it. Its really just a simple sludge-filled horror film.  I would really recommend a 'funny' horror movie, but I just cannot give it any rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be the worst piece of work I've ever seen. It's the least interesting movie I've seen. I guess it must be because I didn't expect it to be so funny. This movie is so bad I just don't know who I'm watching. It looks like a made-up movie with no real story line and no good plot. There are few jokes. There is no good music. There aren't any good performances and no real romantic moments. There really just a complete disaster.  The acting in this movie is really awful, especially the main characters. There have never been so many of them in a movie before, never. Just for a laugh it was the funniest thing I've even seen, but it wasn't funny enough. This really made me feel like a total joke. What I just think is a very bad movie.  I think a lot of the acting in the movie is just bad, but I'm not a big fan of the characters. They're OK. They just don'n get the job done. What happens in this is just a bad version of "The Olyphs" movies.  This is probably the only film about a movie where I didn'€t know which parts I'll never see. I'd just go on a different movie: a very horrible film about the movie: this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was that? "Wadari," with all the twists, is supposed to be an Indian drama. The fact that the film was meant to be a film is a little too much. Although there are interesting little scenes that are part of the story of the movie, it's too obvious and too long. There are very, very few laughs. It is only a slight hint of some of the songs that we have seen.  The song of "Momma" is about how Indian people are obsessed with their mothers. And the fact that one of the Indian women in the story is a girl, that somehow spoils the story.  But most importantly, the ending of the film is quite stupid. It seems to be another Hollywood cliché. It doesn't have a real ending, but they are all pretty stupid.   There are better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not funny. In fact it looks so poor it looks like a copy of the 1970s. I'm not going to comment on this movie for the obvious reason, because I don't think you need it. And, I mean, it's not funny anyway, because the characters are too dumb to be funnier. And if you are a guy, you might actually like it, since you'd like to be so dumb. But the characters, especially the women, aren't so good. And what about the character? I really think they were just stupid, like the poor souls who were in the end just desperate to get the funny part in the movie. But don't take their own selfish attitude towards the world, since all the people in the film think this movie is funny and enjoy it. I know there are lots of people who enjoy this movie and find it funny, but I just can't see that point of view. I understand the movie as a comedy, but as a piece of an exploitive movie it is a very bad movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has all the trappings of a typical horror film and that doesn't mean a great deal. The storyline is weak and predictable, with no clue about what to do. The special effects are poor but they don't hurt much. The acting is laughable as always and the acting is a bit bland and predictable. A big problem here is the acting on these characters.  The acting seems to have been put in by one actor in a straight-shaming performance, the actor is very unfunny and is very bad.  This is an uncomfortable horror movie. This movie could be a remake of "Big Brother", and probably one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not even worth seeing, it just a pile of garbage. I never saw this film when it was last released before it was available on the DVD release. It looked like a film in development, and I think it was a little too late, because they have a very talented cinematographic director that can just turn it off and throw it out there. I mean, even in the beginning I thought the film was interesting, and it just seemed to be a waste of money. After two days and only 7 minutes in the film I was completely disappointed. I don't even think I could say that it was good for the actors to act. You know that these guys were paid to act, and there are really no good parts for the acting actors. The acting is weak, and the film's actors just don't get to act and make good dialog. But the cinematographer is so inept that he should never be considered a good cinematoncologist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film on IMDb, I was really a bit appalled. I know that this film is not as bad as some made out to be but it isn't funny and there's so much drama that it's hard to watch. The dialog is so thin and the story is so poor that it was hard to follow even from a straight out horror film. Even the main character (Alton) is not that funny, but what I want out of it is not a horror film but a comedy. You're simply watching a movie that is a bad idea. Also, the acting is really bad. I had to take a break from the film after one and it really bothered me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting at least one good movie, but I am still shaking my head after watching this one. A remake of the same movie a few years ago, this is the same concept, but it seems to have more of a chance to succeed. The plot doesn't have much in the way of plot, and the story is completely different from the original.  In the original, the setting is set in the far away town of the city where the hero's parents are living, but in this version, the plot is set off in the nearby village. The main character is named "Homer" and is an impulsive teenager who is a member of the village. He also has a father who has not been able to cope with him, and who is also the head of the town council. He and the other village residents are unhappy with him. They decide to build a factory in the village and hire a contractor to build it. In the beginning of the movie, there is a large row of women who is in charge of all of the construction materials, and they rent their own house and make a few million dollars for the factory. The two women, being responsible for building the factory, take a few days off and go to work, so that the women can take over the job. Later, the woman's husband is at the factory and makes the first few dozen of orders of the factory's construction, and at the beginning, the husband turns in his house of an office, which is rented out for rent.  The main characters of the story are just not capable of being a lot of characters in the movie. They are just boring, and each character is given a different job, with the main character doing a completely different job (and this is done with little purpose). However, in this movie, the character does get a job that is a bit complicated and gets himself killed a few minutes later by the main characters in a failed attempt to make it seem interesting.  Once there, the main plot is about the main villain (who he has just killed the woman) and the hero (who is also working for a nearby town that has a nearby army). The villain has several connections with the hero, so his main goal for the main hero is to get into his father's castle and have it built and his father is also killing the villain. After that, the hero takes his job to become a bar owner, but the villain sets off on him because he's convinced
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but the best ever movie ever made. There is no good or interesting plot lines, the acting is terrible and the acting and dialog is just awful. The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is the music. Some scenes are good and some are terrible. I can never remember who is dancing on the other song. I was surprised to learn that it is also made by a person who had nothing else to do. I guess the other singer was the lead singer. Also the music was very stupid and very poor. The video is so bad it does not make any good song or movie: it makes a great video of a terrible movie.  I can't believe a movie is so disappointing. I had a chance to see this movie with my friend after seeing it on the TV and I really must not have. Please beware of this crap and do not see this if you have any interest in the acting, music, or song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an incredibly cheap film. It wasn't really a film.  In fact, I think it was an entirely unstructured film that lacked any real suspense or drama. The story is just plain boring, and there was nothing interesting to talk about. The characters are basically a bunch of actors that are either bad actors or really bad actors, or some of them are just plain bad actors.   There was also some pretty bad acting on each of the main characters. None of them were good, but they weren't bad enough for me to even bother mentioning.  But, there's something about this film that makes me want to give it the rating of a low 10. This film is a really bad movie. If you don't have time, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I finally got my copy of this film I finally didn't like it, and then I just didn't know what to say. It was a bad film, but if you liked it, you had to have seen it, because it's very funny. This is a film that you don't see when it was made, and that's not a good sign if you want to see a movie that's been released without an even a decent editing or a decent plot. That's not even the worst version you'll find out about, because most movies will have you understand the whole plot, and even better ones will have a sense of humor, but at least a feeling of how much they can laugh at the jokes. It's just stupid. This movie has no humor and no plot. It had the worst comedy ever.  It wasn't even funny at times, but the ones who tried to make it funny had some comedic ideas. There were some hilarious jokes. However, for this film to be a bad-looking film, it should have at least had some kind of humor. It is the worst of all time I've seen in a movie ever. You can't say that it's an original film, and the ending was so bad I thought that I expected the ending to have some funny ending. I don't know if the end is funny, but it looks like it will. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie last night for the second time around and after that time I stopped watching it. I did not understand why the producers decided to make this film! It was simply a bunch of recycled parts, including the character from "Neces" and the characters from the film are pretty boring. The only thing I get is the 'Sister, a female in an office!' and the 'Brother, a male!' that you will see later in the movie. This movie fails for the exact reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure it was supposed to be funny. If you're an animal you're gonna die soon. Not so clever but the movie is so stupid, it's hard to understand what's happening and is bad, there are many scenes that don't even make sense. I give it a poor 1 out of 10 or so. You can't even recognize an animal in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was terrible. Its effects were bad. There are no one good or good people in this movie. Its one of the worst movies of all time. I just can't recommend it to anybody. This movie just had a bad ending. I'd like a sequel. But, if that was all of the story, its a real disappointment. The movie just didn't make any impression. A shame. The ending is just the same. If you guys are interested, check this movie out, but don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but an effort to generate more money - if we did the right way, we could at least have an idea. Of course, the way it works seems to make me angry. Even though this is a fairly light and light comedy, I would rate this movie as a one-dimensional comedy with little action sequences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a major piece of crap that I've seen since I was 11 years old. There are a few decent bits of a plot, some good scenes and some interesting special effects. But that's about all. The rest is just awful! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a clear attempt to be something fresh and original. The plot is a derivative of a novel. There is no real plot, not even the ending and the beginning of the movie, neither the ending nor the beginning.  The plot seems to be designed to appeal to the reader, but it was too derivative, and not original to appeal in that direction. There was a lot of effort that went into making the movie (if not in fact a lot) in making the plot. The ending didn't make any impact either, and the plot is completely nonsensical.  While there were interesting plots in the movie--with a couple of scenes involving a boy--the movie seemed to be lacking interest in the beginning and ending. There were too many unnecessary "filler" scenes and there were too much too long, and too short ending.  There is only one good scene in the whole movie, but the movie is only disappointing and bad. I was really hoping that the movie was better than it was because the film had some humor that was good and a few "funny" moments that were good. The movie failed in its execution. It's too much of a horror movie to be a horror film, and I am afraid of the next one of the many movies with a sequel to try and fail and just be another horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is pretty much one of the worst films of the century. It's really stupid and pretty slow, and if you liked the old, there are few parts that you enjoy. The story begins with a bunch of guys making a drug called "Bummer Juice" which turns into an extremely stupid drug. You are then introduced to a guy who is very crazy, and he tells the group he's got a drug he's working with called "Smokes". In order to get to the drug, the guys need to make a "smoke gun", but unfortunately they didn't have a gun. I can only guess why they thought to be able to make it. There was some of the best music that I've seen in a long time, but unfortunately not this. There is also absolutely no good comedy for this film. A lot of people are screaming for the first time they see this film because the film is so bad, but I cannot recommend it as an entertaining film. If you're a guy like me, or like watching a movie, don't waste your time trying to see it. This is one of my worst films I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie made me angry. I could never find out what a car is and the movie didn't help me much. But there are few things that make me excited. But the movie is funny in some of its scenes, but the rest was just bad. I didn't get anything else to go with the film. I did not think that it was meant to be funny, but it was certainly un-funny. The only funny scene is the car chase scene. The car chase is the most un-interesting part of the movie. I was really bored. The ending is not funny, at least the ending is interesting. I don't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole film is simply terrible, the acting is weak and the direction is bad. I could have given it a decent rating, but even so it's better than the Dressed Up TV series.  I think it needs to be rated 2, less than 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was shocked that they made an entire movie of a 'B-IHAT' that was so bad that they didn't finish it off. It had a horrible story line that I cannot understand why they did this movie in the first place and why they don't finish this movie. This is the worst film ever I have ever seen in my life. Even after 10 years, I cannot recall even the name of the 'B'IHAST' out of 10,000. The actors are very bad and the story is very bad! A terrible film that will never even make anyone want to watch it. The only time I will ever recommend to anyone is to watch this movie to get the 'C'S.C.' or 'C.B.' on the Blu/B/C.M.O.X. It's simply terrible!!! All three of my friends that work on this film will never look at the film again. I hope they never get this film out of their careers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a film fan who loved the genre film genre (not just the first) this movie wasn't even one of the worst films I've seen, but I did go to see it as a tribute to a very bad movie. But I have seen this in the bookstores at the cinema club in Portland and also at the movie club in San Diego. This movie just doesn't work. It was pretty much an example of the low quality films being directed in this town - the film is so bad it is only funny. They don't even bother to try to make it more entertaining. They just take out the most mundane details, like the film's supposed name. This is obviously an empty, redundant, un-specific horror film, and there aren't any suspense or even suspense. This film doesn't stand for any sense of art or horror, and I believe there are too many of these movies now made. The whole movie should have at least a few minutes of pure suspense - something that would appeal to a genre film like this - that would give something exciting to a horror fan. I'm sure if it was made in Seattle or Los Angeles, this would have been better. If it were made in Portland, or in San Antonio or L.A., there would be a lot of suspense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to find this movie when it first came out because I had always loved the movie that was released in 1982. I was a little bored and decided to see something for my curiosity, so I stopped my watch on the beginning of the movie and decided it would be interesting to see it. I figured out that the movie would have a pretty good ending. I expected it to be much better than it was and I was surprised. I didn't really understand why. The main problem was the dialogue and the lack of direction and the acting. This movie is very un-funnable and there is absolutely no redeeming factor. I'd recommend one of the other Disney classics, which are still pretty good. I really should have seen the original movie instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply about an old man's dream of killing himself (and everyone else), so it doesn't have much to offer when he's at a "climaxed" stage. One scene I found extremely depressing. The man he's chasing gets a car stolen, so he buys a gun to rob the car he stole. The first thing he does is take it to the bank where he's checking his mortgage. As he's in the bank he gets a gun stolen and tries to shoot it at the bank. The bank then has to wait before he can cash it, so the man and the cop he's after get involved. The end is simply not satisfying. He can't get out of the movie before the credits have run, so I won't have any hope to see more of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit, after reading the reviews, and watching the videos, I knew I had seen this movie before. It was just so bad. I wasn't able to watch it in its entirety. I have watched the two remaining copies of the movie, and it's just awful. The music is bad. The acting, the direction, and the story lines are bad, the dialogue is bad, and I want to stop reviewing this movie. I am sick, and tired, and disgusted with this crap movie. The only good review I can give is:  You really should not waste your time watching this garbage of a film. Avoid. It's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply bad, the acting is bad, and the cinematography is bad. I can't recommend this bad movie because I feel it could be some of the worst movies out there! I would recommend a movie with a decent cast and a plot that actually makes sense.   It's a shame how bad it is, what is worse than any other movie? It's the only movie ever with a low rating, and this movie is in fact, very bad! I hope there's some way to get this movie off the air quickly, or if you liked it, you'll probably get a movie where you can watch it, but if you don't like this movie, there's nothing to do in life.  I don't know why i didn't want to like this film, it's like a nightmare! The cinematography isn't bad, but the acting and the writing don't follow along the way it should have been. I'm not saying that this movie should necessarily count as a movie because it's just a movie, but there's more of a film than an entertainment-only film. If you can, I would really recommend watching this movie on DVD: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i am a sucker who usually buys movies and watch them with amusement. this movie is bad for me, so I just gave it to him. he does a good job in watching some of the older films he's seen, he is really terrible at seeing people who do not understand this. the most bad movie ever is "The Naked Gun", this is the worst movie of all time in my life. I really enjoyed "Dinara", but for me to enjoy another movie that doesn't give me anything else in life makes me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is only one scene that I can think at all have been funny to take this one seriously. I was laughing at it, as I watched the film. The first two or three scenes show that the director is not trying to get a laugh out of this film. There is a lot of stupid scenes in the film, which is the point. And I cannot stand up to those who like the movie for the sake of entertainment.  Other than the first scene I found it funny. I did not like this film, but I was happy to see it in another movie. I'm sure it is a comedy, but it was far from funny. It is not a movie that a lot fans would watch, just like "Naughty Santa" or "Sack-A-Dollings".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can tell you that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot is bad, the acting is not good and the sound effects are awful. The funny moments are only so that you can understand it. The only funny scene in the movie is when Jack's mom is dancing with her dad and Jack is dancing away with his mom! It is the only funny moment in the whole movie. I have seen it twice before and it did not help at all. What a waste of money! You might want to see something that is even better, but this movie is so bad that I'd take it back out of my bag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of some of David S. Lewis's works, but this movie is bad. You just want to see some sort of 'proving' of a child (I've seen this in a horror movie: the kid has a big mouth and is a little bit slow. This is not a horror film, but it's pretty easy to watch, it's hard to sit still. The kid is a bit too large and a bit annoying and I don't like it either, but the kid is not very nice to see either. My advice would be to find out some movies with the kid in them, preferably ones that involve a lot of 'welcome' kids (I know there are many horror movies but I still think it's a good idea to start with one that has a kid). The worst I've seen of David Lewis's work is his new 'Venevere' which was the movie that got him his Oscar nomination, I'd really rather see his 'The Wrath of the White Death', or 'Blood on the Senses' for example. It would be interesting to see a David S Lewis horror movie without the'slash' scene, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Inventroriouches his last chance to become a horror movie in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", but has been so bad he's still good. Inventurings like the one in "House of Horrors" just don't work. There's a whole series of scenes with the character of Eddie Dehn. He's always the creepy old guy that never gets out of his sleep or shows his face. But he is always the creep of the creepy guy. A lot of creepy scenes are put into the film like a child's nose or a fish. It isn't like a film about a horror-film - it's a film with a few hundred minutes of horror and little story. If you've been watching "The Sleepy Bell" you will be sick. A shame and a curse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happens when the film begins is that the narrator, "In the beginning I had no job, and no money" is followed by a movie which features a narrator talking about how he got a job in a bad job, no money and no job. The next scene comes to a conflict between two female students of a bad school. The narrator speaks to them that they have to go to a bad prison.  There is no dialogue between them, and there is no idea how these guys are getting to the bad prison, they are talking about a movie. They are on the verge of getting to go there and dying on the job.  That's where the movie starts. The narration continues to portray the narrator as the main character.  The narrator, who is a very bad person, goes into the prison and talks about how the girls in the prison don't want to go in and they are not going to the prison but to see his old friends and the teachers.  After coming to a job he never really had, he ends up becoming a "good job".  When he is on the bad job he is not very good, but by then he is getting a decent job. When he tries to get back to the good job, he is having a problem with his old job that he has not used for 10 years.  When his job is the only thing he gets he tries very hard, but with no money he cannot get a decent, good job. That's what starts the story so bad.  They meet in the middle of the film and the narrator goes into their hotel room to meet some girl that thinks he can save them. Then a man who is trying to steal their wallet comes in to meet them and tries to steal it.  Once the woman is in the hotel room with them, the man and his friends are watching the girls so the narrator gets scared and the girl tries to take them. When the narrator thinks he's not really able to take off for her but he is there and he is a guy.  He leaves the girls and goes to a bank to cash in on it, which he does. He gets a decent-ish job, but when he gets to work he is still there and there are other people in the bank who pay him for it. The scene doesn't have any real plot, but it's not a very good one, too.    When they go in to the room, the women are very uncomfortable
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was an interesting segment about the end of the movie. But it was a real one. The ending of the scene is not so interesting. After the scene, a few of the actors were moved by the camera and the screen. At this point, the movie seemed to go in a direction. The story is pretty simple and predictable. This is not a film at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was very weak and there were moments that were so bad that you just thought the movie was a joke. Some of the lines that were ridiculous didn't matter that they were funny, but it just didn't help.  The cinematography was bad too, and the direction was weak but it wasn't funny and there wasn't even one funny line. There were so many times that the movie could have been better. I'm just not sure there was anything funny. It just wasn't one of the funniest movies I've seen. This movie isn't worth watching but I'm sure it has fans, but I didn't really care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 20 years of the IRI series were very good, and have been for many years. IRI movies often had excellent casting and sound but they were not quite as good as this one. And unfortunately the writer was the worst. One of the worst scenes is in this movie. The first few minutes are absolutely horrendous and the acting is awful, particularly on the female characters. The story is terrible and it starts with an ending that is absolutely terrible. I recommend skipping this movie and watching something more like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film before reading the synopsis on Amazon and it is so bad. I'm not sure how to review it. The title is about a black movie. I think that's what the title is. But that doesn't help. You're not gonna understand anyway. What you can get out of it is if you want to have fun. But don't expect more of it. There's no funny and there's no plot. That's basically all there. If you like to have a good movie and it's funny, I'd recommend you watching a movie called "Hook In the Door". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad. There is no real story at all, so there is no reason to follow along the plot lines and the character designs of the characters are bad. The acting is too wooden and unrealistic, like the acting of the actors. The film could have been better, but not by the writer of the film. You have to have faith in a good writer when you want a movie. This is not good for a movie, it is not fun to watch and it does not make for a series. I will admit that some of the songs in the songbook were OK, but it's too slow and there is nothing interesting to the character of the people. My hopes were high in the beginning of the story, because the acting was good. But after the ending, you don't know if anything can be done with the characters in the film in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical about this movie as I thought that this would be one of the worst horror movies ever made. However, it turns out to be so.  There are so many problems with this film and I couldn't even make the same sense of the acting. I believe it is because of the fact that there is so little good acting in the movie that they didn't care that they are actually making a horror film.  I've seen this before, it is not scary at all. I can feel the actors and the direction of the film are terrible. The writing is bad. I think there is no good way to review this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say this movie was bad as a comedy, not even in the old "Disco" style. The movie is so bad that it's an entertainment in it's worst possible way. I'm sorry to say, I really liked it, but it looks like a film that was just to be for a few minutes to keep one from wanting to laugh. And it was just that, "that's it's just to laugh... this is the worst comedy I have ever seen. I was hoping that I could get my fellow friends out of this movie, but I couldn't stand on the floor, and I couldn\'t stand on it because of my fellow friend's laughs. It sucked that one out of the whole thing so bad I wish I could have stopped this movie. If you want a comedy-horror that looks like it's actually funny, you may find it somewhere, but only if you want something that has nothing to do with it, it will make you laugh.  If you just want a movie that looks better than a "D" movie: see "Dango", and give it your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the video clip of the movie I was watching, I had all the questions. What did these people think? What are they talking? And I am a male? Just watching it I had no idea what the hell they were talking. What was the first step they were to say? And finally I finally realized it was all wrong. They never had to have a female lead in the story? What is wrong with the plot? If a woman is a major part of the film, then she is the main character, therefore all the problems come from her, but she is no longer the primary character. What am I saying? I am sure it is all wrong in the movie, and I will never again see the film. I had to get in the end the movie and call it for another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a bad way to watch. I can't tell why this movie was made. This film could be a comedy but it turns into a slap in the face of the movie world. I hope the producers won't make this film. This is not a comedy movie. The fact that it is a comedy is a huge mistake. It is a gross way to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm disappointed that I only watched this movie and I'm sorry for this movie. There are some good points about it. The acting is pretty good. The scenery is OK, but there is really nothing good in the film. There was no dialogue and the acting is weak. The storyline is pretty weak, but the acting was okay.  I was hoping to have something good in this movie, because there are many good films about the old 'virus' movies. But it wasn't a good movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting something good, but I didn't expect it to be anything good. There are so many stupid things that get through the movie, the characters are so ridiculous that you just wonder how a person could even have the idea of acting. Also the acting seems so wooden, and so boring it's hard to watch. Also I'm not very good with acting. I do think that the director is one of the most incompetent actors I've seen, and if you liked his films he made his films. You could see this movie if he was the director of some movie. However, this is a one-off movie so no worries about getting a decent one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first few minutes of this when I was sitting through. I don't know why. I know I didn't understand the concept. It's so stupid. I just want to say my husband is watching it and his friends are waiting for this.  My husband said that this movie was so bad and had little plot and acting. It looks really bad.  Don't watch this unless your husband is a fan of something else, it might be good. But don't watch it if you think that this is a movie: a stupid comedy about a really bad movie. Don't think about anything in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i really liked this movie - it's just that awful, it wasn't funny, and it wasn\'t funny. The way the characters were made made the movie an awful thing. In the beginning I didn't like this movie because I just liked the movie so much - I liked it to be an "adult movie". In later scenes I found it better because the movie was funny.  I did however see the movie, but I still think this movie is terrible. It is a bad attempt at making funny adult films, because I find the idea of a female comedian, that is not something funny, but this movie could be so funny if it were funny alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie to be the same thing as the previous "The Last Name" movie. It's just about as bad as the "Last Name" version, which I found better than the other one. I know the director and writer want to get some credit for a good movie, but please let me know who they are and why. You're watching this movie as a mistake to break the viewer from the previous one and this one is simply a bad version of the game. The game's presentation is pretty funny, but this movie just fails to convey any kind of plot/message to the viewer. And it's hard to get away from the characters. There is no real story to the game, just an action scene that doesn't reveal anything about the game itself. The movie's main gimmick is that the guy is obsessed with this girl, who apparently has a special gift. There are only 3 or 4 characters who are able to affect the story. The other 3 characters have no connection with the game and are just useless. The story is so weak that it doesn't help you to actually enjoy the game's ending. The dialog is also pretty stupid. The ending is about as predictable as a bottle of wine. This movie isn't good enough for a first-time movie for someone to watch and have a good watch. It needs a really long time to actually finish and you don't have to watch it through to completion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Mockingbirds" is a disappointing effort of a horror film. The gore of the film is laughable, yet the acting was pretty good. I didn't even like the movie, and I was so ashamed of my own acting that I had nightmares about it. The soundtrack was so bad that it made me feel like it could come out from a movie. The plot, even though predictable, could never make any sense. There were no scenes in the film that were interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful, with some of the characters falling to one of the most bizarre aspects of the movie. When they go to a meeting with a guy with a gun, the guys look like they're acting like a bunch of hippy slugs. When the guys start running to some bad scenes, you wonder whether the guy is actually the actor. He's not the best actor I've ever seen, but he's better than the two people who are at the meeting.  The best part of the film is when we have a giant dinosaur that's just a big, fat, ugly, pig, with a huge tail that is pretty much the same size as a dog. How would it be for them to be a giant pig? It has to be for something else? I thought it was for a reason, and there's something else, in this movie. The dinosaur is just a pig, and it has to get the people to kill it for no reason. The animal life of the dinosaur is absolutely terrible. This is not even remotely accurate and accurate. If there is one good part of this movie, it would be like this movie when it first released. I think this movie could probably be a comedy for all it's, but if you watch it in the store, it might be more like a slasher movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this film and, like I heard, one question is what was to become of the plot. The film follows three people that were not very good actors. One was an ex-convictory-type guy with an exclamation that he is not happy with this movie. One actor was a woman who was really bad for the plot, another one was a realist that was bad for acting, and finally, there was a guy that was not interesting. I was surprised to find out the other person was a really good actor, and that's not a coincidence at all. It would have been better if the characters were better than the film made the whole movie, but unfortunately it doesn't appear that way. Also, the ending seems not to have any logical endings. It's not like you'd see something good and decide to go to the next time. There's just a lot of time in the film. There are so many scenes. I'm hoping the story gets a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand why these movies are made, but don't really. These movies are not a real movie, and I don't believe that anyone needs to care about anything in this movie. Some of the characters were good at one point, but they weren't good at all at the end. Some parts were pretty good, but a lot of them were badly acted. The ending could have been better, but I can't tell what was happening at the beginning. Some people have problems with how the acting was handled, but this movie does nothing to prove either of those things. The main problem is the lack of tension between the main characters. The film is supposed to have a happy ending, but it really isn't. I would recommend watching the movie if you had to stay at a restaurant and have a good time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure what is going on with this film, but I am guessing it's a comedy.  If anything, this film was a comedy with a few jokes about the acting.  The dialog isn't funny, the dialog isn\'t funny and it's boring. I don\'t know what the heck this movie was supposed to be. I do know that all these people in the cast knew they were in a movie, but they couldn\'t act like it in a film.  I am having trouble finding the movie! I have searched the book to find out what these people were going to do in the film. There was an interesting point in the first scene when they meet their new friends and they were taking a look at each other.  So what's going on? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My name is from the original game, "The Matrix", and this is one of the weakest in the whole series. The Matrix, however, is a pretty good thing. In the first Matrix, you were, you will probably, and I'm guessing there's probably some plot-line there about how you had to take care of your daughter. In this Matrix, the plot was, you had two girls, one girl was a bad girl and you had the guy in the Matrix. You weren't that good. In fact, you wouldn't be that good!  The plot is weak.  What you do in the first game is pretty good, and the plot is very bad. This Matrix is just a stupid, stupid Matrix simulation of how things are going and how you would have to survive if you do it.  But, as I mentioned, there's even some pretty good things in the game, and those things are, well, just awful. I really, really don't recommend this Matrix game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely garbage! It is also a very bad piece of work by the director. His acting is bad for this film, as I said, his acting is weak and that makes the movie worse in a way. There is an absolutely awful ending, because the ending is so stupid that it never happens.  I had to stick my ear here and there, because I didn't want to kill this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible! This is one of the worst movies ever made. There are two things that this film fails to accomplish, 1. THE BITE of THE FUTCHASES of the people, 2. THE CURS OF THE PEOPLE, 3. THE MURRAY OF THE REVERSAL, 4. AND THE PLOT of HUTES.   The first 15 minutes of the film is completely wasted. And all the music is absolutely horrible. The soundtrack is bad enough! There is no one song that can even be counted for this movie, and it has got into the realm of "being" when the film has been rated out so heavily.  There are a handful of scenes that are good, but the movie doesn't really work. The whole thing is to make the movie seem like something that happens every so often. I'm not going to watch this movie anymore. It's just a horrible, lousy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never really liked these films to see, and what I saw made me hate it. It seems to have some similarity to the earlier versions, but now it seems like a complete waste of time. In no way, the first two versions were better than the later one. This is a pretty terrible excuse for a horror movie. I feel like a zombie. The people who worked in the first one have gone away from the work.  The director is no good actor and it does not take much effort to make it work. That was a big mistake. The first one made me angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a chance to review this movie and found it quite terrible, especially the fact that the original story is about a group of men who are "joint", and is there are two female characters. One of the women is named as a "jealous, drunk, and drug-addicted housewife" and another female character named as "A-to-B", and you could easily assume that she was a drug addict. The other two characters are named as the "best friend" and the other two are named "humble, self-important, and gullible".  I don't recommend this movie to anyone and I donth believe it would be played around anytime (I've seen the movie several times on the internet and it was pretty bad, I guess it would). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm in a small town and this movie is really a bad joke. They're the best people in town, but I cannot stand these guys. I don't see why they would have done this if they were the best actors. In the meantime, I will let you watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is that it's so slow and boring. The film never surprises me. It has some funny moments, but the main point of this movie doesn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even have the faintest idea of how this movie is supposed to work. It seems to be a little bit akin to the old 'Kung the Dog' style of acting. A guy who is, like I said, an idiot who doesn't realize his talent has done him well in life. The people he has in his life do not think him as a genius, as a strong leader, as the right person.  I could really enjoy this film, except for the part that wasn't about a man who died...I know the way this movie tries to depict a life. How else was this supposed to get across the message? It is sad to have a guy who dies and doesn't think he was in his place, and I also understand why he did it. I understand the way it's been put together. It wasn't like it's a straight drama, it wasn't really a family drama, and the director has done a lot of work in the past to make good stories, but this movie isn't like that. It feels like a slap in the face, and if the story itself had more substance, the story would have been much better.  The last part of the movie wasn't too good, and there were some moments that were too long. The characters seemed to always just be in the scenes, but it seemed like they were being carried out for some kind of purpose. At the end, when the characters were in the hospital, it really seemed like it was a matter of time. I can't even see it as a life-saving moment. When the hospital scene was over, the doctor says, "You're going to be sick," and the guy says, it's okay. But, there were too many scenes that got me thinking that the guy didn't care about the guy.   If I was a guy in a situation like that, I would be having a very hard time coming up with any good idea as to how this is supposed, for my own sense of how to handle movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie on TV this afternoon.  I was very disappointed, mainly because I was expecting it to be better than the bad movie it was. The funny part was when they were filming it and when the film started I was wondering how they knew what the movie was going to be. This movie starts off like the movie that had to be in the best possible mood for me to enjoy. I couldn't even watch it while I drove home, because it just had no plot and not a plot. It is so bad it doesn't seem fun at all and I can't even get to the ending.  As a guy who's obsessed with movies, I was a bit surprised that this movie was the best one ever. If you just want to see a stupid-bored film with a goofy premise and have no idea what the story is about, then stay away from this one. There are some good times you could watch it, but this one isn't one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have in-depth review about this movie, but I do have some feelings about it. The film was supposed to be a horror-feature film, and when the actual director, Paul Henne, refused to admit it was a horror, they decided to go with an entirely different tone. This was obviously meant to be just a horror movie.  So instead of a horror film, it becomes a horror story.  But when this was a true horror story, it was ridiculous to see this movie as a horror. It's simply an effort to scare people by their own incompetence. This movie is about a psychopath killer with his eyes and ears being locked on. The only thing that makes it more interesting is his eyes, eyes being visible, making his hands glow in darkness, and his voice changing pitch to a scream.  And as a result, the horror film becomes an un-true horror-comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part I watched was a very weak, but at least I was interested to see what else could be out there. This was one of those movies which I have watched, for the first time, for it was a movie I would enjoy. But then, I became curious about the story and even what the characters had. It is not even that funny but rather just completely annoying to the point that I couldn't even breathe with the people on the other side. I did not mind being put in such a situation and I gave up watching it. I had been thinking that the movie was about a story about the main character, who happens to be a character in the other story, and thus would be very interesting. But unfortunately, that's not the case.  The story is about a guy who dies in a fire. A good story about him, I guess, because he is very young, very stupid and just tries to make it go. So the next story is apparently about the fire guy's father dying. I thought there would be more to the story than just his dad dying, so I chose not to watch it, and didn't see it again. I don't know if that is the movie's problem.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really dislike this piece of junk. I think I'm the worst. But the film is good, the acting is good. The story is not bad, the characters are interesting, but the story is simply awful. I have nothing positive to say about this film, but i don't want to cause anyone to go out and spend money, or lose time. This is what you get when you go over the fence after a bad film: low, dull, slow and depressing. What a wasted of time. If you have a good movie, don't watch this crap! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this when I started reading the book and didn't like it at the start. I gave it an 8.  It wasn't very funny, the direction was so bad.  I'm not sure where the story comes from but I believe it is supposed to be a horror movie. It's just too bad and there is no real purpose in it.  Overall, not a good movie for a horror fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at work when it was released and started watching it. To my surprise, I was surprised that it was so low budget. I really thought that this might be a funny movie. In fact, it wasn't, and it really wasn't. I think it's a complete disaster. I don't know who is responsible for it and I think the actor who wrote this had no idea he could be taken seriously. What is happening with this movie? Just another low-budget horror movie that just doesn't make any sense. I'm not going to watch this because I like horror movies and I like watching them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts around a camp for children. The kids are having a good life but need to be put away so they can earn money.  There is an effort to keep the movie going but the producers don't. The movie doesn't have any real purpose and isn't funny or funny. It has nothing funny to them and I think it must be a comedy of sorts. When the movie starts I find myself getting tired just thinking about this movie.  When they are on the ground, it becomes apparent that there is no story, and everything is done wrong with the scenes. The characters are really cheap acting. I can tell that these guys are not actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had an idea for this movie, and now I finally get to know why it's never been taken out. This is a bad piece of work by some of the writers in the book, but this movie is still entertaining. I think that most people who really get into this movie will probably be extremely unhappy with the story. There are a few really good things in the movie, but most of the things in it are completely nonsensical, and the movie is so bad that I couldn't understand most of it. I was surprised by how bad the script was because I hadn't even thought about it, but after reading it I think it's a little too bad. I guess it's not too late to start reading the book before this movie starts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My, god, I, hate this movie... it's so lame it could never have worked. I mean, I understand it's supposed to have some interesting plots, but that's just for show. And it's just so bad, it's hard to listen to, and it's not even convincing. I was so annoyed with the entire story line because I found myself not liking it, I think this movie needs to go back to its roots. I think it's really bad at all. The acting is bad, the acting is poor, and the humor doesn't come in even once. So, that's my final word about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film over twice. It is very unpleasant and very bad. I'm very surprised that such a film has not been filmed, but I do believe it must have been filmed. I've given it to every other person who has ever seen this. If you have seen this movie, I'd advise you to drop off your nose and take away from the movie. You don't understand my point of view and don't want to understand what this movie has to be. Don't read any comments about this movie if you have not seen it, but beware! This is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although, this is the best that I've seen in a long time. I found the movie so amusing. I was upset that it got stuck around an hour after its premiere. That's only a few seconds of a movie, and a few minutes longer than the final sequence. But even then, there were few moments of genuine interest in the rest of the plot. The characters were weak, especially one, who would have been quite good if the movie hadn't been so horrible.  Overall, I would avoid any serious consideration of the movie. However, it is interesting to note that this is one of the only things I have to point out as a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film for the last 10 years. It's absolutely boring. And it's absolutely stupid! There are some lines that are quite well thought out, but nothing like the real-life movies they made when they were making this film. If they want to make a movie for kids, they should just be going for children. This is a dumb excuse to take a chance on a decent film; its not even remotely funny to have one of their best actors (Dramon) in this crap. In my opinion, it should be a real film. The direction is terrible, the acting is bad, and the plot is terrible. If you want something serious, don't make this film; you'll miss something good. If I were a kid, I would recommend it if you wanted to see a very bad movie. I've seen it more times in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this movie as soon as I got to see it, I couldn't believe the director or the casting director were serious enough to get this project ready, much less as a movie. The story is bad, so bad that it doesn't work out at all, but I can't blame the writer for not being able to do a convincing job. The acting is bad by itself, but the story is just plain poor. The direction is not good and the dialog is not competent, either. But the best part of the movie is the special effects, the acting was good but the special effect was far from convincing. The special effects don't do anything in the slightest like a movie, and are not shown in a convincing manner. The director should look more careful before making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even know if this is supposed to be a documentary but it sure is. It just seems to be pointless. The main problem I have is with the idea of portraying the people who really made the world come out of their own. This is like a really old fashioned, manipulative film, it doesn't have anything to show them in a documentary manner, but it has nothing to show what it shows them. The best point in the movie is that it does show us people who were good in the real world, but this is just an attempt to get me to buy into the idea that they were good people. It is like watching a movie about a movie. I've seen that one so much, and I'm sickened out by it. Don't waste your time. Don \'t waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of "reactionary" films that have turned into "sadistic realism" films. I have seen the most reprehensible films as a horror film writer (I'm not a horror writer by my own criteria) and even more than that, "The One Tree" is a very bad film. Even worse than that is the film of "The Night Watch". I didn't even like it.  I've seen this film once, with my own eyes, but I was in a room full of people. I wasn't able to enjoy it, it just didn't make me interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had so much fun with this movie. It was simply an absolute joke and so bad at all I felt the need to rip it off. I was so frustrated when it was over. I didn't even know what happened in the final sequence and it was so bad it could never be explained. It is so hard to follow. My favorite movie was "The Secret Life of Richard Gove, Jr." which was so wonderful. But this movie isn't one of those. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was annoyed by the fact that the movie was not even filmed. I found out that the whole cast were totally forgettable. Not one good character was found in the whole thing. Even the ending is a fairly predictable and boring event, with a horrible twist ending.  I've never watched a movie this bad, so if you have some suggestions, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was obviously awful - the characters are so stupid it makes no sense. I couldn't believe that the plot was that interesting or that I actually cared about the characters. The cinematography is the worst thing that I've seen for this movie. It's OK to have some jokes and be ridiculous but it's not like the old one (or like "Crisis"). The film was way too hard to understand. The soundtrack was pretty OK but I thought that it sounded like some songs that had been from the late 70's. I didn't really care - I got bored and didn't mind doing something like that. I've come to peace now - I thought it was an interesting movie and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an obvious reference to a really terrible sequel from the first one. A very stupid idea. The music was also awful. The special effects were the least realistic. Even the special effects from the other worlds were very odd.  My biggest problem is that the director apparently forgot about the idea that this movie would ever be a good movie, as he attempted to make the film a series of self-destructive antics. This movie is so stupid that it doesn't work at all. The writing and story are poor. The acting is bad, and the acting is not good. And the special FX is absolutely awful, as I said. The story is so badly contrived that it is difficult to follow and makes the movie a complete bore to watch. I have only one small consolation: the special effect will look absolutely stunning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know who else has seen this film before. But I did. And the very worst of it is that the lead actor was so bad as I gave it a low rating as I thought I was in fact an idiot for judging the story. The plot is so thin that the story is actually only a little bit convoluted. I cannot recommend this bad film very highly if you're a good viewer and don't think of getting it off on DVD. There is only one good scene in this film and that is when the film's producer is in the room and the director has a couple of questions for the director. They were never asked. But if they were asked, what would they say? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a couple of weeks ago to go to the big film festival at Toronto. I decided on one of those nights to see this film as part of my trip back to Toronto.  I gave it to a friend who told me that he didn't like it and he told me to give it to him. He did see it and didn't care. I didn't want to watch this film. He thought it was a horrible film that would hurt anyone's eyes.  But I saw it and was upset. I was hoping to give this film a chance to break out and at least get something worthwhile done. I did think that some good stories are done in Toronto but these types of stories simply won't happen in Toronto. It made me sad and depressing.  There were no actors at all. There was no good story. There were a handful of good actors but I had an idea that it would have been a pretty good movie. And the cast sounded uninterested, so terrible and uninteresting. There is no dialogue and the characters were simply nothing to watch. It is a bad film in my opinion and I am very unhappy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Demented" is very bad and the music sucks.  There are many problems here, but I am going to try to avoid making any comment about these problems, as I think this is the only movie I can write off.  I guess the reason this is an example of this type of "art" is because the movie is so dull and hard to watch and listen to. But if there's any good art to make this movie, it would be the movie "The Matrix" or the "Starcraft".   And the most frustrating thing about this movie is that it starts off with an insane premise. It's a horror film. What is it with? A horror movie is supposed to be a horror movie, sure, but in this one it seems to be more like a horror-movie-film-with-comparisons.  In the beginning, there is an alien who is having a mental breakdown and tries to kill everyone. He kills the entire town. He murders some others. Then, at a movie festival, he kills everyone. So he goes to sleep, and in a dream-vision he meets a man named Mr. Smith. He uses a magic potion to keep the aliens from getting him and he does not kill the people who are sleeping around. The movie begins with this guy taking a gun and aiming it at people. A massive fire tornado that kills everyone and the man in the mirror is in the middle of killing the demon who has his hands trapped around his head. So the demon's hands are not touching Smith's head, but because of a huge fire tornado, the demon doesn't go to sleep and instead of killing Smith, Smith kills the demon. Then he kills the man and some people on the other side of the mirror and runs across the city with them as a group of murderous people trying to capture them. I guess that is how the whole movie was supposed to work. But there were a few problems.  1. The alien who would have been killed by anyone at this movie was the protagonist of the movie. We can easily rule out a story where one of the characters is killed and the demon has killed another. There is no explanation. The only clue we get about that one is that the demon had something to do with the entire "village" of the film.  2. The demon in the next part of the nightmare is more like it was made up of something they made up. The demons are making
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I see this film in the theater it comes off to me as something that has never made me excited to see this show. That's not a surprise. I had to listen to the show on a tape and that was only because I was so distracted. It is so bad that it's not funny, it is not funny at all.  What could I possibly say about the film? I'm a very serious film buff. I understand that some people can watch it and get a laugh, even though it is a major disappointment. I have a serious interest in movies. The most important thing about me is my love of comedies and I love the sense of being entertained. The problem is I find the film to be a bad version of those. Even after seeing the show, I found the humor in it, I had a sense of amusement and enjoyment that was somehow lacking.  The other problem is that this film feels as if it was a major Hollywood film. I never did this show so much as a single movie, but I knew it would be a major film for all the major film studios. It was so bad it could only be played at a local bar or somewhere else with a large audience. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone who is trying to be entertained but just to be laughed. I was in disbelief, but it would never have a positive review about the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea how this movie has gotten such a low rating, considering this is the first movie I remember watching without ever having an idea how I would go with it. Basically, this movie was about a bunch of little characters who live in a city in the future, and they meet each other, the girl who is a teenager, and the girl at a boarding house in the city. But none of the characters are good, and one gets killed, and two more characters who are in their teens get killed in a car crash by an accident. Also, there are no actual female characters, no male characters, and no sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an effort to make a "fun" film about a couple of random people who decide to travel to another town to get a look at some ruins. It's absolutely ridiculous and there are some jokes that are absolutely horrible, but most of them just seem like they were just some kind of a silly joke that is taken by the writer. And the ending of the film is even worse. A lot of things just don't add up to the film at all, and it's really unfair. I'm sorry, but the worst part about this movie is the fact that the "funny" nature of the story really has no real relevance. This movie is nothing like "The Secret Life of Alex" and it is just a completely unnecessary film with little plot. The people that travel with the group are pretty silly, but I give "The Return Of Mr. Deakin" credit for having an original story. It didn't help that this movie had two pretty good actors in the cast, and just got rid of them in the editing. Also, a character named "Mrs. Deaks" gets her name from a song from the video game "Shout" in which she is in an argument with one of the other characters. This was one of many instances where the film failed to give any real feeling. The acting is bad at best and the film itself was the least of the bunch that I've seen since the 1970's.  Overall, the only good thing about this bad movie was its ability to be amusing. The problem is that it doesn't have any real plot and the characters were just repeating random situations throughout the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can't see this movie, I would be very suspicious. It has this sort of a plot line that is so unbelievable it would be too difficult to take it seriously. It is so far out of line that the movie would be laughable if you actually looked at it and thought it was a parody of "Beverly Bee". The story is so terrible it really should be taken seriously, but most people who see it do not see the movie and are therefore, like me, skeptical. I was surprised at how horrible the story is, and not by the jokes. I guess this movie was the worst movie I've seen since I've worked in this field. If you want to see some great comedies, check out "The Great Cabin" or "Gentlemen's Pants". You'll find plenty of laughs but no actual joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. I think that the writers of this movie were simply playing out the lines that they said they were going to make. They were never that realistic. It seems like some of the lines in this movie could have been taken from the script. However, the movie still leaves you feeling empty when you are watching it and that is because the characters aren't actors, they are just acting through the script, acting, or whatever.  The movie is boring, slow, and very unbalanced and doesn't help with the suspense. This movie doesn't even work for a family that doesn't have a family to watch it. If you have a partner and don't have any kids, this movie is a poor choice. The characters are extremely un-real, and there are no jokes or humor whatsoever. This is one of the worst films I have seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Liposozes & A.K. (Z)" is an average, uninspired film.  One of those cheap movies that are meant to be filmed but is actually stupid, stupid and disappointing. It really sucks, but I can't say exactly how terrible it is. And the special effect at the end is stupid - when someone loses a bunch of money on a vending cart. It should have been better. The ending should have ended up with some kind of 'fearless hero' who is really the hero. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is horrible and the special effects are really silly and really bad. But what do I mean?  "My Lipsos & A K. (Gill)" is actually a decent film - and in a different kind of way - but it's pretty stupid, too. You can't get more than one second of this. I wish I could have gotten out my $2 to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You want to know something about this one, you want to see where the line comes from, and you want a big story, but not a story. This is not a good movie.  It has nothing to do with what the movie is supposed to be about, and a lot is about pointless things, but people get confused about these things because they're about a movie. This movie is about a bunch of stupid people who make a bad sequel to a terrible movie: they do horrible things with each other person, and there is no way to figure out what they are about. There's not much in this movie to do, but it's not about people who do the stupid things in a movie, people who really want to make a sequel to an movie, and people who want to just take this movie seriously.  I think the guy at the studio who directed the movie should just get the hell off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie when it was released, and I was really unhappy with the movie. It was the same movie as all the previous ones, but it didn't have the cool atmosphere and story that made the previous two so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really a very sad waste of money. I really think this film is about a 20 year old film from the '90's. There was a sequel where one of the main characters was in love with a girl named Tiffany, who was so stupid that she would cry over a movie. She was in the first place pretty decent in the sequel, which she obviously didn't know. She is really an emotional mess that she needs to be rescued from. Her love for Tiffany was in fact so far in excess.  This film is so bad that the movie itself is really terrible, I don't even think she could be taken out of the '10's list of top 10 movies. I think she's just a person. The film really needs a rewrite, and that would mean more money to go back to the original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is very poorly directed, terribly acted, and completely predictable. I don't think it's supposed to be anything interesting, but that's not an exaggeration. Some of the actors are better than others, but all of the acting is weak, and the direction is totally awful.   You have to really take the movie seriously for the time. Not a fun film, and definitely not a good movie for anyone to watch. The only thing it gets up with is the end scene, and that's where the film begins and ends. If you think you're a fan of the original (by Peter Firth and Gary Verson), then you can enjoy the original ending (as a matter of fact, the acting was excellent) but you will never enjoy the end of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to have had to read the movie. The acting is just plain terrible and the direction is stupidly bad. I can't even recommend the movie because I have a good memory of some of it and the actors (like Billie Batrus) are actually good. But if you can stand it all of its story is awful. This movie fails in that area. If you can enjoy it, enjoy the original, and even the book version, which was actually a very entertaining and well written film. But just don't do this movie, if you like movies of bad actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't bad, but it isn't good. The plot is completely implausible and stupid and it fails to be credible at any point. The actor that played the film was terrible at most.  I didn't expect much from the acting of this movie, but the acting is bad. I think the writer/director of the film is a loser, or is really a weak guy. I don't know whether he's a good writer or if he was trying to appeal to other people. I like him, and I think it was funny and funny, but at the same time, not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been a fan of these films for years and have loved those that have been so good in films. Unfortunately the original is one of those films that do not exist anymore. The movie is really stupid and predictable, it starts off good, but then it begins to just drag out and make all of your brain go blank. And that is what happens when you have a bad film with some nice ending. You have to look at the first 20 minutes to see if any of those scenes are funny and if there are any scenes that are silly. What really happens in this film is the ending. There is no scene to go after it. It just goes straight to the start of the film and it just keeps repeating the same scenes for 8 minutes more. The characters are annoying and the dialogue is so badly written it makes you want to punch your knee, you know it's over to the point where it becomes a total failure. It takes several months of watching to get through it. I think the director was tired because he had to make it.  I'm not going to go on and write about all of the flaws in this movie. I will just say that the best way to enjoy this film would be watching it from the beginning and going straight into it to find something better. That would be my one mistake. I know all of you are not fans of this film and would never even want to see it, but at least I tried. I have even managed to do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made before the film's release. It doesn't really seem like a real horror film at all. It's a mixture of both horror and horror, so it's hard to tell which direction it's going in. There are some pretty bad scenes, and some pretty good ones, but it has some creepy elements. But it was too bad. I had to get all the clips I wanted in and get the last 8 minutes of the movie out of me, so I had a lot of work to do. This movie should be called the "The Creepy Baby!" Or the "Dawgs in Vroom and the Devil in Vibro." Or "Dirty Dog." Maybe. At least, it has a little bit of style to it and looks like it could have been a movie, but its really bad. It could have gotten better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bodies Of Death" is a movie that's about the worst horror ever seen, and no film-making has ever made this sort of movie so bad! It's like "Shuffle" with no plot or plot. It's one hell of a film. It is so boring that it has some of the greatest acting of all time, and a movie-making crew that's basically just putted out the most mediocre horror movies of all times. The gore and the sex scenes were OK, but they were only that when the movie director was in front of the camera; it wasn't scary enough to make the audience think they were going to die. They just looked bored and unsatisfied. There's only one really good story in the whole movie, and the others don't even come close to the quality of the film, but the rest of them all suck. The cast were bad, and I think that was the biggest problem. The lead actors were OK in most cases, but I don't think that the directors were too serious or too serious. The main characters were pretty good. You'd like to see some decent things in a movie like this, but don't expect too much of a movie of that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just spent over an hour, watching this movie, thinking this movie would be a dorky comedy, but it wasn't.  It's really stupid, and if I was reading this review, I'd probably just drop it off and tell the whole world. The ending is extremely bad. It's stupid that the ending happened to be so lame, which I think it should be. I think the actors and producers obviously forgot what they were saying in the beginning. It feels like a bad version of the movie from the old times.    This movie is so bad it makes me think about the end in a real bad movie. If you read this review and don't watch it, don't go to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A short introduction to the film and I thought it could be good. But that was only after about 90 minutes. It wasn't good to begin with, since it never got to be funny or funny.  However, it was surprisingly good in its first 5 minutes. But after that, it got worse. The film became fairly predictable. But it wasn't even funny, and I can't even say it was good at any point.  The main problem is that the movie relies on very simplistic dialog. This is not a film to watch, but a movie to be entertained. Also, it wasn\'t clear whether the film was a true story, or just another way to "tell" a story. And despite the fact that it is one man's first outing, I had difficulty finding any clues.  This movie is a mix of horror and soap. The story is very vague and is very inconsistent. Even though the movie had some decent moments, it is the movie that I least expected to see. It has not been released in Europe, but it would have been nice if one was. The first episode is pretty good, but not at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a kid, this movie was not good. The way of acting it was the worst I've ever seen. The movie had a weird feeling of being out of touch with the times. The storyline was boring, the acting was not funny enough. The special effects were bad. The direction was poor. The cast were weak. I've seen this movie more than a few times, but I can't recommend it to anyone. The music was awful. The soundtrack was OK. But there were three bonus scenes of a good movie: 1. What's a car chase in the movie? 2. The first fight with a monster 3. What were we talking? 4. Who is this girl?  If you've seen a bad horror movie, don't waste your time. If you have seen a good one, don your time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Coboro" is a poorly crafted film featuring a bad script and worst acting. That's not to say it's funny, though the acting is the worst on the list. I really liked the special effects when they were in motion, and that's what i thought of this movie. Not even the special FX. It really sucks. The story is pretty boring and unbelievable when it's all over. When i say it is a story, it's because it's about a movie. The jokes were poor, and they were never funny. The special effects were pretty cool, and not good. The plot was boring, not funny. This is not a good movie. Its not funny to watch, and no one should watch this movie either. If you liked this film, then you might enjoy the movie "Stachen" from the same studio, which was another good movie, and if you hate this movie, then it is not worth a DVD purchase. Avoid this movie if you have some time to spare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the same kind of movie I watched when I was younger, the acting was terrible, there were no real people on it, and the special effects were weak.  The action was weak but decent and I didn't care for a special effects. It was a bad mix up movie and no real suspense, I usually liked a film that has some suspense. I have read some comments from other reviewers that the ending didn't do justice to the plot and it was pointless. I thought it would have been a great film. I was upset by the ending.  I can see the same movie that's available on DVD, but that's not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really familiar with this movie because i've never seen it. I found this movie pretty interesting, because it's about sex and drugs, and the only thing I can recall is that the movie's about how the boy goes straight to another girl. That's all there. I can't stand for the characters who do nothing but run through town to get to their own house to try to stay sane, or even to work at a real hotel. The acting is pretty bad, and they're supposed to be the acting talents of the country, but it's not a talent. I guess because this movie contains so many different people, it could have a few "goodies" who were willing to be in the film, but the ones who are in the movie are just bad. I thought the film could be about a good movie where the protagonist was actually talented, and that he and the other actors did well. However, it's just an awful piece of work that could not have been much better. The movie is absolutely awful. I'm sure I'd never actually seen this movie, and it probably has been reworked to add some interesting content, like some more realistic action sequences and some pretty good scenes of the cast of a bad German movie. Unfortunately, it just isn't worth the time to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After reading the comments of others on my blog about this movie I think that this is a bad piece of film to be released. It's not funny to think that the first line of this movie is about a love-a-loves-girl named Mary Sue. It just says that the movie is just a horrible joke about a "love-a-" loves-a"-family-with no relevance. A better version would have to follow the same line and give it some life.  It says so much about a lack of substance, in fact, that it's even hard to believe that this movie could have been written by someone capable of writing a positive review about such a bad film. The only thing that makes it more believable is the character of the protagonist, a former school teacher who loves the girl, but she cannot be satisfied to be in a relationship with the other character, the "father." They are both terrible lovers, who are both in love, and are obsessed about her.  The movie also lacks believable humor, and the "plot" is simply a bunch of silly jokes that has little to do with the plot. The whole thing should have ended in the first movie of the movie. It should have been done so before. The idea that the "parents" of the girl's friends are "crazy" is laughable. You never realize what the parents actually are doing when the "mother" is around. The scene with a lot of the film's plot should have never been there, because it is so contrived. The movie doesn't have any genuine tension. It really sucks trying to make the movie more funny. The character of both parents is obsessed with one another, because of a desire to keep this girl involved in a dangerous situation with them. The husband is obsessed by the girl for money, and wants to keep everything "pure" and out of pure love, but it turns into an excuse for her friends to keep him busy doing his jobs. This is where the movie really starts to lose its appeal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is full of an illogical commentary on the current events and politics in Syria. I think it should be taken straight from the video editing of the movie. But I still can't find any better way to describe the film. Maybe that is because a person in Syria is trying to take out the film's director and others.  The film is pretty bad, but the reason why it has not been taken away as this awful excuse for a movie must have something to do with the current situation in Syria or with the Syrian people. The people in Syria do not want to die and this movie just further reinforces the message in Syria that we are dealing with foreigners in their country. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i am so upset and angry that this movie is so bad. And not all of my opinions. In fact, I am so angry that I am afraid to watch it. This is the only way to watch this movie. I would not watch it to save myself, or anyone else. I mean, I don't have an apartment. I am also a former firefighter and a former police officer. I've never laughed at a bad thing. I know my job. I'm not ashamed, and I'm certainly not sad, but I don' t care. What a waste of money. I might even go crazy for the time. I can only guess the movie will win out. It's just so sad, and awful, and horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is quite unlike to anything I've seen in the first 20 years of my movie viewing. The best way I've heard of this is a "Naked" version in the British movie of 'The Naked Man'. It was very dull and didn't inspire me to like it. It was one of the worst films I've watched in recent years. The other one was 'The Little Piggy', which I thought was pretty cool. However, 'Puck' is pretty good, but 'Piggy' is just a poor, nasty sequel. 'The Untamed Thing' was much better, but I was sick and disappointed when I finally finished it.  I'd give this a 4 out of 10 if it had a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have nothing to say about the movie except this:  the story is OK in a movie, but it could have been much better if this story was much simpler and cut-up, like it could be. In my opinion this movie is a really bad movie and the only reason I watched it is because I think it is the best kind of horror movie out there. I don't expect to watch it again, just like a bad comedy movie. But even after my bad review it was very interesting to see that there is even one decent ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching it I was disgusted by the film, I couldn't believe it had a chance to become something worthwhile. I was so disappointed that I just couldn't stand how the film was going, and that's because I felt that there was a clear pattern to it. The characters all had unrealistic faces and unrealistic conversations and I didn't think that the actors seemed to understand the film properly and that made me think they were incapable of expressing a true emotion. What happened with this film was a complete failure of the director's abilities, but I don't believe in the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing thing I've ever seen is this movie. This movie is a really bad movie.  The movie is boring, very fake, and very unnatural. It is so poor as to be easily missed from the beginning to the end. I never got to see the beginning and the end, and it ended just as bad as the beginning. There wasn't any good movie for the whole movie. There was just the two-fold plot. There were no good songs, and there was no good dialogue. Everything was bad, and no good film for the film.  It's disappointing that there's an absolutely terrible review about this movie, I can't really find any good review on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie not very funny and not even funny in a funny way. It was way too long and the characters were poorly acted. I found the director (Trey Gordon) funny and I thought he would be good for a comedy. But unfortunately, I think he was much too boring and not funny. I don't see how he could have made this movie. His casting was bad, but the other people involved in this movie were good. I do not know if he is a funny comedian. I did not like his choice for the lead, which I think was a good choice. Also, he should use his time for other movies.  I could not tell whether he is funny. He was too bad for a comedian to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I am a movie fanatic, I am very skeptical. I don't have faith in it, I do not believe it's a movie. The plot is weak, the dialog is poor and the acting is weak. The ending is a huge plot twist that should have ended much earlier. The soundtrack is weak too and I cannot find the music in the movie. But there is plenty of good moments in it. The actors are terrible, the characters are so bad that if you give any of them a good movie then you would find them a bad film.  And so there is nothing to be happy about it. There are people who are pleased with the movie, but I think there are people that will lose interest with the film. And the ending is also a huge disappointment, especially the ending. The characters are absolutely horrible, the story is not even interesting. There is nothing for the viewer to feel at home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing you can do is to get rid of the annoying and unfunny lines, but I found it so hard to find that.  The acting is about as bad as this film gets. I'm sure the film director has the same problem he had with The Last Picture, but he is no longer able to make films. He should try to write better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on the very negative review of the movie. It was bad, slow and un-polished, but it seemed like an entertaining little comedy, if that's what you want. You would think that this is a movie about the American culture, or at least that it would be about some sort of interesting, even humorous, characters. But it isn't. It's just an obnoxious comedy with stupid characters. It has nothing going for it. I was the first to laugh at the very bad script. And I really have to say, the acting in this film is pretty bad. The best actors in this movie don't even look good, but there were pretty good in it, including the lead actors. If you don't like a lot of things in this kind of movie, you might think it a good little drama, but if you really like it then this movie isn't worth a second watch. Avoid this movie if you can't stand the awful acting, and even if you do, don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, that I rated this movie so highly. I rated the movie a 2 and was disappointed. I expected more from this movie. I had hoped to enjoy the movie, but the ending didn't make me like it. I don't understand why the film exists. It is disappointing to me that the director was allowed to finish this movie without leaving a positive review about it. If you plan to watch this movie, please don't! I won't waste my time. It didn't even make sense. The movie is bad, and the ending is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems like it is getting old. It just has one story to tell, a bunch of other people and none of them really like any of the people in the film, and it has the usual lazy feel to it. I mean I'd like to see someone try to take this film to its fullest potential, though that's not what I've seen so far. I've read that it was really good to see the two couples of whom the two male lead characters (his and her) not actually love each other, but instead each of them is in a relationship. Unfortunately, the other male lead had been a very stereotypical person, and I'd actually like to read a book about him so that it's not only stereotypes, but really a human being, and the movie never allows you to get that insight. A bad film that doesn't really care whether you like it or hate it. It's just a bunch about the movie, not a film, film with a great concept, and really a movie that isn't good, even to anybody who reads book, and at least, I can't recommend it to anyone who reads it. The ending could be a good story if the characters actually had chemistry, but I'm not seeing the story anymore and I hope it doesn't get convoluted by a too much fanatical story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bunch of people on video have to do with the little few minutes they have to work with, it's like a plot. This is not a great film, and no one is even a hero. This could be easily made for the kids. This movie is really just a bunch a waste of time. Some people are too silly, and it's probably too expensive. This film should not even have been filmed, and the DVD/CD versions is not the good movie. This should be an effort to get kids into acting. It's not like a movie. It should just be a "fun" film about an animal. They just couldn't come up with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is quite bad. The story is good though. The actors did well, the visuals weren't. The sound was okay but not good. The voice is awful, the characters were unbelievable, the dialogue was not good, the camera was bad, the acting was awful, and the story was not to have any relevance or credibility at all. It was very bad, I would recommend this movie to a person who is very bored with American TV and wants to learn a new language in a new country. Unfortunately I learned quite a lot from the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this film an 8/10 but with bad writing and bad acting and bad cinematography, it's just another waste of money! It's pretty sad considering the fact that there's a great set of characters and they're all in their respective positions, it just doesn't make up for the rest of the movie.  I'd like to see some better quality films. And if I could find some better film: I would probably watch this film for the time that I was in the middle of a new movie and didn't have any time to spare. I don't know if this film was created for entertainment or if it was simply created to be a waste of time. The story and acting really don't work together. I would recommend that no one who wants to see this film do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has all the hallmarks of a worst movie ever made. What an even worse case is this remake of the original. The first two movies are decent enough, and the third movie is terrible. The plot is very bad, the acting is poor, the camera looks poor, and even the cinematography looks bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were two better movies I could have watched, and I had to look for two before making a list. There's something to be said about "The Last Days of the Last Days," in the sense that it should be in the middle of a film: it's a depressing piece of trashy fare.  What is it about? I don't know. I have watched several of these films, some good, and some bad. If I were in the exact position to make a "last-days" movie, I would make the same sort of movie I've done, but it just can't be done. I don`t think it is funny. It's sad. It`s sad. I can`t find any good reason to watch it, and it really is a bad film. I think it would be a sad movie if i had the power to make it, but I don´t see how it could have made much better films than the other, so I had some trouble finding out why I did. This is the worst movie I ever rented. I didn't know what it was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So if you get the chance to watch this movie don't do it. It's absolutely terrible and this movie is extremely shallow. It fails to deliver something substantial from a great film: I had so much fun with it as a kid who was going to the library with the movie, but the movie is flatly fails to get a lasting interest in the main characters. This movie is so bad that if you watch it, you'll be bored by the ending and just give up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd think if people like this film, they are all really stupid and they need to be taken in. As far as I'm concerned, they need the movie to be stopped ASAP. I can't help thinking there must be a clear line. No reason why any of these people do this!  It should be stopped immediately. I'm afraid of seeing this film again, please. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is simply a collection of a bunch of people who were stupid enough to think that the characters could actually exist, and then it becomes a horror story. And it fails in both execution and execution.  The first problem I noted is the very basic premise of "The Necessary", which is basically about a group of three people trying to get some of the other three back. Since the first film was so poorly executed, I was expecting there to be a scene where the trio would get in each other's' way and then we'd watch one of them die. But there wasn't really that scene. The main character, a guy with a bunch. (This is not a spoiler, because there's a scene in the movie where the guy dies!) has to get a job in a bank, and that job is to run a computer, and it has to be run by some guy called "The Professor".  There's also no way to understand what's in the computer's mind or how it behaves, and the only character from the movie is called "Cog" (his name is spelled out in a name that's also spelled out as "COG", but that's OK, as an homage to the "Caged". That's alright, because that's not the real name). There's no way for "Cogs" to behave like the professor. They don't really care about the life of the characters, they just want to kill the others. And there's no clue about how to behave when we're just sitting around talking about a computer program. I really think the movie's director doesn't care much for this idea of using computer based horror, even if he has an obvious interest in making a horror movie. It's just another way for him to hide his interest in the fact that he has a really deep hatred for computers as well as making a movie that fails to take his material seriously.  Of course, the idea that it's "Cancers" has just been designed to be bad, and not really all that good a film. It was also too bad for a movie of a woman called "Marine", who is actually the main character. She has blonde hair and long-time boyfriends, and is actually kind of a good girl. But even that turns out to be rather boring, and a lot of the scenes with her make me question how her eyes could have looked at him at all.  Overall, a really boring
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is the worst version of the "Paraat" trilogy. The director never really stuck to a groove, which would have been done with a more modern "Sawyer" and "Bakshakabh". (The point I have is that he doesn't want to "paraatize the idea of the idea" (i.e. Paraat's ability to be an evil person, and his ability to kill or even to hurt people). The story is simply incoherent.   The story opens up a few minutes later. Two guys meet, and immediately become two guys (i) and (h) two guys.  There is no dialogue, no character development, no real sense of the characters, no time to develop, no action scenes, no romance, no tension, no suspense, no reason to get involved, etc. The direction seems like it was made to be used as a straight, run-in, horror film. The action scenes are so predictable and stupid that one of them is in a video store. It never takes a real effort to watch the video, and I didn't even have to keep counting the number of shots.  The characters are so bad that you never want to watch them again. I think it's so bad for the kids who weren't too old to begin with this movie. And although I know it had some good parts, I think the actor's talent is wasted.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some good comments about the first 15 minutes of this movie. I was impressed with how the plot was structured and it was well presented. But the other 60 minutes were very disappointing. I have seen a few dozen of the other films in which the story line is completely wasted. It's just not good enough to be considered a decent comedy or thriller, but it's not funny.  I've even rated it a 2. It looks like a cross between two good films - the movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought there might have been some good things in this movie - some good dialog, and some cute little creatures - but they were so awful, so bad, that we don't even notice any of the actors. I wasn't even impressed by some of the movie, so I give it two stars for it's sad, pathetic, and embarrassing performance. I won't even watch this movie anymore if I can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell you how bad this movie is, nor the good points of the story.  If you want to make money, go to the other guy in the book, "The Devil's Blood" and you will get a lot of money. But this movie would be a complete failure for a $500 dollar movie. I'm sorry, I'm not talking about money to go watch it, but it is pretty disturbing. I would recommend watching "Hell's Blood", because I'd rather that this movie was better than other films.  The story is okay, but the characters and acting are just bad. I don't mind if you watch this movie, because you might even like it. I just wish my husband would have taken some of his money to buy some better movie: It would be nice to see some better horror movies from the other genres, like "Blood. Or even a film from "Wipe Blood" or the "Grimble". If you don't see the movie, you might think of it as a cute, scary horror movie, and maybe you might be entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked some of the work from this guy, but he's not for me. This movie didn't do anything with a character that could stand alone. The acting is pretty terrible. I could only recommend this movie if it were a little lighter, and there are only three stars. I guess it's probably a good movie for those who like their acting, but for the rest of us, it just sucks. If you like the idea of playing a role with a guy who has an issue with his roommate, you'll find yourself in a total psychological mess. This is a bad sequel to a good film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never really understood what this movie was about. I felt as though it wasn't funny enough. This movie is so bad. The acting and dialog were not funny enough to warrant a rating. I think the director was trying to create a funny movie about a crazy person, but not so funny that it doesn't suck. The movie is boring and uninteresting, and the jokes are so bad that you find yourself laughing at the jokes. What the hell was that? I hope it's not a joke. This is truly one of the worst comedies ever made. There are no good laughs here. This was like a parody of "Madder" or "Dazzle", or the other stupid comedies, or an uninspired sequel. This film is only mildly entertaining and I could see an "Uncle Dazzle" parody. The director should be held responsible for making a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I'm sure it was a mistake, but it wasn't bad at all. I have to say I just can't find it. I can find a movie that has anything at all (a movie with good music and decent acting), but it won't make money. This one won't even make money because it's so bad. The soundtrack is the worst song I've heard in my life. They should have spent half of it in a metal band. The video quality is not bad though it does look amateurish. I mean, it has no real story to tell, not even a story with a story. It's just like a bunch of empty shots with no real action. Some of the characters are not that funny, the girls are not funny at all either. The actors don't have any charisma, and the voice actors aren't that good either, or could they just have been a voice in a movie? Just ask yourself how much they could have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no real details. People will say that I didn't miss my train and that my parents worked in the theatre during my childhood years. This is simply a self-assessed person. I'm still hoping that you can see some of the special effects on the stage, but at the end I'm left to guess what it would be like.  This film is like an entire stage, without any sound effects, music or even a single voice, except for a few people who sit on the edge of the stage to watch and tell us how it goes.  And although it was interesting at times, it was disappointing at the last minute and the ending was simply a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen several of the "HOL" films and was dismayed at how bad they were. This one was a mess. I was also dismayed by the fact that the plot was completely unbelievable and that some of the performances were so laughable that they were impossible to follow. The plot was so bad that the director actually seemed to care little for the actors. Even a "Bibby" is used to carry a small amount of truth and what the other actors do with the script is lost. I've read some comments from readers about the film but I was so disappointed in how bad it was that I couldn't even think about it until I watched it. I don't know why he thinks it was good, he probably is just one of the bad actors in the whole thing. In fact, I wouldn't want to see this bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't believe this movie is a bad film at all. Not one I think anyone will like. This was bad, and I was scared of seeing it. I saw it for a couple of years and laughed at some of the stuff they tried to put in it, but this was bad. The characters are bad and not at all funny. The dialog is very simplistic and there are no real lines to speak. The camera is not even good. It's not even a good-looking movie, and is really lacking in the special effects.  I wish I could say more. The movie should not have a shelf of great ratings. This is the kind of garbage that one would expect to see. The music is poor. The acting is not good, either. This movie doesn't make any kind of sense at all and doesn't even have any real life behind it. All of these things don't mean much to me, but all of these issues don't make me feel good either.  The biggest problem is the editing. The voiceover is a pretty bad one too, but at least I thought the voiceover was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst acting I have seen in years. The only thing that saved this movie was the acting of Charles Worthington. As soon as the film started, I thought it was obvious that this would become a joke. This is a very disappointing movie for a man that has really worked hard to overcome the pain that he experienced after he was diagnosed. To me, it is impossible to make out what Worthingon did in this film. He was acting in this in a way that was so hopeless it made me wonder if he was really capable of this. He is not a bad actor but he is rather a weak actor. I hope he can gain some traction in the rest of his career. I'm not sure how it was that he was in this movie. I suspect he had to hide his feelings and make him more comfortable, but he never did. It is like he is just going through the motions he's supposed to act out in a movie and his real life is not about acting. I can't think the man that was in the film wanted to be in this, because he seems to be very comfortable. I really don't understand how he could have become so unhappy after he's become a co-percer of this movie, because I'm sure he hasn't been in this much since he got the job at the bank, and he never shows up on "A Man Like You". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave it 2 and 3 star ratings, because I liked some of the dialogs in the movie. But this movie is so disappointing. My best rating is 4 out of 10. The acting was very bad, and the acting of the movie was so bad that I wouldn't even think about watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch, that even one person in the video to a lot of music might enjoy it, it is also so bad. I have never seen anything that was even remotely enjoyable about this movie, and I only made it because I had to see it. It should be taken as seriously as some of the worst movies ever made. I was very upset and annoyed by the way it played out. And this movie is very bad for the girls who made it. I don't know why it's made to be released and I don`t want to say why, but I do believe it was made because a few producers at the same time, who are involved in the film, decided it was their own personal agenda. So there's not much to be pleased with or see. But it just got a bad name. It's so bad and so stupid. A real shame. I would like it to have ended sooner. But as I said, it never got much traction because of the fact that I really liked this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film on the video store, I was like to say "that movie sucked me up", and that's how I felt the whole time. But even after watching it, I didn't believe that it was just another movie. That's all I can think of.  The most disappointing parts of this movie are the lines. Even the lines that seem like they are just a little bit silly. Even after reading those lines, it's still a bad film for me. But those lines were okay. I'll probably think twice more before I watch again, but don't bother me. I really just want to see something else.  What was about it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read through the plot synopsis for this film. It's so lame it is hard to believe. This is a complete failure of a film and I give this guy an absolute F-WOW.  I don't know how he can make this movie. It is like someone put their brain into a bottle and started running away from a wall with a bad paint job. It turns the people in the scene so thin that it's almost impossible to get to the characters and even see them. This film is about how the main characters are screwed up because of the plot, which is not a very strong story. I wish my brother got this movie for his birthday because I was one of the younger kids and we were bored with it. We loved it when it came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie's really disappointing - but it's better than any other movie ever made. The first thing that bothers me about this movie is that it's really hard to remember the actual story. What about? There are only so many people in the world that have such a great story - a bunch of high-end guys who are super super-rich to the point of absurdity. How the hell do they really live in their own manships? Where are they? If they're not super-wealthy, it's not much of a story, and their super-vampires have only about 100 minutes to tell the story, or they could use a TV camera. This story is completely disconnected from any real life, and its so dull - as with any other high-profile movie - that it takes away from the real story. Also, if you watch it, don't expect the plot to be a good movie - it's hard to stay awake and think about the real world - which is why I can't recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive review:  I had one of the original shows and I didn't care much for the remake. I wasn't that surprised that the new show was so terrible and it didn't bother me at all.  If you have seen this show as a kids movie, this is probably the second one you've ever seen.   I was so angry that they added a character in the new version of the show who wasn't so stupid. My kid had the same laugh that they had in the other version and when I found out what they did, I was flopping around, shaking my head.  The new show had a really low line for jokes. I laughed like I was dying. I tried to finish the movie and my kid was crying from tears. My family laughed with me as the show ended.  In a nutshell, I'm really sick of this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible movie: It's boring, the actors are terrible, the direction is terrible, and the plot is pretty lame. And it looks like it was designed to fail as a sequel. I found it to be a pretty funny film, but I'm sure there will be one film to make it out of all these awful movies in order. I can't even find it in my own house, and I can barely sit on the couch watching it on the computer.  I cannot fathom why the director decided to make this movie, they obviously knew how awful it had to be. There was clearly an audience for this movie to enjoy, and this movie failed badly with an audience that was completely lost. I'm a fan of the films that failed to come up even as good as this one, but this one just failed miserably.  It's not even funny, it's a complete waste of money, and it's really pointless, as you can't find it on tape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie through someone who commented about it online. As an entertainment, I rated it as a one-day, but a two-day rental price is less than what I paid to rent it. The only good thing about it was that the main theme is "evil girl". This is nothing like the film the other reviewers are praising.  I have never seen a good movie, and I don't recommend this one to anyone who is interested in watching this movie as a fun film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I've seen this movie is because I like all things I do on a TV. The rest of the characters are just completely horrible, but this movie really doesn't do anything good for those of us who watch it.  A lot of this movie was stupid, and I can't figure out what the premise is. But if you can look past the beginning through the end, this movie will lose a lot of its own.  If this movie comes out, I'll be glad that I didn't see it. It's not even a true horror movie, because it has all of the trappings of horror movies, and it starts out on a weird premise.  It could also be better if the movie was a parody of a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the movie, I've seen it a few times, and it just doesn't have any plot. The movie is about a teenager who decides to kill the gang of her boyfriend, but she can't follow her orders. She decides to use her brother's body as a form of revenge, and she doesn't exactly do anything right. I don't know why the movie is in this category, but it certainly doesn't inspire any sort of film interest. What the movie does, is that it presents nothing worthwhile, the movie fails to give any sort out, and the characters are not well developed, which is all for lack of screen time. I didn't really like this movie, so I gave it one rating, but as I said, it has to be rated one or two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say "I'm sorry", but that's a lie! I really don't have any sympathy for this movie, which I've only seen once or twice, but this movie is absolutely awful. The acting is terrible, the acting and dialogue is weak, and it really shows that it was really bad when I saw it.  I would definitely recommend a second-time watch to this movie for anyone who doesn't want to sit on the couch with the feeling of "welcome" to a movie that they were forced to watch. Otherwise, a decent effort to laugh at this movie could probably be done by watching one of the first 20 hours of "S.I.E. 2" -- and those were funny movies anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts off promisingly enough and then quickly becomes worthless. And I am sad for the actors who made it. What is wrong with this? They seemed to have learned some tricks to be able to make the film and that is why they ended up with the worst of their careers, which is an unfair punishment. They tried to make a film with a very, very small plot and also managed to make it seem like something. The story was so bad that they actually showed the characters in a movie and that's what they are in the book. The plot is not strong enough to keep the attention of the viewers.  The acting is bad and the direction is not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems to be based on the premise of a revenge story but I'm not so. I have watched it a few times and decided to watch again and decided that I couldn't take the idea seriously. But it also had some really weird and stupid lines. The guy who played the leader is the same one in the movie as in the book, the actor is also the narrator (he's in fact also in the novel). The story is one about how the group called the "Vastard" tries to get revenge on the guys who betrayed them in the second book, by killing them in a time-honored revenge game. There's nothing interesting about this plot and it just seemed that somebody put together a few muckings for some kind of drama. But I had to go for the other interpretation that it was more a revenge plan and a bunch of revenge schemes than it really was a plot about the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the whole premise behind this film to be absurd, ridiculous and contrived. The whole story is extremely contrived and completely absurd. The only thing I found amusing was when one of the girls was running around making out the girl from behind the bushes. This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was the longest and most painful movie I had seen. In all other respects, it's really not a great film, but it could have been better. The camera is bad, the actors are bad, and the writing is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very unhappy with this movie. I mean I don't know what they were doing, but that I believe. You'll never find out.  But I still have nightmares. It just does not make any sense, as you sit there looking at all of the terrible, terrible things that go on. They don't even bother me. It was so bad that it was funny, but this movie doesn't seem to make any difference. It's just one long story that has nothing to say about anything.  I'm going to miss my sister and my friends too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit it's one of my worst movies ever. I don't even like it to be taken seriously, but it turns out to be one of the worst films I've seen since my younger days.  This film is just an insult to any and all viewers who even like this movie to have their minds blown so much for being a teenager. What a waste of money spent on it. I know that I can't even see this film for longer. I am a little less biased than most, but after seeing it, I was sick to death. It was just awful.  I just couldn't believe this movie was made, even after I know what it is. It should never be made again. I just think this is what I would have gotten if I had to go through and rent it again. Just awful. The acting is horrible. I only write negative review for bad movie; it doesn't have a decent ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of those so-called 'Dontinuation' movies. I found this movie so bad it was hard to get into. The plot is weak, and I do not care for any of the plot. And the characters are not as good as they were in the first movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie for several years and I've decided I'm not interested. I have nothing more than an angry feeling and an over-a-boiled review.  As was the case in the movie, it is not as an anti-war movie, but an entertainment that is really more of a self-indulgent vehicle than a movie. I'm sure this is an entertainment industry, but not like one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't really call this film a "film". It's more like a plot with little plot, really. You get a scene in a restaurant, they're supposed to act together to get together and get their friends to fight. Then all hell breaks loose and all of the women start to fight, and you're left to wonder why the heck they're fighting.  What's more is that the film is actually kinda predictable. There's some pretty good moments, but there are some horrible ones as well. They do a little bit of ballet with a bunch of stupid songs about dancing. I don't think you could even find another movie with a plot that sucked that much better. I didn't like it that much, but I felt like it was an attempt to glorify a romantic relationship between a guy who had a fling relationship with a woman who had an affair with a male.  It looks good on the surface but I don\'t think that would go well in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm looking to buy the DVD version of the first movie. I can't believe that they put all their eggs in the basket when they made this movie. When I look at the trailer, it looks like a car was used to make it. I mean, that's what it looks Like! A car! A truck! A motorcycle! A helicopter! A ship! They've done it once or twice now! The only good thing about it is that the voice actors are actually good. It is too long, too long and too long! You have to be a little scared of it! It's a bad, bad movie.  The soundtrack is bad and the camera work is bad. The dialog is not good. The acting is bad too. The plot is bad! The voice-acted is bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a little short review of a very bad movie. It is probably the worst movie ever made. I cannot believe I watched it. I spent 5 hours watching it. And it wasn't even worth half that time. I feel like it is just an advertisement for a bad piece of work. I don't know how to make this film any better or how to tell it to a decent viewer. I recommend getting a copy of it before anyone hands it over to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of the critics have pointed out that the movie is so bad that it should be considered a parody of a horror movie. This is not a parody; it's an old film that is totally bad. The story of the movie starts with a very brief scene of a ghost's blood, that has been cut to pieces by a pair of scissors. It's then followed by a bunch of teenagers trying to take on the name of the ghost that has taken on the curse. The first scene is obviously very, um, gruesome. Some people have not noticed that this is a horror film, and that's okay. But this is the movie that tries to be taken seriously as a horror and nothing else.  The acting in this movie is simply bad. There are too many ridiculous scenes and the dialog is stupid. There were some parts that were funny, but not nearly enough. A scene involving a girl who wants to kiss and dance with a bear (who is actually gay) is the best thing of the whole movie, because the girl's hair falls in the air and she screams.  Also, it was very disappointing when I heard what was going to happen when it was shown on screen. The girl's mouth has opened and the teeth come down. The next thing is her finger moving and her hair is falling off.  I was really sad when I saw the movie. I wasn't surprised that it was in the comments on IMDb. But even after the movie was posted on the IMDb website, it seems that it wasn't getting any traction.  It was really only funny in a way. There's just no plot or anything going on. I found myself crying while watching it. The end of the film is simply a re-run of the same movie, so much of the dialog was left over and the writing was never touched up by the producers.  If you have to watch the movie, don't. I do recommend a more modern horror film with a plot that's actually entertaining. It seems to work well at times, but this has just about the same amount of vulgarity that the original was, and even has less of that horror element.   I'm not sure that anyone who has seen this film, or even really liked it, will be able to even understand how it is so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was the most disappointing movie I've seen in a while. It was completely incomprehensible, but it wasn't even a gag, it was just a horrible line. The character of 'Foxtile' was an OK, though the direction was so bad that it could have been used as a gag. It also lacked a sense of character, it just seemed like it was an off-season show from MTV. The film's premise is so bad, even though it has some of the best acting. I didn't think I'd be able to watch it because I really liked the series, but the casting was so poor. There were so few of the good actors and actors who were attached to the project. The only exception was Jack Black, who was amazing in the series and who played as a child in an adult film. He said some great lines and always played well as an actor. But as an actress, he couldn't deliver as well as any of them. He's a very talented actor, but he couldn' fit for an acting role. There was also no supporting roles for the actors, which was disappointing.  This was absolutely terrible. The producers obviously wanted their creative powers to come in and just make a movie that would get aired for a low price. The story is so predictable that it feels like it's being run out of pure anger. This film just isn't interesting as a series of jokes. No jokes, no funny ideas, no clever funny jokes, and not even a plot. I'm not a guy who has seen this movie and laughed at how bad it is. I don't understand how anybody can possibly be fooled into a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the movie is interesting, but it lacks depth and makes no real point. I would have been interested in a film with a more realistic plot line - something that would be interesting in a plot-focused film. This film starts with a bad story - the protagonist is dead from an overdose and his son turns up from a coma. It seems as if the movie was designed by the writers who wrote the book to just get a simple plot of what happened to be there. I mean, I'm not saying the characters are all stupid, but if they were, the movie would be funny. That being said, the actors in this movie are stupid - the acting seems flat and predictable, and the dialog is a complete mess. The movie really suffers from a lack of a realistic plot - a good story in a thriller is well-rounded with the characters of the main characters.  But, the worst part about this movie is that the plot is completely unrealistic. The film starts out with a good plot - the characters get ready for a good fight - but instead of fighting, the story falls flat. The characters' love for the son's mother is real and nothing comes from this. It would have brought a nice ending for a decent thriller.   This film has been put together by a bunch of guys who were probably unhappy with the movie. They were looking to make money. They thought that a low budget would improve the movie because they were unsatisfied with the script and couldn't make the film as they had originally planned. In the end, they decided to make it a short movie so that it would be more appealing to viewers. Since there was no shortage of money to make this film, the filmmakers decided to "sell" it so that they could get distribution. They did a very low-budget short film, but they ended up having a very long run.  If you're an anti-climaxion fan, enjoy the ending, but even if you don't, don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been reviewing this film since I have finally seen it.  I cannot comment on it because I did not bother to watch it, and did not read it. I was only one person with a copy of it. No one needed to see it. This is the worst film I have ever seen. There is a little better video of it: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are so poor they are not capable of making any funny jokes. I didn't care for anything else. The whole thing is a piece of cheap-made soap opera, but I find the whole premise to be a complete joke. The plot is not good either. The ending is totally unsatisfactory and there is not even a good ending. I really did love all the characters and their roles, and this movie simply needs to die. I wish it could have been saved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie as a kid. I can't even go into the end credits without seeing what happened. It looks like some of their movies that had a special effect, like a newbie with special glasses or like a kid with a magic book. I don't care what this movie is like, because it's just that awful. The ending was stupid and made no sense whatsoever. It was about as bad as a "Wizards of the World" movie. I'm surprised they decided to make a sequel to this one, because I don not even know how much my husband and I are in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are simply too predictable and the movie seems to suffer from little or no real suspense and tension. I've never seen this movie before and don't plan to waste time watching it again. But it is still good for an interesting genre: horror and the otherworldly "hell is not possible" thriller. But the movie simply isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this movie was an interesting and entertaining film. However the film was a complete failure on many levels. I would avoid this movie if the only person that is truly interesting in this film is an idiot. The film is painfully predictable. It is one thing to read books which are boring but actually I felt that the book itself was an extremely boring film. I could listen to the film and listen to it without getting bored. I don't know why this movie is considered a cult film. Its also one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Overall I was bored by this movie and I would never find the courage to watch it. It's also an extremely stupid film. It seems like a comedy about a movie but really I would have to find a way to watch this movie without the fact that I just watched this film so many times. The other problem was I got the same feeling after seeing this film as if I had just watched a movie and there was nothing left to say. The acting was so weak and the direction was poor. I was not interested enough to be able to enjoy the movie and even though I wanted to see this film again I was unable to find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie many times and it just keeps coming. I'm not sure if this is a real sequel to the "Kidd" movie. The first movie was quite good but after "Kali" was out, the quality dropped so drastically. This movie is not funny, nor does it have any good scenes, nor did it have enough laughs. And the special effects were simply horrible. The whole thing is just annoying, especially the ending sequence. I was laughing and shaking my head with the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script has all the usual clichés for the first time. That's not an accident, but that's what it's all about. What happens when you've never heard the other person's name, either, in the middle of a week, and now you're having to hear them again! A lot of the script was recycled from the other people's script. They did have some interesting dialogs in the beginning, and I'll admit that some of the dialogue could be funny, but the rest of it just seemed so predictable. The only thing that bothered me was that they didn't even include the first person's initials in the script - only in the end, they had an unwise attitude about the other name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't care if I was getting bored or if I could be bored. I'm looking for some entertainment when it comes to a film so bad that you feel like you're going to die.  It's not worth $10. I'd have done the same with a $10 million dollar film.  I'll admit I'm a huge fan of the previous versions of this film, but I was very disappointed by it. I've seen a lot of good movies, but a lot that one fails to make even a decent sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, if I didn't know this movie was going to be made before I got to it, I should have known that it was so bad, since I got a copy of it for my first viewing. It is absolutely appalling, it has a pretty low-budget feel, and looks like a dumber sex movie that was designed to appeal to the 'baudette' audiences. It's not funny, it's not clever, it hasn't any plot, and there's nothing to take it seriously. It was an interesting attempt, but even worse when it comes to sex.  I've never liked this movie, it is bad, but it's hard to take seriously.  It really was an insult to the viewer's memory. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is not much else to describe this movie. It's just a bad, over-the-top-looking, brainless, pretense-fabulous-plot-driven thriller. Not much to say, it's just so bad. If it were made in California or Hawaii, it would be a fine film but there are few films that can be well reviewed in a positive review. The only good point is the actors, the script, and the performance-in-the-. It's no matter how many you like it, if you're into a thriller, you won't enjoy it as a thriller.   4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first one but the second is worse. It just starts with bad dialogue, awful special effects and bad acting. And there's still the lack of a good character. But this is the second film i've seen which actually, it's better than the first two. The first one is simply a poorly acted film with interesting and very well-crafted characters. The second one is a much-anticipated film, which makes me think a very strange film. The plot and character development is quite thin, but the special effects do not help.  The third film i have seen is simply OK, but it's not good as a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I am going to talk about the acting. The acting seems to be just plain bad, especially the acting between the people and the story. They should have put in some decent acting; otherwise they should have acted like this in the series they made in the last few years. They are acting like the characters in the movies they made before. They have to act like an ordinary person to have these kinds of things in a film. They act like they're going to be boring and have no interest in them. If you want a good thriller, please don't watch it because they're all boring and predictable and very, in my opinion, boring.  The plot is pretty stupid, as well. In this movie, they really had to make up a story of a murder case. If it had any real meaning, it would have been better. But not that important. If they had just been having fun, the movie would have made a lot of money, which was obviously the point.  One interesting thing about the ending was that they used the same exact same phrase, "no doubt" when the murderer was killed. It wasn't a sign of guilt, but a sign that he had no doubts about murdering. He just killed his sister. It was a sign which he was convinced had to have a killer. And the police didn't act as they had done. It is just another way of saying the police shouldn't go there because there were no other murders that were there.  There is nothing to say about the plot, just the fact that there wasn't anything to show. The movie starts out with the murder just as it is set to happen, with no indication that the murderer wants to kill someone. However, when the police go to the murder house, there is an attempt to hide the murderer so that he doesn't act like he does. If we had made the same kind of movie for a sequel of this, it could have been a much better movie. If one had read the series before, it wouldn't have been such a lame plot. I understand that they made the murder trial because they wanted to hide her, because that would mean that they didn't have to make the case a lot, and also that the killer was a good actor. But they could have done a better job if they just made it appear. There is a sequence where one police comes to the house and it becomes obvious that they weren't really trying to hide him.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this movie is not bad, it still is awful. For this film to be a true "cane" this is the worst movie ever. In fact I cannot stand it was the worst "cANE" movie ever made in my life. The "cano" theme had me screaming for the first time. The director of this film tried so hard to make this movie seem like a comedy. It could not have been a comedy at all. This is not a funny movie and will probably take you back to sleep to the first day of sleep. Even if you are not a teenager you will have to spend hours to watch. This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen and it is made for a 9 year old. I had to go to sleep again and had to sleep for two nights. The only thing I can think about is that it was so bad that I had nightmares. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been reading the reviews of the previous reviews and, by their own I think they are correct - the main reason why I can't recommend this film is because its main character does not act as well as her counterpart(I'm not trying to spoil this, but the acting was bad). However, this film should be more than a three and a half hour film, it should not have been a one hour film. There was a lot of pointless dialog, which was unnecessary and didn't make for the film. The film also had some of the worst acting of the movie, I think the casting was OK, there were also some minor parts which were interesting, but were drowned in the story.  I really feel like it's been put in to a "film" by somebody, and I don't think it's being produced by a Japanese company. What was interesting about this film was that it's an attempt to bring an American version of the "Shakokuge Girls" - I'm sure the girls won't be too familiar to Japanese audiences and don't expect to be treated exactly as Japanese. I'm really sick of the fact that this movie has the word "Ace".   If you have to see one of the films listed below, I would ask, please go ahead and buy a copy of it, because if you actually do enjoy the original Japanese version of this movie, you'll be treated to the quality of the original American one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is a movie about the greatest of all time, the greatest, the least interesting, and the least funny of all the things...but, sadly, its pretty boring...and just plain sad! I was hoping to like this movie because, unlike most movies, it is truly a genuine comedy. I was going to enjoy it, because there was really funny and interesting in it. But, it just got boring! I wasn't a huge fan of this movie, but, considering it was about a real life drama, it should at least be entertaining. It just had a hard time with the characters. As I said, most of the characters are boring and one of them even dies. The characters are weak and are not interesting, but the movie has a decent story, so you'll probably have a better time with it than watching it. The only point I made is that the film wasn't very interesting...but I was looking for an interesting movie...not too entertaining, I might have been having fun watching it if I could only like the people involved. The actors were all okay, the acting was good...but the movie is so bad, so sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the premise is so stupid that it has me, the viewer, wondering how it is. But don't get me wrong. I like the premise of the movie, and that it's funny. That is, if you don't mind the fact that the movie is one of the worst and most poorly executed comedies of modern day. I found this movie annoying as it wasn't funny. I thought it would be funny. However, I was annoyed by the fact its premise and its execution, because it did not take place in an authentic scene to the story, nor did it accurately reflect the events of the film. It seemed like it was made by some kid who had never worked in movies, or someone who had seen nothing else but knew nothing about cinema, and had taken some college classes. As a movie maker, I'd be embarrassed if I'd made something worse than this, but I give it a zero. There were no good laughs here, the acting is bad, and there were some pretty bad lines but that's okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst thing I've seen in ages.  It's just the worst remake ever made. I mean, it wasn't even a remake...I mean, how the hell does it make a remake? Where do I get from the last time? I can't even tell what it was? The script is terrible. I think that is it's in a way that there's no real meaning and there's an attempt to make it seem like it is one thing. It's all about the characters' relationship to each other (a guy, and a woman, are married and married, so their relationship is not about being together or being married...and then they decide to be married because they get into a fight or something about "his relationship with this woman" but it turns out that he decides that his relationship is going to end)...it's all a waste of money. The ending is basically just the same as the original. And there is absolutely no suspense for a great sequel. And if you are a fan of a film, this is the only way to get into this movie. I don't know what director is supposed to be involved with this movie but I can guess, I guess it is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no plot, it is poorly made, the soundtrack is bad. There are many bad scenes in the first 10 minutes, most of which are unnecessary, the plot is fairly simplistic and the acting is bad at best, the acting was good enough, I give it a couple of good lines. The characters are bad, the actors do alright and the music is okay, but not for the ending. In fact, I don't think it's a good movie at all.  4 out of 10   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have laughed when I watched this bad film. I have never seen a film this bad. The acting was bad, and even the dialog was bad. I had to laugh, and the soundtrack was stupid. Some of the most sad scenes I have seen since I was 8. I thought I'd finally made my second film and this was disappointing to me. I am sick from the first film I made, and hope I never see this film. It seems like the makers think you can only see one of these films before they have made one. I'm sick of it and it doesn't look good in a movie, and you don't see the "good" ending! You need to watch and find a movie about a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I will find this film even remotely interesting. The whole movie is stupid, I'm honestly not even interested in this kind of film. It's boring, and the acting is not too good. I don\'t know whether they should make this movie to be a comedy or not.  However, it's entertaining at times and I have always loved this movie, but this one is completely flat, and even the story is boring and doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really surprised. I think it would be an interesting film if someone put some thought into it. But this film is just awful. You've got a few stupid scenes and people who's the main character(Riley) are in the cast. They really should have a director. It was really just awful and I was just laughing at the end.  There is a really bad remake of "Myster City" about a teen who turns into a drug addict and becomes a drug abuser. The movie was about a teenager who was in an abusive relationship with a girl that had been in a relationship with the boy who she had loved. What a stupid idea?  I don't think the director really had any interest in this film. I just think the film would have been better if it wasn't made from the start to the end (it was only released in Japan.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has an even worse plot than I expected. I didn't care if they were to be really good. The lead character in the movie is a psychopath and you can't even really feel for her, especially after she was killed by some fellow psychopath. She really didn't do anything, she's just a little bit crazy, and she talks about killing the victims. When she's first shown, she shows no signs of empathy or respect for others, which is interesting considering the fact that she was the only person in the whole world to survive an entire night, considering how cold that must have been in the middle of a cold winter. After she's killed those people, she has the feeling of guilt about it and decides to become a murderer. It's not long. Just before she kills the psychopath, she spends hours sitting in her bed at the hotel with the killer. As time progresses, she murders everyone. It doesn't matter what happens. No one actually kills people, just people want to die so there's a lot to kill.  The acting is also terrible. I would give the actors an Oscar for this movie if they just wrote something that had some interesting story. There's not much story here. If you're looking for some kind of a horror movie, you can substitute this for a really good movie: horror-no more horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have nothing nice to say...   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is absolutely awful and the acting was extremely bad. The acting was bad and there was even a whole line of dialog that could be misinterpreted. The whole thing is very confusing and there is absolutely no room for a plot. The director seemed to be completely lost and I am absolutely amazed that even a second rated film was rated by the American Film Institute, not even to mention the 20-year anniversary of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've been to this movie many times, and if I didn't already know that it was a piece of crap, I'm certain I'd be at the same level. I'm an adult, and this kind of film doesn't have any redeeming features that make it a worthy film. It is bad as a plot, because it starts out with a very weak story and a lack of direction. In a lot of the first 10 minutes, this movie is a complete waste of time. But then, I was intrigued. What the hell happened in those first 10 moments? It's just an embarrassment of incompetence, and most of all, it is poorly written. This is the same guy, in fact, who made the first horror film for such a low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad, in my opinion. You would never expect a movie to have a good story or ending. The story is very basic, but it's not good. The scenes are very disappointing and there's no tension whatsoever. The ending has a vague and confusing ending and there aren't enough endings. You can't make a lasting impression when you have to watch this movie more than once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are just about 6 things I have noticed about this movie: 1. In the past 15 years I have seen better movies. 2. In recent years I do not see good movies made by the same directors as this one. 3. This movie is a disaster of bad movies. 4. I know who wrote this movie and I know what happened to it.  There is no mystery here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a one and it was a bad. The music was terrible, there was no music and the acting was terrible. But the director gave him a new lease to an evil family.  It's really not a great movie, I have not had more enjoyable films. This movie has one of the worst ratings on IMDb, in the worst category. And there's some good jokes. But overall this is an awful film, it has been done again. I would never recommend it, but if you really want to see some "funny" movies, maybe you'll find a good movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so stupid! It seemed to be all over the point in the last half hour. When you are a big, bald, bald person and your friends keep commenting about it, the first thing you think is "it's too long" or "it looks stupid" or something else. But then it happens and it doesn't matter.  In the end, one of the two main characters (the actor and the writer) are talking about the whole thing.  "Let's see if you can change this movie" is the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care which movie I get to review. If I had to choose between one of the two movies, I would choose this one. This movie is so bad that it shows a lack of feeling for the characters' story and the characters. The characters are terrible, the action is stupid, and the direction is terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad to have finally seen this movie, even with the caveat that it was meant to be a comedy. But it is just so bad. The dialog is not funny. There's not a decent storyline, and the plot is just plain boring. So I thought that I had a good movie on this day, but I couldn't really remember it. It could have been a parody of sorts, but there's just no room for it. A plot that revolves around the characters' behavior is simply not funny enough, but for a comedy it just has a bad tone and looks desperate. Also, the ending is a pretty lame way to end the movie.  The only thing I could do was watch it again and see how this guy plays. He doesn't really look all that cool, but he is the guy. If there was a better person to do the movie, I would like to ask my friend who played that guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ever see "Mr. President," this is the movie that you would never expect to see. A bunch of people who think the president is some "hippy" hippy with a penchant for the president's underwear or who would like to kill the president to get a job back to the country or that the president has a fetish for sleeping with him. This is not a comedy, it is an entertainment. A pathetic attempt to take the President seriously by making him a bit more serious. The only thing that is funny is when Michelle Obama is taking a bath to the White House. If you like this movie, please don't see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was my very first viewing of this movie. I was extremely annoyed by how bad the film was. The ending was so bad, it really must have been staged. I don't understand why they decided to use this footage. If you watch it, please do yourself and yourself. Don't let yourself get into this movie as it plays out like a piece of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has the worst acting ever seen in a movie. I don't even care about acting in a horror movie. They should really put some talent behind it to try and get some better acting. This is a disaster. This movie is extremely stupid and has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It could be a little better if you are one of the people who tries to find a decent job, like a movie director. This was probably one of those terrible films of the year and I donno need to tell anyone else. I just want the first two movies out of the trilogy to get the sequel together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one was so bad it almost killed any potential viewers. It got me wondering why the writer couldn't come up with a better ending than what I saw at the beginning. The writing was really just terrible and the acting was just bad. I really do not like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't very good either way. I think it is a little more like "Tales of the Moon" or the other classic films of the same genre and they just don't have anything good to say. The film is supposed to be a thriller, so when I first started watching it, I thought it would be a horror film. Unfortunately, it's a mix of horror/comedy and horror/amnesia. I'm not a horror fan, but I am a fan of a horror/comedic film. It fails to make you understand the motivations and the problems that the people in these worlds suffer. I don't think this movie was intended to be the film it really was. There is one short scene in the film that shows a guy killing himself and it's just plain awful. The movie is only mildly entertaining with some scenes that are interesting, and a short story about a vampire girl who dies and turns into a very sexy zombie. I hope this film gets banned from the censors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie again after watching the video that I bought in the video store. I was hoping it would be worth the price I paid for it. Turns out, I'm not gonna' give anything for it, and it looks like it was an hour and a half of an hour. The actors are really bad, and I believe the director should get a better job. The acting is bad, I think the story and the story-telling is very poor. And the acting. Well, that's not surprising, considering how many times it could've been funny and witty.  But it isn't funny either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is full of bad acting, bad scenes, and the best part of the movie, the music. I have only one positive review about this bad movie, and it's about the soundtrack. I had to listen to this music, because I had the thought that it was the best song ever in history. The only one good song is "The One You Would Have Wanted To Hear, But You Can't". That song is so bad, that I laughed while I watched it, and that's a horrible excuse to listen a bad music song.  Other than the worst soundtrack in movies, I have to talk about the bad story. It's not too long to get into this movie, but even if you are in an adult movie, you won't be able to make any sense of what's happening, because it's not a movie, either.  It has a decent plot, but what happened in the movie is too obvious, and very hard to understand. Also, all the people in the movies get their bodies ripped off and are unable to escape, which is just plain horrible. They can't escape in the first scene of the film, and all their bodies are ripped off, and then they get ready to attack each other's genitals again. I can't imagine why they would want to go through the scene again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the problems it has for those who liked it. But it is so bad that I wanted to see it again and it was so bad it made my wife feel sick. The ending is the worst part of this film. It is only the worst I've ever seen in any film. The plot is really bad - I won't even mind you call it a story. The idea is stupid. I saw it in the box and thought it was a story - not like a story! I saw the opening credits on video online and thought they were the same.  The acting is bad - the characters are poor - and the dialogue is awful. The acting isn't even good enough. The camera was bad too - but the camera didn't make it up. My kids have told me how bad this movie is, the plot is bad, the acting is awful - but it didn't matter, I wanted the money, the enjoyment was lost. I didn't care if I lost a few hours. I'm not going to see this movie again. It's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so poor in itself that it was supposed to be a comedy. The movie started about 30 minutes into the movie and then took 5 minutes to finally get to a full hour. I've read more bad movies, and this was one of them. The ending was so bad, I couldn't even finish the movie. I don't know what to say about the plot and I donno how you can go about to rate it. I'm not going to even get into this one. I won't even give it one one out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of the movie had promise for a good story. The film is a very confusing story line and it's only half of what it could be. The actor's acting is weak and most of the acting is boring, as well as the story itself. Overall, this is a complete waste of time. I found the movie pretty interesting, and some of the scenes were interesting. But when I look back at them, I think it's obvious that it's just plain awful. There should be no funny stories, no lines and no suspense. I hope the producers try to stick together to finish the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because I liked the way the movies that made it seem so funny were. This movie was horrible. It was hard to relate to what the other movies were like, with the way they were all about the same plot lines and storyline. I mean the two other movies made much better. I am not saying that the other movie is better, or that it is better than the other ones. I just mean that they were not funny. The jokes are too weak to be funny. I guess that the way that the movies of this genre was going and the way their jokes were going. The movies made fun with their humor but that's not how these movies were supposed to be. If you want to laugh, just one time would be enough for them. I'd recommend watching the "Strikers" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this for my birthday. I'm a movie buff, so I wanted to see it. This movie is badly written and acted. The actors are not good actors, and the dialogue is just awful. The acting is stupid and the acting is terrible. The girls are the worst they are acting so far. If you are an avid film buff, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I just want a good, interesting film to watch. If it's a piece of American life, it really should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In some other good films, like "Jumbo", 'Honey', and 'Corsac' 'Homer' we get to see the good ideas of the past. But this is not. This film has none of these. It has no real characters, and it doesn't have real plots. The characters are boring, the characters are bland, and the dialogue is completely incoherent. Some of the dialog in the movie has been ruined in a terrible way. But there is some good elements to this movie, and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It is a disgrace that some producers should be able to make a decent film with a decent cast. This movie has nothing to do with the future of the film. If anything was in this film, it is just one of several poorly produced films about the current movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So what was the first thing I thought of coming here was. That's not to say that they're bad, but they're the most terrible movies ever. I can never really believe in the concept that there's a relationship between men and women, so that it makes the films so terrible. What made me even happier is that it was so predictable that there were so many scenes where women would react in such a way, as if it was just some women feeling what they want to do. Even for a few minutes of film, you'd think they were doing some kind of thing, which is how these characters are treated by society, and it wasn't even that well. They were the same, in a way.  As if these people don't understand that. The problem is that I never really cared whether anyone knew what these people were saying, they simply weren't interested in me. In fact, they didn't even have any interest in me, and I didn't know who they were. The only thing I can conclude is that they just do all kinds of wrong things.  This is a movie that is so bad it could have made some good movies. It just has absolutely no premise, but it has all kinds. It's just a bunch of people having fun at their own amusement. What happens with this stuff is that the people in the film pretend that they have the power of the system, and that they act like it to get what they need, and then act like a bunch to get the results they want out of their system.  I'm not sure that anyone ever really liked this movie, but what's interesting is that we can only guess so many different things about it, and they have made it so bad that it's not even remotely entertaining.  The movie was absolutely painful, and there are times when I've gotten into a really rough exchange with them where it seemed like a joke, and at first I didn an impression. I was reminded that there was even a woman in the same movie, and even though I had seen the woman in an earlier film, I couldn't remember her name. The closest I had to actually say I had was about how she didn't seem to like the characters that she was in for, and she had told me that she had liked the characters in the movie, though.   After a time, I get tired and uncomfortable with it.  One thing I noticed, and is kind of boring, is the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film. There is absolutely no redeeming character. The way the writer plays the lead is so weak and unnatural and I could never understand why. The ending could never be believable. The story, although interesting and could have a funny story, is so lacking in emotion. What this film is really about is how the writers are acting. They are acting like people who do not have any clue in acting, not a clue in any language or history. There were no real story to the story, nor were there any real characters to the characters. When I had finished the film I couldn't believe the director had cared much about the story that the story was about. This is bad and there is no redeemer in this movie. You do not know what you are about to do or what is going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing part of this movie. The lead role of Jake Stark was good. And the rest of the cast was a mess. This movie was nothing, not great, but it didn't make sense. This was a film that I never expected would have a sequel. In all honesty it didn of course have a plot. But unfortunately there were no sequel. The most important part was the villain, and in this movie he was a pretty decent, but unfortunately not very interesting.  In the end I found this movie frustrating, in most part I think I would find some enjoyment to have an attempt at this movie that at least tried to build up the suspense. There wasn't enough good jokes, there wasn't a good storyline, and there were too many holes that were too big.  I don't know why, but I did think a bad one is better than a good one. I'm not sure what the reasons were for making this movie, but at the least, it didn´t seem like it would have been good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie and the director gave me an angry look.  It was about the same as the previous one.  The only thing that saved it was the fact that the guy was trying to make money off of it.  Not exactly like a zombie movie.  I don't know why he thinks a $10 million budget will be enough for a 10 year old film. But it seems that this guy does not see the fact his own film could make for 10 million. Maybe he'll get bored if he goes too far.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this I was very suspicious. It was a very strange little piece of junk. I was hoping it was funny and funny, but it was just the opposite. It seems to be in the same kind of manner with almost no plot at all. There are some decent bits, but they don't make the cut-off jokes in a funny manner. It really wasn't funny. It's just a complete waste of time. I didn't really see anything more to the film, and I don't plan to see more. I don the end-of-the-film any way, and it wasn't until the movie finished playing that I had a clear understanding of what was going on. I can't imagine why this film was released. It didn't help to save the film from making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As some of you, I'm sure the movie's ratings have some of the blame for that. This film isn't for teens, nor is it for kids. I know they make it out for younger kids, but this is nothing like a kid film. They just have a few scenes to show them, and then it's over. When they start watching, the films are bad, so bad that you want to see something better. I have to admit that when I saw this film, it wasn't a full-on horror film, but it is a very bad, well done bad, made-it-up horror film. It is so bad, that when you watch it, you just want to go out and buy some other horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of Mr. D. Hineson, the first time I watched "The Black Hills of Earth" was in this episode. But that was only for the first episode and never the series. In a new episode I watched it again and I can't understand what Mr. Harpell is doing. Why was he so bad? What is his motive? Why was there a story about a man who was trying to prove that he was a man of deep interest? What if he just wants to be so special? What happened to be his first effort? We never find out why he is so bad, and I think it's not worth bothering about trying to figure out his motives. In the end, I am not convinced he's so special. It just seems like a case of people having the same desires as we, so no matter if Mr. Hiles does it or not, what is the point of being so special in the first? This is not the best movie of the year, but it does have some good points.   The story goes on and it doesn't have a lot of dramatic and suspense. If you are a "hard" viewer, like myself, you might find yourself falling into this section and find yourself stuck. The story is about a woman's wife and her husband, who go to meet the woman's husband. But when they get together, she starts talking to the man and it is determined that she will not marry him, and there's some drama about how it all works out. I don't think it would have been much fun to watch for a few minutes. I would have felt more entertainment if they would have had done a better job.  This is one of many of the worst movies I've ever seen. The dialogue is awful, and the acting is so poor that it can just leave you feeling like you're going to break. The movie is also a really bad sequel. The character of a guy who goes to get into the black sheep hunt to help him win in a battle with some black sheep of a tribe of war in a desert. As a result, the story ends when the man goes to see her in front of him and shoots him because he sees the value of it.  It's an odd episode to listen to. You get to be distracted by pointless dialog and a few good parts of the story, but even in a movie it's a disappointment to the viewer. I guess you
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As some others have stated, the film is very poor and looks a bit bad when played on. I am sure it would be very interesting to listen to music and find out if the song was bad. Or at least find out what songs were played in this film. I have to admit that I did find the songs interesting, although they didn't make much sense. I found the story a bit weak and the acting was lacking, but at the same time, it wasn't bad. Unfortunately, the ending is pretty stupid and I believe it is about time to get rid of this film and re-think. I don't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the lead actress for this movie I have to really hate her for her poor acting. She's really a loser for a pretty lady in the movie. There are some really bad scenes, which are probably the closest thing I could ever see in the film. But in a movie directed by the director of "Rock & Roll" it was only a matter of luck that it worked. I mean a lot of people in the movies never really do well in their jobs, but I guess there is really a talent in acting. Just look at all the actors in the cast, and how bad they are. Just a few months ago, you could not find the same actor for me. It's all the same characters, but there are new ones that want to become the protagonists. There is a new story for the "Rock and Roll" movie. But now it's just the same old movie, and when you're watching it you can't really relate to it anymore.  This movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen, the soundtrack is awful, and the plot is even worse than the original "Rock& Roll". It's just a bad excuse of a movie. I can not recommend it, and I think I'm just gonna be sick of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was only okay at its beginning and really only really good at the end. Some characters are silly, others are totally unrealistic, but the movie never gets much better. The most irritating character is the father, who can't remember how he started doing this movie in high school and who still finds it difficult to watch his daughter cry. And the other annoying character is his kid, who thinks the movies are about some cartoon he saw in the other video game, or an old sitcom he remembers. The film also includes a lot of gratuitous moments, like a guy who runs a car with a gun in front of him, as if he were in an "advice video" movie. I think the creators should have gotten some kind of a sequel for the other "The Big Fat Games". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm not sure what the movie is about but I don't want to comment on it because I don\'t think it was very good. It is probably the worst movie of any kind ever made, and I don-t think anyone could be that surprised by the movies that have been put together (and I mean really made). But it has at least 2 or 3 funny clips in it, so it is not worth to waste time looking at. It starts out by claiming the world will soon end because a 'God Almighty' man has managed to steal it. There are obviously many other words in the film and the beginning is pretty predictable. Then one minute into the film a guy drops a bomb into his room and it destroys everything. Then, the guy says 'the fire was probably created by a 'Bum bum' and the fire was 'God' Almighty.' The rest is very predictable but still has some weird visual gag that is pretty obvious.  There is obviously a major disconnect between the characters and the script. In fact, the ending is the least funny and most predictable and stupid ending ever made. The only reason I could justify its ending is that it's pretty funny. There is no indication as to how the next question should be answered. What I mean is that the 'God's God' is supposed to be so powerful and yet, he does nothing after dropping the bomb. In the next movie you are going to see 'Honeybee' making it's way to the top. The film is not funny and no'real' plot except for a funny sequence of a guy leaving the house. The 'bomb' is obviously an act of religious fervent desperation and the character says it was like a piece of furniture that somebody stole from a church in Mexico. The guy then says that God is trying to destroy the world. The next scene comes a few minutes after that. A guy and a bunch of friends find a bomb in a room and leave in an alley to destroy it. He then starts making a fire and he burns everyone. This is followed by an interlude about some funny 'joke' between a couple of guys who are on their honeymoon.  The next movie is called 'Dirty Dungal.' After having seen the 'Diluted' trailer I was so sick. I wasn't even able to 'find out' that it was about this movie. But it wasn't only a 'jerk' movie,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst of the horror movies of the 1980s. I was quite surprised to discover that one of them had an R rating. This is the only movie I've seen in a really long time that isn't one of these low budget horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this? It's a movie about one single character. It is very hard to get into the middle of the plot, and it's hard to understand the characters. And what is a plot? It is an incoherent story with no real ending. The first movie I saw was a very boring plot, but in the next movie I watched I was very bored. And the movie is so bad it is not entertaining. There are some funny moments, but that could be expected. There was no clue that this was really a film. It would have been better if this had been a sequel to the very good film "Bully" or something like that. It also wasn't well known and widely known at all. This movie was the same for a few of my friends.  What makes it so bad? The actor was very bad, but, to me, it was obvious and funny, and the movie itself is funny.  But I just don't understand why he was in this movie. I really didn't find anything funny. The acting was not funny or funny. In the next and third movie I bought I thought the movie was good, and my friends who were fans of it didn't understand how bad it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little bored and my thoughts were, that when I saw this film that I didn't really like it. I was so bored with the idea of being in an apartment that I saw another movie about a guy who plays in the first movie I knew about this movie. It was so boring and sad! I watched it again and that was about 30 seconds after. It would have been better if it hadn't been so long since, and it was never meant to be taken seriously. This film wasn't funny. I just found it sad that I wasn't the only person that cared for this movie because it was so sad and disappointing! I had also watched this film in the UK and I didn�t want to see it again. I only saw it because I wanted it to stick up. I had gotten tired after watching it and I wasn�t able to stop it in the US. I didnât even realize why this movie was so bad, but when I was in England it wasn't even that bad because the acting was so good. This movie isn't even funny and it isn't really scary, but it isnât a good movie.  If you don't have any interest in the movie, I donât recommend it, it just donâ  let the writer or the person that wrote it make the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a pretty big fan of the show and I really liked it. In fact, I used to watch it for several times but I was pretty sick of this movie. I mean I was just a normal viewer. I was sick of the ending which seemed to make no sense whatsoever. I'm a huge fan of a good movie and I thought it was really good, but I think it just couldn't be good. The movie is just so bad it hurts me to the point that it really isn't worth my time. It's really the worst kind of film I have seen. It just really hurts me when I finish it and think of all the other movies which have nothing better than this.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if you're serious about watching it and you want to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie as a bad comedy. I felt there was an attempt to capitalizeise the script. Also I saw an hour of the movie in a free movie review in LA that included the ending scene. It was a poor effort, and I found that the ending had nothing to do with the real plot. But that was more than enough to make me laugh. And I don't believe they had to go in with the story. A big red red square square (also known as "The Square") is at least a movie where you can laugh. It is not a movie about an ordinary criminal (who is in an alley and walks into the square) that could be easily laughed at. I didn't find any humor in the ending. It just seemed to be a cop movie, that the cops knew they were coming to get the job done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was no explanation of who this was and what its story was. In the interviews, it seems like they've had no clue. They don't really care. Just a few minutes of an interview is what it would have taken. That's not a true answer to "How to think about life, what's my life?" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was extremely disappointing because it had absolutely no redeeming features. It is extremely bad, especially the ending at the end of the film was so horrible. The fact that it was so long after this movie was released that no one could find it. I think it would be very interesting to see the new movie "Gumbo" which was just released about a year ago because this movie has some good ideas. Although, this movie is not as funny as "Goliath", it is just as bad as "Bigfoot." It also has absolutely no substance to any story. In other words, the movie is simply bad.  The plot was terrible and there was no funny, either. If I could, I would have left the entire movie out and never watched it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie I cannot say I was surprised. It was never interesting enough for the first 3 weeks. The dialogue was extremely stupid and the cinematography looked like the most self-indulgent piece of work I've ever seen. What the hell did I do with this one? I decided to watch it again only so my brain can finish all the things I'm writing about it and figure out what the hell it was supposed to be. I give this movie a zero rating, no stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so bad that I don't even think that it's worthwhile to review. It's one of those movies that you just never stop watching because you just have to believe it. They tell you that it won't make a difference. I just wish it could have been anything else. It starts off with a very uninspired character who is only half right. You don't get a real understanding of her until she comes up to you later on. But it's okay. Even then, she lies, and you feel like a complete sucker. You get it and get it, but you don't really understand how she's going. Her entire family is just a bunch of annoying teenagers. Just a couple of grudges, you could have had a long weekend and spent some time getting them all together, if you could. And when you do, you will find that there is something very wrong with your whole family. It just seems like a bunch a people who can't act properly because they're so obnoxious, like you and I. That is what is worst. Just awful, horrible, terrible!  This movie was bad from the beginning.  It's too bad to be true to the book (the book is so good). This is a bad and depressing movie. It is absolutely awful. The first part is very, very bad.  What a pity! It's not even funny about it...  This has absolutely nothing to do with anything. The only way it could be redeemed is if it has a good plot, good acting, good cinematography, good direction and a good story. And it's not a great story. It ends in a complete mess.  I was really hoping that it would be an improved sequel, because this is such a terrible and sad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie opens in an unsymmorphous way.  It is a pretty slow plot and the film is so badly acted that it doesn't matter whether you like it or not. It's just an awful plot that is only there for being an oddball that could make it worth watching. The acting is pretty poor too, and it feels just as flakey as an angry zombie movie. The director tries to do something good with the horror element, and even tries to get some action in it. It ends up running for an hour and a half before getting bogged in its story.  The good thing about this movie is that it is not the worst horror film I have ever seen, but there is enough of it to make it an interesting waste of time. The rest of it is just a bad waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie through one of a number of online porn sites, and it was so bad that it actually was in fact filmed by some really insane person. My friends and I are still laughing about how the script is so bad! There are no other actors in this movie. The girl, the girl with the giant ass, and the girl in the bathroom, are absolutely horrid characters. The only person I can see in this film was the actress that played the part of the girl on the last installment of the series. There are few good parts in this crappy film, and no real action. I have to assume that they were a couple who had problems. The two lead actors were also bad in this. I don't even think they made the final movie. I'm a little sad. But if you are watching for the "wack factor" which is what we call the film's star attraction, you'll be sickened by this flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first read the synopsis for this movie, I was skeptical of it being a true sequel to the original "Kung the Huns", and I think now I just think it's a plot line. I don't want to read the book and think my opinion was correct... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie on Youtube, and I found it absolutely terrible. It's very disappointing. I tried to figure out a way to give it a decent rating, so I thought, "How can they possibly call it a film?" and they were good for a few years, so what else could they be? I decided to watch this one in theaters. It wasn't even worth that much.   The movie was not even interesting. There was only one good movie in the whole film. The whole movie was a disappointment, and it made me sad, for me. I just found it bad, and so bad that I never bothered to buy it again, but don't let me say that if it didn't kill off all the other parts of the plot, which were excellent.  My guess is that people are afraid of the film because of the fact that this is a horror film, not a horror movie, but just a shock movie that is just a bad attempt to fill a void.  I'm sorry, and just want to get my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is actually a remake of the late 1940 movie, "Citizensville House," which is a remake/re-imatrix of the original movie. This movie is only good for one thing, in the fact that you can't expect to see any of the characters' dialog, because there are too many of them, and I'm not sure if they are supposed to be the same people. In the original, the entire plot was based on the novel, but as far as I can see, they are completely different from the original by their own merits, and the plot is simply wrong. But the other problem is that even though it is a novel, the movie simply never gets that 'choseness' part of the book, and since there is not any actual plot, it is only pointless to even think about it, and therefore don't want to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be the worst movie ever! It was predictable, so bad and so bad that it never left your mind. I was the only one who gave it any hope to watch it, so I chose to sit through it. I give you some points about the movie: 1. It was about one woman (that) was supposed to be a person with a big family with lots of money, who made a lot of money. That person wasn't that person, it was about some of her relatives or some of the friends that live nearby. The guy that left her in the hospital was supposed be a man that she had known. 2. He didn't have a good job or career as a police officer, it wasn't like he had to become a cop and go into the movie business. 3. The scene where she is put into an ambulance, where she says it wasn`s a very high crime and where she went to in a movie room to meet a guy with a lot more money and wasn't able to hide from it. It wasn't really like a movie scene, it looked like a porn movie. 4. The way her doctor was dressed was stupid. You have to know that if you're the guy that runs a movie studio, it's not exactly the same thing in real life, where you dress your best, you go in a room and your clothes are put on your bed.   7. Some people have suggested that this is a horror movie. Some suggest that it's a comedy or action movie. I don't know about those things, but the way it is used is so bad it's hard to watch and feel anything else.  There is absolutely no excuse for a movie to be so bad. The only way to watch this movie is to look at it on its own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is so bad that it is scary.  The character that played the lead character in the film is actually dead.  Even when you look for the actor who is not actually dead, it is impossible to imagine that he could actually have been alive. The viewer should have at least seen the other films the "great" actors that were in the first movie, but did not.  What is also bad is the direction of this film. A woman who looks at a dead guy with a gun, you will find out that she's pregnant. When the police find her husband, it seems that he's not dead. You then find out what happened to him... what happens to her when he gets to the hospital and the first is not that he had no interest in her. It doesn't matter whether she is pregnant or not, you do the scene at all, the ending is all the same.  I think this movie should be called "the sequel of the original". I'm going to give it a 7. It was bad enough to be even worse than the original, the only good part being the beginning.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad but that is not an understatement.The characters had absolutely zero life experiences. The whole plot was incoherent and inconsistent. It is not a mystery. It does not make sense. It looks as though the actors could barely act. If you're looking to make a low budget movie about a good movie then look no further.  A simple way to say this is that if you like a character, you like the characters. If they are bad, you'll enjoy it.  If you liked the characters then you will get bored and you'll not get the enjoyment.  The acting was mediocre but the music wasn't bad but not too good. The music was not too bad but it was not good. If these people are good then they might be OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a great movie: you should check if you are looking for a horror movie from the late 1980's. It's bad and awful. I think that this film could have been a lot better than "Karm Man". This movie is just awful and very bad! There were some good shots, but that isn't going to work for me. I would like to give this a rating somewhere. That would be "Karma". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you get the movie, and don't like me, you will enjoy this, because it is very boring, with poor acting and very poor film editing. I'm sure I could be the only one in the movie who would comment that this movie is bad. I hope I'm correct. I want to be the first person to comment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is poor and it does not matter. Its supposed to be a horror film but it is very disappointing. When you get a movie and it is not scary or scary, then you tend to find yourself bored. The acting was laughable and the acting was not convincing. The plot is not bad as well. The violence is not terribly scary but the lack of violence makes the story less scary. It is also hard to believe that we got our money back so fast after the money was in the bank. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of arguments in this movie. The first thing that came out is that the director is a huge Hollywood buff. He has big budget, he always gets movies that make him laugh. "The American Way," which is a horror comedy about the 1960's, is about a family who is an odd family of a bunch of elderly men. The husband is a "bunch of old" men, and the wife has some gold on a dresser. The wife gets stabbed by a man who tries to break their house. A family gets killed and there's a bunch a horror movie that is even worse than "The Americans Way". The other important thing is that there's only a small number of old and unemployed citizens (with their dogs). "The Animal Lives!" is about animals, but it has some of the worst dialog that has ever been in a horror film. The best part of "The Animals Lives" was that the man was a dog, and he was a very loving dog. What the other animal of this movie does is that it's about a group of elderly people, who are also poor and unemployed. They decide to go to California, because they live there and want to live there. But California is a bad state, which has a lot more of the same people and the money is very expensive to fly there. The plot ends with everyone in California having some major problems that are dealt with by them. The main problem is that each person in California wants to get some money, and that they want the money so that they can take advantage of the money. However, they don't get their money because they have a big job to get, and it's because they're bored of taking it.  It's a sad, dull, un-serious film. Nothing comes out. There's just some scenes and there are no funny moments. Some of the humor is in the special effects of the movie, but that's all there is. The special effects that are supposed to scare people are bad, and don't matter much. I'm not sure that anyone would find anything funnier to watch. This movie is definitely not funny, and I think that people who saw this movie would be annoyed by it. The funny is mainly because there are a lot less funny jokes. You can't take it too long.  I've been looking at my copies of the film on the Internet and finding some of these jokes that are in it. This one had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Kung Fu" is an interesting film from the Japanese. However, after my first time seeing this film, it becomes an insult. I have to admit that I do not care if I ever watched this film and that I am one that watches all kinds of films. I am so used to watching film for movies that don't make any sense at all. I feel like these are not movies that are meant to be funny or even funny at all, and so I am sickened when the film is over.  I would have to give this a little more money if it was a Japanese film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to be able to comment on the story. I did not like it! I saw it on IMDb when this was released. I'm not sure if this was a TV station, but it was certainly not the kind of movie to use to sell a movie. It had not the plot, or story. Just a bunch of really stupid people, trying to fight a war that wasn't in fact going anywhere near that war.  There is no story and not much action! The actor I saw wasn't good enough to justify a lot of the acting. There were a lot more lines that could have been added. It's just a lot slower than the original! It's not even a good movie for the lowest of all. There is a good chance that the director of this movie is not a huge Hollywood talent, but someone who has been made that far from being a true talent. It just needs to go back to its roots! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a couple of good things in this film, and the rest of the film is just a disappointment, which doesn't help me at all, I really thought the film was going to have some good moments. But unfortunately, it was pretty boring and it was really difficult to watch. I found myself unable to follow the plot and try to connect what happened in the movie to what's happening on the Real World Network. I didn't understand how the story was supposed to have happened, and that's not enough for me to watch this movie.  Other parts of the movie were a little amusing, like the fake police officer's role as a criminal, and I laughed that he had a fake badge. And it's just a shame that he and the other characters didn't do a great job in the story. But the characters were totally bad, and this movie is a mess for anyone who likes watching sports on TV. I think this movie was made to have the lowest rating for any of the major sports on television in a decade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad, and the direction will probably be somewhat obvious and I don't think it's a film worth seeing. The story is good, but the plot is terrible. I donth wonder how the film was edited and made this awful! The film has plenty of sex scenes, but that does not explain what happened to the young couple. And what happened, they would get pregnant. There wasn't an easy time to find a movie that had a decent story line. There is a very shallow sex scene where there are no other sexual scenes at all, and you are left guessing if they are actually sexually active. I am curious, what was the point of this film? The best part is the sex scene.  There is no way the movie can make the point about what happened between the couple. No one's life is like that.  They have to take their own life, even if it is risky or uncomfortable, and there is no option for not trying something risky, as the filmmakers did. You have to make your own choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the usual horrible violence and then has a blood-red twist. The director is a total retard and this movie is just a bad sequel to a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has been put out without the usual flair and gore. I'm sorry I had to give it four stars because I didn't think they'd get one. It was a very bad film - just awful, not funny at all, not even a funny film, not the way this was supposed to be. I had been hoping they'd at least get a decent one, but it's got all the worst. The acting was pretty good, though they don't all of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been able to find this movie ever and now, after watching it with my family this evening, I still find it difficult to find. The first two minutes are wasted as if they are the most boring scenes ever. The dialogue is so bad I couldn't even begin to care. Also, the casting. Not all that good, I mean there's no real acting in this movie.   The second half is the best part about the movie. You are expecting to sit back and watch it and enjoy it, but instead, watch it again in order to end with a bad ending. I have to say, this is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. It made me cringe at the ending. If you're serious about watching this movie, stick it in the drawer, don't even rent it. Don't do that, but don't waste money on this movie as the ending is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film before, in a video store in Los Angeles. I'm a fan of some good music, like "Sugar Candy" by Bobby Pink in "Wang's Rock", but this was a waste of money, a complete waste of time. If you watch this film, please don't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad and it's really hard to watch. It's basically a very bad film that has absolutely no good quality whatsoever. Also, I've heard that one of the actors are good friends with Sean Connery and he never really seemed to be in love with the people that made this film.  So I really hope this movie would get canceled at least one time, and that this movie has not gotten any money out of it.  I've to say that this sequel really needs to be canceled, not just for the sake of "fun" or some ridiculous stunts or stunts, but because it is SO bad! I don't think this movie was made to be a film to be remembered, but it was made as if it were a film for a reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I found out about this movie, I was so disappointed. I couldn't even watch it because I thought the show would be an important piece of work. However, I still liked the movie because the characters are believable, the direction was good, and the movie seemed like it would be a great film. Unfortunately, the show isn't even the film it once was, it's a copy of one of a bad piece of film: I'd only recommend watching the video of the show in the movie's original release and that is all I know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, I really did like because it has a VERY BAD opening. For one thing, it's not as good as the other movies that this one has to be the worst movies ever produced to that date. This is probably the worst film that I have seen in my life. In the last part of this movie, we go to "holling in the house and go under the hood of the lady in the town.  Now, we decide to leave and go to stay a little longer, and the lady told us the house is going to be closed down and that she's gonna lock us out.  The only thing that happened in the movie was when we went there, because that's what that movie does. After leaving there, the lady says that it was going to stay closed, and then we get into the elevator with our friend to go home. Once we get to our house, the girl says she'll stay there and we just walk away. After going home, we try to leave our house to go to the other house, but they don't let us in because they know what we'll do. The next day we find that the woman there in the shop was there. They let us out and the house we're in.  What this movie does was something that is simply a horrible, pointless piece of work. I don't know why it was that bad. It was stupid, I don 't even think. It's just stupid. You know, it was never to be that good. This movie is stupid, because it could have been so easily made by someone who knows how to make a good movie. You just can't believe the other people who made it. They made it so bad it had an ending, and I was afraid it would not stick around. The ending was so lame, and there was no emotion whatsoever. The only positive about the movie is the part where it starts off with a really good part. But that's too bad to be honest. This film is just kind of horrible to watch, and it's stupid and stupid. I can't understand how someone would think of a good film. It would be very easy to make an even worse movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe the producer was even remotely able to bring this movie to the screen. There was a couple of good things in the movie, most of the scenes were funny, but that's about it. I have a few thoughts: 1) The main character (Bryan's son, or so I've been informed) is a child and this kid is actually his dad. The kid isn't really a typical boy, but he's pretty good looking. I've noticed that the kid is really nice, but I can tell he's not a typical kid. 2) The kid plays his father, a little more childish. He can't act like his dad and he doesn't act "funny" like his father. This is also the case with the kid's girlfriend. The girlfriend's brother is obviously a pretty stupid kid, but she's good looking and he's cute. 3) The movie makers seem to want to be funny but it's not funny. The film starts off with a silly, one dimensional scene of a couple's breakup. Then the next scene is a kid's birthday party which, apparently, turns into a murder.  The only decent aspect of this movie is a brief scene in which the mom plays with the kids. This movie doesn't do any comedy for even one minute. 2 and 3. What was the purpose of the movie's creation? The guy in the house? Who? Who!? The guy, I'm not sure, has to be the lead actor (this would be the case if he was the lead, too, because it looks like he's all of one good person in this movie). He plays with his parents, but who's the lead? The lead? How would he and the two friends he's just so bored with? The fact that he's getting away with his girlfriend and it causes a lot of awkward, pointless drama and pointless drama throughout the movie.   As I said, my best friend, a friend of mine I never had the opportunity to really get to know, I always knew him from one or two years ago, and he has since gotten to know the girl, her dad, her mother, and the other guy who I think is playing with her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so dull and boring and I never got tired of it. The only thing I got enjoyment out of was the 'Bumblebee' and 'Bubble' - though this is just the beginning. And there's still a mystery to be solved. The 'Boom' and the 'Beet' are actually good. But they are just two of three of the three. So, when the story moves back to the city of Bumblebee, we never find out about the two main characters, and we don't know who they are - or why they are getting together for this adventure. And so we just watch them work their way through a maze of death scenes. They get together and we get tired of this. The movie has nothing to do with anything - it has nothing even to do - except make them laugh - because it isn't funny! It also doesn't make a good movie for an American film club, though it could get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not very bad for what it was, but this is still a bad "Giantes" movie. It's basically an "Bachelor's Guild" type movie about a guy who gets involved in some shenanigans with a bunch of other guys. There's nothing interesting and no plot whatsoever. I'm not going to sit on a couch watching this but if I were, I'd just start cleaning my couch because I have had just about 5 minutes left, and it could probably be salvaged. I don't know why this movie is so bad, but the guy on the other side was definitely an idiot. It looked and felt like he was in an action movie, and there was some really good action scenes, but when it got old it could become boring and not fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An overblown horror film. I have seen this movie before and will never forget the movie. And the name "HOMOLOW" is so strange that you are expecting to hear a positive review about it. This movie is not worth a plot. It's not even a movie. It really a slasher horror movie. There are three "Homes" that are so awful and awful. And there's nothing even good about them.  It's like a movie that's bad for the name. You just want to know how to survive one of the worse movies ever made.  If you have a good movie: a good ending! But if you go see it for the final time, you will never get any closure. The movie was bad and terrible for all. If you think the movie was good, you can say it was good for the time. But if it was bad, there is not a movie at all.  Don't waste your time trying to get a positive movie out of a bad film: Avoid HOMOLOOW. Don't even rent it and watch it. That is how it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this, I laughed. It is not worth anyone's time. This is just a "ridiculous" movie to me. A simple premise of a woman giving birth to a baby baby is completely preposterous. It's so awful it hurts my heart to watch. And even if you do like this film it is only OK if you are pregnant or just want to have a baby. This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever and no good reason to spend money on a DVD. It looks as though the director was desperate to have some sort of "legacy" to this movie. There was some talk about "selling the DVD" but it seemed to be out of their minds. The DVD release has only been a mild success because it's not even as good as the original DVD. I wouldn't be very surprised if the Blu-ray version is only available. I've seen some pretty poor films, and I thought this was bad, but this movie is worse than the last one.  I'd be interested to see how this movie has developed over the last few years. It seems like it was a huge success to get all the "junk" out of this, but I suspect the film was never intended to be a film. As a result, the film's not worth the money. There is no redeemable value to this stupid movie. The other problem I have with this movie, is that there was never really supposed to be any plot. It actually is a really short, rather light film, and the acting is okay but not good. I don't really think the director has any real ambition to be great at making it, but it just shows how terrible it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be the worst horror film ever made. It is just bad, it doesn't deserve its reputation. It fails as a horror film and fails to scare the viewer.  I give this movie one 10 stars, it is bad at all. I don't think the cast will ever scare anyone. It's just a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few funny moments, but otherwise the plot is not strong enough to justify an average rating of 7. The dialogue is extremely corny, and the plot becomes a distraction from a movie which could be good, but is certainly not funny. In addition, the cast has the appearance of a child actor.  The ending was not funny, and it does not make any sense whatsoever. The ending may have been a mix of a plot twist, and a plot device for a comedy, but I was hoping to get some funny ending and a good movie.  Some people, like me, enjoy movies like "Kung Lo Ma Lo" but just can't stand too much. I don't think any director of this movie will have to change anything about the rest of the movie, though the movie could be saved by a funny ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this film on VHS at midnight last night, and thought it was very bad. If you like gore movies, you will like this bad movie. But this is not to be taken seriously, because this is an honest film that has been made by inexperienced filmmakers that cannot get any of the real actors. That's why you don't see these actors and actresses who were very good in their respective careers. This is what you expect, and nothing else.  This movie is nothing more than a pathetic horror film. It is hard to watch if you are tired of the whole series. It's just plain awful. The acting is so bad. And the gore is very poor. This movie needs to be deleted right away, and not only in publicity, but also by Hollywood studio execs.  The good thing about this movie is that I think it's a very good way to look at horror, but its bad for art. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sequel to the original series. They make it worse. You will not see yourself. Don't be surprised if you watch this one. You should never be surprised. There's an interesting story line. But not much of it. The plot is unbelievable. It's not surprising to know what's going on. And the actors aren't good enough for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting some good movie for this bad movie, but there are few scenes that is interesting. I was so bored with these scenes that I thought it was a joke. I didn't care what I thought about this movie. It's not funny at all. Its not funny, and there are no funny lines at all except 1 in 3. This movie is like a soap opera and a bad soap opera. It would be funny if it was funny but it doesn't make any sense. I give this movie 4 out 10 stars and I was embarrassed for watching it. I'm sure the writer had some great ideas about how to make this movie better, but they were not well put together.  If you are looking for a bad drama, don't waste your time looking for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what you'll find if you're ever to watch a movie that does not end in an even 1st frame. It's pretty hard to see if the movie makes any sense at all. As I say, this is a movie of two or three people. It would be an appropriate title for a horror movie, but it really isn't. It doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this when I finally saw this. I was surprised. It's a bunch of sex toys that get in the end of the movie so people will think it's OK. This is the worst movie EVER. I give it a 1/10 rating based on how horrible it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to see something with great potential. This was the most disappointing film I've ever seen in my life. There are some good moments here, like the one with the female lead, but otherwise this movie is an absolute failure. I was hoping for something that was entertaining, but this film just couldn't keep pace. I really wanted to have more fun, and I gave the viewer the impression that this is not going anywhere. This is no longer a film! It's time for another reboot! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie for weeks, and only watched it once (because I only want to like it) and so it just became boring. I did find a positive review about the movie. But I think this movie would be just one dimensional rather than being a good movie. So I'm not going to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am one of the people that was in this movie. They really didn't want to be in this. I really liked it for the one time they went to a country park for their hike or something else. But now I think they would want to become a soldier and fight in an army and get into the real world but this movie sucked the fun out of it. There was no good scenes of real life and no good stories. I mean it seemed as though the movie had just been to get the reviews to review. It was really embarrassing and disappointing! I hope that the movie doesn't get released. I don't really like the movie, but I thought it was so bad that it looked like it was an effort at trying to create funny stories and movies. This movie just was not funny. It just didn't go for you in a funny way and it really just had nothing to go for this movie in a way. I didn't know who had the idea to make this movie, I really thought it would have been better if it had been released to some people. This was bad for a whole time. I think it would be good if it got to see the end of the movie and then made a sequel. I just think that it should be released and then make a sequel to this terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watched this movie, I was concerned that it was so bad, that it had to be considered as an artistic masterpiece, so I was a bit skeptical. But, I also knew that there were some decent points. There were some good jokes (the one about the black person was funny!) and the most horrible part of the movie is when the female ghost appears and starts to take over your head. I think it's a bad remake of a bad horror movie, and if you're looking for a horror movie that could be a comedy, you'll most likely be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just started watching this movie in the beginning and this review was awful. After it finished I was very depressed. I'm not going to comment on this movie so I just wanted to share the details. The acting is the worst I've seen in my life. I mean I don't think anyone could get this movie into its own and I think that's the reason why people don't see it. There were two different versions of the movie. One was a straight forward movie with no special effects and one was a crazy film which I thought was funny. The one I liked was the one where it had a special effects effect on a character. The others were all completely different from each other. The other one was even a parody, just like a parody. It didn't even get the name of it, it was just like the one parody. I think they could be better like this parody movie which I guess was similar to a parody of a parody cartoon like a Super Smokes movie from Duck & Duck, like the Muddy Duck! Where do you think they are? I guess that is an answer you can't guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sitting in this theatre, watching this movie on the video. I'm really really just trying to see what happens to the characters. If they weren't all, I would really feel like watching a movie that had nothing to me. So this movie doesn't even give any meaning to my life. This movie is just about the worst in my life; I can't even stand for this movie to be remembered. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of my other films I gave it a rating of 3/10 but it looks like it was rated more like a 3/5. The story is terrible as the film starts with a pre-school teacher's life being depicted as the protagonist, and then the next part goes about the school counselor's life. The characters that are portrayed in the film are pretty cute, but they seem to be a bit bland and stereotypical of a male film. The acting is fairly weak, and it seems to be aimed at a young audience. Overall the film is a total bore, and there are no good references to the life of the character that is depicted in it. Overall if you want to waste some time on this, the best way to avoid it is the first time you rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've come to say this film is stupid, really stupid. It is so bad that it can't even be counted as a film to be taken seriously. I mean really, really bad. The whole film is bad and I feel like I have to call it something for this film to make the point. I don't feel like it's meant to be a film; the whole film seems to be just a few minutes of mindless torture. I wish it to die, and I hope it to go the way that all of the other movies made at the time. The main plot of the film is pretty stupid and pointless. There are no real action sequences. No real special effects or effects. The ending doesn't seem like it and I don' even get the feeling of a victory. A few other reviewers might make the film a better film; it could be better like "The Oint, The Vixen", the original of "Dare Bear", or even the original "Busted Ass" because the characters are different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Invented in the mid-90's with a cult movie, the film started to get the worst of the best cult films of all time. A major problem for any cult film is that they can't come up with new plots every time the writer has gotten bored and told the other plot. Some cult films are great, like The Looney Kong franchise or Jackpot's series. These films were well written but not made to stick with the plot, and sometimes they were good. But with The Omen, this film was about being a big action film, not about a cult film. Even when there was a "scramble" with a young hero with his mentor, it still fell apart. Even more bad was when the character turned into a monster and started attacking people with the same power and speed of a dragon. This movie is no way to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one-taste-of-a-half film is, to be sure, a poor comparison to the very good (and good) The Dark Knight of Death. The story takes place during an evil period of world's history, and the plot seems to be an excuse for an ending.  I guess I can't see how this film was supposed to appeal to anyone. It was bad, and there were few parts that had anything interesting to say.  But let's get a positive review about this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of the film, but I can only recommend a bad ending, that is not a Hollywood ending. I understand that it's a movie, but there were parts I wouldn't expect a better ending. It's boring and disappointing. I can't even imagine why this one won over 10% of the vote, and I can barely stand the camera. The fact that I'm still watching it makes me sick and desperate to even watch it.  Don't watch this movie if your budget is too high, or even if you're interested in it for a horror movie, even if it's not for the same reasons. Also, if you just like to watch other horror movies, don't watch it, but watch it for other reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was bad as soon as I saw it. There are probably a few nice moments and the story is OK. But as an hourglass for this film, I was just sick of this film. It really took away from the plot, the characters, and the acting. There were about three of the actors that played roles in the film. I wish I had seen it with my sister. I think the movie was so bad because it was so poorly put together. There is a slight improvement in some of the story moments, but there was too many plot points that I couldn't even get into. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had an hour and half in the first hour. I'd like to say this movie was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. There was no dialogue, no continuity, no plot, no idea, no direction, no action, no fun, no laughter, no cool moments, no suspense, no good dialog, and no interesting, realistic, interesting or funny person. I was thinking how I'd react to the "good" movie and that's what I expected. But when I got to the part where a person was dead, it was all about being sad about it and getting sad about how it had turned out, it turned out that there was nothing funny. I just laughed. I laughed. And the "Good" guy had a funny way of dealing with the whole situation, just a couple of words that he couldn't quite figure out.  All of these scenes were the worst I've ever seen, not even being used to a laugh, although the characters were fine. Some of the dialog was a little good and I'd recommend it. But the rest was a very poor, uninspired, badly scripted movie. This movie didn't do anything interesting at all, and the movie didn´t even allow the actors to really have any fun. And although it was very good, it left you feeling so sad to have nothing to enjoy, and it left me in such a state that I was literally thrown out of the movie. If you´re interested in this movie, try it for a few minutes only. If this movie doesn´t help, you can watch the two movies it made more than 20 years later, the movie called "The People", and they´s a pretty good movie.  I´m not sure what happened here, and I´d wonder if this person is even alive anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to be so depressed. The movie had good parts, though I don't think this particular actor had any acting or acting abilities. I found myself wondering why a male actor would be in this movie. It would be so easy to find an acting-star on this movie for me. I feel like the entire thing could be a really bad movie. The acting is so bad! It would've been better to use some decent actors to do the film. The ending is so disappointing. The story was so stupid. I think this movie should never go out of print. I highly doubt it was intended to be a comedy. It is absolutely pointless and it does not make the world go down. I was so frustrated that there's no end. This movie is so predictable and there are so many wrong turns.  There are many small parts, but the whole movie is a lot of awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. I'm not a movie fanatic, but my brother and I have seen it many times, and if I had to go to the theater, I wouldn't take my money for a ticket. I'd like to see the movie, but I'm sick to my eyes.  If you enjoy horror films, you'll like this movie. If you hate horror movies, you won't like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "In another version this movie is really scary. It is really not scary at all, I really don't want to see the whole town being attacked by the mob... it really seems to be a bit of a shock. I mean it's a very low-budget movie with the exception of the great performance of the other actors.  In some parts of the film, the character of Dr. Oliver Wrigley is somewhat cartoonish, and I understand the idea behind the movie, but it's pretty disappointing. The story itself isn't anything interesting, there is nothing to find out. The character of Oliver Wernley is a real jerk, he has a long time-hype and has no interest in this movie. He is a major distraction because the movie revolves around him. The other important thing is that the whole idea of the "Ghost Bride" is just plain ridiculous. I don't know what kind of a person he is or if he really is a ghost. I honestly don't think that a ghost is being trapped by the "ghost bride" but I can't say if he is really in an extremely human form. There is absolutely no connection between the characters and the actual ghost of the Ghost Bride. There aren't even the people who were in the film because they made a vow and said they were ghosts. The "ghost wife" is apparently dead, so there is no connection of them to the characters in the movie. What happens with the story is that a girl's life force is weak and is not enough to make a ghost ghost's life spirit so powerful? I don' see how the girls in the end is more dangerous than the girls of the original story!  A pity, the entire series of the show is just as bad as the original. What is it about? Some of the movies are entertaining but most movies aren't.  It is only bad for the fans of the characters of the series. What you would expect would be in the original series?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i can tell you this. i had to watch the other three movies in the same way i did. this is the same in all, except in the other two i wasn't sure i was going to like any of them. the first was good, the third was very bad. I've watched this movie in a few days and it doesn't help your eyes to even begin. i don't know how the hell it could have been made but i guess you are already thinking about it because you have been stuck in the last 4 movies.  this movie had me really stuck in my seat. there was nothing to like it, and there is nothing to do to begin with. it had a good chance to get to the third act, but instead you just stuck in your seat. the worst thing is seeing my girlfriend having sex with the other guy, and then she goes off to have sex with him. she is really hot, that chick is really gorgeous, and she wants to sleep with me, and that is good, too. but the guy is not the sexual offender. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad horror film that just didn't work for me. I have had nothing good to say about it. There are quite a lot of jokes that go too far, there is no gore and no horror, and no real suspense. If you are interested in an interesting horror film and find some good horror movies, that's what you should watch. In this one I found it very bad for me, and I will never watch it again, nor will I encourage you to buy it. I don't like horror films that make no effort to make it scary. My goal is to try to teach you how to enjoy movies that don't kill you. If that's not enough, watch the "Hobbits" movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to be bored by this. But I really wasn't. It was predictable, there were no real surprises, and not even the name "Lily" was worth mentioning. I think the movie was designed to be predictable, and even that didn't work. It's basically a "chosenkey" movie. It just ended with two scenes after one hour and then nothing about the next two hours. The idea had an attempt at some really good movie-making, but it didn't last. There was no substance at all. It could be better than the films it was in.  I know it could have been better. The soundtrack was a little bit better than I thought. The acting was pretty good, but the acting was bad. I didn't even think there were any plotlines. It really sucked me out, and I think that it ruined the movie for me. It sucked the film of one movie, but was even worse than the TV series it was supposed to be. I have no idea what this movie was about, but I think it was an attempt to take a simple movie and make it a story. It couldn't take a story seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have nothing else to do with this movie, then the other movies that are similar may work. Some of the people who tried this movie were actually very good actors, so what's it that this movie is about? I hope it's a satire about bad movies that take the movie seriously and try to make them even more interesting than the others. I didn't like this movie at all. I don't know why it was made so bad to be a comedy movie. I mean, I guess it was kinda funny to make a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this bad movie 1.5 out of 10. I wish it would go to the top of the 10. It is a poorly written, half-witted, half, half gross film. If I were to give it a high rating for the first time I would give it 1.2 out of ten. It could be one of the worst movies ever made, as I said, but this is only 1.1 out of five.  If you watch it and decide to watch it again, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first time that I've seen that this has been done. The plot is so bad that it must be a horror movie, which I don't believe any people can think is funny or funny. I'm sure even though some people knew that it was coming in one of their other horror movie series and thought it might be a funny thing, this is still horrible. What an actor is able to do when he has an actor with real, human, emotions, and that acting is so poor as a horror director? I guess it's like a bad "Carnax's Crawl, where it has to be an action film like 'Life Story.' "   The acting is bad, and the story is so weak that you could barely even hear it. Some of the characters are so weak in the script they are acting with the characters like a kid with a broken leg. I just wonder why they actually care so much. If you see this movie in a theater or even watch it online, you'll realize how awful it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie on two days. It is absolutely terrible. A few things were interesting, like the fact that I was never that young nor that my family is not in the film. It was interesting that the film was made by one of the most ridiculous directors of all time. It wasn't funny. It sucked. The ending was just silly, especially for what happened at the end. It also sucked for the story and character development of the other parts of the film - they were pretty stupid and there wasn't a lot of dialog. The whole movie made no real sense. There was no good dialog in the other three parts of it. I know it would make good comedy, but this has to be the worst comedy ever made. I have watched this film several times but I couldn't really care if anyone will allow me to rent it again. It had an interesting and entertaining look, but it really should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As for those who do not care for such a weak attempt at comedy, this is a weak comedy which is somewhat lacking in terms of the characters and their behavior. But still, it has some good laughs, especially when the whole family is going to sleep. This is bad in itself, but when we watch the whole group get all drunk, there is something there that seems oddly interesting to the viewer. But this is also too bad for the characters. They are not even good enough for comedy, but we would definitely prefer a little comedy from this movie to help the story. They would be better if they could act together.  This movie has to be the worst film I have ever seen. If you are a comedy fan, I would recommend avoiding this movie, but if you want to see a comedy, try it somewhere else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have any idea why the producers had to put this movie off. What can I say? I didn't care for a film to be anything other than just a bit of fun. However, I did know the plot. I'm not a fan of films like this or that kind of movie. I donut I'd have a great time seeing someone playing in this crap. But I won't have to watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this movie was advertised as an "classic, classic, classic" film, it's really a weak, and poorly acted. This movie contains no dialog. It's a bad film for anyone who actually likes films.  It contains an incredibly boring ending sequence that just shows what a plot is, without the slightest indication of how to make this into a film. There are also a few of the actors in this movie who did well in previous films; I thought, for example, John Candy, the other main character, who played the main character (John Candy) seemed more competent than a character with his mind intact. It also contains some very low acting. This has been the case of the film for the last 40 years, but it was also quite enjoyable to watch as such an attempt. In short, this movie will never win any awards. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got tired watching this flick because it was so poorly done. I really liked the original, but this movie made me hate it. I think this movie should have been scrapped because it wasn't well thought. I thought the cast was good, I think the actors were good, and the acting was decent, but I still have issues about this movie because the acting is terrible and the dialog is weak. The movie really falls apart at the end.  There is not one good scene in this film. The only highlight is the ending of the movie. What this film really is is is really is a comedy, and a rip off of a bad comedy that could never be saved by a second director. I don't know why the person directing this movie thinks that he needs to change his work to make this movie better, he needs a great director to rescue this movie, but he clearly has not done this. He should not have been directing this film, and he should not give up his job to make a great movie like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this movie to be some kind of cheesy horror flick about a group of murderous thugs, and that it would be scary. I was pleasantly surprised to see it actually being cheesy. But after watching it, I was more skeptical about the premise. I'm not so sure that the film could be funny, even though it does include a decent character, and a handful of good jokes. But the movie still just doesn't have any substance, even if you have a bit of an eye for horror. The story is so unbelievable that I can't even find a way to relate it to anything. As for me, it's supposed to be a sequel to another film (I'm not even sure about that), and I'm sure it has a sequel of its own. But I'm a real horror buff, so I don't have to watch any other films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's a very poor remake of the original. It starts off with something I think could have been an original that was an original in the original, which I think was a funny. It gets progressively worse and then I don't know who it's supposed to be. The acting was bad at all.  I didn't really mind it, but what caused me to want to rent it was when the other actor in the same movie was actually the better one. I could not believe he said something decent in the film. What happened in the movie was that a couple of the other actors in the other movie were really good. They were both competent. I did not find this movie as a "funny" comedy. I was surprised that the director was involved in the writing and directing of the script. I didn a slight impression that this was a "dumb joke" but it had its own style. I hope I can get some good reviews about the original version, as it was better than the film and its remake. I won't get into this film much longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a 7. I have seen several reviews of this film, and this one stands out as the worst I've ever seen. The actors are terrible and the action is bad, but what makes the film so depressing is the lack of humor and the lack effect of the characters. The only funny element in the film was the one that had a little more humor than usual.  There is also a lack of the old humor in the movie, and the acting is just plain awful. I don't recommend this bad film at all, but I'm not sure what it was about this movie anyway. I know it was made as a mockery of the film industry because there were plenty of people who saw it as a satire, and it could have been turned into a comedy. I just want the movie to get back into its own vein.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't understand why this is considered the best horror movie ever made, but it definitely got off to an annoying start. The plot is predictable, and the ending is the weakest in the movie. Most of the characters were extremely over-the-top and stupid. Some of the acting is very bad, and it's difficult to care for a movie with characters that are completely stupid. The acting is not good, and some of the actors are just plain bad, like a former actor who has just recently been arrested for robbery. You just want to avoid the horror movie, but the other point of this movie is that it's an ugly piece of trash. If you see this movie in the bargain line, then you'd be wasting your money and not have a great time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate to say this movie is bad.  There are a few decent lines but the acting was horrible. It was annoying and I didn't care. It got stuck in my mind.  The plot was okay but the storyline and story were totally pointless. There is a scene after the movie where the heroine is in a taxi with the driver. The scene is supposed to be a flashback of the hero's girlfriend and his lady that is seen in a movie. They talk to her about making a movie about her husband who has cheated on her and has a lot of money and has cheated in the lottery.  I find it hard to believe that this is a story and not an "true story". If I was a guy, I would have laughed at this movie. This movie should not even be taken seriously as it was a major hit in 2005.   The movie was so bad that it won the worst awards ever. It should never be taken again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with an ugly scene which is quickly followed by some gratuitous violence and then the story begins to lose its momentum. By the end of the movie the story has gotten very predictable and predictable and there is little else to say about the plot. The plot is fairly predictable, but a few things are missing.    This is a very bad film! It's really not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some interesting elements like the main characters who are so stupid. The people who are responsible for all this, the people who make this movie, and the person who runs it, all come to their fate together. This movie was really terrible! It was also kinda funny! I don't know how this movie could've been made. I mean, there are some pretty funny people in this film so that's not a bad thing. But i have to say, the movie is not about a movie at all, it is about a person with a lot of money who is a loser who lives in their basement. I can tell you that, this is a totally weird film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie through a local newspaper and was flopping around. Although I liked it, it was an insult to the whole thing. If I could find no decent film that had just a few good lines in it, I would give this one a 4 out 10. And, by the way, it's a very poor choice in terms of acting. I found it very bad. All the actors did a little bit decent, but most of them were not very convincing. And the acting is OK, but no one ever looked good. It wasn't a movie for anyone to watch. There are other ways to judge it. I find the movie somewhat reminiscent of "Honey" and even some of the casting. In short, the director didn't really know how to act. I wouldn't recommend this movie if you liked that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is about 2 minutes longer than some of the older films, but I don't really think any one could sit for another 2-hour film. The acting seems a bit corny, the acting is bad, the plot and premise is lacking, the story is weak, the special effects and graphics aren't good, the animation is bad and the effects are bad.  I give the worst rating here to the movie because it is so bad to the point where I would want it to be shown on screen or even get taped up. It doesn't do anything good for the time, and I have nothing for show when it comes to being shown on a video tape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of great films, so let me just watch those films. There's the film that is a remake of the original 'Madrigal.' One of the funniest films I've seen in a few years. Not only did I have to endure two people standing up and yelling "Overtime! Overtime!" - with one person holding a mirror - but there's not much to this. Also, there's a very bad script. There are some funny bits, like 'Where did you go?' (which I found hilarious), and some of the dialog is really bad. There also seems to be a shortage of 'Cabana.' Even the 'Cin-e' scenes are fairly funny. What is wrong with the script? The director, John Dickson, seems to think that he's going to be an 'courage' at the end. Why does he not believe that a man who had been convicted of murder, has a sense of shame?  I find the only redeeming thing in this film was 'Rang' in the movie. But 'Cara' does not have any redeeming attributes. It's sad, stupid, and stupid, which really is all there is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An awful piece of work I have ever seen, not one that I can recommend to anyone. Its a piece of nonsense.  There are a few good parts. Some actors and some good direction but overall this film is bad. Its bad because it tries to draw some deep meaning out of a movie that isn't.  My point of reference was the actors. They were good actors but the way they spoke was so bad. The camera was OK though they weren't really acting, just the acting was better. But what makes this movie awful is the lack of any plot. It is so poor that it doesn't hold the viewer's attention and it is such a poorly structured that it drags on the viewer to just plain stop. The plot is poor and there are little bits of dialog that just won't give the film any credibility.  The whole movie feels like a little kid's movie. There are too many flashbacks and too many characters that get killed and get away from the movie so that the whole plot gets so screwed up. There were some funny moments. But this film really isn't a good horror film at all.  It needs to be at least 6 times longer. I think that it's about 60 minutes long. I know some of my critics have said that the film had a good storyline. But, that wasn't the point. A lot of horror is so much better than this movie, but I think what the writer has done here is simply a failure.  I think it would have been great to have the story of a murder that got stuck off the wall. Then the story would have ended and the viewer would have understood the story and what had come before it was a good story.   This movie needs to stop. It needs redemption. It's just so bad in it's worst aspect, that no story would appeal to anyone, in any circumstance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't even say the same thing about it as it's an idea: It is just a complete lack of interest, which is a bit surprising when you hear it so out in the context of a film: It really sucked me out in some spots, but what with it, it was too weak to keep up with the time. You can see something going on with the film if you get really into it, but it's a pretty simple affair - the way it looks is totally meaningless, there are no real action sequences, the acting is bad, and the writing is bad. I think it's just a weak, but not bad, because it doesn't go anywhere. The director obviously needs to make it so far into his movie that it's less boring to see it, and I hope he has done it by now, but I don't know if it's finished or if he ever made it. The way the story is structured is just pointless - the end is too long, it is hard to follow through and the characters are all too long to keep at 100 minutes. It's really not enjoyable to watch.  Overall, my biggest problem is the story itself - the idea that the director wants to create a sequel to a movie that was originally supposed to have a sequel, and then he made another sequel that wasn't that much.   The director says that he would like to go on to work on a sequel but if he makes it, the plot is not worth to him. I wonder why he is getting involved with it in the end, when the plot actually wasn't original enough to be original, but he is obviously enjoying his work on the film - just like the music, a lot of which is quite good. The film isn't that bad, but if you can take the pace of the film and not listen to all of it, you might get bored, which can be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As one of the most disappointing of the first night of the New York premiere season, this movie fails to stick to it's true intentions. In addition to the usual "b-tasts", we have, as always, just the same standard-collected B-tastes, only in the morning. The result is a complete lack of entertainment.  There are no story development, no dramatic and no suspense to be found. The whole film is just a "drama", it's a plotless, it's un-watched, it doesn't make any sense. And in a nutshell, it just leaves everyone looking at the camera and wondering why this movie is being so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen many times people cite "Bridging the movie" in the comments on other IMDb postings. I find this movie to be boring, and it does nothing to save the life of a younger viewer. There is no plot, characters, characters and acting, all the elements needed for a film are so badly wrong that the film never works. I found this movie so bad that I was willing to rent it again and even the first time around was way too dull. There are no scenes, no scenes with a story, no characters, no actors. I will have to rent the sequel or look at the sequel to get me out of the awful movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have to be very careful with this one. I mean, it isn't a "Bunch Of Cuts", but it is still a movie that isn't worth paying attention to. There are quite a few scenes that break the whole immersion, the story doesn't come to the end, the plot is extremely lacking, the dialogue is awful and the overall performance doesn't make much of the film, let alone the "females" (not much, mind?). The worst part is obviously the acting, but even if it wasn't funny enough, there are a few funny moments.  If you really want to see the story, then there is no way to watch this without the whole movie. If you want to watch "Bunggs" then you should do so from a safe place and don't have to risk getting this "movie" into the middle of the pool.  This movie is a complete disappointment for anyone who didn't like a bunk or two. There is no telling you what's in store. It is all for you and your money. Avoid it and avoid it if you have nothing to do with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. They are very fake, no plot, and they are just a bunch of actors. Very bad. i have to agree that this movie was not as bad as the other "Tale of Tears" movies. They were very fake and were obviously bad. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was in shock the first time I watched this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this film. I've heard it before and said it is awful, it is scary and not even funny.  I would never watch it again. My life has been that same. There are no laughing matter in this. My brother loves it, but I can't tell if he is a fan of it or not. This is a lost film and I hope to see the original one again, because if you go to see this film it will be a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea that it could be a comedy was an interesting thing. I just got bored and started watching it and ended up being really annoyed. I'd like to see something with some good jokes and not something with a very slow-moving plot and no real connection to the other side. I couldn't be bothered by the direction at all. I think there is a huge amount of effort that went into making this film. Also, there are too many jokes. The characters themselves were also a big part of the movie. I really wish they could have put a little effort into making a good film. Maybe I didn't even think about it for much of the time, but I'm still looking for it. I am not sure how this could be dubbed a film worth watching, but it just was never funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie and it is not very good. I was surprised that there was an Oscar for this film because it was very uninterested and there was no money to go in to make it, though it was entertaining at times, but the film was badly flawed. The movie started out as an attempt to appeal to the younger audience that would appreciate a movie that is not actually funny. It was the same kind of movie as the Disney film, except it was far too grim to be funny, and the dialog was really sad. If you go to the movie on its own, it is only a bad attempt at comedy, and it might actually be better than the Disney movie. I am not a fan of a comedy, but this movie is so bad, and this is no way to start off having a sense of humor or being able to move on with the other world. If the movie is not really good, then I'll have to see the Disney sequel, Frozen, or even Disney's sequel, 'Sausendia.' Otherwise, it doesn't take much longer than a few months to get all the way through. The DVD will probably be better suited for a home movie than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about nothing but a bunch of weird teenagers who like to watch stupid films on their computer. The plot is totally lacking, but the characters are interesting to see. I don't know why anyone was ever to pay attention to this film. The acting is bad, and I believe that most of the acting is simply bad. This movie needs to be turned into a comedy, and this film should never have been rated 7 or 10. It is a poor choice for anyone who has seen it, and if you are in love with the main character, I recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not really worth a rating but the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean it's just a little bit of trash that hasn't really risen to its high-scored heights, and a lot of it just has a lot to show no one who can really take care of people. I also don't like it when they're trying to make it look like an American film, especially when it's so ridiculously over-the-top, especially in a scene when a group of people are playing some silly game about what a good movie looks like. The best part of the movie, the ones I've seen in my life, was when they were trying to recreate America, when they started trying to dress up like real Americans, when I knew what the real country was. But this movie is just terrible. The worst part is when the characters are making movies, and the characters (mainly the film's lead actor-Mihiro Koshiro and Kazuo Wakahara) have very little regard for the movie's director and are acting like a bunch of idiot, acting like it's in some Hollywood special-instructions. Even if the characters don't act like idiots, this movie fails to be funny or interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was never intended to be a film. It never had any relevance to the plot. I was also surprised that it was so slow at some parts. Also, I am annoyed that I thought the characters in the film are so terrible - I thought that I would never really liked them. I really did enjoy the scenes with the three guys from England. But they did not work together - just so lame. You can never enjoy such a character. And there is a glaring lack of a clear theme of love. I can't even get what the filmmakers were going with - just how they got together? What was the point of their marriage? What they were going together? Just how crazy it was to keep them married? How did the lead actor get the job? Who were they? How much did they want? What were they saying? The funny side is that the lead character, while acting in this movie, says he doesn't want to "get along". I thought he didn't want a family; he is alone, so he lives alone. So I guess the point is, that although I liked the characters, the "me" scenes never seemed to be interesting and interesting. It seemed to just be a bit of a filler, in a desperate, desperate situation. The film just seemed to end. The lead actor is very, very bad. He is very bad - he was just trying to make a lot of money for a movie he could get away from. I just had to end it. I did not care for it, and I don't think the lead is a strong actor - but it's just too hard to take. It just doesn't work for me. This is just a complete lack of anything. It was boring, so bad that I found myself waiting for the film to finish. I donned myself more money for the sequel, "I.B.S.I.E." - and there are just some nice moments, and the story itself was interesting. But it just had no idea what the film was going to be. I think it was just a kind of a waste of money, even though I didn't get the chance to see it on the big screen. I wasn't interested in getting a DVD of it. There is too much "funny" humor that I didn´t get into, and there was just too much to get in. This film is full of stupidity and bad acting. I´m not interested in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie from the bargain bin with a copy of the original script. They ripped the original footage in and made it a totally new film.  The script was pretty good, but there were two points that I just couldn't find in the script. The first one is the scene when the police car stops off the road to prevent an accident. They do so, and then there's a lot of talk and action.  I think that is the end.  Then there was the scene where the car pulls over another motor vehicle, with the driver yelling, over and over the cops. This gets me to wondering whether the cops have the same powers, like police or cops, or is there a different group that has more control over their actions? If they have more control, are they the only ones who have the power, or the ones that have more authority?  It wasn't that I didn't pay attention to the fact that these guys are in an SUV, and I just wasn't paying attention to those guys. I'm pretty sure that the cops in the SUV knew that their car was coming through and the cops knew that the car was pulling over them, because they got in the car and stopped the car, then they stopped the vehicle in order to get their cars out of the way.  That's the point I didn''t like, though. The script and the scene with the police truck chasing the cops, as well as a scene that is supposed to be about a traffic accident, are the only things that seem interesting.  My guess is that the police in the truck had been in the parking lot where the accident happened and drove through the accident site.  Some people seem to think that the only reason the truck wasn't there was because the person was in a coma. And that's true, but I'm sure that was the only way to get the people there, because he was in the coma when he was dropped off the highway on the way to the accident location.  What is the difference between the truck and the police vehicle? A truck and a cop vehicle? I think the answer is that they are different people, with different power, just because they are in different locations. So, where does a man in a comatone get into a coma in his coma? It doesn't make sense to me.  But I still don't buy the premise. The original script has good story twists, but the movie never really figured out what
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has the worst acting in the history of film history. It is the worst possible film to ever made. Its funny and hard to believe how hard it was to find it.  its an empty plot that just gets people killed by a monster. I did see it with friends after lunch. Its like getting a lot of crazy guys thrown at each other. A little kid who tries to get into a game with a boy kills everyone. The acting is also horrible. I think I just laughed out when I watched it. When you see it it, you are left with no choice but to find a copy of it to try and find a time to rent it out.  the best way to be a film writer is to just sit out on the fence and laugh. i am a huge fan of film and I think everyone should be able to laugh when they see this. Don't waste your time doing anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. The camera and effects are lacking and the whole plot is pretty shallow. There is no clue of what exactly happened when the crew began working on the film. The story itself is not much of interest. The fact that they filmed a lot of footage in Hawaii should cause us to care more. They didn't care if they were going to break the mold for the "Candy's Dream" TV show which featured a lot more money to make a great television show. But they wanted to create something that looks a lot like a film. And that's the only thing that can be said. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had just watched this movie, and didn't like it. I didn't even care what it was because it was so unbelievably terrible. I mean, it wasn't really good, but it wasnacrosslly bad. Even though it was directed by the guy who made it, the direction was bad, and the dialog was bad. The film was so bad that, considering it was such a derivative piece of art, it could have been better directed to have a more appropriate ending. I think it just screams!  But it wasn´s good for a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a movie fan, but if I couldn get to see it I'd have had to throw a few hundred bucks at the box. This is not a film to be taken seriously. The plot is so bad that I can't believe that this would have been made for the price of one dollar. The acting is so pathetic that it's not funny! The acting in this film is so weak that it is stupid. When the title was "Wipe In Your Eyes," I was amazed that I didn't even laugh. They must have been making the film so hard just to get some audience watching. That doesn't necessarily mean that the film is bad. It just means that it was made so hard that you couldn't even cry. I wish the writer would get into directing his career. It was so bad I didn's name in and out. If I was willing to watch it for free, I might be able to enjoy it for a few minutes. I'm not going to rent this film for a couple weeks to rent. I only watched it and wished for it to end.  I'm sorry to see the person who made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i don't like what i've watched this movie with its bad acting. The music was bad at the same time. A lot of people didn't get to enjoy the movie so that i decided to only go once. That's not enough to call this movie a bad choice. I have no idea why this movie was made. Its bad in the way, as a matter of my interest and enjoyment. This movie is an insult to all those who love drama in the art of movie making. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be just another one-hundred minute long crap. And it's about the worst I've seen since my youth. It's a pity! It's really not good enough for a really good film to be shown in the world. Some of the jokes are funny and amusing, but don't try to try and imitate them. I don't like these kinds of movies either. They're just as stupid as I think some of those comedy series have been made. What a shame. I can't figure out why the director is making this film. I didn't like it, but I do hope it will not be made! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I both laughed when I saw this movie. It was so stupid, I think it was one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life. It just seemed so sad and pointless. I was surprised to learn that there is no video, no DVD, and no soundtrack, no soundtrack. I know that it was supposed to have been a parody of the hit movie 'Death of Father Zebadara', but it had to be more sad than that. I also think that the acting was laughable. I could barely recognize the people that were in it. The plot was so bad that the movie seemed so weak. I think if you just saw 'Death to Father Zemba' then it was better than the 'Death Movie'. I recommend seeing 'Death Baby 4' and 'Death Movies' but the 'Movie' is so bad it is hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know what was going on in this film before I came on it. The acting was terrible, even worse than a bad British film. I don't understand the motivations of these people, even though the girls were lovely. The director who tried to make it seem like a movie could be successful. I think the actor(s) was the worst person in the film. The camera was bad, even less than bad. The cinematography was really bad, with too many things in the shot. The lighting was awful and the soundtrack was bad as well. I didn�t understand the plot of this film. This movie is just the worst one I have ever seen. If it wasn�t for me, I�ll give this movie a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like it, but this is not the worst thing I have ever seen. But the film does have some really funny scenes. I just wish it wasn't so funny. I thought that the movie had some pretty funny moments, but unfortunately it just was not funny. The first scene is a really weird one. The dialogue is really bad. There is a good story and a good ending. The characters were not funny at all and just really awful acting. Even in the end the story ends just a bit dull, and I was thinking about the acting in the ending. There are some funny bits of dialog but I think that could have been better than this film. But in the movie they never really started off like a normal scene. This movie is not even a comedy, it's just a poorly written and filmed movie, that is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised by the terrible movies they made. This movie is so bad that I'm very worried about the filmmakers. There are no good jokes, and no good characters. The ending had a slight clue of what it was about, but it isn't even a decent flick.  If you liked a good movie, don't watch this one. If you were expecting something interesting, don see something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two of the films I ever saw were the ones that made me cry. The second film is a comedy film that looks more like a comedy than an actual film. I'm not saying there's any great comedy in this movie. The comedy is really the worst I've seen since "My Life Story" which is an honest comedy film. However, the film isn't entirely about comedy. It's about an un-intelligent man that thinks he's a god.  There are plenty of other things in this film, and I have not been able to find out anything about them. I guess that this film might be a comedy, but I think it's really about a slap in the face to anyone that likes to be on a soap opera. It just reminds me of a typical, stupid, white, typical white, stupid white, and stupid white trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, this is the most disappointing I've ever watched in my life. I just saw it again. It was an almost totally bad movie, as it seemed to be an obvious rip off of the original "Gunga", that I would expect from the original. Unfortunately, this version is far worse than the original, and I do not understand why it is a DVD to begin with. It is really awful. I was especially annoyed at the fact that this movie was so completely uninteresting and there was no real plot. But I'm sure there are people out there who liked this version. They have a hard time getting into it because of all the terrible plot. I had to listen to the entire first episode of the film and it just sounded like something from the seventies, although it was pretty entertaining as it was supposed to be.  The film is pretty unsymmatic and very bad for a first-run movie. The only thing that has kept me going through this movie is the fact of the fact this original is a sequel to "Gang" which I thought I'd be able to enjoy. But since I've seen it several times, it's not all-great.  I was extremely unhappy with this movie as I thought the end-conception was a disappointment for me. There was no suspense, and it was not really well directed. I'm not sure if I was the only one who wasn't drawn into this movie, but I definitely didn't enjoy the film as I did for most of it. I don't even want to see it again and would only recommend to see some of it because it's an interesting look at a movie that never has any real substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am absolutely amazed that they won the Oscar for this lousy film. This film is full of the "sharks" from "Gangen" and the "vices" from the remake of "Gungen" (see: The vices in this film are the Vixen). But even worse than the Vices, it also has a whole bunch of goofy lines. What they do in the plot is annoying and the rest of the film is a bit predictable, but it's just sad to see the filmmakers waste money. It should never happen again. It might happen in a different movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is the same as most of the "real" films in the current decade. It starts with a group of teens who look for an exotic movie to steal and then they try to rob some old guy.  This film is the worst "real-life" film ever made, with the exception of, of course, "My Name is Steven" and "My Family Is Home". There is not even one of the main characters to go in and get involved in the actual criminal activities, but we still find ourselves in the real world. In "Criminal Profession", a guy gets beaten up by a kid with a huge nose and tries to get revenge.  We are given the idea of this movie as a sequel to "Carcade", but it was obviously not the sequel to this one. We see the guy's "big nose" and his "big wig" wearing a pair of glasses and we are told he will soon be big again and his big wig is his new weapon. The movie begins with the "Cocadoll" team of criminals who try to steal some money from a bank and try to get the bank to lose the money, which is much more than we can expect.  It starts in a horrible place, with a guy who is having a drug run on him and an owner of the bank, called "Mr. Coker", who is obsessed about getting money from an office where he lives, but apparently he didn't go into an office. I can't wait to tell him that and his friend's son is about to get him a job, but he never gets a job and they get there anyway.  In the meantime, the guy with a large nose starts robbing some old men in a local bank, which goes wrong. He gets stabbed and gets stabbed by an old lady. He is then attacked by some kid who beats him around a lot. This seems to get away from there, though. The girl who has a giant nose drops on her hairline is in fact a woman, though, and she is much better than her big nose. I don't know if she is pregnant, though I cannot tell.  The "Cancer" people get their first clue to how to get over the "Elderly Woman" after the girl is stabbed and beaten up on a chair.  Some scenes are interesting, and some are not. I found it a little amusing to see a guy named Mr. Lacey (for
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film three times so far.  I was very curious, since I've watched the original one. When I saw it, I thought it was about an old movie about a boy who lives in a slum with a gang of men. When my girlfriend got it, she said it had a VERY IMPORTUNLY DARK story. This story is never the same as the original. It takes place in a neighborhood where a group of men go to hide a heroin drug dealer, and they're all over their backs and there are a few days when they're not hiding, so I'm a little skeptical. However, I'm not a sucker for it. I like a good movie, and I thought this made it bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't good, but I did enjoy it quite a while. I'm a big fan of "Big" 2, but this was just terrible. The story is pretty stupid, the characters are obnoxious, and they're pretty predictable. There are a lot of really awful lines in this movie, and I really wanted to avoid the movie, but unfortunately, I cannot, because I cannot think of another movie that compares to this. If you want to watch this movie and have to see it, you might try the other movie, "The Lofty Tale", or the two movies it is in the title, "Munchies, Snopes, and Bunches". But if you want something that's pretty stupid and stupid, then you might also try "Lofty Tale". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie 4 stars for being a bad one and 3 stars for not having any decent direction or acting. It starts with this scene of a woman being held in an elevator. (the elevator was obviously not in the house!) It starts about the first scene. A poor director (as usual for a film) starts to shoot, but he never actually begins to act. His character doesn't even start off until he's a few minutes into the movie. The next scene begins with a female worker showing her boss how to shoot.  I can't think how anyone could possibly think of a film with this director. They never even have a decent idea about what it all is supposed to be about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise seems reasonable, it's good enough for a laugh but the acting is so bad that the whole film becomes a laughing matter. The dialog isn't funny and the acting isn't interesting, it should have been better than a joke but it fails. The film could have been a bit better but it looks like it's more desperate to be funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say the only good thing about this movie was the special effect at the end. But the movie was terrible. The action of this movie just didn't seem like any film, but for the sake of being, I give this movie zero credit for its acting skills. The worst thing I can imagine is the ending. It was a little short, but the ending is only a little more than an hour and a half. There are few parts that were difficult to watch. It looks like a standard American family drama series. The best part of it is just the ending when the father and the daughters are sitting around the kitchen trying to see if they should say anything about it. It should have ended sooner. The ending should have been about something like a family vacation where a father and daughter want to take their children to another vacation. A bad movie, nothing but a bad one, and I hope the next one is a good film. I have been looking for this movie for some time, and it really should be a real comedy. But unfortunately, this movie is not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i get angry after watching this movie with the new 3.1.3/DVD. It is extremely irritating, there is little good dialogue, and the story is predictable. But, if you just watch it to have some laughs, you will probably be bored of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the plot, I was shocked. I was expecting a good story, but it didn't make it seem more exciting. When you can do this, you can also become bored. In fact, I think it's really sad that most people can't find any enjoyment out of watching a movie.  I thought the movie was a little funny and entertaining, but I could only end up thinking of the characters' problems. I think the writers were just trying to make a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to like this film but sadly I did not. I'm sorry. There are very few laughs that were left to be had.  The cinematography was OK though the music was not that great. I was also hoping to like the music and the acting was good but unfortunately I didn't. I think the acting is bad in a film that is completely predictable.  I really didn't like this movie because it just had too much of a bad smell. I don't care whether you liked it or not, but it needs to die off as soon as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really was very surprised. This film has been all the way around the entire time. I really think it is one of the worst films I've seen since, and I don't even think it has any redeeming qualities. Its really sad that I can't even have one good line in it. I don not know why this movie is being made now.  The whole point of the film was to make an average horror movie with an average B-M-M budget and to make something that is so bad it doesn't matter who gets sick. I think this is a way to get rid of crappy horror movies like this because they are too horrible. The only positive review about the film is the good dialogue. There was a nice scene in the film involving a couple who made a joke to each other and at least the film did have some funny moments. This is just a pity-filled trash-filled horror film that won't appeal to anyone.  I would avoid this movie if I could avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film on a DVD and this is so bad that it had me questioning my loyalty. I would never even have cared if I had not been raised to hate such movies, and I'm definitely not a sucker. This movie is just plain bad. You'd think a film would be as bad if it had a few good jokes. This was so bad, I actually wanted to give it 10 out of 10. Unfortunately, this movie is the worst one I have seen from the year of this decade, but I know that it does have some redeeming features, like the occasional jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this as a "giant horse-sized toy" that had nothing to do with the film. I'm an aficionado for Disney and I've seen it so many times that I think Disney is doing a better job at directing this thing than trying to make it all good. The movie was stupid and the acting was horrible. I'd like to give this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the awful acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not to be taken seriously. It is extremely unbalanced and pretentious. Also I think it's one of the worst films ever. I mean it's got all of the same effects as an adult film. There is a little love in the film but it's all fake. The story is simply a bad, pointless love story that's about nothing. I am trying to say that it was one of "best" films about the 70's, but it isn't. The film contains a totally unrealistic ending! You need to see what it was all about before you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is interesting and there is some good moments (when they are good). This movie is pretty much a series of poorly-written dialogues. I wish to say that the movie is not that bad. It is certainly a shame that it won't be released after all this. It's absolutely unappentrable, even after all the "plot" has been released. I can only imagine how a film with no dialogue is capable of such an ending. It was a shame and embarrassment that we could see a movie like this to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was based off of the TV series "Hobes" and some of the acting. The plot was based on the book "The House of Blood" from the book and was not too different from the first book. In fact it had several inconsistencies with the book, making it a bad series. One of the problems was that the story started with a scene where the guy in the cave was getting some bad treatment from the people who were going to get his hands held (it's a very unoriginal way to go). I didn't care. He didn't stop getting treatment and he's going to die and he wasn't in love with the woman. The scene in "House Of Blood" is where the protagonist is supposed to get some good treatment from all of the people on the way to find the lady in the desert. That's about where the movie fell from. The ending is pretty stupid. It was disappointing to see the acting and to see a movie that had a few interesting twists. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, I feel that this movie is one of the worst movies of 2013. It has a very thin storyline and has a plot that reads like a children's flick. Even the most well known comic series of the DC comics has some good story lines, even though it is so bad that you are left with an endless plot line. The characters are bad, and I'm not sure if this movie was actually written by one of this writer's children, but it doesn't matter. It should have been an American film with a decent story, instead of one of those children's films.  I can't wait to get this movie because it has a great chance to get an American remake as well as one that I can watch. If you want to see a movie that is actually a fun ride, then you'll have to watch this movie. If it's not, it's just one of a dozen children's movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story and plot is weak and doesn't make much sense. This is most evident in the fact that the plot is not a logical thing. The movie had several moments that could have been either a funny or something else but this is the worst film I've seen. And the acting was bad and not the least of all bad since the beginning of the story and was quite annoying.  The movie was a mix of a couple of old "couple's time" movies with some bad acting mixed in with a couple new horror flick.  A lot of the scenes were also bad, which was the fault of the director. I had never seen this movie before, and I think that is why it is not well-known. It's just a horrible horror movie that tries to be scary, but unfortunately fails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first question is why I think it has to be made. There was a lot of good ideas in this film, and they were well-executed, but the film's direction is severely lacking. There are some interesting things in the film, but it's very hard to see through. The plot is one long story and the story takes an odd form (not even an ending) and then there are no ending. In addition, the acting is terrible, and there is a lack of acting to justify the film. There's some pretty good acting but there's a couple of lines that just don't do much. There also is some very bad dialog and some of the camera is bad. There is some interesting moments, but nothing really keeps the film alive.  I have not seen this film before and don't know what I would have done if it was meant for a film. This is a bad film! Don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really care if you disagree with this movie, but I do agree with others. They are not "the same," as the reviewers might assume, and the movie would have been better.  They are actually quite similar, but they look different. I am sure that this movie was made to get to an audience that is not familiar with the world and with a negative attitude toward a movie. They have to be familiar with religion and their own faith and, of course, the "welcome" of those in other religions. This is not a movie that a Christian, even one who has serious doubts about Islam, can look at. The message is so off the mark that it is hard to understand why the movie is being distributed and sold. The other problem is that I don\'t really understand what they are saying. That is, to me, the message of this movie is not very clear. For a person who has a problem with Islam, the way they are preaching it is absolutely not obvious. We have seen what they say. Why, do you think, would make you angry? Or not? Because the way the Muslims are preaching is simply something along the line of a "HOL" message. No matter how sincere they might be, it is an insult to their sense of being Muslims.  I find that, in my view, there is a lot of room for interpretation. But they say, when they say something, they do not explain it with a clear and logical message, and that leads me to believe that they are deliberately trying to make you feel bad. It isn't just a message that is simply conveyed through a film, but rather something that is interpreted by a specific person. It is a message which is a "jargon" from the people.  And if they say this message is about their own message, then I question if it is a jargon and then is delivered by a person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be a fun horror film, but unfortunately it is very boring. The characters are horrible, the plot is nonsensical, and the dialog is stupid. If you're a horror fan, you won't be able to like this movie.  This film is so bad, I actually wonder how anyone would even get this one out of their hard-drive. This movie should never, ever, be released. The acting is laughable, the acting is terrible, and there are no memorable scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this film a little dull to watch. I cannot recommend this film at all, but for some reasons I would recommend watching it to enjoy it as the most boring film of all time. If you like to laugh, and maybe watch other film films, perhaps this film would be worth watching. I mean there is something to take away from this movie's acting and special effects, but if you just go on a date, you might get some enjoyment from this film. Not for those who want to sit through everything, the film really does a number of bad jokes. They are so flat-edged, the story could only be a little interesting if you really want to see a movie that isn't as boring as this one. The film starts about as soon as it hits a major twist. It should be at the least one of 2 - 3, though if it isn't, it should be 3. The plot is weak and the characters are very flat and no emotion, even if they do a great job. The story is pretty thin. The only interesting thing about this film is the opening scene where the woman is about to be impregnated by an alien. I know how annoying it was to watch this film because I had to watch it at the end when the film is finished, just after I had seen it all in the theaters. However, I would rate this film as an example of how bad a film can get. If this film had only one good moment, I might consider watching it again, though not if the other good bits of the film were interesting enough. The whole movie is really bad and there's no redeeming factor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i watched this movie for over 40 minutes and did my best to take it as just something to get me interested. but after a few times and reading through the plot and didn't find anything to add to it i found the whole thing rather a bore-down affair. then i started wondering about what it was about that made it so bad. but it was such a bad film, i don't know the name of the lead actor but i think that is enough to give you the first clue. if you were hoping for some plot, you might not even get it. if not, it's a fairly stupid, self-centered, and overly over-the-top thing to watch. this is just an interesting fact, the only thing that has ever done that is such a ridiculous example of what you can do with movies is something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An ugly, shallow, and slow moving film has been given a rating of 3.9 by I'm not going to watch it, but I did take it to see some of its other features. As an aside, I'm interested in the character of the young, naive and naive. As I read this film, I have to admit that the "witness" scene was pretty interesting.  The characters seemed to be unaware of the nature of the universe and the truth of the world. In fact, I can't believe that most of the characters had been in "theory" relationships that were supposed to have been. It just seemed that their love, friendship, and unity was a signifier of ignorance and not a sign that they were really in relationship.  I also felt that some of the "magic" scene scenes were totally out of context and just the wrong order. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sure, in retrospect, I didn't understand the problem - I just didn't want to have this movie. In my mind, if you want to learn what happens to your son or daughter, why don't you watch "The Caretaker". I was thinking about "Caringer" but I thought the movie is too slow and don't understand what happened in the storyline. My girlfriend liked the movie - I think she was like the whole thing - I was about 4/5/7/7.  "Careder" should never have had anything to do with "Caryer", but it's OK to have it, as I said.  But I was just so angry and angry at the way it is supposed to be, and I had to think about the problem (and my girlfriend liked it better than the movie) and I finally understood that the reason why they made it was because the director didn't get the idea that the film might not be able to be well-crafted. The way the script was written and the way the actors were acting is just silly and pointless.  I can't say anything positive about this movie - it's just the way they've tried to make it seem like a movie. Just a simple excuse, I think. I don't have faith in this movie, it's bad, but I'll take it for its novelty - it seems to be entertaining to me, and it's got some good acting, some good casting. However, I can admit that it does have some potential - but I donut want it to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really disappointing and has been rated as a "CURSURE." I give it 2 out of 10 because the main characters are the same. This movie starts out as an adventure game, but that becomes a bunch of games when you realize what the movie is and what the characters do. The acting is terrible. The direction is awful. There are some good lines but the writing has a number of holes. Some of the plot points could have been written more easily but it's been years since they were written. I could say all about the actors but if you really want to read the movie, don't waste your time reading a plot guide. If you need some serious, long, hard-headed comedy, then just watch the TV series. You won't have any good laughs in it.  If you want to have a break, watch an old movie: Mad Max and "Mad Dog" (which had a better script than this movie). This movie doesn't really have a story about what happened, why the movie exists, and how it will make a difference in the world.   If there is any good reason to watch this movie, it is a film that's really just boring. The way the characters behave in the movie can be explained easily, but the plot isn't very interesting. If this movie were better, the way it could have made it interesting would be interesting.  I would recommend it for a short time, or if you just want to kill somebody, because the movie has some interesting elements, but as a movie, there is no good reason for you to watch it. In my opinion, it wasn't good and it has the same problems as "Iron Man" movies of the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could be an example of how bad things get made. It's like a crappy horror movie: when you see a scary guy, his teeth and a little chipper are on the screen, you wonder how it has gone and the movie doesn't make any sense. Also the special effects are bad, like the spinning skull with a big fake hand. Also you have to watch this in the theater without any headphones, and it's pretty annoying. Some of the dialogs are silly, but that doesn't matter because it's about how bad it gets. Also there are no real surprises to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know what movie this was supposed to be about. I was surprised that it was not a movie. I think the movie is basically a plot to do a sequel. If there is a sequel I am hoping that the film doesn't end there.  There are probably some good moments in the movie. There is absolutely no story! You are left wanting to know what is happening all over the whole time. But I guess, there is little suspense here! I would be at least interested to find a trailer for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Great Fish" is an unappreciable piece of work. You know how it's lacking the story, plot, and most of the best story lines. The plot is about a man and a girl that are in search of a goldfish. This movie is so bad it reminds me of the "Couch" movies. A sad story of the man and his girlfriend is the best thing about this movie. The acting and editing are just awful and they get the least of the story. The most annoying thing about the movie is the lack of emotion and dialog. There was nothing to go with the other characters except to provide some good dialog. If you liked the show, stay away and avoid this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really want to cry to say this is a bad film, but I would be, and the reason why I'm reluctant to do so is because this movie is an absolutely worthless effort. It has some of the best acting in the world, but the acting is so bad, the acting looks so stupid and bad that I would have to think it was directed by some low-quality scriptwriter. I have watched this movie and I donno longer can see it. I was hoping I could give it a 8 rating because it has a pretty good, low-budget, cult-movie look to it, but as a complete, flat-footed piece of work this movie just doesn't impress me. The film starts off very interesting, but then becomes completely awful. I wouldn't recommend it for a 10, because I would like it to be a 10. It's a terrible film to rent, and I'd give it one point to see for it's interesting. Unfortunately, this movie has a long, dark future of a horrible movie that is just a bad way to waste time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad it's so bad that even if you don't have one friend who will do an excellent job, you will still watch it. If you do have any friends who will help you (like you) I don't know whether they will help me to fight for justice. This is so stupid that I think a little kid should just be left standing in the theater. There are no jokes or other clever jokes to make the movie worth to the viewer. If it would have been made for the sake of satire or to illustrate a point, the movie would have just been too stupid. It does not matter how old the movie is, but even if it is the worst film ever made, it's still bad. It is so dull I almost never found any funny or funny things. It's just one joke about an elephant. I really hate this movie. But don't see this movie if it comes out at a low cost. Watch this movie for the stupidity of a poor movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad that this is no one's fault, it just sucks. There is a point where the plot becomes too stupid to be funny. A lot of the time, I get angry at the plot line and the dialog. It's like a real bad movie with some of the more interesting characters and the other stupid scenes in a bad action comedy film that we found out a few years ago. If you want to try out a movie with a really funny or interesting plot, avoid this movie and move your mind to the bottom of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm having great difficulties in believing that this film is any more than an insult.  What really happened is that the story is a lot of bad dialog, especially the dialog between the two of the characters, and there is really no reason for me to believe that the director was having fun. My mother was upset because I was getting something so off, and also I was worried about being too thin (I had gotten into some sort of a serious weight gain treatment).  The only thing that I can conclude is that what was supposed to be an honest film was so bad that it wasn't a very good movie. It isn't clear which one is more important. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, the script was pretty good, the director was talented, the acting was excellent, and the acting and acting were okay. But this plot could be better, and really, it sucked all the guts off. The ending, which shows the protagonist getting caught in a real life-threatening situation in the real world is terrible. The most disturbing part about this movie is that the whole time I watched it, I thought there was some kind of special link with the "real world". What a movie? I guess I thought they were in the "Real World" in order to warn me away. I think my expectations were being very foolish. I didn't even know what was happening. The only time I got out was when the main character, who was supposed to be this star of this movie, was supposed by the producers to be a "real person". I should have read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was thinking it was going to be a decent film with the acting talent of Michael Leland. It turned out to be pretty terrible. I liked the original. I really liked the art of the movie, but it didn't work.  A big problem here, is that this movie is so bad that it can't be used properly.  There is a lot of inconsistencies. I can count the number of times I was in trouble reading the book. The book was not clear at all; it's got a bad writing in the beginning, and it got a few of my friends a bit angry. I also saw the music which is supposed to be so beautiful in the book, but there's nothing in the movie that makes it special.  The acting is bad, too, but that's not because there are some good actors. I feel bad about this movie because I did think it was good, and I didn't know what the story was.  I would rate it as one of the worst things I have ever seen. It is simply not funny, and the acting is so poor that it really isn't funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a pretty bad version of a great film. The acting is terrible, and the editing is really terrible. The story is pretty stupid and the ending is pretty absurd. In other words, I would avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's so much like the first version of 'Grimgarden'. This is about a movie being made in 1999 so that the younger viewers would still be at their full height, if they were not already. But here it's a sequel. It has a totally ridiculous storyline involving the people in the village to find out where the next door to the village is. I thought the story and plot was bad, the characters were bad, and the acting was bad. But it had some good laughs, some good dialog, some amusing scenes, and some decent action. I had the misfortune of being in this movie when it came out of the box in 1999, I didn't like it, but I still found it to be fun. At the very end of the movie I realized there was a lot of promise behind it, even though the characters weren't particularly good in the movie. Even though I liked the plot, it was impossible to actually watch for me.  And although it was a good movie, the plot was extremely bad and the ending was awful, I'm disappointed. It had a decent ending and I think the movie will never come out as good as it is now, as terrible and bad as the original version. It should never be given another release again because this is too bad for the first time. It's not only a waste of money, it is a waste for the audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bad piece of film to the most important aspect of film making. It fails to capture a real feeling and is the worst remake of the 20th century.  Even worse than the original in the late 1970's.  In short, the original had an honest and genuine feeling of being a film - but this one tries to replicate it in another way.  I have to say that the people involved in making this film seem to have some sense of art. They obviously didn't understand the meaning of filmmaking.  This is a movie just like the "The Great Picture" except that it was supposed to be a parody of the 70's film "The American Renaissance".  The first person I see after it was in fact "Alfonstramor".  There are only two parts, and the story is pretty minimal. It's just another piece of crap that's put on for money, and made for no purpose whatsoever. It is interesting only for the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An attempt at making a documentary is the same thing as a piece on a bad piece of fiction.  I mean this movie is so bad it makes me want to cry.  It does not make up for the time of the book.  This movie is about a story that had been told many times in the book that was written as a story. In the book it is simply a story about people trying to get out of a bad situation, and then trying to hide their true identity.  The film is just a series of interviews with people who do not believe in God. This is a bad script.  There should have been a followup story with people whose faith has been broken. It should be made into a movie that shows the consequences of the world's end, and that we can only learn of what they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some reviews of this movie, but I think most of them are the old ones. If this film had been released earlier, it would have had some interesting "realness" to it, but it isn't. It's not a film to be used in a low-budget, low-key, action adventure format. It has to be an action thriller that could get a hold of your brain. The acting is just stupid, and the script is stupid, too. There are all kinds of awful acting and dialog, and some of the special effects are so bad that you wouldn't recognize that they were actually there. It doesn't matter whether your life is going to be miserable or not, the film's just plain stupid.  The special effects in this film are so much bad that the movie is just plain awful. I'm not sure if this is the last step in the descent into mediocris, or if they were trying to finish this off, but this movie is simply a pile of shit. Don't rent it, or download it, and get rid of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty bad, I can't even say it was the best film of it's director, nor the best sequel. I was disappointed by this movie, I thought I was going to be treated to the other films.  The plot is not very good, even though it was pretty good. The movie is not about vampires, it's about the supernatural, it contains horrible things, and horrible things go on. You are put in a cage for a whole year, and you can't see the other world or even the afterlife? The best part is this, when the demon in the prison is brought to a full-body prison, you're forced to eat human flesh, and the demon's soul is sent to a human skull, the demon becomes one of the human's only possessions. The plot ends when the man in the next cage is eaten, by a demon named 'Tajoch'. If you were expecting a horror movie, you will not be surprised.  This is one of many horror films. The only positive one is the movie "In the House of Hollywood", which is about a kid who goes on a road and is abducted from a group of vampires. The film is about how the vampire's vampire's gang leader takes care of the group of kids and then has to fight against them.  There are also a lot of gore, like the demon killing a person in a fire, or being bitten by a vampire, the demons killing in a blood ceremony, and having blood thrown into a human's mouth. The demons also like to rape people. The demon goes on to rape a couple of humans in a ritual, and also goes on the rampage with a demon's friend, destroying everything in front of the kid and raping women. Some things in the story make you wonder, even after all the horror, is it really okay for the cast? What the hell was the hell? The only good parts of the movie are the two female characters, a girl and a witch. The girl is one pretty sexy, and her only good aspect is her sexy outfit. It is pretty hard to believe this was made to turn off some kid, and as an American, she sure does come off as hot! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to give the director credit for the fact that this movie is a complete disaster. The director must be mad for this movie to have won an Oscar in 1989. I understand why the director was doing this movie. Because they were very close to hitting an award. If it had been a commercial film, I would give this guy a lot of credit for being good. But this movie was simply an insult to film-making. You have to understand that the movie was not in a commercial. It is like watching a movie on a tape recorder. The music was totally bad, the sound was bad, and the dialog was bad. It's like watching an actor playing a movie. It has nothing to do with the acting. But I'm not saying that the director is stupid, as they should be. They should have used good music to make the movie better. This movie is so bad, even that I had to watch it with friends. The sound track sounds like a tinny little toy, and this movie has some good jokes, but it is just horrible. There is absolutely no rhythm whatsoever. The soundtrack is terrible. This is like listening to a movie through a toy tinny toy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd have a hard time getting out of this movie in my book. I was looking for something to see if it would fit my interest, but in a bad way. I got a copy of this film in the mail and saw it only 4 minutes before I had to drive there. I'm so depressed... and I was in the early hours of watching this film... I must admit, I'm a sucker. You're going to see the whole movie. In a couple of days, I had an urge to rent it, and then I bought a copy...  I didn't think anything until I saw it again... and it was about the only time that I'd seen the film that I actually cared about. I mean, I'd never seen that film before, and when it came out, I was like I didn`t know what the hell it was and I couldn't even see through the story. There were little holes in the story, and nothing seemed to make sense. There was one, you'll notice, where a character was in one room, and he was in another. You'd have to see for yourself, but I'd be hard on seeing if it is a guy or a character... but don't be so surprised if you're one of the fans and you're not interested in the plot. They aren't, by the way, in a place like an office room... and they do, it doesn't happen in real life...  The movie is really awful, but so bad that it's so bad you want to see it. I'd also recommend that you don't see it in the theater.  The plot is about a guy called "The Boss" who has been through a lot of adversity and then is in a really bad situation. It seems to be to be more about being a survival story and not being able to do anything and get out of a big job, instead of simply doing something else, even if that could be done. I think the movie is about him in the last, only one way to get him out of his problems. It has no way of explaining that and he ends up falling into this awful situation in an attempt to get "The Next Boss". It's a bad plot and he falls into an unhealthy situation. The film really is just a "joke". It is not funny, the actors are bad, but really it really is an awful film and I think that makes the film a very bad movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. I would like to point out some of the problems that were mentioned in the film, such as the whole "fear"/"curse" thing, which is totally unnecessary. And the scene with the firemen chasing the "curse". Also, the whole scene with an old man wearing an outfit is stupid. Even if it were me, I would have rather never seen this movie in any detail, because it was stupid, and the acting was just silly, which would have made me sick. I just want to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's two words you'll hear if you've ever seen this movie. I'm a former teenager of 10 years, so when I was first into the 80's I would be a bit skeptical. I was happy with movies like "The Little American Village" and "The Last Man on Earth". They were both funny and funny, but "Munchies" is so bad and stupid it is just one of the worst movies I've seen. I cannot even stand it when the ending occurs and the story is pretty unapparent. Even if this were a film with a great cast, it would have been better to watch it in slow pace, or watch it while listening to the soundtrack. This movie is even worse in the middle of a car accident. I couldn't even watch this in a movie club, much less watch it again with a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have to go to see any movie: "The Secret of the Tomb", then this is it's a good one. It has a very fake story that is full of the same rubbish that everyone else has seen for the previous eight years. It's about a guy that walks around his neighborhood and finds out that he's in a secret prison and that the guy he's been sent away to prison is the mastermind behind the kidnapping of his brother. And all along the way through, it's very obviously fake. And what is the secret? Well, I guess it's some type of treasure, but it's about how to use some of the characters to "train" people for a mission. What you do is... well, I don't know. Maybe the characters are trying to use their "real" powers to find out some way to get a free ride (since most of their powers are based on the movie) or some kind of superweapon that they can use to fight a demon or a demon's army (so that they may get killed). I guess that maybe they're trying to find a way to make people suffer, and this is some sort of plot to make them suffer. So... yeah... get it. It doesn't get much more than an hour, though. And the movie is full to crap, so don't waste your time. You'll probably be able to take the movie somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait for several hours to get into this movie. As I was getting into this trailer I started wondering why. I'm not sure if it was one of those "WOW" movies or "WILD" movies and I think this movie was one big disappointment. I think it could just be a bit of a bunch of poorly planned out bad movie, but it was still good at the beginning. I guess it was kinda funny but there's nothing in it that makes me laugh and nothing funny about it. There is also nothing funny. I know I'm probably going to watch this film a year later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing left in this movie. The acting is horrible, the special effects are ridiculous and the movie's script has been pretty poor all of the time. If you enjoy a good movie, don't see this one. It's not the kind of a movie you'll remember for hours and hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad it was hilarious. I don't know who is this person or person in the film but I would think the director (the first person I thought was in it) must have been an idiot. The ending is very predictable and extremely boring. But even more bad for it if you thought it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this movie because this movie is a complete disaster. This movie was never really funny.  I think the producers really did a bad job by getting this film out of the box. There are no funny lines in the movie, but the main characters are funny when they are supposed to be funny, and even when the movie starts and the main actors are supposed by the script to be humorous, they are never really that funny, instead of laughable. When I tried to watch this movie again, I was confused by the fact that it has such a stupid name for a movie. I thought it would have been funny to say that the characters are actually making a joke. I didn't know how the movie actually worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't even understand why anyone would be willing to pay half of the price for a bad film. This movie is a bunch of mis-information, some bizarrely convoluted story, and worst video editing. It has to be the worst film I have seen to date, with the exception of "Curse Caribbly" which I thought was quite good, even though it had some humor. There were a couple of funny moments, but most of them were lost. I tried to think of some other good films, but I cannot find any. This is simply not a good film, and I think it was only made because it had the potential to make people think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What were these guys talking about? a "I am a bad person" movie? I cannot see any of the music videos they are singing, I cannot even begin to understand the plot.  I do agree with a few people that this movie is funny, the artistry is not up to the standard of other movies, but I cannot recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a movie: The characters are all over-scared and don't know what to do. I guess a movie would have to have a good, even though it had a decent cast. I could have done better.  The movie was stupid. I think it would have been better if the people were in the same situations. The characters were stupid, stupid and there is not even a chance to see the characters act properly.   The script and the acting in the movie is about average. I couldn't believe that some people didn't enjoy this movie because of a bad acting and I was shocked at the acting and the direction was so bad.  I had to look up the movies and try my best to get rid of it because it was only a few minutes long and I didn't care for this bad movie and the actors didn't really have that much of a career. I hope to go to an event where it was shown on video or TV and that people could see it. I just don't think anyone who was planning on seeing it should waste any time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie many times, but have never seen it. It's not funny, it's not good. There is no believable dialog. There are no funny moments, no funny songs, and no laughs. There's no humor, and nothing really funny. The main plot is about a "real" family. The father has to spend all his time trying to get his daughter to stop having sex with her brother, his wife, and his daughter, to get the hell out of his life. When his wife gets the idea to commit a crime, he's going to go to jail, and everyone is upset about it. In the meantime, it plays out like a typical American family drama. I've seen this film twice, and the ending is painfully predictable. There were a few times when the father went to jail and ended his life, but that didn't happen because it was clearly apparent that he knew what was happening. This film isn't even funny, and in the end it doesn't make sense. There was a funny song in the second half, but in the previous film it wasn't a comedy. The dialog is really boring and is there for no reason. The acting is bad, and if you liked these three people, you'll think about this movie because you won't even need to see it. There isn't any story of the family, and it's totally predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a couple of small mistakes in this movie.  This is the only film I have ever seen with the same plot.  The last minute of the movie is a complete fail and I am truly embarrassed as the movie fails to finish. I think the plot was so bad because I liked the cast I had liked the actors who had excellent chemistry. I would NEVER recommend this movie because you have to have a deep discussion with the movie director about the awful script. I could not figure out why the director couldn't finish the movie!  I have never heard anything good about this movie, and I think it is just a bad acting drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this one as a teenager, the characters were interesting and I really enjoyed them. I thought this movie had potential, but it didn't work. The script was a bit predictable, and there were just too many times when it was clear that it didn´t work.  The acting wasn´t great. I´m not sure what the casting was supposed to be about. The story had a lot of inconsistencies, the setting seemed so silly, and the whole cast just didn´n't do the right things. I didn´´t get the feeling that the actors would have been good if they didn´m done their job.  Overall,  I would avoid seeing this movie. There are so many flaws in this movie that I don´t even bother to watch. I really had liked the first movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of a couple of brothers who run a chain of restaurants, so the story becomes interesting. But after a few days of this, the film starts to drag out and get worse. The acting seems bad, the story is not engaging, and it ends with a bad ending.  It's probably best to avoid this film because I think the characters are all over the mark. I think that even if you enjoy the previous movie, this one won't be worth a second time, but if you liked the previous film, you might enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if this is actually the film that people thought. I'm looking to see the sequel so that I can actually comment on the actual plot (and get my money back). The story is so stupid that the director has to follow the plot line exactly and make it appear more than just a bad joke. This movie is a bad sequel to the very good 'Grimblee.' This is the most terrible 'Gobblee' movie I've ever seen! It should have been titled 'Gunga' but 'Gombine' instead. The story line is so awful that I didn't even like the music in this movie. Also I don't even remember who the other person in the other movie was, and I don' know what their name was. I found the movie to be a complete joke, I don\'t know why the other movies people thought it was. It looks like they're making a joke about a stupid movie: the movie is about how bad the sequel could have been, and the way the director's script actually works. It should get better. I feel like this is just the kind of an amateur actor's idea they're trying to get ahead of the sequel and become more popular than 'Gargine.' I don \'t know how to pronounce the name of the person in this film, so I will have to find out what the name is. This is also a very bad sequel that only one director, and probably one decent acting actor, has the guts to stand up and fight for the title. It's really like one kid trying to go straight to the front door of a bank to get money back from his mom. They have to fight for a good title for a movie: one that is a good song, a good movie, and one that will be an average sequel. This one sucks! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand that this is not intended to be an "documentary", but it is. I have been trying to get the movie to be more interesting than a dry, mindless, story of a murder, but it's just that sort of movie.  But the story isn't actually funny, it's really annoying, and the actors are awful. It's so bad, I think even this one of the very few films made by a director (Garry Kornowski) who made a decent film about an accident in the real world, and you really want to avoid taking it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am shocked that this film could even come out so soon. Its only a problem when you are a diehard fan of a movie from a film that doesn't have all of the special effects or visual effects. That is only a short video with an out-of-the-the element animation and the plot is about a school that teaches kids how to fight. I guess it could have been a very good movie when I had been a die-hard fan. The only thing is that the animation looks so much less impressive when the kids fight it out. I would have liked to see a lot of people who actually did the fight in this movie. The animation is simply too slow and very bad. And the sound is bad as well. A little light in the video can ruin any fight. And finally, the music? I don't like it much. A good actor in a fight-of course, and the music is good when it comes out. But I think he should have a lot more money than he could spend. That's just a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen. The story is a mix of rubbish, but I really liked it, so I was disappointed. Even though it does contain all the hallmarks of the genre, it fails to make any lasting effect. The scenes were not good. I am not sure what the director was attempting to achieve. The dialog was really poor, with too many bad lines. They should have got a better idea of how to act and write the dialog in the script. The actor's character, as the actor, is not well developed, and their acting is bad and predictable. I also think they should've let the director and the actors get a little more practice in making the dialog. The characters are also bad, and although the director tries to make a couple of their scenes interesting, the characters themselves don't get a chance to develop. I can't really say that anything was good. There were some funny lines but, once you get into a good scene, you can't even guess which is the best. This is definitely a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've read all the comments, and so have been hesitant to watch this movie. I was also nervous to watch it for that reason. But in retrospect, I was really scared to see the characters in this film. The plot was too obvious to be anything more than a generic story with a lot of plot points thrown up at the end. I'd like to say, and I do, but that's not all that an effort, because there are many plot points that are so absurd that they didn't matter. The ending really seemed as though it was going to happen, but never. There were also some scenes that seemed to be a scene, or a scene just to give the characters an excuse to act stupid. And although the characters themselves seemed to act in a normal manner, the camera work seemed to have fallen into the kind of "let's camera do it" kind of a way. I couldn't really see what was happening to this movie, but I guess it's because I thought the movie itself was about a horror movie, and it never seemed like a real horror film. I did like the people involved with the movie, though. They seemed to think that the movie was a real movie, with the gore scenes and the music.  But this movie was only about a few minutes short.  The only good point is that there is an ending. In the end, the characters' deaths are at least a bit appropriate. This might be an interesting story line if the movie ended at 10 minutes, though I think it could have been extended to 10 hours. I also noticed that the ending scene had an element of irony, but only one scene, so that it was funny. The "real" story ends with the same ending. The movie doesn't have any lasting consequences. It was just a wasted effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is quite bad. It was really disappointing to see the movie. I hope the director has done good work. But if the director does not want to make a movie for me, this movie would not be good. I really don't think it can stand. I do think it should never have been played by any film teacher. I understand how it could have been interpreted. The problem is that the movie is so inaccurate in its interpretation. There are so many of the scenes that go back and forth making the movie look stupid. I am sure the people involved in the movie are guilty of that. I think that the writer/director/director probably had them come up with a script. He is probably a true amateur. That would make him an acceptable actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an interesting review about the movie. I can't tell you how the people who thought the movie was interesting or not stupid were thinking. The plot is the story of the protagonist's brother who goes to the island and falls in love with the girl (Rachira Vazquez) on the island. He is told about how he sees his brother is going to get married to another woman and wants to have a "prozac" for his bro to sleep with her so he can get a prostitute. He then goes and tries to get a bro to make a "drug" out of this, but to get it to work he needs a prostitute who is in love and has a great love life. Her brother is in jail for violating the law and he is sentenced to prison for violating of his probation. He makes a free getaway for his mom and the girl but is then sent back to the jail where he is incarcerated. The lady he goes in with is a "psychedelic" or a drug dealer, but nothing about it is even funny. The funny part is when the girl he was in love to goes in to the bro's house and is locked down inside and he and her are locked in together for life.   It just got stuck at me that there was no real sense of what it was supposed to be. The movie is actually a story about a young woman who's boyfriend was in prison and is getting into prison and she is looking for a girl to marry. I mean, it's a funny way to take on a story and it's not funny. That's what I call a comedically uninteresting story. The story is about people who want a prostitute to go with them for sexual escorts and to buy drugs for money and the way that their boyfriend goes to prison is kind of a setup for a story where you are like, "Wow, I wish it had been them and I didn't have a girlfriend to go home with me". I don't think it was meant to be funny. In fact I think it is very contrived and very shallow, there is no funny little bits at all. A girl who is on drugs gets herself a drug and that turns out to be a drug addict and she goes to a prison for stealing it. There is no good plot line.  This movie is also terrible because of how it is made by the writer. I'm guessing he had a great idea for a movie but didn't put
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most depressing movie I've seen in my life. I can barely believe anyone would be willing to watch it. The whole idea sounds like a dream that a kid put into his mind while he watched. They should have made more money for making a lot of money on the DVD. It was an extremely stupid and unfunny film. I have to admit, I laughed when I watched it. But my only hope in God was that I didn't have to. Maybe I'll find the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What ever happened with this movie. I mean it was the first time I've seen this whole series. In the first movie we have the whole story line of a girl dying in the forest because she's struck by lightning. When the forest is filled with fire and darkness, the girl's mother (Kamari Panchayam) comes to find the child. The father (Wade) is killed in a fire by a large fire that burned down his house. She decides to go back to the forest to see what happened to the father. However, she's unable to find him and is attacked by some old people. She's in the hospital with a broken nose and a broken arm. The story is about the next morning when she finds the father and decides to take the child away. When she gets to a large log in the woods and the child is able to go, she sees a small girl. Her mom is afraid of her but she has a friend who thinks it's her. The girl tells her, "I'll save you" and the woman with the child goes home, but the girl decides to stay with her mother and leaves town with her friends. Now the girl and others are in the town searching for the girl, and the town is full of people trying to find her. When they meet the villagers they find the girl. She is told they're looking for the child and they are afraid they'll lose the girl so they run for the door. That's it. That is when the villagers stop the fire and then the villagers fight each other fire by the villagers. The village is full with fire. The villagers then decide to go after the fire to try to protect the child from getting burned up again. They then fight back. They soon learn that there's a big fire in the fire, so they decide to use fire to burn down the house. The mother and the man who was her father strike the woman and they decide it's time to go to save the villagers from getting killed. As they run from a burning log, they burn some villagers who are trying to go in the house with the villagers and kill them. After the smoke clears, it is determined that the girl who's been in the village gets the girl to her house and burns her.  The next movie is about a bunch of villagers that are thrown off by a huge fire by some villagers, so the woman decides to get rid of the villagers who were burnt and throw them
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie before it came out on DVD, and I was very disappointed with it. I did not like it as I was a teenage boy who didn't understand what it was and was expected to understand. I don't care. It was an hour long, so I gave it a one star because it was bad. I didn't know what it is, so much. It is absolutely horrid, and there is absolutely no reason for this movie to be made. Its really not a comedy, its an insult to all comedy fans. It's really a way to waste money and/the time of watching. I can never say that this movie was funny or funny, and it is so bad I'd have to kill myself.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was awful. As I was watching it, I was thinking of the plot. As it progressed I kept thinking that it had gone through and the ending would never occur. I was a little concerned, but not because I was worried that the movie might go through and I wasn't sure if it could go through. Of course it wasn't all that. I know it wasn' just one day and not necessarily that it could happen.  A lot of this stuff comes from my childhood though.  I guess my mother got an old TOWD after the first movie and now she's looking for the first one.  So much of this is bad. The way the plot is laid out makes it look like a sitcom. There's a huge amount of detail in the film and it shows in the last 60 seconds or so of the film, but that is all over again in the DVD release.  It could be better. But if you're a movie buff and the movie you are watching, don't be one. The only way to enjoy it is just watching it in a movie theater and watching it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, the first-hand review is, "the director is terrible, not too scary to the audiences!" But this is not a complete picture.  There is a small piece of what's supposed to be a great film, and the first half of it is so bad it's annoying. It's an average Hollywood film and there's no plot except for what it has a "camera" which isn't even a plot. But this movie had such a bad acting that it is difficult to watch and that's why I don't recommend it to anyone.  So if you want to watch this movie, make a copy of this and watch it in the video store or something, maybe then, but if you decide to rent, don't waste money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete disaster and I can't believe the person who gave it a rating would want to like it.  It was obviously the biggest mistake ever, and I don't care what the other people say about it, because I hate the people who think they're like it, but I do like them. They're really just stupid, and they're the one who makes all the other stupid movies so you don't understand how silly they are.  This movie isn't just awful - it's just really crappy. I have to warn everyone out of the comments that might be written about this film and don't be one of them. This isn't even a bad piece of horror; it's an action piece that's really about making a bad joke about a movie: a film called "The Nightmare Before" is about a bunch of kids who run through the forest playing a video game in their hearts and pretend to shoot a video shoot. That's it! What a bunch? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You want to know my secret, so don't let it out. The badest aspect about this movie is the fact that the movie is not directed by the director of the film. This movie is actually supposed to be a comedy; this is a shame! You can laugh for me! I do not understand the point of this movie, but the point is that the whole thing is stupid. A big fat guy was involved in it, and I believe the way he's supposed to act is laughable. I can never find out what he was thinking. I did enjoy seeing all of this film because the fact is that it has just about as much of a story to it as I can find out. Don't watch it if you don't know what it is. You may end up getting sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of people who hate me and the fact that I'm a writer/fan, get mad at me for writing about a horror film:  The plot is good, but it is also a bit bad - and I really don't care. It is not funny. I'm sorry to be the person who didn't laugh.  A horror film is supposed to be a horror movie to be funny and/or scary; but if you only want to be scary and/only scary, you'll probably enjoy it less than a bit. Don't watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has one interesting feature - the old "slasher" motifs and the way they're put together. I really was annoyed by the fact that the plot was so contrived and the ending had such a terrible ending. This movie isn't even that good, in fact it's rather boring, but it's the only way it can be seen in a movie. The characters are all just horrible, and the movie has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. The other problem is that there are no real plotlines in this movie, as if it's going to be just a comedy, which was obviously the case in the previous movie. I would like to see another good movie that has real plot. I'm glad it was never done again - maybe some people will want to do something like it for an hour and a half or two hours. But don't let it get the ratings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with an obvious rape scene, a bunch of extras gets drunk and then get into some kind of game with a gangster who has no idea what is going on, then the game goes on and the whole movie becomes an incoherent mess. The ending seems to be nothing more than a bunchof stupid people acting as if it's a movie that's never actually been released, just to put it simply: there's absolutely no continuity or explanation. The movie starts out alright, the dialog is good and the actors are OK, and there is a pretty obvious lack of real substance to the story. I think the makers should have gone for some sort of a special effect.  But I guess that's not entirely good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is terrible. There are several problems with this movie. The script is terribly bad, the acting is bad, and the acting and cameragency are bad. I do feel sorry for the cast, the actress who isn't even very good and tries to be something glamorous but ends up acting like a slob. I mean, she is a really cute, but acting like the slob that everyone knows she's a slop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i first watched this movie in 1987, and like most movies of the era, i thought that it was trash.  But I was wrong, in some ways, and in most places, it was funny, and it was very predictable. It was a shame that it took my life.  There is no good comedy in the plot. the characters are unbelievablely unfunny and there are no laughs in the whole movie. the acting is weak, if you expect anything else to be funny. the whole cast is awful. there is also a very weak ending which I wish I had never seen before. The ending is not funny, but it was annoying.  The only thing I found mildly amusing was the fact that all of the actors in this movie played their roles really badly. I have never played any role that I thought was funny at all. I remember when I was about to go to see this movie, and I laughed at the way the actress's mouth started to tremble when she started to say something funny. I never heard this movie after the film and never played again.  This is a bad remake of a bad old movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It does nothing for the end. No plot. No acting. No suspense. No comedy. No character development. No romance. No real character development either. I found myself a bit too much of the movie. But I must say, the acting is decent, the cinematography is okay, the music is decent and the soundtrack is okay but not good. The best thing in the whole movie is the fact that this movie is made on a video camera. It wasn't even a plot, it wasn't really a plot. It really had nothing to do with the real world or anything else. In fact, it was designed to be a straight-down parody of a Japanese movie. No action! No drama! No comedy! No romance! No horror! No suspense! No anything, just a really bad film to be used for the sake of advertising. The DVD itself was better than a bad video of course, but i wouldn't even call it a comedy. Don't waste your money, buy the DVD: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even a bad flick-film since it's an obvious rip-it-and-slash style of a horror flick. The film starts as it alludes itself into a very brief prologue. What comes after that isn't a lot of what's done before, but it's not exactly a spoiler. This is just bad. The worst horror movie I've ever seen (for a horror movie it has to be at least one) - and that's a good thing for those who like it to feel like it. It's not scary, but just plain stupid and stupid. I have seen this film more than ten times and I don't want to watch it again. There's just not enough room for a scary movie to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of the movie is that a strange event is going to happen in the world. Someone is going around to find a strange person and they are going to give him the secret of how to be able to break out. It's not that there is an unexplained event, it's just that a stranger (who's part of a secret) is coming to break up one of their friends and he gives the stranger an odd and strange power. And there is no twist whatsoever to the story, and the end doesn't make much sense.  The movie's characters are simply annoying and there is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch it. I don't know if you saw this movie before or after and the director should be fired.  I don`t think it's a good movie, but I don´t see any reason to watch the sequel. It really needs to be canceled and then never seen again. I recommend skipping this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. You can't watch the intro and get the whole thing above the 40 seconds before the beginning.  The director should have read a book and get a job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's very bad, but very entertaining. The story is just bad. I'm not going to argue that it's not a story. I was disappointed by the ending. It was too long and could barely move forward one single sentence. I didn't know what the last sentence could possibly be. I thought it could be the most depressing movie of any of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was supposed to be a "comparable review of 'Candy's BFF,' 'Citizen Kane,' 'My Loved Girl,' and 'Wake Up,' which is the film's biggest gimmick. Unfortunately, the characters are not at all that funny. They are flat, annoying and just plain boring. The special effects are disappointing too. And there is nothing at all to get involved. The direction is disappointing but the special effects look good. Even the little, seemingly insignificant parts are good. The ending looks pretty silly and there is no real closure.  A good idea was a plot, a special effect, and a proper ending to a movie. But instead of all that, this movie is just a bunch of boring and forgetful music.  I've heard some people comment that this movie was bad, saying that it doesn't give a good ending. Well, it doesn´t make much sense. It is also very hard to situate. It isn´t a funny film because it seems to care too much about its very poor direction and presentation.  It´s just one long monotonal section of the movie and if the ending is satisfactory, you might find it funny. But for everyone else, this is only an unappealing and dull, meaningless mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of old-fashioned characters try to make it funny by making the movie that is supposedly a classic film. I really had fun to see this, but it is not funny.  The only thing that works, in any way, is a very poor script and a very long script. The director is so bad, that you will be left wondering why it has not already been released.  But hey, it looks like a good film - the title might even make it look good. I have heard the same film, titled "Escape The Beast", by David Gordon Lucas and Steven S. Daniels, was made by two men who actually made a better movie, "Dark Eye".  But they both have learned nothing from this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's not even a good movie about a good story; it's a total mess of the first. Even the good ones are better than this one. I don't mind telling you about how good the story is, since there is no story. The acting is bad too, and the acting is really bad. I do enjoy the character of Dr. Sami. I also like the acting of the other cast members in the movie, and feel that the movie doesn't quite fit me, personally. I was hoping that the story was good and there was something good that could happen with it. Unfortunately, there isn't a good way to handle it. A lot of people who liked it, got angry about it, and I don`t think the story line is that important. The casting is awful too, but they didn't seem to really understand it. The plot was good, but unfortunately, I don´t think there was anything good about it. They didn't make much sense in the beginning, but by the end of it I thought that the plot was about all the same boring crap. I think that the director is really guilty for not making good movies, but there is not a very good movie that could make any good effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had really hoped I could not watch this film. But I did. And I did watch it. It's just... not a good film. I find no explanation in its ending. The only thing that I liked about the film was that the cast had not been bad. I thought it was really a great film... but it really didn't care much for me. The ending is very annoying. I cannot even hear the end. I just feel like it has nothing to show for me, but I do like it for the music that comes in the beginning. But not at all. So it's not a bad film...but I'm gonna start watching it again once for a reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought there would be some funny movie when it was released. But the way it was put together really didn't do much. The plot was weak and there wasn't enough funny moments, so it wasn't funny, and it wasn`t funny enough. The other problem was that the director is probably trying to be funny. I really think that it needs to have a story of some kind, it needs some point to it, and if it wasn´s meant to be a comedy, it couldn't be too funny. It really needs a story that isn´t funny for a comedy film. I don't get what this movie was about, but I think it was just plain crazy. The only funny movie is "Cinderella" but that film is so funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised to find that the director had the time for a short break from his schedule to review it. He said he got the film and it needed to be removed from the release. So it should not be released and should not even be played in theaters. There should be no need to comment on this. Please don't be offended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film has very little substance, no plot, no humor, a few good characters, and at least a few well-thought out scenes. There is a strong contrast between a young woman in love and her family members who think that she should just take their advice and leave the marriage. The family does everything it could possibly have done and nothing could have prevented it. This film has nothing to offer, nothing to do. It is the same kind of film that the "Gobra" is made out to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the plot line. The only thing that interested me was how the man who had never seen her on screen in any way seemed to care about her. But that was the only thing I had to get out of the movie. What a horrible movie: a guy who lives in the middle of New York City, gets killed in a car accident that leads him to find her dead body and it is then he decides to go back to his home, in order to find himself some nice things. He doesn't know about how to make a car or how to find a nice house. He has a weird way of getting around. He starts trying to get a job with a restaurant who thinks he can help them, and he thinks he's the guy who can be helpful to them, but because he gets stuck in New York, he becomes obsessed and gets killed by people who are very hostile and don't care what he says. He soon has his dead body back and he finds his wife again (who is dead and his son is alive) and there is not a clear connection between the two of them, even though he has seen them all in the past. A movie about a guy not even having a connection with a stranger is a disaster, and I cannot recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was a pretty weak and the acting was awful. The ending didn't make it a comedy at all. But if you can find yourself a copy of it, you can watch it for a laugh. The point is that this movie is an attempt to bring in a 'charm of evil' which we are still on as we watch it. I really enjoyed the film, but if it had any substance, it could be funny, but unfortunately, it was so lacking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the last episode I watched one of two episodes of this movie so far. The episode was an inversion of the previous episode which is a plot, but it wasn't good! The story was extremely disappointing - the premise was awful and the actors were not good.  I don't even watch the movie to understand how stupid it is - not even in the sequel.   If you like a movie then this movie isn't for you.  If they made the sequel because they could make a better one then it is OK - but don't make the sequel if you like to see the sequel and don't want to know what the sequel is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As you all know, I was fortunate to be the last person who went to see this movie. This was awful. There are no suspense whatsoever. There is no plot, no plot. No plot, not really a good story. It is so bad that the only thing that makes it watchable is the people on stage, so that's it. If you want to see an interesting film in the "real" world, then watch "The Matrix". It is not an actual documentary, and no one was actually in the real world, but I think it was made up for being stupid to make it a "documentary", just to amuse people. But that's the only good thing about this movie: not having an actual film or having a real plot. It was just one of those stupid, stupid, and depressing movies. If they didn't even have a single person in it, I don't even want to know what is it about. The worst part about this film is the script. The script is so predictable that it's so bad, that it is only predictable. It's so predictable, so boring, that even a few days after seeing it, that I almost had to tear myself up again. I have only watched two or so hours of it, and I am still having nightmares. I'm not sure if the people involved in this film are aware of the serious problems in the world that we are trying to fix. The movie does have some good points, especially in terms of some interesting and well-developed character characters, such as the "Dooray Man" and "Shining Star", but they are just in the wrong places for the whole of the film. The whole thing is simply awful. If people want to go to see a "real movie" based on a "film" based off of a bad film, I'd say "Don't buy it." But you can't watch it without watching the actual film, and you're only slightly entertained. And as a person who was expecting a good movie, even if you liked the movie, I would strongly doubt whether the people at the studio behind it actually intended to make the movie more interesting than the original script and its characters.  If you were expecting to watch something with a very interesting plot, then try the real film: "The Legend of Zuma".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and the acting, which are both very bad, have been done so badly that I don't even recommend this for the sake of entertainment, but for the fact that this movie is so bad that it would not even fit any rating. I don\'t recommend this movie, but it does feature the very worst acting in movies. I wish my rating had been higher than 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I read this, I decided to warn everyone else to avoid this movie. I can never forget the first few days of my life spent watching this film, and I hate it. I'm just sick of watching this terrible film, even after I saw it for the second time and finally understood its horrible nature. I don't know why anyone would even think this film is good. I hope someone will use their imagination to think better about this movie than I did. It's so depressing, even when the characters are all good. One of my friends had a great memory in this movie, about how the writer made a movie, and when he wrote the movie, it was about the "best movie ever", the best in the country. He said it was stupid. This is the worst movie in the entire movie line, but if I had to watch this movie again, I wouldn't even watch it again. Don't waste your time, don't waste time on this movie unless you can do better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been a while since I've watched this movie I was really annoyed. I found it in the DVD pack on Amazon, so I didn't bother searching for it on iTunes. That was pretty bad. What was the problem? Well, I guess it's a really bad movie, for every story it has a totally bad ending. The plot is really terrible. I find it amusing that it starts with a really sad ending, and the movie ends with a sad ending. A sad ending should never be the final one of a movie. The ending of this movie was just a bit too sad to me, and I feel like that could have been some sort of an ending. But I think this is more like a story of people's life and loss. There was a really good scene at the end, though, which ended with a very sad ending in the end. I don't think I'm a bad person for watching this movie, but I am a bit embarrassed watching this! It was a bad flick, I don. I didn. I just don't understand what was the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "One Night" should be remembered as an embarrassing piece of film. The plot is somewhat corny and there's some good jokes but there are too many of them. The script is bad as well, there are many jokes that I wouldn't care to hear. The acting is not good either, the dialog is so weak that it is hard to listen to. This is a classic example of an ill-performing actor and a movie that needs better direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not an expert on the subject at all, but I would assume that you are.  I was expecting to enjoy this film, especially when I saw the title. It was very disappointing when I actually saw it. The story was completely nonsensical. When the protagonist, Anna was attacked by the unknown, it seemed like a plot line. It is absolutely preposterous to expect him to be able to overcome all obstacles and defeat all enemies.  When the characters are getting to grips with life, it becomes hard to understand what's happening.   Even after being attacked by a stranger, Anna still can't get to her feet and even if she's finally overcome, she gets angry.  The only time I really enjoyed the film was when it was in the middle of shooting. When we were in the scene of her struggle, and then at the point where she had finally gotten her feet, she seemed to get sad and sad, but she was in good spirits.  Even now, I have no doubt that she had a great opportunity to defeat this evil. Unfortunately, she couldn't overcome it and, in fact, I felt like I had been on the verge of dying and was in fear. I suppose, the story is about her finally getting revenge on the evil guy. This is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth watching, but it has a pretty good soundtrack to go with it, so if you have some money, you should watch it and then watch yourself cry.  The ending is not funny, nor did it really take effect until it came out. However the plot is so weak, and the dialog was very poor. It seemed like an open-source project with a lot of room for money and room for bad jokes, and no real purpose. It was also the director and lead writer's fault. They tried to write a funny movie, but instead wrote a movie that was too long and not interesting.  Some have criticized this movie for not being funny. I have to agree with the critics. They don't take into account the funny funny things that the main characters are, like the hilarious guy who is wearing a baseball cap. I would have liked a bit of humour in the movie, since it was not about a full-time joke.  I can't say what the point of this movie was supposed to be. There are very few jokes here. However, I cannot say that this movie is good or funny, not that they are too good for the viewer, as it is a really low effort. Some people say they dislike the movie because of its length, but I disagree. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happened during the first episode of this movie was the character that was supposed to be the most important character in the first couple of episodes. But after that time, the series as a whole was going to lose all interest in making this film. The script that was used was nothing but completely useless, and the ending was simply bad.  The story, acting, and acting was so bad, that I think I'm going to have to find a way to write this thing off. It's just bad. The acting is bad, the dialog is bad. I'm not sure what's to do next. There is no room for drama in this movie, and if you want to make a decent movie, then make the movie. But, for this, it just had to go. The whole plot is just about as predictable as the story in a series of the Star Wars movies. And even the characters and their interactions are just a bit predictable and dull. The cast is very boring, and I would never be surprised to find out any interesting details. I'd be surprised if there were people like this actors.  I wish I could have some kind of way to salvage this movie into something better. Otherwise, it's just way too short, and way too long. If this movie is going to be a series that doesn't completely break from it's own formula, then at least there are enough decent scenes to go for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the best movie I have seen for a long time, and it wasn't even good when it was supposed to be a thriller! And oh, the time I'd spent to sit through this movie could only take away ten minutes. I just don't want this movie to be one of those "horror movies", although it is a very good horror film. I do not even like gore. I don't know why people like this movie, because they make it look so nice! You would think a horror movie is about gore? Well, I like gore, so I'm sure there is gore, but I'm afraid to be scared.  It also fails to finish the film. It just comes out like it's something from the Twilight Zone. There are no blood-gelling scenes, but when the blood ishes off, it turns into something else. I tried my best not to like it. I think the director was making a movie based on a horrible premise. The people who have been enjoying this movie were probably thinking that it is going to be good for horror movies. Because there were no blood scenes, it seems to be about gore, which just goes against everything else. There were no explanation of how the characters became bloodthirsty. There was nothing in the film that could make the other audience think the movie was a horror film, so it wasn´t a horror-movie, and would it be an appropriate horror movie. It was just a very bad film.  The other film I like, this was also called the Twilight-Zone series. The remake, however, doesn´t look like Twilight Zone, which I would have expected the original to have better blood-spelting and gore scenes. The original Twilight Zone is so good. The first film, Twilight Zone: Dawn Of the Monster, is a horror and horror movie, but unfortunately not a good one.  This is an even worse sequel of the original Twilight-zone film. If you don´t know what Twilight Zone was about, check out Twilight Zone or any of its sequels. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the reviews of this bad movie very difficult to find out what was wrong with it. If you watch it for what it was, you may find yourself very confused as the plot is so bad and the movie is so hard to understand. The ending is not the worst movie I have ever seen. It is also somewhat funny when we see the fact that we are supposed to watch this film. If they would have made it a better film, I would have liked to see the ending. They actually tried to go to the end and we have to watch the credits. I think that this movie is no longer funny and it should never have been made. Also, I think the film's cinematography is very bad. I would like to have it reclassified. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You don't need to have a DVD set to be able to watch this bad piece of work. You donno need to be a fan of this crap, but it is very bad! The acting is awful - I'm sure the director is a genius, but this piece of crap is bad enough. I'm willing to see this on the screen, I'm ready to pay to rent it and never watch another bad movie ever again! If you find this bad film, try it and laugh it at the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the first attempt I have seen of the low-budget indolence trend that was so prevalent in the 1950s.   I'm not going to review these two movies but I'll give my take.  It's a simple, but awful script with poor direction and acting. The movie starts out well, with some pretty good jokes (but there are no jokes in this one, because the characters are stupid).  But the movie ends up boring because the script is too bad, with a very poor and unsatisfying ending that I found incredibly stupid. I won't even remember it when I saw it again.  But hey, you've seen it all the way up and down.  I'll have my friend to laugh for all the jokes. I don't even care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to like this movie because I like all movies with a plot. This movie just got one good line in a movie: "It looks like something has never happened, just to me it is... strange. So strange...", "It is like something was never there." It does not do justice to any of the other characters. I don't think anyone should find this movie to be good, especially because it just plays out of character time, which would be boring. I found this movie extremely stupid and didn't really care for the acting or the dialog, and the movie had a very bad ending. The ending is stupid, and not even funny, which was odd since it was based on a TV series, and that is really a factor of not having a real ending. I just didn't like this crappy film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the good guys (Gem) and the movie they made. I also like the old school of rock & roll music. It was all a bad idea. I had to see it to see the movie. After seeing it I was sick. I didn't like the people in the movie and the ending was annoying. The ending didn't work, the actors were so bad they didn't look like heroes. I'm going to miss my childhood, and I'm sure I'm just going to stop all my music watching. I know I'm still a fan of it, but it's a bad sequel. The movie is a waste of money, and it is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to comment on the acting that I did not like to see. They weren't acting at all, they weren't moving well together. The acting was bad at first I found the whole thing so weak, that I found myself in tears at one scene.  The acting didn't hold back what the movie really contained. It just wasn't realistic.  There was no drama with the villains. The villains would have done what they had planned for. The film didn't even have a real ending, which made me feel that they weren' just puppying their enemies.  I feel that this film is the kind of garbage that everyone has come to expect from a remake of the film that's just so bad. It's a little sad to have one of your favorite movies being remade for the remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never laughed so much at a bad film since I first saw this film. I didn't know that it was a remake of a movie but it sure was. What was worse than that was the fact that it didn't really care much about the plot and that it seemed to be on the same footing as the original. I did get interested after reading the movie and the plot was a little bit interesting. I thought that I had to get involved and then I realized that it would be quite pointless. I'm not sure if this was a film at all or an abomination but it is still an extremely bad movie and I would never finish watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was only an improvement on "The Last Resort", which had a pretty good story and decent story and the plot was good, but it lost that "feel" it had earlier in the series. I mean the plot is good, not that much, but there was no story, not much plot development. If you like movies like "The Jungle", or "The Sentinel", you will be disappointed. The plot was about half a sentence, and the movie ends in a fairly short time.   Still, if you liked movies like those two, take a closer look at them. I give this one three stars out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a little bit disturbed by the way that this movie is being made. I've never really seen this movie, so I thought that the directors would at least make the actors look a little less pretentious. And the movies were so bad they didn't even fit the story, and I was so upset that I was just turned off and didn't watch the whole movie. But if you read my review of the movie, it's not bad by and against. Just bad. I'm not a movie reviewer, but i do think this movie could have been better. But it also has problems that might make me depressed. My only word is that the acting in the movie is so bad, and the dialog is so poor, that it's just not believable to anyone. And I wish they would have had the courage to put these actors in a proper movie. The actors in the movies are so flat, and so bad that there's just nothing for them to succeed in acting. And there is nothing for the producers in this movie to do, because if there were any lessons to teach, they need to follow them in a movie.  There's a few good moments in the film, but don't expect that for a long time. If you like watching movies, don't watch it, and just be happy that it doesn't kill your interest. This movie wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Movie that Never Should Have Been: The Movie that No Where Should Ever Have Been After" has come out. I'm not sure if it was directed by one or two of the writers on this movie. The movie is about a family who get together and start looking for jobs. This is not that movie. I think there should have been a movie that ended.  The main character is not very interesting. The only two characters in the movie are two middle aged women and two women who have not done their job properly. I don't see how it was supposed to finish.  "Cauthenz's World" has another movie with a great storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in the theater on Friday evening. I was skeptical about the acting and pacing and was even slightly concerned with the premise. I even thought that it was a "made-for-tv" movie.  But what does this have to do with the rest of the movie? It is not a straight-back, "serious" film, but more like a "wacky movie". And if the acting is terrible, I would like to see it again. The only thing I liked was the ending. It was a bit too long and made me wonder if the producers knew how to end the movie. I wasn't able to watch this movie and get all the other characters involved in it and get on with them.  The worst part of the film is the ending of the story. I believe there are two endings. There are the first and the second. I think it is a made-for*tv movie, and the people who are made into the show, or even the people that are making it, are also made into fools. I hope that the actors are making this in their lives. It is an awful movie that is full of lame clichés and pretense and nothing to a serious drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a mix of boring, predictable dialogue, and a lot of silly acting. I don't see the ending, but I did like the way they played off a pair of old, fat old ladies. I wish them to change the story.  I had to go to my room to see it on the VCR and it wasn't even funny. Even after I tried to sit in my chair, I couldn't keep sitting down.  Don't waste your time, because the rest of your life will not be much easier than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst of all time. It was the worst one I have seen.  This is a bad parody that tries to be funny, but fails. This movie was so terrible that I didn't want to watch it. I couldn't find anything about it to compare it with any of the other horror movies. And the other guy is the same person I saw in the earlier "The Legend". It didn't make me feel like a zombie! It is not funny, and it is terrible.  I hope you like the original Halloween movie, which is also funny, or another horror movie I didn´t know if I'm watching it on the video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, with the addition of a little extra scene where a couple is sitting on the couch.  There's a couple of good scenes and scenes, but the overall scene is just awful. The character is annoying and just plain boring, which would be okay if it were an animated film.  This is another long-winded sequel with no real story, a plot that is totally unnecessary. I have no idea why this was made, even though it was made for an animation medium.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this with the intent to see what the other reviewers said to me about it. I mean I'm a big film fan and would like to go watch something to enjoy. So I saw this movie and the reviews say "well I really liked this movie" and the reason why was because there were all kinds of problems with it. The first problem was that it was a soap opera. Also, the acting was bad. Also the action scene was absolutely awful, the story was not believable, and the dialog was not realistic. I won't comment on that, because this movie has no real substance, no story to tell a story, no action to give a emotion, no plot to follow and no characters to speak. And the music is really awful. It sounds like a porn movie. There were a few parts that were interesting to me, but most of them seemed to be in the final weeks of the project, and even the most respected voices of the cast didn't get in the end and get the plot moving along. The final problem of all is that the movie doesn't have a premise. The movie is not a comedy, it's just a soap movie. What happened? This is supposed to be a story about a soap drama, but I think it would be a comedy if it was only a comedy. In fact, it really was a comedic soap opera, about a guy who thinks he's a hero because he can control an entire nation.  If you see it like a comedy movie, you wouldn't necessarily get bored, and when it is acted, it won't be funny. Also I was hoping that it wasn't a film to be used for a children, and so if a kids movie doesn a lot of laughs, I think they'll enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still laughing about this awful sequel. I've seen the original version (with its wonderful, beautiful, and gorgeous musical score, but also a wonderful sequel) in the first episode, and I'm pretty sure that it is not in any way worth the money that it cost. This sequel was so bad that I thought I'd just have to see how it would behave. The musical score was a waste of time, which I find the soundtrack a little too shallow. I didn't care much for the original score. I just wanted something to go in with it. I tried to listen, and found myself thinking that the music was much better. If you want to waste more money, don't get a second one of this crappy sequel.  I did not expect my friends to like this, but I wasn't exactly thrilled by it. It's just too bad to be a film that had such good music, in my opinion. I gave it the name "Ode". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a positive review about one good movie: The good movie was nice, the bad movie is bad. And I would like to give this movie a lot of credit. But the bad-movie-making is really the big secret. Don't be a movie-goer. Don "Tear the fear of heights" your heart and try not to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just leaves you thinking they are making you think about the horrible people being around the world. I believe that when the movie was at least decent, it would have been better than this one. Now it just leaves me thinking that the writer has screwed over all of us in the world, who else? I don't think that would be true, it probably would. But I do think that if you actually liked the movie, you probably wouldn't have come out to say, "I hate this movie", because I would think that most of us would.  But when this movie is over, you are left wondering how it all started, what is it going, and how many more movies like it have gone.  This isn't a good movie, at all. It should not be taken seriously. But if it doesn't kill you, it will most certainly kill your life. The only time I ever saw this movie was in 1999 when I rented it on VHS. I remember this movie as nothing more than a droning, over-the-top horror movie, but it was good to see the people get hurt. It's not even funny.  It's only sad and sad that we have all these types of movies going in. I'm a member of the film festival that hosts this film festival. The festival is still going, but I wouldn't believe it if they were really making it anymore. If you are hoping to see more horrible, over the-top, horror movies, I wouldn be waiting to see these films. They may appear, but you'll still have to buy something, which is why it never gets canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a lot of acting. That's bad on the face of it. I'm not sure if it's the acting or the acting. The script is stupid and pretentious and I can't imagine how someone can watch it. This film is completely predictable and fails to take the most part of the movie's premise. I found myself laughing at it and found myself crying at the very end. It's also really hard to watch because there's no emotion. No emotion and no direction. It is not entertaining to watch and listen to. There's no idea.  I'm a fan of horror, but this just isn't scary. If you have nothing else to watch, don't watch this film. If something is good, watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just terrible. It is absolutely pathetic and it is not entertaining. I mean you'll feel like laughing at the fact that the women of the film get all the way through the scene without stopping.   I'm a man who has to give this movie credit for that fact. It was not a good movie at all. If you want to see something that's truly bad then get a lot of stuff on your mind. If that is the case don't bother me.  I will give this film 10/10 for one thing and 10/7 for no other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is pretty much one of the worst movie ever made. It is full of horrible, disgusting characters and a plot that just plain sucks. I gave this movie a 3 out 1 score because it's a piece of trash. The plot is so bad that I'm a little embarrassed for having wasted the time to watch it. If you can't wait for the credits to finish the film, you might as well watch the video in the video store. But don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is bad, and there is nothing redeeming about it. This film has nothing good about it, and I have no idea why it got nominated for an Oscar. I'm still wondering why this film was ever released. The plot is an hour and a half, and the whole thing could have been done without the need for a second movie. If you can watch the movie, don't get out of it. Avoid it, even if it makes your life a little bit better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can believe that it's the same script that makes the original version better. I mean I get the script was bad, but I think the movie is pretty terrible. You get the same old stuff, the acting is terrible, and there's nothing much to watch except the first 3 or 4 minutes. The characters are terrible. What happened to me was like they are really stupid.  I mean they are so stupid that they are unbelievable. I don't think a man who worked in the industry for more than 15 years (I was part of that industry) and made this movie is even a funny.  This movie didn't even have a director. It was made so late that I didn't know who was directing it. There wasn't one decent movie made after the original. The director made no attempt to make the movie funny. The only thing I would recommend for this movie would be a really good animated film. I think it is very sad to see one of those movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always been a big fan of Disney, but this is the first time I was ever offended by a Disney film.  The plot is terrible, the acting is bad, and the special effects are terrible.  I really was hoping that this film would end up being so bad that no one would bother it. Alas, it does not. It was disappointing to watch it. And the best part of the movie is the special effect that has nothing to do with the story, and I laughed while it was going through. That's an insult! What I mean, this movie is a complete waste of time. It just needs some better special effects to match the movie. And don't get too close to Disney. This isn't a good way to get your entertainment on. The Disney stars can go on and on and do their job, and you don't want to waste time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is absolutely ridiculous, the actors/writers just don't have a clue. The first twenty minutes are completely incoherent and the plot is not even vaguely apparent. The next twenty minutes have the same plot progression, but with the same cast that was the last half of this movie. If you've seen "Frozen", and even remembered it, you would understand how these actors acted (I had). The film has a few moments that are good. They get a few funny lines here and there. There is a small, almost insistent scene that could have been cut loose from the original, but at least the scene with the two guys dancing is pretty amusing. But the movie is just plain awful. This is a movie that is bad for us, the viewer of the original who has no clue of what's going on in it, and the viewer who is a child. This movie fails as an attempt to create a decent animated animation. The plot is so bad that you think the movie actually has to be an adventure, and it's just not a lot of fun to watch. It also fails as a romance and nothing with the girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did not like this movie. I think that it was either a bad film or a bad remake of a bad sequel to the horror genre. There were some good parts, but it was completely unnecessary and just stupid.  I give it one star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a little frustrated at this movie, I mean I am so used to see it, so I cannot understand why it took 15 years to make it. The worst of the 20th century movies has never been so bad and this is just one of the worst! I am also a huge Star Trek fan, but I understand why people will think that it is bad because it is so obvious and not funny to say this, and there is an element of humor in this that is just bad.  The worst movie ever was the "Star Trek IV" movies, but if you are not going to see them or watch them on TV, you can never be in complete disbelief about them. There is a lot of things going wrong in "Star Wars" movies like these, and it doesn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a funny film, at least from the comedy direction that I've seen. I thought the acting was okay, but the ending was completely predictable. I was annoyed by the ending. When the movie ended, it was only the first time I had watched it. I've just watched it twice so far. I cannot afford to waste the next time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have only seen this movie in the cinema club at the end of the summer, but what about all those other actors?  I just saw this movie as a result of a group of students who were in the movie.  This is nothing but a horrible script. There are no suspense, no suspense whatsoever, just horrible and unbelievable scenes with no context, no explanation whatsoever, and no closure whatsoever. This movie fails to even qualify as a film in the best of all kinds.  The cinematography is horrible, the directing of the plot is poor, the acting is bad, the editing is bad and the cinematography has awful effects. If you look at this movie with some faint hope, then feel confident at the fact that it is a really bad movie. However, for the fans of "The Incredible Spider-Man" movies, you'll need to know there is a certain kind of joy that comes from their entertainment. You'll need some serious thinking before watching this movie. It doesn't mean you're over a movie, it just means you have no desire to continue to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst remake of "Dolphin" ever made and I am appalled that they dared to take it seriously. This movie is no "Dixie" like the movie originally made for the "The One More" and it is so bad that you feel like a child trying to drown you. I know, this is the same movie they made in "The Three Little Sisters", the movie will never be made again and I'm glad to see that the one day of its filming was cancelled.  However, I think that some of the people who made this movie should have to try making a better version.  I've seen more of the original than this movie and I have seen a few more of its trailers. I'm hoping that the people behind this movie will have an idea of how to make a better movie, but i'm not going to write my opinion on how they made this or a better film.  If they tried making a movie with a better plot, a better script, and a better ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit, I can't believe anyone's ever seen this movie. I just went to see it because my sister told me it had a good ending. The plot and the ending aren't that good and the story is bad. I understand it's not intended to be a "horror film", but it is scary nonetheless. I can imagine how people can really get hurt from it and I'm afraid it could very easily kill them. I don't know what is going on here. What could be the reason for this movie? It just seems like there's so many questions that need answers that should never be resolved in a movie. How many questions have I answered and not only? What happened when it happens and what is it about? What could I find out about my sister's husband that happened? All of the dialog? What makes it scary? How's it all going for? How could this happen? How am I supposed to feel if it's meant to scare a friend?  The only thing that makes it more scary is that I just watched it again and I cannot believe a girl can do that, much less a guy that's doing the same thing. That's like I have only watched this film twice so far and there's no way I'll believe a guy can do it twice and survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to watch this film. The only thing that keeps me from sitting through this crap is a really good actor who could do good work. However, I just wish I could get some enjoyment from the story. I can't stand for the fact that they are going for two different stories. If you watch this movie, you will NEVER get any enjoyment out of the first story. The acting is horrible and the script is awful and unbelievable. I'd recommend watching this film in the middle of the night for a quick laugh. But after seeing it, you won't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch this film because my brother's sister was a friend of the movie and she loved it. I was not impressed and I was surprised by the ratings. There was absolutely no plot, and not one line. I wasn't even in the film but I felt like I should be in the movie, so I gave it to anyone who wanted to see it, then I got to go to my sister's room and had sex with her. When she went in the bathroom and I saw the movie she made me cry. I didn't know if she was a lesbian, and I had to wait till a few weeks later. I had sex that day and after seeing it again I couldn't sleep for more than a few hours. When I got off at the end I couldn`t even remember the movie. I think I made a positive review about the movie: It is a pity as I thought my sister liked the movie so much more than she did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well the first thing I noticed was the casting of Robert Crumley and George Whitehead were both good, but at the end i thought that they should be removed, which they were at the beginning. And when I saw the introduction and farewell of the two actors, I just felt sorry for the film that didn't follow the plot. It was a horrible disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching this movie for about 2 minutes now and I'm still reeling about the plot and the direction. The script is terrible. The acting in this movie is so bad that I've stopped watching and stopped writing. A few lines in the movie, a few things that are supposed to have been in a movie are missing from the beginning. I can't even see that they're trying to make it funny. This is truly a disaster. If you see this movie with any intention of being funny, I think you'll lose your mind. It's really sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poorly-filtered movie with some decent acting and a pretty woman who's not even given to the movie. What's up with that? The movie's not a comedy and there are no jokes to be found. It's just a straight-up B-movie with a very low budget and no plot. It is nothing short of an old school horror movie that I would not recommend watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a funny little movie, but it's not one I would recommend watching. This movie is very sad - the idea that the first female movierunner, who was supposed to be the best writer at this time, was at least nominated for an award on a very low budget movie (like this one), a show that fails to make the movie seem even remotely entertaining, as in other reviews. That's sad, because the other person with the show is a really good actress.  I've seen this movie once. I think the director (who is also the director on the show, and I've also seen his previous work on "Crown" and his other TV show "The Last Call" was bad, and even worse when he wrote this movie. It is a pretty bad movie, and it deserves to have two stars, but I can't say that about the person who is starring in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise behind this is pretty stupid. It has no plot and no story whatsoever, but it gives you a few good laughs with a very stupid premise. The only thing about the premise makes this a good comedy!  The ending is so bad that it deserves an inversion. The ending has nothing to do with what really happened in the movie.  But, to be fair, I had seen this movie before on my birthday and I remember it was the most disappointing Christmas movie I've ever seen. I can't even say that it was good. But I do love movies with a strong storyline and good acting, so this movie ruined the Christmas fun of many people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fairly inexperienced writer, and while I think I can do better than this, I cannot write about it.  There are three or four plots in this movie, I can't tell what they are. I don't know the names of the characters, and I haven't watched this movie and tried it, even though it's available on Amazon. I thought this movie was good when I saw it in video form on YouTube a few years ago, but I'm afraid to see it again, and now I've heard that it has been advertised as having "greatly amusing dialog". I'm sorry, but it really is just plain awful. There are no lines for the characters; there are no story arcs, no character development, no plot. No funny dialog; no funny. No plot. The dialog is bad. And the movie contains a disturbing number of sub-parts that should be removed from the movie, as well as those parts that should not have been included.  But the worst part is in the fact that it says that these four characters are not really connected with one another, and that it doesn't really explain what happened to them in the end. This isn't really a mystery. There is a clear conflict in their personalities.  One of them is in love with another, who apparently kills off his partner and takes the wife to a forest to get revenge on him for having murdered his wife. The other partner, the father, thinks the dead guy is the only good thing in his life. The man gets drunk, the girl turns up the cellar and comes to the forest and does what I call "snapping their dead bodies", leaving the father to go to his dead-level grandmother's funeral home. He then starts crying for her, and she is screaming and he runs into a fire. Afterward, the woman is screaming, and he shoots her. When the girl is finally found, she dies, and the woman and father are mourning their dead partner, so their children are left confused about why they died and how they're alive. Then, when the women try to make sense of their lives, they don't find the place where they will meet the dead man and the father's father. The woman and the man's children go to the other house and find the key to find the father. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is only a good movie because it's a straight up zombie f*cker! It was about 20 minutes long and was about two scenes a day. It's just plain boring, and there were no real plotlines, the people involved were boring, the special effects were awful. But at the end of the movie I was crying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I am saying is that you cannot even remember who the two people were in the film. My friend, John Howard's character was an older man who had not even been in one movie, and when the director found the other, he seemed as if he had been set up for such a project. And he didn't see his mother and his daughter in the movie, or at the very least was in the family. This movie is an insult to all that have aged for generations. It is an incredibly bad film, as well as a low-budget movie for a first-rate actor to make, and the actors are so badly cast in the whole thing that it must be an incredibly awful film. If you're reading this review, please don't be watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I know, this movie is about the 3rd best thing I have ever seen in this movie. The music was bad, the acting was bad to the point of bad. I think the movie is a piece of crap. I don't know why it is so stupid and yet I have watched it so many times. I feel the movie could be better, but I don\'t have any idea how to do anything. I'm sure the director and the cast are good enough, but this is simply a waste of time. I wish I were in a room with people who laughed and made jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't see any rational discussion about this movie. This movie is a complete disaster. I'm so depressed I didn't even want to see it. I couldn't stop looking at it, it just kept sinking my mind. This is a pretty bad movie for a few reasons. 1. The story is so bad that the actors get it right. They just show it the way it's going. The actors are so stupid and they can't follow and the dialog is terrible. 2. The acting is bad. I've never seen this movie before and I know I never would want to. 3. The music is awful, awful bad. 2-5 out of 10.  The acting has absolutely awful. It's bad, and if you watch it alone, don't waste your time watching it.  If you're interested in a bad film, then watch this movie instead of the very good one: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the very first time because of the trailer. I have seen this movie in theaters, on cable stations and online. But now I cannot see it on DVD. This movie has a VERY bad acting (like a few acting actors). I don't know if it's just an acting style, like "Crisis". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off the bad acting. It looks like a little brother with a bad brother. I've seen a million movies like this, that I would definitely laugh at. My favorite is... "Havenabe". That movie was awful. It wasn't even good when it was in the script. Even if it was one of the better movies of the decade, it could have been worse.  There was one scene in the beginning that made me laugh. "Won't give you my life, just to start a movie..." oh lord, that's too much for those who just want to sit around. The other movie was the "Cuck Off". Of course, I thought it was a good movie, but I didn't think it was that good.  The acting is bad, and the acting isn't that good, but the acting is good. It's not worth seeing for one second, and I don't want to read for the rest of the time, and this is a movie to watch for only if it's a short time. I can only recommend this movie because of my desire to punish those who took the idea of trying to get into a movie about gay porn, and most of the people who didn't take this movie seriously won't be willing to see it. It doesn't matter if you like the movie or not, I hate it because it is so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in a really bad movie. The movie is terrible, the acting is bad, the plot is bad. Basically, what made this movie so bad is the fact that it is made to be short.  The story was okay, the story was alright, the characters were good, the cast was good. But the actors were not good, and the ending was terrible. The plot was not good. The ending was very unsatisfying and really not good considering it was about a story. I cannot say more than that.  There was really nothing to see the film except a few good moments.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie a little weak but not bad. This is the worst thing I have ever seen. I didn't even go to my high school's library to rent it out for my friend. I think my friend and I made sure to rent this movie when it came out when I was a kid and didn't think about it for 20 years. And, oh, it's so bad. I don't know what this movie was in the future. I've only seen it once but I heard something about this movie because I rented it. And I really do have to give it a bad rating. It's not only terrible, it is so bad that my only thing that it has in it is that it contains so many horrible things. I had to be very careful watching this movie. There were so many bad things that I wanted to avoid. What's the point of making this movie? Why the hell is there a movie: It's so stupid! I donno need to see this movie more than once! I really did like other movies, and I think a good movie is one that can give you some great thrills. If you like these movies and want to rent some bad movie then watch it, because you'll feel like a true film. I could tell you that a movie is not a great movie but it is still pretty good to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was really disappointing. I'm really surprised that I only found out about this when I was in my local supermarket. I saw this movie in the theater a few years ago and it still was a bad film. I hope that it's not that bad. I'd just like to see another film that is more depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for this movie for a while and decided it was good. It didn't have any substance. It was not a comedy nor comedy, it was an action movie. The story is so stupid it is hard to watch. It's not a film you want to rent, it's just a comedy that takes half of the screen time. Its the same kind of movie as the bad 'Sons of New York' in the 'Rapper' movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You guys are lucky if you all read the previous movie: http://www.slowerthenbrief.com/2006-01/best-of-every-episode-n-5-of1-9. In the sequel, you have to follow the instructions. Don't even ask! If you read the first film, you might get the first part of this movie, but you can't follow those instructions.  This is not a good movie, nor a good comedy. I wish there were some better films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie for about a couple hours. I was really bored after watching it. I wasn't even interested in this movie. I'm only a 10 year old, and they didn't make it so interesting. The best thing about the movie is the fact that it's in 2D. I couldn't even tell whether it's 3D. Just a few minutes into the movie, and I knew something was really wrong. But then I get bored. So there's two negatives. Don't see this movie if you're scared of a sequel of this movie because of the same cast (Daryl) for some reason.  There's no good way to say what this movie is about. It is just a bad comedy movie that has the same ending. And I want to say something about this movie: No one is really interested in the storyline, but I can really believe this movie isn't that bad. It's just another one of the "sick" horror movies, and it makes you sick and sick.  I'll watch again because it has something interesting, but this movie just doesn't make much difference. It just sucks when you're bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think this could have been made. It's absolutely awful to have seen this film. There were no decent dialogue for this film whatsoever. I laughed for those who laughed at the actors for having only one decent scene, which was one of the most disappointing scenes of the film. I really felt like the whole film was so low budget. I didn\'d really like this film, but I'm not gonna be surprised if I ever saw it again, even after the fact that I already saw it. I think the film had its good qualities, but if you're willing to be spoiled and make fun of the way the actors acted, you'll only miss so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains only three plot lines. They are the plot lines which could be a plot of a film. This movie is just so bad that it could be laughed off by the audience. I just can't see how anyone could enjoy it. I can't even call it a funny movie.  The story is about a middle school teacher who's obsessed with the school teacher that takes his own course and is obsessed with her school teacher. The movie starts with a bunch of fake movies with the real teacher. One movie involves a student that was sent to an alternative school to get out of the school. A few of these movies ended with a real teacher showing his class a mock-video tape of the teacher and students. Then the teacher gets out of school to take his lesson to his classmates.  And one movie includes a fake movie that includes a kid with a giant penis. And the kid gets into an accident that happens when he and his classmate try to get revenge on the teacher. This is the movie. It's awful.  There is so little fun in this movie. I find it difficult to watch.  I'm just a few months after the movie and still, I can only say that I can not enjoy it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on the internet and I have been skeptical on it ever since. I don't know how it could have been saved from a better sequel. In retrospect I thought this was about the same as "I Want the Girl Who Does It." Unfortunately, it's got worse. A couple of plot lines, like a little girl with an owl, get boring and the movie becomes predictable. Then the movie goes about being totally unrealistic and then there are no real twists. The ending is predictable and there are hardly any real emotion.  But it's not like any other movie: it has absolutely nothing to do with the world, its characters are boring, and it doesn't make you care what happened or how it happened.  I think its a waste of money, too. The plot isn't even believable, the camera is bad, and the characters are totally uninteresting. It isn't about the most interesting movie ever, but for anyone that likes watching sex and murder films, that's good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most terrible movie ever. I've never been so disappointed with the crappy movies I have been used to. I was expecting something good. This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen, I didn't know whether I had been burned to death or even like it. I'm embarrassed to say, there are some funny bits but it's a terrible disaster! Don't get me wrong, I liked my first memory of watching the movie when it was about 8 minutes into the movie and after 8 minutes, I just stopped. It was awful! It just doesn't make any sense. I'll say, "I didn't get this one for a while, I did get it in the beginning of the movie, I give it another try after seeing it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been reading this movie for years, and have noticed that the plot and acting are weak, but not in the way of the first. I have heard people saying they are watching it to enjoy "Die Hard" and "The Stunt. They are neither, nor do I believe they are, as it is supposed to be a horror film. This is a disgrace of all kinds of film. If you watch it for the fun of it, or for the thrill of a scary horror flick, you will likely find yourself getting bored from the second story to the fourth story. The main reason I have rated this is the ending, which I believe is the worst thing I've seen in this year. I think it is a horror movie, but at the same time, I believe it is worse than all of the other horror movies. It is bad because it has so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and it fails miserably as a horror plot. The characters do not act in a logical manner, and I do not understand how they are supposed to act. I would recommend the title for a horror-themed horror movie. It does, however, deserve to be more than a horror story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you really want to find out a little piece of history, then this movie will be disappointing. And don't take advantage of the DVD version which features a little historical tidbits. This is also disappointing if you think historical information is the thing that attracts you to this movie. Just don't do this movie! There is no way that any of the actors' names have not been mentioned or that the actors have not done some research themselves. This movie is not good because it fails in every possible way.  The movie starts off with one of the film's biggest problems--the lack of dialogue and the slow pacing. When I watched it, it seemed to be an interesting and interesting movie, but what happens when it plays out is just boring.  Also, it was a bad video-television movie. The actors are simply too young. It is just too hard to relate to the actors and the general audience, and too slow. The music is also lacking. But if you are looking for an interesting movie and the actors actually are good, then consider watching it--if you want to see an interesting film, you're going to have to look at one movie first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A mix of some good elements in the movie but very bad as the movie ends with a terrible ending! I have to get it. You see the good elements of the movie in the beginning, the first act is about getting a job (as I understand this is what causes a person to succeed) and the beginning is about the "me" guy dying, but that's not quite all of the elements of it. And then the movie begins with the "I" guy making a movie, which is a plotless, and almost made the movie a complete bore.  And then there's some good action scenes, that are good. The last scene has a good scene of a guy (Nolan DeRoy) who's dad (Raymond Tummers) is going to a movie theater, and when he is going there he can't remember how he was going and when to play the movie. And I guess there's a couple of good bits, but there's also some very bad parts. This movie was never supposed to be an "Giant Guy" film. It really didn't want to be in the "Big" film club. And the movie was so bad that I gave it a low rating.  This movie needs to be banned for all the stars and the movie makers have had enough time to do this movie and they have been doing it. What is a "G Giant"? It looks like a bunch of soap-operations, plus one plot. That's not really how I'm getting it. This film is really a failure on it's own, but you may like it and you could probably find some more interesting things in it. It would have been nice if there were some decent parts to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Shenanagi" is an extremely stupid and awful film. I'm not sure who this movie was intended to be. I think the movie was designed to get people interested in the world of Japanese history and to sell a movie to unsuspecting audiences that couldn't even comprehend the plot. There are little scenes that could have easily won an American TV show. I've seen some of this movie on the Japanese TV stations in Japan but I'm sure they couldn't have done much worse. Some of the scenes were unbelievable, but they were funny. Most of the films are either silly or too far ahead of Japanese standards. I recommend watching this movie at a friend's place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not read or seen this movie, but I have heard the reviews and the reviews are not good and I don't want to see it again. So I won't see it. However, I know that it will give me trouble when it comes to this. It's not even a movie, and it's not good for anyone. I mean, it's a horror movie that everyone who is involved in it is looking for reasons to go insane. I won´t say it was a bad, but it's got that attitude! No one would really want to make this movie. It was like seeing a bad horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of Disney's 90's Disney Mouse House, the Mouse House series and, of course, "The Jungle House" series. So when I watched this movie I was stunned. The actors and special effects are so bad that I find it hard to even hear a single word uttered, and I don't like it very much because I don 't' like Disney's current storyline. The movie is not, you know, funny to begin with, or anything to justify a decent film in this state. This movie is completely unpolished and unbelievable. The dialog is stupid, the acting is awful and the acting scenes are so poor that they could never be shown on television. I found the best review I could find for this film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible, especially when it was made in the 60's, as it is on the DVD. I don't know how this film was made, but it is not very funny either and really has the worst actors in the world, not even in the 70's or 90's. Also I don\'t like the music, the soundtrack, the art, or the sound of the film.  It was in the 50's for a year, not for 30, and didn't see any other good movies, but the ones that were made after that were pretty good.   Don\'t waste your time watching this, you'll probably lose interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to recommend the "Blackfish" series for those who want to watch it as a horror flick or something for them who just don't care for horror, and it certainly isn't a true horror film. But unfortunately I think this movie is a complete lack of any type of original horror elements or even genre based horror elements, and unfortunately for that reason, this movie had its best 3 hours of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it was actually very interesting to watch. I was very surprised that it made it to the 20th anniversary of 'Burtison' as an entertainment story!  I remember being able to appreciate a movie as a joke from a movie: if you watched it for three seconds, you would find the movie funny! So, in those three seconds you're going to see everything from the very beginning, and even though the story is very funny, you wouldn't find anything funny. The movie started with the obvious 'joke' joke that I was surprised to find in the video! After this, I've noticed it all over the world, but it's just as bad as most of the other movies I've seen. The only difference in this one is that it doesn't make the people jump on the stage and laugh. It makes the people wonder what's really funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this on a screening of the second night at Cannes. This is the worst film I have ever seen. I watched this with one mate and we laughed. We were crying to the fact that this was so bad, it was so boring. If there's a better movie then I'll check. If that's all I have to say.  If you're looking for a romantic, you won't get a good movie because it's not. If you want a romantic movie, then I can't say any better then this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although it is one of my favorite films, I cannot even think that it could be so bad, considering it to be so predictable. I had high hopes for it to become an average horror film like "Gangs," but alas it's not. There are no good reason for such a low-budget flick, and it doesn't work well as a film! The acting is poor to the extreme, which is typical for these films. I can't believe that they are going to watch this film and find it funny, much as this movie is supposed to be funny. Some of the best comedy scenes are scenes where you can actually laugh. But the worst scene is the ending sequence. It is about 20 minutes of nothing, which makes it impossible to predict anything. What is bad is the fact that the film ends with a girl being stuck in a man's arms in a room. I was absolutely stunned to find that one of the actors in the film is even in it. That would have been much better if it would have ended at a scene like this one, but it's so predictable that you can't even get the rhythm, and you can not find a sense of rhythm, because you are trapped in this situation for the entire film. It isn't funny. It wasn't like anything, and I didn't even have the ability to tell if it was funny. The acting was so poor that it was one of those situations that it would be very difficult to watch. I think it would probably have had a better story to tell. I mean there were several funny scenes, but that's not how good this film is supposed by the producers. I don't think it was a bad film, but there are too many of these bad films like this. They usually make the director so hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie after seeing it for the first time in 1993. The movie was so bad it didn't make the cut. The director's script was about 70% bad. The acting was awful and the dialogue was bad. It was so horrible that I expected a "film" to make it better. It didn't. It is not like a TV movie, and it is not a horror movie. It isn't even a horror film, but it is bad. And the characters were bad.  I think that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought it was so stupid that it didn´t even exist. It had nothing to do with the original book or the series and it had nothing with the characters. It got so bad that it has some of the worst acting in modern fiction. The story had a horrible ending and it doesn't make sense. The whole thing just seemed like a bunch of old jokes and not a serious movie. If I could not stand up on the stage, I would have been sick. It's absolutely pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you get into the movie too early, watch it for your own enjoyment, not for the amusement of anyone else. The fact that this movie isn't even as enjoyable as it could have been is pretty much the only reason that this film has any sort of appeal to me.  The reason why I am so frustrated about this movie is because I actually like the way the music is presented throughout the movie, and I also like the fact that the movie is completely disappointing, I mean awful, and extremely disappointing.  I have not touched this film since it was released, but I felt like I was watching it again on VHS as I did the original film.   I will not review this film again, because I understand that it's a very low quality film, but it still contains some very good and important elements. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a bad show. But it turns out to be hilarious. I was just looking at it for amusement. And I didn't like the characters. They were ridiculous. They would never act like this person! It's a huge disappointment, it has a few good laughs but not much. There is absolutely no comedy in the whole show. I just can't find any humor in it. They are all very, and totally, and not all of them. I can't even enjoy the "welcome" segment, that is just a few laughs. You would be better if you just went and sit on the stage with the other party members in a bunch of other country's dance scene. The musical part seems silly, but there's no real musical music here. If you like musical music that's ok, but for some reason this show is bad for the songs in the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You just can't believe that this movie was made, because they had so much money to waste on it that it wasn't good. There are no real story. No real action. Just a very bad story. I thought the writer was OK because he wanted to tell a story. It had nothing to do with the book, the movie was just a waste of time. In the book they are much more serious than serious. In this movie, it's all just an action movie and nothing seriously. There were no real emotions. There is no real tension. The ending is so stupid and stupid. The way it starts was totally stupid. No one ever tells the story and there is no emotion, but there is absolutely no one. It is just all just a joke and the plot is completely worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie fails to be funny, and I think there are better movies in the world than the one I saw. I can't understand why they want to show their movies that bad, even if they want some money. They want to sell movies, and people like me will buy them, and have no idea how to make a movie that's good. There's a ton of stupid scenes, and there's even a fake movie called "Hookin".  There's an awful movie, but there is one good thing about it...it's actually pretty funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even have the patience to see this movie. I think I could take one month and see it. But this is such a bad-movie I can barely stomach it. The characters are simply bad. The director and script are bad, the acting is bad, and it starts to affect my faith. A few of the guys I have seen in my life, and I had a great friendship with them. They were good friends who loved each other, who made nice music, who didn't have problems with me. Now it's just bad. If this movie had a good script, the person who made it should spend some time studying. There's only one person I will remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I recall the plot was pretty good but this movie just turns out too long and is too long. It's OK if you want a movie to be that way but it should not be too long or that it could get old. I know there's nothing here that's so good and that's the point. But as a film maker I'm sorry to see such bad work. They should have done something better. They just don't have time to make it all good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always been a fan of the late great movies of the Disney musical "Bochai" (Kiyoko Kamikawa), but now I'm a bit scared to see this one.  The story is bad, it's too complicated, and it's only halfway convincing. This is the movie where you have to see the end credits, and you have not had time to digest the ending.  But my brother was very happy with this movie. It's just so bad! I won't get bored watching it again. I might even go and rent it for a cheaper rental. The movie is not even a proper Disney musical. It is not only a bad Disney musical, it is also just a bad musical.  I will give it one star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the review, I thought I'd be OK, but I am not, in my opinion. The plot, which was very predictable from the beginning, is so bad that the movie begins to lose any plot and really gets a bit dull from the end. As you can see, there are two main characters, all pretty good actors, and the others are the weakest. The only thing that kept the movie afloat were the female actors who were absolutely terrible, making the movie's acting laughable.   There was really nothing good for them to do except this one movie that is so incredibly weak.  The story is the worst thing of all the movies I've seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to like this movie, so I made it on the DVD that has never been released. There are a few very nice moments, and a very lousy ending. The fact that this movie is one of many "slightly-slightly" comedies, and one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. The worst part of the movie is the sex scenes. I understand why the makers wanted to make this movie but I don't understand why they do. I tried to give my girlfriend some of the sex lines, but she seemed to be quite shocked at the movie. I just got off the DVD because I was tired of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie while on break at home, but it's so sad and depressing, it's just really annoying and annoying and I think that it should never have been made. I think it would be better if these guys had a job with a positive attitude and that they didn't waste their time doing this crap. I was only able to see two or three of them in the first half of the movie, but at the end I just stopped watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this when it first came out. And it's just that bad. I've seen better versions of this movies. And the only one that can match this one.  I've played many movies since this movie came out, but they weren't worth my time. Even worse than some of the bad movies I have ever played.  The whole movie could be easily categorized as a B-horror flick, but that's only if the director didn't care about making it!  This is so bad. And if you liked the original, one of the good horror movies from the 70s, this is not a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really want to talk about how this movie was awful, but my opinion was very positive about it. It was like a sitcom, except there wasn't any room for comedy. The other side of the movie was that the girls really were stupid. They were never in a real fight. And although the movie got good vibes from the characters, like the main characters, they were just a bunch of idiots that didn't really care about what happened to them. I didn't have the same enjoyment watching the final scene in the movie. I wish it could have been more interesting than just a bad comedy show. It would have been better if it had been a really good movie, and I want to see more of it, like a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't figure out why this terrible movie was released in the first place. It's unbelievable! It seems that the movie was originally filmed in France and, as is evident by the movie opening credits, that many of the actors did not read the script properly. And then the movie goes about making the transition from "the story" to "the scene" - with the exception of Julie Chaplaine, of course. This could have been the case of one person's memory of a story from the original "The Last App'" was remembered and then played on again. But, I guess it also happened on the TV show which apparently inspired the movie to be made.  I have to admit that, for a movie: "The Movie:  The Last App" is a really bad movie. I'd like to be able to watch this movie, with its high rating, and give the movie a 10 rating, instead of 1. And that's not because the movie is a comedy; it's just because it's terrible. This movie, in fact, really does seem like an act of violence. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone who's willing to watch it to only get one or two laughs. I think that the way the movie's made up its story is so bad that it could be quite easily made up. What a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has so little character development (I don't have the same issues with the character development of the other TV series), the acting was bad, and there was no one decent point. In a good movie, when actors get the right direction they can use the language to enhance the story, and it's okay. This movie is bad on several fronts. Some good actors (like Charles Purdytte) were good in the earlier "Dark Angel" series, and some of the acting in the later series was actually good. But this film did not go anywhere. What was interesting was that the actress on the film, Anna Minard, was not the original Angela Ross-Sutton. She was replaced by an actor (as in the TV series) who was actually a former "Dark Angels" agent.   There is nothing to recommend this film, in fact, what was interesting about this film was that it was the very beginning of a series of "Dark Evil", a plot that never got much traction, and finally finally, this movie is no more than an attempt at redemption. I mean, the story is not original and there are no new characters. There is no plot twists or new scenes, and not even an opening credits sequence. The actors were never involved in the scenes. There were even a long period between the beginning and the end of the film in which the characters were talking on the phone and they were all talking about the very long phone call. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts as a very silly and pretentious satire of a man who plays as a drug dealer to sell drugs to an unsuspecting customer. As usual, the film goes off in the middle of nowhere as soon as it goes into its final stages. It becomes a very dull and tedious movie.  It starts off with an interesting concept (see how I can guess what's going to happen after the first scene) and a promising scene in which one of the women (Ruthie) tries to convince a policeman into buying heroin for $100,000 dollars and buys some.  This is the first attempt of the film's history, since they weren't quite sure how to do it. In the beginning the story is pretty plain, but after it gets down from that, it becomes a mess. It fails spectacularly.  Even if you liked the previous version of "Street Crime", I don't see a movie that could easily compare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of the classic films from the 70's. They had a funny plot. I could never find the original title!  I thought it was good in some of the other films but, if you just sit and wait, the story falls on a pretty low plane. If you pay attention to the film for your amusement, you might end up watching it twice. I think the movie starts out as a pretty simple little comedy. I was really sad that I wasted time seeing it and never even got the DVD version. It was just terrible. I couldn't even use it to watch it again. I would never go on to sleep with my wife and she did not get the joke of the title. They just made it look so dull and boring. I didn't get the movie finished, but I knew the movie sucked. I have just had time to rent it again and didn't want to start off again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an insult to every movie enthusiast. It was like a movie that is made to be an hour long and then half of it is used for a little extra time and then the rest is just thrown away in a few minutes. I'm very critical of this movie. I'd like to give it the "Citizen's Choice Award" and the "Punishment Award". It has some interesting themes and it has some good animation but it was obviously an eyesore. The plot was good, but it's not realistic and the direction was terrible.  What is interesting is that the movie started with a very annoying person talking with a random little girl. There is no real story, but the "The Last Wish" is actually very moving and I guess that could have been an interesting script. There was some funny dialog with the girl and some "gag" and some really stupid scenes involving the girls. But the movie just doesn't hold together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this movie a low rating because it is not a horror film but rather like a cheap horror movie. It's too long and the acting was not good. The movie didn't have much interesting stories, not to the point that it was good for its own sake. This movie doesn't have a lot of suspense, the characters were simply flat and the whole story is nothing interesting. This is not the kind of horror you would like to watch. It was about time for a good horror film with a good story and good action to make it more interesting and action-friendly. But sadly, it fails to have both. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first movie I've seen since I was at university. I'm a huge fan of movies like "The One Thing About Adam" and "Rambo Packing" and I cannot stomach this kind of movie. It is a bit funny to see a movie that does not even contain any jokes. I am a little disappointed that this movie does not break the norm, but the point is to just get a cheap movie to pass a week and have you over for the year.  I have not gotten much use of this movie since its inception, and I haven't even finished watching it. To make up for the movie, I would like to look for a movie: "The Movie that No One Wants to See", by Adam Winters.   I can give this movie a 1-2 out of 10 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very lame and there is no plot at all. And all the acting is bad. The script is bad, there is not any character development and the script is a huge plot and poor writing. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, go back to the 70's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad sequel of a bad action movie. I'm not going to argue for the idea that "Mad Dog" is better than "Shots" but it is still a bad film. It is not the same as "Mad Dogs" but I'm glad it was at least better than that. The script and dialog is pretty stupid and the characters are boring.  I was expecting better. I am looking to burn my brains out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I tried to watch it for years, but the video quality is terrible, with bad cinematography, horrible acting, and terrible special effects. If you watch this film then you have to think your brain will pop off! I hope this movie will never see the light. I hope someone gets rid of it for good reason! But at the end of the movie, I was afraid it would never come to its end. It is very unfortunate. There are some very good reasons to watch this bad movie, but it is hard to watch and the video is bad!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a new Star Trek movie, it's just the same old one.  It is just an attempt to glorify the "great" movie from the "virus" days of "wampath". The movie is just the most terrible film I've ever seen since... EVER. I cannot tell if this movie was a parody or actually a parody. I don't have a single idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is badly acted and even worse. The script was the same as always, and the whole movie was awful. The acting was the worst since the first movie was made. I was one of the actors in this movie, so I can understand why the original script wasn't used for years, but that's only because the new actors that had been cast were good. This is the worst film I have ever seen. The film is about to be put in a collection of bad movies, and I can't even make up my rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never really liked this movie... it really is an ugly and disappointing story. I thought the actors were OK, but I didn't like the part where they would get into their sex games, so much. The acting is bad and the acting is poor, but there is also a really funny and entertaining song. I think this movie is a waste of money... the best thing about the movie is that I am sure the actors did a really good job in making it so bad. I will rate this movie at 1/10 but I do not think it will get 10 because I like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the same type of movie that would be made to be for $500 dollars. If you ever get this movie, it's the worst thing ever. The main story is bad. The characters are OK. The animation is bad, the sound is bad but this movie should probably be saved for the special effects in the next episode. The ending is so stupid it should be made up from some kind of special effect. This movie is also so poorly made that even the makers are laughing about it. I guess that this movie is meant for a teeny teen girl, or teens who can't dance properly or do enough gymnastic tricks. If we are teenagers, we should really avoid it.  If you are a teen, you would be advised to stay away from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked what Sean O'Neal did with his film. I had been watching the film and really liked the movie, but by the time it was late, I thought it was just a little too hard to watch. It really was not for me. I was surprised that the movie was so bad that the first video clip, even after I had already seen it, was so disappointing.  The second video clip that I watched is "The One Hour Film" about a girl who thinks she was an artist, and she wants to be a painter.  I didn't really like it, but I still think the acting was very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a bad film. It was so bad that I wish I had never seen it. I've watched it twice now and I have never found out that it was funny. It is so stupid that it would be played off and laughed off. And I can't see any humor in this movie. It should not be played out but it should never get to have any chance to succeed. This movie made me want to go crazy! It should never be played by any actor, and the funny bit is so obviously stupid. I don't want to think about how stupid this movie is, because even if you did like it, you would have to know that it is so bad and so laughable. This is a huge shame. This isn't even a very good film, it's just bad in the end. What a waste of $5.00! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a sucker's kinda guy, and this is the movie that made me so annoyed with it. This is the one movie that I never heard my father saying. I read the book and this movie is what the book says. I mean it says it was "the movie to end all your life", but this movie could not hold back what the words it has. I just don't care about my daughter anymore, and I guess I just couldn't see her in this movie. The reason for this movie was that I had just fallen a couple of days after my mother died, and it seemed like a continuation of the book.  I guess it's not like "Die Hard" or something else to do it, but it wasn't good to finish off like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to see this one. When I watched it I was in disbelief. There was no plot, not much to watch. I was about to stop watching this movie and my wife and daughter were only mildly amused by it. I cannot recommend any movie to anyone to watch it because it's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had no clue how the film was supposed to be a piece of "Biological Science" in it's name and I couldn't figure out what the film's story was. This is an insult to anyone who actually watches "The Making of Rocking Shoes" and wants to see the whole "Science" theory and there is no evidence to confirm that it is.  I can see a movie that doesn't follow it's own "plot" for what it is and be able to get along and even finish the movie with it. "Biotic Science" is a concept that is, at best, a weak and stupid concept. This film could have been made without some plot and a good story. I don't care if it's made by a man, woman or a woman. It's bad because it should have been a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is so awful. It is really a shame to see a movie that fails to make much of the effort it deserves. It doesn't even feature any decent acting. Even the actors are so bad that they shouldn't even have to try to win it. Also, I am sure there is a great deal of money that could have been used to make some sort of movie. The ending is so lame that I would have been embarrassed for my sister to watch it. This film needs to be made into something interesting to everyone so we could get some decent viewing experience. Unfortunately, this movie also fails to have any substance. I would advise against spending $25 to see it, but that would probably be the best bargain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the film critic, this is not my opinion, but it's pretty clear. It's really not good. I found it to be even worse than the video was. I have to agree that the director is terrible. The acting is absolutely awful. The plot is bad. The characters are not good either. It has to be rated one of the lowest rated movies ever made. I gave this one 10 out of 10 in the worst ranking ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really scared of the people who made this one. Its hard to watch these films, they always make them look so lame. I think the filmmakers should stop making movies like this. Its like watching an alien movie where the people have nothing to do but watch weirdly dance with each other. That's just the beginning of this one's problems.  This is like a sequel to the worst movie I ever made. This movie has nothing going for it. I'm hoping the film will eventually get released, but after watching it I was really scared it had the power to be a decent movie. Just awful bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I really thought I had a good movie. I didn't know how to use my hand to write a positive review about such a bad piece of work. This one is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. And I'm still finding it. I really liked "The Last Picture" but I can't really describe it here.  The film starts out with a pretty good scene at a pool and that's all there. But in order to get that pool opening, the film starts off with another movie which just turns out to be a horrible piece of garbage.  After the pool scene, I was wondering how I could get this movie shut down, but there's so many plot holes that it just needs to be shut down. I guess I'm a really dumb person, so I thought I'd try to see a few more of these films and just go through them. The ones I didn`t like were the ones I liked the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm very confused. How could this movie be put together and called this??? And at the end I still don't get this movie. I think that there is no way that this could have been an effort.  It was a complete failure. I was expecting better and funnier than this. Unfortunately it wasn't better.  I was really hoping that this would be funnier. I expected it to be funny but unfortunately it wasn\'t. The plot was so thin that it didn't even get to enjoy the beginning of the movie. The whole movie is the same, so the movie could have saved its own. I also feel that this movie is not funny at all, it's just not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is one thing that can justify this film: 1) it is a comedy that plays for laughs, but I'm going to give this film a really bad score. 2) it's too long, and 3) it has a major lack of focus and purpose.  There are so many problems I've seen that I can't even start to mention the worst one. And let me say, I'm not going to talk about some people who like it. This film has nothing to do with the art of creating music. It's just a way to get you to spend all your time on it. But those are all so small and superficial that they're actually enjoyable! I don't even think that this film would be good if it was just an adventure. It was a complete disaster. It just seems like a way for an entertainer to make, or a way that a writer is trying to get a positive review about some movie: a film that isn't about any music at all! The art of film is about making art or music, but this is just about the worst example of that. It seems like it was a chance for an artist to try something that isnno music, and then try it in a way like a musical performance. It is just like a bad music movie.  I'd give it an 8, but don't be surprised about this. I'd rather see a comedy than one of pure entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the early 1990s. It's a shame to be watching this movie. I'm not an English speaker but my American friends don't know what a translation would mean. There are some good moments of "Dirty Dogs". In the first scene, some of the actors go on a golf outing for their members, and then everyone is upset about it, and the next scene is a little too long. Then it goes out on a really bad ending. If you're a dog person, you don't need to be so depressed. If I were a dogperson, I wouldn't be so sad. This movie doesn't have any good themes and no great story lines, but it's a complete mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this film and was a little sad and angry when I finally watched it on my computer after seeing it on the DVD back in 1999.  There are a few good spots in the story; the "Grimstone" is nice, but it seems to be a real-life zombie movie. The storyline is very vague and has a few loose ends and some decent characters who have their own stories to tell but not the good ones. The ending is fairly predictable but the characters are not even good. The actors look really bad, too, although I am a huge fan of this movie and was hoping that some of them could come back in some future film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this one a rating 4 and a 1. A real disappointment, for what it could be.  But I do rate this as an average comedy with the obvious acting of the characters. But it is way too simple to be a comedy. What a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My expectations at the beginning are to watch a film with a very weak, predictable story. I hope to watch it for a few hours. That's my hope. I am scared for this film to be one of the best movies of the genre. There are just some pretty decent bits that make you forget how bad this movie was. Some of the other actors were good, but when this is the last one of them you have a pretty high tolerance for those bits.  I hope the rest of the movie will earn my respect as the weakest of the "genre" that this film was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of a group of scientists in the future. But a lot of the plot line had a certain "realness" to it. If a movie is not produced with the same kind of depth as in a film, it's hard to realize how it really relates to the reality of the future, the scientists, or even to the real world.  The fact that the movie ended with some of the characters dying (I'm not sure on why and I'm not going to speculate on how the film ended) is perhaps indicative of the writer's need for a real story and story-telling that doesn't have anything in relation to reality. That, in the end, the writer simply couldn't answer what a writer thinks he has to say, or whether or not he's going to do what he says.  Other than the character's deaths, there were few things in the film that had anything to do with life or anything that was serious or even remotely interesting. The film is one long series of "talking" or "talking"-type episodes that is nothing at all, but unfortunately fails to tell you anything. The plot, unfortunately, is the most predictable of all three films in my opinion. It's about time for a writer to get his bearings, and get a plot that actually has a beginning and a middle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is very bad - I think the director tries to make a film that it would be more interesting.  It's not good for a movie that tries to be interesting, but it's okay if it is funny. It just don't work.  There's not much to show or hope to be a good movie. What I find annoying about this film is that there is not much in the film to show. The film fails as a comedy! I think it fails as an art film! The film does have some moments (the story and the acting is good), but I think that it's too obvious. It isn't interesting to see how many of them were sent to prison. I also have to conclude that the film fails to be funny and that it fails to convey the truth about the events that transpired and that no one involved in the case (including the media) ever knew about it.  The story is weak, but has some redeeming features. There is a moment when the police escort the inmates and the inmates to prison to get a "time-out". (not a time-in-chase) but it is never shown. Some of the characters are even involved in other scenes.  I don't know if the movie is a parody of the "Joker" TV series. That's what I would classify it as, but there is nothing that has anything to do with the main plotline.   Some of my friends have commented that I thought this movie was interesting. I am not sure.  What I would expect in a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a very nasty script, and has to be taken out of the gutter. I don't know why it was taken out by a major publisher to make this flick. I'm not sure whether this is a serious film or not really a funny comedy, but it does not contain any funny jokes. The plot is weak, and there are too many ridiculous and unrealistic jokes to cover it. The film starts out okay, but after the beginning, it's just plain bad. Don't even bother watching this unless you have a good laugh with the cast. Don not buy it unless you enjoy it, or if you're a kid. If you do like this film, don't waste money or a week's rent on a blu-ray copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie on Netflix streaming, and, after reading the reviews, and watching the movie again, I was not surprised.  The story was so bad I had trouble with my eyes, my mouth, my nose, my ears, my hands, my eyes... It was just like a really bad movie.  My rating: **** 2/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first few minutes of the movie are an absolute waste of time, it has no decent storyline, even the first scene has the perfect sequence. This is a disgrace!  The end should really be made up a little bit, when the film starts, at the very start it is too bad to be the worst of all time.  Even the last scene is a little good.  The film has the biggest problems in it. This movie needs to be abandoned for it's own sake and never made into a great film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't find it as a terrible piece of work, I do believe it's a pretty awful movie. It's just awful. It was way too long, too long. I'm not sure whether it's funny or not at all, considering it's about the main female character, not the lead male character. I know that she's not the "best guy in the world" but that she does act like a normal person and doesn't really get the job done, and her character doesn't behave like a girl, or any other person with a positive attitude. I really wish she got a break from this movie, I don\'t like her anyway and I hope that it becomes interesting after time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ever saw a horror movie starring a major actor and directed by a major director I'm not surprised to hear you, because most people in America would rather expect something more interesting. This movie had one of the worst things I have seen of those 20 years since I was in my late teens.  I had some good bits of a scene at the beginning, but there were so few of those scenes. The other was when we left the scene in the kitchen. The scene where the guy was hiding in the bathroom was pretty good, but the scene where we left and left the bathroom and the scene with the girl (who is a girl) in the hotel scene was pretty awful. The film starts off on an interesting premise, but that's not how it's actually treated.  The ending could be better, but it is very bad for an American audiences.   I will not recommend this movie to any Americans. It's not a very good movie. Don't waste time looking at this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins to run around, with the first hour or so being pretty good.  The other two hours are a big mess. I think the director was bored during a shooting. A bunch of bad lines were the best part of this movie. You can't even count how annoying they were.   I know some of the actors did better than this. I'm hoping that these characters are a lot better than their portrayal in the actual movie.  They had some of them as their characters, such as some of old wives or old ladies.  But that doesn't help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed when this movie came out, I have always been a fan of Star Wars, but this was a disappointment. I was hoping to see the original trilogy, but unfortunately, I did not see them on the shelves. Instead, I got a movie that had nothing of the same appeal to me. The story of the first sequel was very entertaining, but not for its plot. The only thing I liked was the inclusion of the Captain Katheleen, although I did appreciate her attitude and the look of her. I felt that she was much more than just a female captain, a good captain, and had some serious emotional problems, but that was about all there was. I can't even begin to describe her acting skills, she didn't look like a natural character and never felt like a "strong, confident woman". I was expecting to find some way to make her characters more interesting, but alas, they were totally boring, boring and just plain boring. The other issue was how poor the plot was, but apparently I were the only one who liked this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is terrible. It should be given that they had to make a big budget. But it's also very weak on the set. The acting is bad and the camera work is bad. The cinematography is bad too. I found the camera in the original. That has a distinct film of a 'wipe me off'.  But it still shows that it's one of those movies. I really need to have the director get rid of this and re-think how to make films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard of this film being referred to as a British film. This must have been one of those "great" English documentaries (I've seen some of them). What were the first few minutes of this movie? I really hope it wasn't filmed with someone who didn't understand how to make movies. If you can get it all right, you'd probably be doing a very long time, I'm guessing. I've seen more than 40 minutes of it, and it starts with bad jokes, and a really bad voice acting. The plot is not as good as I'd expect, and when the dialogues are good, the movie really starts to lose its ability to stand with any seriousness. Some of the characters are stupid, and some of the songs seem forced and out of place. It's a bad film, but even worse than the first two VHS tapes. The first one was far better than the sequel.  I haven't heard it again, and I'm sure I'll soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of the viewers that took the movie seriously. My wife loved this film and it was just a bad idea! I felt like I was going to have my eyes blackened on the DVD. I didn't mind that it was a huge piece of junk! But I did have to take my eyes off so the movie could feel nice to my wife. The acting was not very good and there was something about the plot that wasn't obvious at all. But what's so bad about that? There are so many issues with the plot and the characters of this film, but I have to give it one of my top points. I'm the kid who got the idea of this movie, but it was only about 6 minutes of time for me to really absorb. I just gave it the most disappointing of all time because it was so bad! I would never have watched it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An awful film! I was expecting something nice, and unfortunately this was the case. I'm a horror nerd, and that is not the way I expected horror to be portrayed. The movie starts off with an overly loud and fast scene with a couple of characters talking, but there's no real plot. The story is lacking, with some very poor acting, and some of the dialog is good, but nothing really works in the movie. The ending was bad.    I don't even watch horror movies, and I didn't even really like this movie, so I'm left wondering what this movie is about. I do not recommend this film for anyone who really wants to watch it, the gore is pretty heavy, the acting is terrible, and the ending is bad. But don't be afraid of the "cuddles", just because they are in fact quite sweet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really poor movie.  The acting is bad - i'm not even that deep into it - but the script and script are stupid. They were probably the most insane actors to ever have a chance to appear in a TV show. The acting and the dialog are not that interesting to watch. The dialog is bad as well - I laughed and I thought that was too funny.  I had a bit of fun watching this - after all, it's a thriller, but it was too slow and too predictable.  If you enjoy movies like "The Untouching" then this might be a good one.  Unfortunately this is just another example of a movie which gets off its feet after a few hours and then loses steam, even when it has some good parts. I can't see why, when the director is talented, good actors get a chance of success in this one. It just doesn't seem like anybody's idea of doing something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although I've seen this movie in my own private screening, and after reading some reviews I thought it was bad, I was still going to rent it, but was unhappy with how bad it was. A few hours after the screening, I discovered something else that I did not expect to see. I'm not a "believer" in the faith in God that this movie has claimed. I was not expecting God would be a demon.  After seeing this movie, I think there is a lack of sincerity in the film's script. I hope that people who are able to find out the ending and understand the way the movie was going, and try to make the movie more interesting than it is.    I was hoping that the director had been under intensive study and was serious about making the movie better than the current version. However, he is nothing of a genius or a genius. His film was bad at the start, but he is good at what he has done. It is not clear what the movie is about, whether it is a movie or an animated movie, or if it is like a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. There were so many parts that seemed to work together, the characters were boring and the scenes were not that interesting, and I found myself not wanting to watch.  If you are looking for a film that has a good story, good performances, and a good soundtrack, then maybe this movie is worth a shot. Otherwise it is a bad comedy to be seen unless you watch it on a big screen and the people do funny. That is pretty much all for the plot.  I found it difficult to finish. There are not many funny moments in the film. If you're a movie watcher then it is an okay film, but if you are an action movie, this is a horrible story and there is no laughs in this movie. If they made it worse than a horror movie then it must be an excellent movie. There is also a lack of money to spare for this movie, which I found quite sad. But if you have some time then you might be able to enjoy it. But most of the people that I heard heard about this movie did not even go out to see it in the theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first hour of "Die Hard" was extremely unappealing and disappointing. However, it was very interesting for the next 30 minutes and eventually became much better, perhaps in retrospect. However the movie itself was terrible. Most of the time I saw the movie, I felt like I was having the same movie before I even came to the theater. I didn't really understand why I even saw this movie. I think I just didn't get into it. But it's pretty good for a cheap movie.   I have to give this movie 4 out 10 out of 10, because it wasn't bad, just a bad adaptation. It had a few good moments and moments. But I could have lost several years of my life watching this movie if I hadn't seen it.  It's just a crappy movie that needs to be remembered as soon as possible so it can't tarnish the legacy that it was destined to make. If you liked the previous version of "Rock & Roll," that movie was pretty good, even if you didn't like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it online, and it has been one of my least favorite movies of the past decade. I've seen it again and realized that I'd be able to describe the movie as a joke about a movie: "This is one of those movies that is so stupid it's really funny, it's not really interesting...  It's really painful to watch this movie. It's not funny at all, and I don't want to waste my time trying to find out what it actually is about. I wish to just get out my point of view. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of the bad movie names, but that's not the worst. When it's all "for free" and no money exchanged with the movie-makers and the movie stars are in it, they have no clue that a movie about a prostitute who can only afford an apartment. This movie also fails to make any sense whatsoever. The only reason that this movie is so bad is that it's about the best film in the history, but it's not that high, it's a lousy film at the same time. I'd call it a bad film if the plot were the point of interest, but the movie just never does anything else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie in theaters for the last 10 years. I can't even remember what it is about anymore.  It tells a pretty bad story of a guy who goes on a rampage and starts killing everyone he encounters. I thought it was so funny and interesting that I expected it to have some dramatic flair. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. It was only okay because it's one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen. I was hoping that it would go out with a sequel but sadly, it didn't.  I'd think it was funnier if it were an action movie, which is what it was.  The acting is terrible, with awful accents and horrible dialog. I think the actors were too inexperienced to use their own talents to make it funny. Also the ending seems very unrealistic and unbelievable. There's a lot of bad acting and dialog in the movie but it doesn't matter. The cinematography is poor. There aren't even any interesting or suspense scenes. The music is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a young teenager who has just fallen out of the orphanage, a tragic tale of betrayal, is one of many that fail to have much of the charm that the typical soap dramas typically have. If anything is going to be good about a soap film, then you would expect something funny, even though the actors are obviously capable of entertaining, even if they are stupid.  The problem, though, is that the film is not funny at all. The film is so bad, the acting is so poor that I cannot even recommend it to anyone. If this is a film for adults, then what is it for children? There are few lines of dialogue that the characters do not catch, most of the acting seems to be silly and even the music is not strong enough. Even though this is not a terribly serious film, I could not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few decent stories, a few good endings, but a whole lot of bad stuff. I don't care for this one, the movie is just plain bad, with poor direction and bad acting. I think that this has more than one person who really needs an actor to play their parts, or even to speak well. I really do not like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've not watched this movie for the last time i will watch it again, I have no idea why the makers of this movie have a vested interest in making it. It has to be like a school for those who are obsessed with acting. This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. In short, it is a really disappointing movie.  The movie starts by making a guy (who is no joke) in an extremely stupid manner. He is not even able to sit up with the girl he's got in his pocket. He's got a big nose and I believe it's obvious, but he is able to act, and not at all. Then, we see him being chased by the other guy, who is the only other guy who is ever involved with him in this incident. This would have been a hilarious scene if we could have seen the last of this film, but even if we did it, it was very bad. If they were able to fight against the chase, it would have to be a better movie. It does not seem like a good movie. I just want to have it deleted from my memory, it feels like something that was made to be only for its own sake. The best movie I have ever seen was the first one I saw, this is not one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at around 1 am. I remember seeing it when it was on TV and laughed at how stupid it was. I don't know what to say about the movie, but it did it's not what I expected and didn't see it on DVD. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It did a few times and got good and didn´s that much fun for the few seconds. But I have to admit I liked it when i heard about it in my school, but if I ever had to watch it again, I wouldn't. I think it was a bunch of high school kids who got bored after watching it and decided to copy it. It wasn't as good as the other films in the prison, but you could almost hear the words 'A.N.S.E.D.' all over the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows the storyline of a family of people who want to be the best. They keep their children alive, and when they are attacked, they do not care. The film is the only bad thing I can think about for the show that would be made. The plot is pretty lame, and the dialog is boring, but the story is weak and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not an "ner" but this movie is just plain bad. I am surprised that someone actually had to watch it to see it and didn't watch it in it's entirety. In the end, the plot is about a plane crash involving a couple who run away from the plane and find out that the pilot was missing. They decide to make a plane flight to bring the pilot to the hospital to help him. A woman gets the news that they find a plane who is missing in the plane's wreckage. The pilot is in trouble and says he needs to fly to the crash site to help the pilot so the family decides to put the plane in the car and drive to the scene to get it and get him in the hospital. They do not see the pilot's mother's phone and the pilot is gone from the crash and he is soon in the emergency room of the hospital with his family. The family has two kids and one of them is a cop and his girlfriend is in the same hospital. The cop's wife gets the kid and the kids and go with the family of cop's girlfriend to the airport and she gets the family in the police station to get the family to a police station and get them out of the car. The kids and the family decide to meet the cop's family at the hotel and they try to persuade them to help them. The only thing that comes from this movie that could be good is the ending. I'm sorry for that woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little bit sad seeing this film but then saw some of the good stuff, and I was sad to see what could be so bad.  I am sad to report that this film is awful. If you like horror movies, then there is one good thing to have.  The worst of it is the movie ending. It is very sad to watch a horror movie that has no ending and there are no good endings. The best of it, however, is the end. It's sad that this movie was such a bad choice.   10/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is truly an awful flick.  I was not really interested in this one, and was hoping to see something better in the sequel.  The idea seemed to be interesting and I'm not a fan of the main characters, but I do not understand how much to compare them.  One of the best features in the original was the concept of the "The Three Years" which takes place over 10 years. The whole story could have been explained so simply and made no sense whatsoever. But what was happening in this movie was not only bad, but completely un-real.  What really seems to have been the point was the fact that we were never in a place where we can understand what happened, and that we had no clue about how much this story would end. That is where I started. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to like this movie. I didn't. And there were some plot lines that were so absurd that I felt I could have understood them from reading the book. But the acting was bad, too many actors were acting out the same old ways, the cinematography was bad...and then I couldn't even understand the concept behind this movie, considering it's not an adult film. This is probably the worst comedy I've seen in a while. It doesn't even start out with a decent premise, then its got so bad that it just sucks me out...and I'm so depressed. I don't even know how this movie could have been made by a teenager. It should be for a kid, not for a teenager who's just recently divorced from a long marriage and still wants to have kids. I'm not sure if this movie is meant to be a low-budget or a 'jiggle-jacking' version. It could have even been a horror film. I mean, it's probably not meant to scare anyone, but it could scare a lot of people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed when I came to see this movie. I was already familiar with this plot in my mind of this one. I thought I had seen many of the sequels, and most had been good. I just couldn't believe that all this plot was completely unnecessary. I had to find out for the rest of my life that this was a really bad film. I watched it in the theatre and then decided to rent it again. I rented it from a house in a hotel, and only then did I realize why I was even bothered about this whole thing. I didn't even think about its sequel.  This was the sequel of the TV series "The Nine Lives". You can guess why this is so bad because it really is the sequel. The plot was so bad that the series was better in the TV Series. The only thing that was so good in the series is the final scene of "A.D.C.O.", which I remember vividly.  The whole thing was unbelievable, which was disappointing and made me sick. I would have to recommend this only for a very cheap rent, and there are many other great movies that have similar problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only saving mistake for this movie was the movie was about to have a female pilot. It would have been so much easier to make a girl pilot who had an old pilot's pilot pilot's diary, but here it is. The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that there was a female character that was in the pilot. I mean it is hard to believe this movie could be anything more than a flop. I've seen plenty of poorly constructed and unedited films and I don't understand what it is supposed to be. You have to laugh because it's so bad that you can't take it seriously. I'm sick from laughing, but it is so bad it made me sick! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished watching this movie, and it was the worst movie I've seen. I am a big fan of "Beneath" and "A Lot Of People" and I thought the plot was interesting, but this was just the worst version of the book I have ever seen. In fact, I would have rated it 7 out of 10. I would say that it has got the worst plot and is an absolutely pathetic movie. The other factor was the characters were not properly developed, and that really hurt the movie. This movie was so bad that I had to keep it out of my hard drive, and I was afraid to listen to the audio track for this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to say it I'm very annoyed that I actually laughed more than a couple of times. I was the only one that laughed. The rest of my fellow viewers laughed less. It was very bad to start off. I had the whole 'bump' after the movie. I didn't laugh the whole time. I don't remember the name of the actor that played the part was the guy. They were very bad actors. The ending was bad too bad to end, but didn't quite make it look like a movie.  I really tried not to watch it, and I tried to do my best to pass through it. It wasn't that bad for a long time, but not that good. The cinematography of the movie was horrible, the characters were very flat, and the cinematography was bad. It didn't seem to be a movie that was intended to be funny. It got all the way 'wrong' by the time and kept on going as a movie about a movie of 'Bump' type of film with no real humor. I think it was an insult to all of us. It really was one of those films that only made a funny movie, and it had nothing to offer. It is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just as bad to watch. I give it a 'C' or 'F' rating as there are no real rating for a 'B' film. It could probably get an 'E' for being funny. The other 'C film I have seen a few times better than 'Bolt' because it was a more serious film. I'd take it for another laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched one of the two best scenes from the show in years, and I'm still shaking my head in disbelief.  The scene where the woman says she's not sure who she's sleeping with, and the one where the man gets to know her and has sex with her? That's it, and that's it. It has absolutely zero plot. The other one is a scene where they take their hands and tie her up in a room and stuff, and then she talks about making a copy of the movie.  This is a complete example of how the show is so poor in its portrayal of the women in the film that it makes them appear as cartoonish and unfeminist, which I suppose it would do if it wasn't for the fact that the men are so good and well-trained at making jokes about it. I don't know why this has become a popular cult classic among horror fans, and why is it not on the big screens for anyone to watch it. There are some good points in the movie, but this movie seems to be the least good horror movie made of the last 30 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to enjoy this movie. I am still feeling like a "BEW" but this movie is too short and too long. The storyline is a little too slow and I was surprised that it went straight to the end and not an hour and a half. I really don't care for it, but I did enjoy the ending. The dialog is pretty bad, and the acting is so bad and there was so much fake laughter, it was an hour long! I give this movie a 3 out of 10 stars if it is so short, no rating means anything. I think it could probably have been better, but as I say it was so bad, this is a movie that you just don't want to watch... and you can't even watch it in the second hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An example of a bad horror movie: I am not sure how to pronounce it, but it was an excellent example of low effort horror. The plot was pretty bad and the direction was lacking. I was disappointed with the ending. I think the director probably thought that making a horror movie was too hard to be made. The last part of the movie was an OK way to finish a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of Hollywood and, like the critics, I cannot really explain the reason I am not feeling the same to this film. But the worst movie ever filmed for this side of the year is so bad it is impossible to like it.  I can only say that the actors and the direction, with the exception of John Glover, are OK, which is not a knock against them. The story is a total bore - but the dialogue is so terrible it is a huge pity to see it made, let alone being able to watch it. The film is about a group of teenagers who are on a trip to the beach with their family - the mother, the son, the sister and the daughter. When they return home, the family of the family - who are all of the girls in this movie - gets lost and they decide to spend the entire vacation.  As they are on their way, the group of teens decide to go camping to this very scenic spot to swim, and when they return, they decide on the same trip again. The girls are all very drunk and the boys are just a little bit drunk.  But they decide they will get lost on this day so everyone tries to follow them, as their own vacation plan. The group of guys are so drunk and very hungry that they start searching for food for their families. Unfortunately, the girls are sitting on the board at a BBQ stand on the very large sandbar and the girls have a good idea of making the boardwalk as a "climb".  They decide to start fishing and swim off of the board; which leads them to get into the sand. They decide on a swim and are able to get a ride in a small wooden boat from there.  The boys and girls are not too drunk to get the board up. The boys decide on their boat. It is then late in the morning, when they decide the girls need a "trip" to the board a long board. As they start talking, the rest of the characters get drunk, and the parents wonder why they are still drinking. Suddenly, they are off a couple of feet from the board, with a very big pool on the sand and they have to watch the girls swim in a swimming tank - it was supposed to be in a little more than 50-feet long.  Unfortunately, they get to the very big sand and it is one of those places you don't need to see. So, if there is a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very lame movie. The acting was laughable and not as good as the TV show. This is a real pity. I really wanted to see something new, but not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really a bad flick. I would have appreciated it if it were better. In fact I wish it was a comedy, with a few laughs. But not even the ending is good. I couldn't find any other humor and it was annoying. There are little dialog and there aren't much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a film: a bunch of men, none of whom have any idea who the two women are. They're not the two leads of a film, but merely the two who can help the story, the lead man and the lead woman.  In the beginning, the woman's boyfriend goes to an emergency meeting with the leader of the group of men she's been sleeping with.  This happens. He has his arms, legs, and head attached to a chair, but unfortunately he's not in his right state.  The women are going to find out about the situation in the club they've gone to, and he has to act on his way to meet the club's owner.  We don't see this until around the middle of the movie, but the ending is pretty clear.  There are some nice elements, including some of the storyboard, but it seems to be there's nothing in this. It could have been a good movie, if it'd been a real film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director was responsible for the decision. There were probably some good ideas, and there was a few good jokes, but they were way too vague and too long. I can't figure out who put the blame on the director for this awful movie. It really sucked me in when I watched it, and I was very disappointed in the characters and the fact that no one cared. I think it would have done a much better job if it had simply been a slap in the face for the director, who has repeatedly acted in ways that have been so poor.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of people who've been fans of the movie, and I've noticed some of them just after this movie. I know it's a remake of "The Mambo Killer", and I get the feeling it's being an insult to everyone who was fans of it. I mean, what happened that year?  I have to say it isn't just an insult, it's an insult on those people who like "The Man from Miami" or "Punching the Dead" to the people who made this movie out of the same idea as I was. I think it's something like a joke that someone tries to make a joke at another person and has to pay off the person with a bad ending. I guess I'm saying to those people.  But what I think is going to happen if anyone who was a fan of this movie decides to see the sequel, is that they're making it in the literal sense of an insult or joke. It's not a good movie, it really is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The direction is bad, the acting is terrible, the cinematography is awful, the editing is bad. The soundtrack, although fine, is not well used, and there is absolutely no point to the plot. There is nothing good about the acting, but the acting has some elements which aren't good either. I have seen many films with better acting, such as "Mr. Stratton" where a real person can act like this. Still, I've seen "Mr! Death" and it was great, and this is simply not one of those. It's an interesting, but not good film, and a complete bore.  If you are looking for a film which has poor and not good acting, I recommend you get some other film which is much better. If you like a movie which has decent acting, don't see "Death!", even if you like it and enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't care who they take credit for when I watch this film. However, it shows just how hard they have to push the envelope to push their way into this kind of trash. I have to agree with the comments here that this is the worst film I've seen in my life. I just want to be angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an obvious disappointment. The first 3 minutes of the movie could be worth a film, and the rest just as poorly as the movie. However, this is not a bad acting. There are some really good moments, but they were just so bad they left you with an extremely bad sense of the acting.  What the heck? I'm not going to waste your time watching this movie. The movie will not help you. If you're looking for a good movie, then you'll have to watch it for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this would be better than "the Oceans" because I saw it on the other day. I was going to see it in the movie theatre but, I hadn't.  I expected a good movie. It wasn't. "The Oceans is a horrible piece of film" as such. In fact, it is so bad, it doesn't even have any suspense. The cinematography is bad, the voice is weak, the music is bad (if you're a music teacher), the acting is poor, the plot is bad. It is just horrible. I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch it again, but I don`t think I will.  The movie was rated  Excellent (4 out of 10) but this is a bad way to end my life. I didn't even watch it after I went to my deathbed for two days in a place called "The Narrows".  The only good part was the "Marines" movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first couple of weeks of the film, I really expected the first thing to happen. At some point the producers and producers have really gotten their act together, and decided that the movie would not be filmed for 10 years. Of course, I'm not saying they can or should have done this, but considering the way they were going to use the script to create a commercial with a cast that was only 90% interesting or somewhat interesting, I don't think it's necessary to go through 10 years of production. That's how I thought it would be.  Anyway, this is really not that movie. It just has a lot of problems in a really bad way.  As far as the acting in the film is poor, the writing is really bad and the acting is bad, the direction is bad and there really is a number of sub-points thrown in the movie, some of which I won't even mention.  The story was about as simple as it could be. There is no way to know what happened in this plot, how it's about to happen and who exactly does what. But even if the acting wasn't bad, it was never that interesting. They actually decided that there would be no way for the main character to survive unless the main actors and the main supporting actors all knew what was going to happen...well, they should have.  Also, the fact that this is an "advertiser" movie and a "television soap" doesn't help the overall picture much. Just because it is about a guy who has problems with getting along with others, it makes the movie more about the "bad guy" who gets in a lot too many situations with others who do what they are supposed to do. It really shouldn't have been a commercial, and I think it should have been something in the real world. I also think that a movie called "Busted In The Head" would not have much more than one or two funny jokes.  And when it was first shown on the stage, I was kind of embarrassed. But it still wasn't that funny after the first hour.  I'd probably give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating just for the acting, but it had some of the better dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to like the movie. I wasn't so, and the ending was a huge disappointment. I gave it one star out because I enjoyed the first 10 minutes and liked the cast of the movie, but when I think about the end, I find myself wanting to throw the thing off.  I cannot understand why the cast did this, but I did.  What was a big disappointment? The girl is the one who's in love with the hero. Why does the hero think his lover should be dead? I can't see the end and I think it must have been a major disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this, exactly, they say. It has the usual Hollywood clichés, the characters are so dull and that's why they have no plot or plot. But what's the worst part about this movie? That the character isn't talking. The actors aren't acting, the script is bad, the acting is bad. And the dialog and jokes are bad. That's it, that's all there. I didn't like this movie, but I'm trying to watch it because there is still a bunch of interesting and original people in the cast. But they don't act, that makes the movie a bore.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the first X-men game and loved the movie. The movie was stupid as all the plot was stupid, which in itself had a very good feel. The story was the same as the one from the original X-Men game and we saw the sequel plot pretty much like the one in the X- Men movie, only they are funnier to the game and a few moments were very stupid. The plot was boring and made the movie worse in some parts, and I just couldn't get to know what were the "most important parts" in the story. I give this movie a score about 1 because it was only about 1 hour of movie time, but I think the story was not that important in the final end. The actor, Michael Amor, is in his own, so why did he make me so sad? The girl, Lucy Daniels, played by Nellie Fox, was stupid in every scene, her acting was worse than the original game, and the movie just went on with the ending. The ending is not that good, at least, as the ending was already good. My thoughts are not that bad for a bad, but what does it take to have a sequel? The X-mensis will be a much better movie than X-Man. The X Men movie is not the greatest X-mas movie, but it is not much better than X1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that it's bad, but that doesn't mean my vote.  The ending is pretty terrible, and there's no good way to save this terrible mess. I think it would be good if they just re-tear it and just rehype it. The only good thing in this film is a great voice-over for the voice of the person who wrote the script, Richard Clasping.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was an interesting documentary when I saw it. I was surprised that it wasn't the same sort of crap he made before. He obviously had little interest in writing about the film. He could hardly care less than usual when he made it, which is no doubt the reason why he made the movie in the first place. He seemed like a dabbler, and a hodge of half-wakes. He had absolutely no interest in being involved in any way with any of the things he was talking about. I found out that he did a lot of work with various magazines that got into trouble because the content is really not good and very offensive. I don't know why he chose to make this film when he had such a big chance. I can't figure out why, it would be great if he was a little smarter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had one redeeming feature- that is, the "greater love" which was always there. But this movie had none of the charm that it used to have in the show. The actors were also bad, and the music was bad, too. I had nothing special to say about the music or the acting. I really enjoyed the show that I've seen from the show, and so I didn't watch it, but I didn a chance to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a pity for a low budget, cheesy sex thriller is this one. I'm not sure if it's true or true; I know I'm sure it was the one with the best performance of the movie.  The sex scene in "Giggy" is not only unbelievable but also so bad that I actually didn't feel more than a slight degree of shock.  It's only bad in that it's a horror/horror film, but the only reason it should be rated on the level of horror is because it's so awful. I have no idea what a film like this is intended to be. In any case, it's probably the worst movie of any of the series, and I don't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My poor opinion is...it's a very bad comedy. I've seen several good comedies, but this just isn't a funny comedy. One good movie is OK, but it's not funny.  I hope this movie is never played. I hope I get some decent work, at least I might be able to watch it. But this movie doesn't have any value for anyone outside of the music genre. I know there are several good movies out there, but the ones that had any appeal were, and most people didn't know what this movie was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of the film, because I've seen it so much as a child and I liked to have seen the original version. Unfortunately this movie is full of the worst scenes ever filmed!  There are some good moments, such as the scene in the opening sequence, but there is no scene that makes you feel sorry for the actors. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that I didn't like the actors in the original film. The acting is terrible, as the actors are terrible actors.  Also I find it to be a little confusing to see the film because there's no real explanation as to why this is happening in the beginning and why the main character is so sad, and why she can't die and have a life again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing movie of this year. It is very disappointing and has absolutely no redeeming qualities. I will admit that I had watched many of the other movies in this series. And even the trailers for the sequel show a good idea that one might hope they will be better.  But unfortunately they just don't. They are not even remotely interesting or even funny. They just very boring, and I thought that even the movie's premise was just a simple gimmick to get us to watch this horrible movie. The fact that it has a movie director is a big issue. The only time I saw this movie in its entirety was in the first season of the second series.  I really wish I had seen the first movie when they started shooting for this sequel. It just was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film twice, even though it looks like a typical horror movie. There is something more sinister than what I saw in the beginning.  This movie features the girl's mother, her husband, and her boyfriend. The wife's family and their enemies have decided to try to kill the girl. When they try to hide the father, the wife and her father, we have an idea of who to kill. The only woman in the movie, with whom it's possible to guess, is the father's wife.  The scene that is supposed to take place when the husband and father are dead is one of the worst scenes of the movie. The ending has the girl and her parents, apparently, eating all their food, even when they are dying.  There was some good, but there is also some awful scenes. I'm not sure if this is one or the same movie the N.R.D. did when they were making movies like Monster Squad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was about a major Hollywood film released in 1985, about 20 years ago, and had some good film material to begin with. The reason being was not entirely obvious. But this film was really bad, and there were too many terrible scenes and clichés. I think the director, who never wanted to finish a movie, decided that he needed to finish it, and so he tried to force it off by making the movie seem more cinematic. The acting was so bad that it was just embarrassing and pathetic that it couldn't really be a film, so it has to be played out. The ending is very slow and boring, with too many false endings and stupid plot twists. I cannot recommend this movie unless I were a big movie lover, but this movie just made me feel sick. Don't waste your time watching it and try to look past it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bite," a horror film based on the novel, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is about the boy whose mother is dead, and he finds a bunch of friends who have just been killed in a house by an unknown man. The plot is not exciting or interesting, but the direction is predictable and the ending is the worst I've seen since I can remember. There is no suspense or suspense whatsoever, and I can't imagine a scenario involving those two guys sitting on a chair together, talking about how to get rid of a man who has a knife. It is just pathetic. I don't know if the director was a copyist, but I'm not a fan of horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best one that has been made so far has seen the cult of The Valkyries. This one is just like a copy of the series, except with a bunch of stupid, pointless characters who are no good.   All the rest is a bad effort. The plot is stupid, the characters are not the same, the music is not the best. I would like to note this with a caution. It could get some serious publicity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was absolutely terrible, which has been pointed out from very many other places. I gave it three stars out of 10 on it's own merit; not even one. This movie was never well made; it simply left you with a bad feeling for a while. You may also be annoyed by the fact that the writer (Paul James Wright) is so uninterested in the subject matter; the film was made because he wanted to be "cool" by writing it.  I've read this review at least twice.  There was nothing to say about the plot; the characters were the same as in the original; the ending wasn't the best it's possible to get. The worst of it all is the story and characters. It seemed like this film had been made to be a quickie film for the sake of its budget. We were let out at the start and then let in again, so that we could get a cheap movie. This film could have been easily produced in a video shop; it would have cost us more. It took a year to find a good movie. It's bad because it has nothing to go for; it is also a real pity because of the good parts it has in its structure, though I thought there was still some good in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that this film would not have a major disaster, but it just does. I am really sad to see this film. What it was like is no good. The characters were just the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. They were pathetic in every scene. They did not react to the situation in a way that could be emotionally satisfying to anyone. It was sad to me to see such a low-budget film in the first place. It really does not make any sense whatsoever. It just leaves me wanting nothing more, and I do not even have a copy of it. As I said, I'm really surprised that there was such a movie out. It doesn't appear to have a message. This movie was just plain boring and terrible, and there is absolutely no reason to be in it. No value whatsoever. If you can afford to rent it, I wouldn't bother. I think it's just an over-the-top bore. I really don't even like it. I guess the actors and actresses are just average. It's just bad. If I had to rent this movie I would have never rented it, and it would never see my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film from the 1950s.  It is the worst film I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's an awful film for a film teacher.  I wish I could rent it for an extra movie. I had to rent it so that I could finish it and find a way to fight my anger. I didn't want to go to a movie theater and see it again so I rented it, hoping that it would be better than the first one. I should have paid more attention to the title, which says "The First of Great Horror Movie's". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a real disappointment. A poorly made, low budget film, and I can't believe it's so funny. This movie was put in a bunch of time before it had to make it possible to be released in theaters and the reviews of the movie were not good. I am a big fan of Disney and Disney has made great cartoons and games and I think their cartoons are funny. I'm sure it's hilarious that one of Disney's biggest stars could not even get in the film. And it wasn't even funny. The actors are the worst they've seen. There's no real talent here. And the fact that it's a remake of a movie made on a computer with an extremely bad script is disturbing.  I hope that Disney gets this movie killed because it's not worth a lot of money, and it doesn't seem like it's worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing you will realize when you listen to this movie is, that it is NOT a film at all. I think that the filmmakers had some fun when they were shooting it but after watching it in a 3 hour movie theater it is just an odd mix of old, and old and new. Some of the jokes in the movie are pretty funny, but a few of the lines that were used in earlier films seem like they were made for an amusement park.  And if you pay attention to the story line, which is pretty silly considering it is about a girl that's been around for years, you will find yourself thinking that there was no clue in it. The most egregious of these "plot points" is the "love" which it takes for granted. Some have "love", "friend", and "death" in their mouths. If you look at the movie closely, you might think it was about a man that's dying and wants to be loved by a girl, while the girl in the story is dying because she wants to get this man, but that is NOT the case. That is the way you'll learn about this love, what it is in a "dramedy" film.  The director tries to stick as closely to the concept as possible, but it is pretty clear what it really is. It is the idea of a man being in love with a woman that has been around since he was an old kid, but he is in love again and wants what the girl wants, but when he gets the chance, he is unhappy and is not able to fulfill his desire. There is no purpose to this character, it's just the characters' behavior.  There is also a bunch of silly characters who are not actually who the movie wants you to believe in, but who do give a good job. I'm not sure about who they are. The characters are also pretty annoying, but I think they have more character traits than actual characters. They are in an "friend" that you would like to see at least some semblance of affection.  As the movie goes on, you start wondering why "the police" didn't want to know about this situation, why the police wouldn't just bring a positive review about this movie.  But I'm sure the movie isn't about a positive movie, but about a bunch with no real purpose, it has just one, and not much more than that.  It's just plain, and stupid, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains a major flaw - I do not understand what the title of this movie is supposed to be. What is clear is that it is a movie that contains very few jokes about people who died at a funeral, or that it lacks funny lines. This movie is not funny, nor does it have an idea about the life of a person who is dying from cancer. It's just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this film a low rating because I didn't like it. And it got so bad that I tried to get rid of it and just got frustrated. This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. I don't know if the creators of this film know how badly it needs to get through all the awards it got. I'm a guy who is completely baffled. There is just one of these stupid movies that you never want to see. You should never pay money to see this movie, and if you did, you'd never finish it. This film is not for you. It just needs to be stopped right now. You're looking to buy a copy and you'll probably not find any good movie for you to buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this film was so lame to be the sequel to a hit movie: what a joke? This film was terrible. There is a pretty obvious ending and the rest of the film is an odd mix of a horror film and a cheesy horror flick. If you liked the first movie, watch it, if you didn't like the first one, watch the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did enjoy this movie, with all the good dialog. But the main problem is the ending. The only ending could be that the boy was a little kid. I didn't want to see more of his life, so I tuned in to watch the final scene. It was horrible, but I had to admit, it was the funniest scene in the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is about a couple of teenagers who are trying to make a better life, and one of them ends up on a dead-end street and stumbles in the middle of the night. What happened is that they fell into an alley. When a dog falls into an eye, they are both surprised and angry that they should be dead. The police respond, and the whole story becomes a story about a murder. The ending is painfully obvious - it's all in a "show-piece". The characters are not good actors. Some of them are annoying and a bit obnoxious, and a few others who are interesting are actually not that interesting - most of the actors were probably not very good actors, and their performances are fairly flat and predictable.  There are other things that are bad - most notably, the acting is bad, and there is no continuity between scenes. Some scenes in the film go on too long, and they're very predictable. The film's dialog is pretty stupid, and characters sometimes don't do things that make them stand out, and some of them have little personality, but most of their scenes don't make me even notice them. Some plot lines seem a bit long and unwieldy, and it's hard to find the story through the film. There are too many plot lines in the movie - they aren't realistic enough. The characters do not have a clear idea what the story is, and I couldn't really believe that the story was actually about murder. In a few other parts, the film's story feels a little bit too long to be a comedy - the final scene seems a bit much less silly, and is better than it could have been. I recommend the first movie to watch only if it's part of a movie of the kind that I'd usually recommend, and even less if it was something that I liked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie over 40 times and I am sure it is garbage, but I thought the storyline was good. There were certain moments that were interesting, such as a scene where a woman is lying on her legs. But other scenes were less interesting.  Other people I saw over 40 hours of video, but don't read out the whole thing because you are bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the most terrible film I've seen in a long time, I mean terrible, not to a good movie. I could not tell if it was actually a film at all, it really wasn't a film. What were you going for? No one ever gave it a chance. This was an unfortunate addition to the very good "Ghost Rider" movie series, even as they were given some good ideas from some of the "Hollywood's" version of "Halloween" stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a rating. It was awful! I'm a guy who has listened to all of the books and movies since I was 6. This movie was the same movie as it had the first one, but the sequel was better than the original. The movie was really bad, in my opinion, but it wasn't just a bad, it was a bad way of making a movie.  It wasn't all bad because there were many funny moments. The story was good though it wasn´s mostly predictable. But you can't understand anything in a movie until you really get into it. The ending was pretty weak as well.  I hope you will stick to the sequel, because there are some interesting story lines and it wasnʅt just a filler! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that this movie was crap, and I am still looking for more film that I can get to review. I know there are good movies like this one, but if you go to watch it in the UK it is not going to be one. The movie starts out with some interesting elements of the world, and is pretty boring when it reaches its climax.  There were a few interesting things, such as the horse that was used to convey the spirit of the human beings who came before the book was published. And what the hell did we do in the previous book? There was nothing to add, but the book is still pretty interesting to read and it should have been put back in the book. But the movie really doesn't matter. This movie doesn't count as a good movie, and would be best put in the junk heap of the "The Darkest Day". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film opens with a scene of a woman's lover telling him that a "ghost has come in." Suddenly this is all wrong. This is the movie where "The ghost is inside the house" for a few minutes before she has a conversation with her boyfriend. The next scene she's in the hotel (she'd been drinking alcohol all night long and was sleeping). That's all there, she had sex with a friend and had sex at a different hotel. She gets to the bed alone and sleeps with some of the friends who stayed in the room. She then goes to work and the next day a friend drops off at the hotel and gets in the bed with her friend and gets drunk. She wakes in the bathroom with alcohol running down the floor and is so drunk she can't sit on the stairs and does a lot of laps.  She also gets to work again and that same scene is again, she is drunk and her friend is drunk as well.  Her boyfriend is getting restless and the other guy is having some problems with his boss. After he is given some kind of an uncomfortable scene he tries to sleep in and gets into the bedroom with her and tries to take her away from it. He gets drunk and tries something and gets thrown out. Then he gets in a fight with the manager of the hotel, so she's beaten up.  Another scene with a ghost appears but nothing happens. That night happens then it is all right, the man comes in the house and the girl wakes up to find the ghost. He gives her the guy his car keys so he can drive off with it and go to an ATM. He doesn't have a job so he decides to take care of his dad while they're in the middle of the parking lot so he doesn't hurt his car.   I can tell you that the ghost who she sees in the other scene is a little less dead than an average ghost.  It is obvious to the viewer that this film is about an insane movie that just happens to take place in a hotel somewhere. But that really is too long. The acting is bad, I mean it's bad, the cinematography is bad and the storyline is stupid. The story is about bad movies and they just make them good for the audience. If you watch this film in a movie club, you would have to be really sick of it. If I ever get another movie I'm going to find it again and watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not been much more interested in the other films, but the one I saw was a lot of fun. It did not work for the sake of being funny, but for the lack of direction and pacing. The ending is not funny enough and is simply bad. I cannot understand why this particular movie is still considered one of the best comedies of the all time, but if it is true I would like it to be taken under serious consideration. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could have been better. I thought the whole film was a mix of trash. I mean, the acting was bad. The characters were stupid and the cinematography was bad, and the film made even less sense than usual. And it wasn't even as funny as the old Jack Black film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of things happen in this movie. There are some of them really good, but this movie fails to make me like it. I usually like the way a movie is set up. But it's too stupid, and it doesn't even make it worth to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This has been the worst film I have ever seen. The dialogue is so bad. The story is weak and predictable, it is unbelievable that a movie like this was made to begin with only one trailer. The cinematography is bad, the acting is bad and the dialog is even worse. This movie is made by a very poor director, no talent for acting and no talent or special abilities for making this movie. I can't even understand the premise. The fact that a little boy is sent to a very long-wind-sounding video game and gets in his first scene with an older woman who's trying to get revenge on him by having sex with him is a total farce. The scene is basically a set-up for a sex game. The game is stupid, and the fact that it is played by an old lady is even more stupid. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, in my opinion, and not even a movie from a movie company. I cannot believe that people would be willing to pay money to watch it. It would cost me a lot of money, and it's extremely disappointing that it was even released. I was expecting a more good movie, but sadly, this is one that falls far below my expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was stupid from the beginning. I'm a very passionate film buff. I was a huge film buff watching this movie and the ending was just plain stupid. I know it was a "film", but that wasn't a word that was spoken during the whole screening. I can tell you why that was the case. There was not even any humor in this movie.  The acting was terrible too! The acting, when I first watched it, were poor and the acting was poor. The plot was completely busted up. I didn't even notice the plot. The director seemed to be so desperate that he didn't actually care what he was doing. I thought there was more serious trouble in this than a horror movie. If you want a "horror film", don't watch this! It is stupid, just a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's an interesting thing about the whole thing that the director, and the producer are so uninterested in creating a good movie, that's not even in the end funny. What happens when a young boy turns into a very sick and mysterious monster? He starts hallucinating an ever so strange person, the people that surround him, and his best friends.  This movie is awful. It's so sad it has no plot, no ending, and no acting. And it starts with a truly stupid scene where one of the people in a movie says he has some kind of personal grudge with the person he's seen on screen. How could anyone possibly make such a ridiculous remark to anyone in such a situation?  I know, but you don't have to understand it, because it's not funny. It just saddens me.  The movie is supposed to be about a very sad kid with an unusual condition, who becomes involved in a case with a mysterious lady. When the girl dies, the boy, and what remains is a mystery, begins to act in bizarre and very bizarre ways. He becomes obsessed with her and obsessed with himself.  What happens? The people he's trying to get to drink and get a girlfriend? He dies, and dies, again. And he becomes obsessed and gets revenge for the girl. I'm sure there's a good story, but what happens is just about pointless. And I've read the reviews that this movie has gotten around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I read the "newspatch" review, it seems I should have to write a negative comment about it, but I cannot. So it must have been bad for a long time, as it's the only movie I've ever seen that I've gotten so bad reviews. I can't think of anything else in this movie except the fact that the title had been 'fuzzed' by the casting. Also the "dramed-life" is overrated by the acting in the film and by the movie itself.  All in all the main actors, the acting is not good. There are some good performances but there are also some bad ones. Also, the soundtrack is OK, but the soundtrack soundtrack is terrible. I did find the soundtrack very catchy, though.  The other movie is an action-fantasy movie.  My rating:  7/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main theme is about getting lost in a family dispute between an adult and an elderly woman. The young male (who is the "youngest") is trying to convince an elderly female that she can convince him into joining her family.  However, the elderly woman is not a "smart" woman and she decides to leave the family and stay with her old parents. She is accompanied by a younger male who was the "greatest" in her family, whom she didn't see after one time.  It seems that the people who created this film didn't know what a true family feud was and the movie seemed to be made in the 1940s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this show in a movie theater in NYC. I never saw it on TV and I thought it was one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. It should never have been released. In fact I think it's one of my worst movies ever. The acting is really awful! I know people that say it's good for them but the acting is terrible and the acting has the worst acting. It also does a good job of taking the time out of an otherwise normal movie to look at. However it does have some funny moments. This is nothing like a major Hollywood film. There are few "chic" movies like this one so don't expect a straight comedy. But the worst movie ever I've seen is probably this one. Don't waste your time. It's bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie, I had to laugh. I tried my best to figure out why it was never published. It wasn't an important film, really it wasn't a big film in the sense of it. It was just that it was not well done and there was no plot. The story had some good bits, but there were a lot of plot points that just ruined any chance it could get out the way it could. The film was not funny and it had no real funny moments. The characters were not funny, although there were some cute and some funny characters. The ending of the film was so lame. It could have been funny with some lines that were funny, but I did not laugh. A lot of people do not understand the message of the movie, or just assume it's not funny. I give this movie one out of 10 because it was just so bad.  The other bad thing is that it is a musical performance. It is the weakest movie of the cast members and I did get bored and even laugh in it. I thought the musical score was good, but it didn't really contribute to the film in any way. This movie was just a bad sequel of the musical classic "Twinocut" (the musical musical) and the film just isn't as good. I really liked "The Three Little Roles" and "Corsac." I think that this film was the worst movie of all time and I don't think it's good at all. I think it could have an impact on the production industry and I would love to see some big talent get behind it and help out. The casting was bad, the script was not much original and the acting was OK, but the acting had nothing special. And there were no funny and funny characters in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely pointless, it had no plot, and it just didn't care for character development or character development. Unfortunately, it lacked some of the best of the horror genre as well as some good action scenes, the characters are too wooden and their scenes are often quite meaningless to the viewer. The acting was also too silly to be taken seriously, although the acting is good. Some of the performances are just plain bad, as though some of them are amusing, as well. The casting was not strong at all, especially in the parts that had an emotional connection to the audience. The music also was not good, in fact it isn't even songs, which could be a plus for some scenes.  I give this movie a 1/2 for a bad attempt at horror, but you might like it if you like a horror movie: not a good horror movie, but a fun one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see a true, believable Hollywood horror movie, then this is not the movie you have in mind. There are few parts that make you want this film to be interesting. It doesn't make sense, like why would the protagonist be given an explanation for this bizarre behavior and become involved in the mysterious events? (I mean, what would the director want?) You can count yourself a little more believable than you could when watching this movie because you really have to believe it to be a movie. And that's a problem. You will get bored and have to stop the movie if you want a horror film to watch.  This movie contains the worst dialogue and I wish I had given it a better rating.  But what else is this movie made up? I really would have to ask.  I had to put this movie down as I had an incredibly bad movie to watch and I still have not watched it even though I have to watch it. The only good point about this movie is that some of the action scenes were excellent and the camera was very good. I really liked the little special effects they made in the movie. But in addition to all of the stuff, it's also just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a bunch of old clichs from the movies and children's movie era. This film's characters have little substance and they are all acting as they are. The female lead is a bit obnoxious, and the male leads just don't have the presence that the other male leads have. The acting is poor, and there are no real chemistry between the two leads. The cinematography is bad, too. It is hard to watch two people acting in their roles in any kind of way.  It's hard to find anyone who liked it, and I couldn't even find one positive review about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, this is a comedy about an unproved film, and not an ideal work of horror - but it's an attempt at comedic subverting "fun" instead of making a horror movie that has "the potential to frighten people".  I don't think it's funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film contains the worst acting I've seen since, maybe, my lifetime. I mean, I'm a person who knows the words but not the music. I was really upset to see how little it got, what with the bad music, bad editing, and some very disturbing sound track that sounded like it was going to be the soundtrack for a TV drama series. It was definitely not worth seeing, although I suppose you could gain some enjoyment if you really enjoyed the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I wasted 2 hours watching this movie, I wish I could have given those 2-3 hours back to me. It's an obvious joke that some of the scenes were stupid. There is nothing funny or interesting about the characters. There are no clues and there are not even a plot. There's no plot and there's nothing to connect to the film. I don't know why this movie was made in the year that this is a "funny" movie. I think it would have been better to put a better film make for it and then give it to the public.  It would be better if I had some way to relate this movie to the other films made in 1950s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read and read and reread the book a few times, and have decided to try to see it again in my opinion. In one line the characters are all in the place of one or several other major historical (I think) events. In another line the story is about one character, and in another it is about another character, a minor, and one more character in a different area. It is just not believable that the different characters are in a major league team, so I will give it the benefit of having more characters with their own personalities. In other words, it becomes so long to read that I was bored by the end.  One last point I have to make is that the movie is so poorly scripted. There is absolutely no one believable character that is in an interesting way. The characters are stupid, and this is the main point in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked the "Kali" story, but I don't have any idea what this movie is about. So my opinion is that they should have used their special effects to make something better. I know there is a lot of fake magic, but they just used it in the wrong place. That was not fun, and very un-real. I would give this movie a 5 out 10 if it was just bad, but it was not even good. I am really looking forward to the next one. It would probably be better if they would use the actual special effects for a better movie. I hope the "Turtle Egg" would get to make some money by showing it in a movie, but since it has not been a good movie, it needs to go to the other party. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not a bad film or an interesting piece. I don't know why this movie is supposed to have any interest whatsoever but it does have a few good qualities. I have the only question I have about this movie.   1. The story is not good or interesting and it is pretty dull. 2. The action is dull and not good. 3. The special effects are annoying and stupid. 3.- There are no good special effects, that is really a shame.  The cast is not that good. This movie will be terrible if you like the action and suspense of "Vitalis".    This movie has nothing in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember this movie as an extremely bad piece of work. It was probably one of the worst video of all time ever made. It really seemed to me to be "just a video" but what it was really was just a bad video movie. I was a little bit concerned when I saw the opening. It made me very annoyed by the fact that I was trying to look past it to find something interesting about it, and the fact the story had so little relevance to the movie that I wasn't even listening to it for several hours. I've never liked Hollywood's "regular movies", and I was very unsatisfied with "CIV" and "Rock of The World". But there was an interesting element of this story, I guess it had some relevance to me. So what if the first one isn't a piece of music or a film but a movie to be used for a commercial purposes? I just didn't know if it would work. The only good thing about this movie is that I didn't have to watch it again, and I didn two additional episodes and watch them anyway. It's awful and awful to anyone who actually wants to see it. It also seems to be just as bad as the TV series: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know people have different opinions about this movie. I found it so bad, the jokes and the whole idea of a film made in the name of John Pohl was very ridiculous. Pohl has such a low opinion of people that it's almost impossible to find out what his opinion about the film is. I don't like John Pool because he is one of the greatest comic artists of all time, but Pohl is an odd person and no one knows why he wrote this movie, his style is too lighthearted and he's just a guy who wants to have some fun. People who want to see a movie that has nothing to do with it should stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An illogical plot and a badly acted plot seems to be the highlight of this troubled film. What I do not understand is that the people who are to be subjected to such a treatment of life and death need to be so sad and scared that they'll lose their sense of humor. As far as this movie is concerned, I was glad to see the people involved in making it happy and funny. I was also wondering how someone could stand such a premise and not be able to laugh in a movie anymore. However, this movie must be based on the premise that nothing is too funny. This is not a comedy of the year, and it must be a comedy that could be taken as seriously.  The film has been released at a small town in Colorado and I would definitely recommend it to the worst viewers. It must be an old, unappreciated film by those in Los Angeles, and even a film in the beginning of a career, but it must have a chance to make up for its deficiencies.  I really have difficulty believing that this film would appeal to a serious film enthusiast. I could not find anyone who understood the plot and how it worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although the movie itself has a few good points, the most annoying and frustrating of them all was an opening scene where I really believed that the whole time that the main characters in the film were on a cliff (not in a very dramatic way). I'm not sure how to describe this scene without sounding like I'm making a gag out of it. And there is a lot of things I could comment upon, but it was all terribly irritating, and I was getting tired just seeing it. I can't even recommend this movie anymore to anyone considering it for a few minutes. But, it is a shame of the very bad acting that this movie has been. I hope that the producers of the movie will at least put some effort into making it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry. I've seen this movie more than 40 times. It is not for the lack of money that I have seen in the last 40 years. I think that some good elements of the movie still exist, but this movie just lost something important. It would have had been nice to see a sequel to this movie. There is nothing else that I would want to watch. The story is really not all that good, but if you could see it in its final moments (when it was first available) would be OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In another review, I found an interesting movie: "The Ghost Man", about a guy who has been possessed by an evil evil entity which he has just escaped from. He uses a variety of devices and experiments with those to take control over the girl, the girl whom he sees as his prisoner. I wasn't even impressed by this film, as the plot was not very interesting to me. However, I did appreciate the fact that it is a film that was obviously never going to make any money and had been forgotten. It's even worse in the fact of being completely flat and uninteresting, which I believe can be explained by the fact the director wanted to make money. The movie seemed to have been made to get money for the movie's sequel, which didn't work, but it still looked like it. There were three of the same characters in the film, so there wasn't a lot of story to tell. The only one that could have been better, would have been a special scene in a scene where they came into the girl's room and were attacked by a monster that was apparently in the middle of the movie.  But even that didn't seem to be quite good, so I'd recommend it for anyone who likes their own movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just had an unpleasant movie, and I'd never laughed so hard for it. I'm a fan of fantasy and horror but I'm not a huge fan of anything like this. This movie is not a good horror, and even less fun than a low budget horror. It's really just plain bad, even worse than a good piece of horror or horror like "Dare Devil". I don't think that anyone could really enjoy this movie unless you're a big fan of a horror movie. This isn't one of the "best" movies made in the 90's. It feels like a soap opera with bad twists and gore, and the characters are so flat and unappetable. They just don't get any interesting, and they're all boring, even the one that made me laugh with her. I'd have to give this movie a 1 out of 10, just to look at the time of its release. I could have never gotten over any of these actors.  I also think that if you love horror or fantasy, and have a clear view of the genre, you might be able to enjoy this flick. But if you don't, or don't know what movies are good, you should definitely look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had nothing good to say about this film. It has a disturbing story and a laughable ending. I guess that is the story of this film's purpose? A lot of people have commented about it and I don't understand what this film was intended to be. And even if you think the story is alright, it's badly acted and fails to get any real closure. A lot more should be expected from this film than that the characters are cute and their characters aren't scary at all. The only way it was possible to not be funny was that there were people involved in this. They don't realize how awful it is. I'm sure there are more interesting stories than this. This should not be a true comedy, because of the ending. A funny guy might make jokes. I don' think it should be a comedy though, but if you're a fan of a funny film that isn't that funny, you won't get the full experience of watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was only ONE good moment in the movie, but when it was over I was really sad.  I'm sure the producers had some good ideas going in the script but I'm not sure there was enough to make it into a good movie.    The movie is all about the girls' frolix lives and the girl who wants to become famous. If you enjoy watching girls go to the bar and get to go home, you should give this movie a quick chance, just like a "drama movie". I think there is too many wasted in this movie. I'm a guy who watches so much porn that I have a hard time enjoying a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd love to have seen this movie, but it's just not so great. The story is terrible, the acting is not good, and the cinematography is not very interesting. I was very disappointed.  But the director has so much fun! His performance is unbelievable and his acting is worse than his acting in this movie.  It needs to be banned. It's sad to see a man whose talents are good to him, in the same situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was obviously based on a horrible book and a movie that takes place in 1930. The story begins with a man in an asylum. After some time, the man finds himself in prison. He is sentenced to life in prison and then gets out again. The film then abruptly abruptly changes from a very simple and brief story to a completely nonsensical soap opera. It is absolutely disappointing and awful. The acting was weak and the overall picture was bad.  I don't understand why the makers of this film went ahead and decided to make this. They might have been afraid of losing money and doing a sequel to this movie. But, I guess you have to believe me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can hardly recommend a movie: a weak story, an weak storyline, weak acting, and too many unnecessary scenes. And I'm sure it will get the worse in the end. But there's something else about it that makes it so bad that it should at least make the best of bad movies.  The film is not funny, nor does it necessarily fit the standard genre. And it's not even funny in a funny manner. But it's certainly sad that, having a family that doesn't know what they're up against, a lot of people that don't understand how to communicate with each other, and most of the people on the show are just idiots. I know it wasn't a good film, but it's still interesting to see how many horrible, poorly acted films have fallen from the heights of cult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I found out about this movie after seeing it on the TV when I was looking for it. It's terrible. In short, it's just one of those movies that has absolutely no premise. It really just is an old, old, tiresome movie that will never be found again. I've never liked these kinds of movies. The director (Brian DePalma) has done so much better in his previous films than he has in this one. The only good thing about this film is a little boy named Johnny who is played by a real teenager named Dara. This was one of his weakest performances I've ever seen. The rest of the cast is OK, the actors and the camera are good, but I just find it bad.  The rating of this movie is 1.2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this bad film. The characters were not funny, they were not interesting, and the cinematography was so bad. A low rating: 3 out of 10. It was very disappointing and it seemed that most of the people watching this film didn't know what the heck it was about.  It was made at a time when everyone who made it was no longer directing their own films. So there was no impetus to put this film forward to the film's future. That is why this film was so poor and why it was made so quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to be very patient and have come from many times, I have even watched the movie, but I never knew what was going on. I was not surprised by it and it's just plain bad. It was also the most awful in the movie. I couldn't even read the plot and what happened to the characters was so horrible. I can't even say that the characters were good. I'm sure there is an ending, but none of them come to me personally. And I thought there was the perfect ending for the movie because it was that sad, depressing, awful movie.  The movie started at 4AM in the morning, and at 10AM it is the time to get the movie in. What more would you say? You won't be sad? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film was an awful piece of garbage. I mean even with a decent set and a decent cast it could at least have a decent ending. In fact, I felt that this was a truly stupid excuse for a made-for-tv-movie to be released. I was hoping that one of the actors would have been better than the other. But no. It was just terrible. The soundtrack was terrible, the acting, and the editing was just horrible. I can't even remember the plot.  This isn't even a good movie, as a horror movie this kind of bad...but the only thing that can compare it with the horror genre is the classic horror films of yes, horror, horror film... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I did not know anything. This movie is one of many awful things I've encountered in my life, and I found it hard to believe anyone could still find this film to be worth watching. I mean, if you don't know who the cast of this movie is, don't listen to the plot, you'll be sorry for yourself. If you do, you will suffer yourself. There is no redeeming point for this movie, and it is not a movie. Also, I've found it difficult to find any of the actors involved, and some of the performances do not even seem to be realistic. There's no real sense of seriousness, no realistic tension. The dialogue is annoying and poorly staged, and the acting is bad, with little, if any, feeling about the characters. This is a shame of a bad film. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again, and there are so few funny jokes in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was upset with this movie. As you can imagine, it is the only bad movie i have ever seen. I'm even surprised that it got nominated for the best comedy award. This was extremely bad! I didn't like it because I was one of the people who thought it was a good movie and really liked it. And the best thing about this movie was, the cast. This movie is so bad, and I can't even figure out what the hell it is. I can tell you that the people on the screen were all totally terrible, and that there are no one funny or funny or even funny. I give this movie a 1/10 rating because I can only take it as seriously as it is for a very mediocre TV drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're willing to rent this bad movie, be prepared to spend your money, as I did, and be sure to get the movie at least the next time. I spent hours over an hour on trying to get this movie finished, so I give you some suggestions:  1. Avoid the screen-armored director who has a knack for making awful films; they're just too predictable. Avoid getting a new movie released on the web. Find yourself a good movie: a comedy about a girl that wants nothing but for something to be done with her life.  If your brain knows that you're wasting hours over again trying this movie, and it's not an even good film, get yourself a DVD rental somewhere and rent it before anyone else thinks.  It's too bad to be in the spotlight at the media, but I don't see much merit in complaining about a movie that's too easy to find out. Don't make the mistake of buying the movie and then seeing it through TV.  2. Avoid watching this film for about two hours, or you'll lose your mind and have to sit through the first hour of the film to get it to end. I found it so hard to make it through to the end that I was able to do that by myself, only at the very end. It just got annoying.  3. Avoid reading the book on Amazon. This book contains all the best reviews of the book, which are bad. The writer is obviously taking the book from the wrong direction and making it look dumb.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty good, there were some interesting details, but I don't think the story is very good, it seems to have little cohesion, and this leads to an overall lack of interest. And so the movie seemed to be an effort to "move forward" a story that had nothing to do with the real events, but after all you have seen so many movies like this I'm not expecting it to be anything remotely fresh.  But it is what it is, so it could be easily rated out for just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a bad feeling for this film. It is absolutely pathetic that they're putting a lot of effort in making this movie as the "most realistic film" of all time. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. This film is a very poor piece of work, and is not even funny. The characters are so bad that they can't make the film funny anymore. The acting is bad, the storyline is bad. The editing has not been updated for the ages. The music in the song is not funny at all. This is terrible, very disappointing, and disappointing, no comedy at all, really bad, and no funny. I highly recommend my copy of this film, only 7 bucks to me. But don't listen to the DVD, or watch it, the sequel will only make it look better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie could have been funnier and funnier. Instead of one or two stories that go on for so long it just runs out and becomes a mess. The story is stupid, the plot is so bad, the acting is so poor, the characters are not to be taken seriously or cared for by anyone. I understand there were some funny moments but there were not enough jokes. If you are a fan of the "W" series then enjoy yourself watching this crap, but if you are someone who needs a break from the bad parts, watch a movie that doesn't get the laughs it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has the dubious distinction of being the one of the worst films I've ever seen. The story is nothing, but the soundtrack is terrible. The acting was laughable, but also the whole thing that I saw in it, looked extremely silly, and all seemed to be done by a single person in a large room. There were just three or so people in the whole film, and the only good thing that is that I've read some of the plot. And it must have been one person in the room, because it seemed like it could have been two people and just one of them, but it couldn't have been. It had to be at least two people in one room, and I've been unable to find out what each other was involved in. A couple of the people I saw didn't want to be in this film, but for a long time I tried to guess what their motives were, hoping that they wouldn't act in a bad way. They were so ridiculous that they would be in a long row. The film seems to be set up and acted as if it were a simple play. A simple premise is being played out on a small stage, for their own amusement. No one is actually involved in it except the one who is involved. I cannot describe how it started, and it seemed so bad that it was so bad I couldn't even see it.  I really did think this was a film of someone taking advantage of some of my friends in the "Naked" world who were looking for money to make a couple of million to sell it to the movie studio. The characters, and their names were all on the verge of being believable. They seemed like they were trying to take advantage of the film, which had some great acting. But the film is bad because it was not directed as well as it could be. A film would have worked much better if the "film" writers and the film itself had tried to give the actors a decent performance, instead of relying on them to act in some kind of drama. It's just another bad film. No way to survive this plot! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a whole bunch of bad movies out there. One of those is this one. You'll laugh and think how stupid the movie is and how crazy they were to get involved with some old ladies. It's a waste of money, the acting, the story, and the acting are stupid. Some people thought it would be a good movie, but they were wrong. It was full of the wrong kind of clices and bad acting, and that's for a lack of money. The film wasn't even filmed by a person that was in the community. This one isn't really worth watching unless you're looking for a "b-movie", or unless you can see it in a video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that keeps this movie from being a good story is the way it was cut together so badly that there is no continuity to the story. I'm a big fan of movies like "Rise of the Iron" and the "House of Sand" where each character has a different story. However, the characters are not the "rightness" movies that we normally watch. I think the way the story is cut together could be a very good plot if the movie wasn't so predictable.  I'm not sure how to characterize this movie, but the way that it is cut up makes me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not as funny as it has been on other "funny" movies, but that's not enough for it to be the worst movie ever made.   The movie starts as an overly silly comedy but then morphs into a really bad movie. It isn't funny enough to be funny at all, and it's way too heavy on the jokes. In addition, it takes way too seriously. There is a scene in which a man gets hit by a hammer, and the guy tries to get into a new environment, but he can't really get anywhere with a hammer. Even so, it is not a funny scene. If the characters weren't bad, this movie would have been a decent comedy.  But they're all pretty stupid. And not very funny.  If you're looking for a good comedy, try "Wacky World". This movie should have been better. But unfortunately, it wasn't funny. This movie would probably have been made for a younger audience, and I'd definitely recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen the film in one week and had to be sure I was watching the film properly. I was expecting to have fun. I did not see this film in a bad way at all. It was an hour and a half of time, but I wasn't the only person that got annoyed with it.  The film is a lot of noise. No real action. Just sort of silly action.  I cannot say that the film was bad, and i could feel like watching it from one-half of one. I just wished I would give it a more honest review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've seen this movie, don't bother. Don't think I'm saying that it's an interesting film, but that's not the only thing that can make this a bad film. The story isn't original or original, but the idea that a bunch of guys in a bank will get away with an illicit loan and a bunch- of guns is absolutely ridiculous and stupid. And that's all I got. If you have a couple of beers and you start watching this movie with your friends, be good at it, but don't go into the movie expecting a lot of laughs. That is all it takes! This movie should have been made at a school of thought rather than a film studio, because it's a really, very lame way to produce a film that could actually be shown anywhere. This movie is only slightly funny and slightly entertaining but I'm not a big fan of comedy in general. A lot of these jokes are simply recycled from movies from the late 60's, when people were still trying to create modern art, so if you want something that is totally different from the last 30 years, you can watch some of the classics that are also hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the year of the year, and this movie isn't worth a chance. The first problem is that the acting is so bad it's obvious the characters are so bad they can be amusing. The second problem is the dialogue.  It seems to have come from the old television series. The dialogue is awful, the acting has never been good, and the special effects are terrible. And, surprisingly, I thought the special effect was really good. I thought that was a little disappointing, given the fact that the special part is only 5 minutes long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this film as a child, I was really unhappy with it. I just didn't like the idea of it, and there were a few times I really felt like watching it. But it didn't affect my children too much. In fact, they are usually good at all other things. And I'm not sure if I have ever been a child that would have seen this film. In any case, I'm sick of this movie. I was about as depressed as I could have become. And it doesn't work as a children's film. The ending just never goes anywhere. The story is stupid. What could it be. I've seen this movie once and I didn't care, but it's a lot of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, I don't care what they have been saying, it's not funny, it looks like a little slap in the face. The ending is so stupid. I laughed, and my wife laughed so hard. It was never funny, this isn't a good movie. It is not funny at all! It is very depressing and boring, and I do not feel like this movie will stick with you. There is one of my first reviews ever so I'm not going any longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just a few weeks after the big "Nuurses of the North" film to follow. Unfortunately, they didn't do anything with it. The first half of the film is a very dull and unimaginititative piece of horror. You would be wondering how they were so cheap to make this in the film. However, the second half is a pretty cool horror/gory film, with the story revolving around the women being raped by their husband, so it is very uncomfortable to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of trash. No one ever asks a movie like that to be a serious film; you know it's not. If anything was wrong, then the characters were OK, but the dialogue was pretty weak and not all that funny, and the overall story was bad. I think it was an obvious waste of money and effort. I don't care about the money, which was the only problem. The director tried to make some of his funniest comedy scenes, but that was pretty much done. If this had been a serious movie, the story could have been more interesting. And don't go on to tell us that there is a sequel, because I was hoping to see something more interesting like this movie. The acting is bad, and I would give this movie a zero rating in a movie: 0/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had the potential to be good. But it wasn't, for my taste. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I think it was so bad because it was terrible. It just plain sucked me in and made me laugh to death. I never laughed to death, but I heard my own friends laugh as they laughed, the same way they were laughing. This movie was so horrible that I was crying and I couldn't stand it. I'm a man so I don't laugh, but it was a comedy about nothing. If I want a movie with a plot I have to watch this movie, I can't listen to the music that this movie had in the beginning because I have a feeling that these guys made it a joke and tried to make it too funny. The characters were so bad that I just couldn't believe they weren't making fun of the whole world, but the same thing with the ending made me uncomfortable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a group of four kids. But after three days, they decide to kill the kids. In a flashback sequence, we see a guy with no visible or visible family. After five hours of the movie, it's obvious that there are no families. The only ones we see are a couple of them. The characters are so bored they're almost impossible to care about. A lot of the scenes are pointless and nothing at all makes sense, and the overall look and feel of the film is poor.  It also feels like the sort of a movie that was put to life only for the sake of getting the license to make it. I mean, it looks like it was put together for money, and there's a lot of money in it. Maybe if it had a different ending or a different storyline, it might have been better. However, it still suffers from a lack of plot and a general lack of focus, which makes the movie not really funny or interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not very interesting or funny, and even the little funny moments in this movie never get much appeal. I feel there is no plot or story. I also feel there's little plot line. The movie never gets a real storyline, and some of the characters are very shallow and unfunny, and there are also a lot of scenes that could take up to an hour of screen time. The storyline has two or three plot points. They are never coherent, and one point is totally unrelated. I felt like the movie didn't go anywhere. The film is pretty boring, and it takes advantage of the fact that it is very long to finish. The whole movie starts to get very long and drag on, even after the movie was over 90 minutes long. I don't recommend this movie unless you're a fan of horror movies (I don't think it was ever made for that), or if you just want a cheap movie that will only make you look at the other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may think it is an acting show, but it's really a plot that does not make much sense. In the first scene you have an acting master that is literally speaking like a human and his wife in a scene that has the whole point of it being about him having to deal with a man that has no real acting skills. The acting is bad, but the music is good. You might be surprised, but this guy is pretty good. He's funny, but he's not really convincing.  In the next scene the acting master goes in and puts an evil businessman into a room and tries to kidnap him so that he can blackmail him. He is accompanied by his female assistant (also a very bad acting talent) and you would think that he's funny. Unfortunately, she gets kidnapped by the evil guy and gets raped in a room. When the victim gets raped, you'll never really get over that scene. The good news is that the acting of the movie is pretty cute and that a few of them are good.  Don't waste your time going into this movie and hoping for a good movie. Don't spend hours and hours looking at the plot for a funny ending. I can barely stand some of the actors' dialog and there aren't enough jokes to make this movie funny at all. I didn't expect some of them to be funny, and I'm glad I got into this instead of laughing. If you want a laugh, just a couple of minutes and you won't be disappointed. I just wished they hadn't put some extra jokes into the movie and that they hadn'something else to make the movie funny. I would have paid to watch this movie instead of wasting money watching it. I'm not trying to go off on this movie because I think it's good to see more films like this. The problem is that this movie was only so bad that I couldn't get through one of its scenes and even got around enough of it to feel the laughs.  I think that the director probably made the whole movie over with the sound and camera that makes a mess of the sound in the sound track. There's a lot of annoying music that sounds like there was an almost a break in the music track and is annoying to the soundtrack. As for me I didnth believe that the music would work for the next five years and could I imagine that the sound of the song was made during filming.  The music, which I heard that the musical score was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was supposed to be about a good, touching film, and then it fails miserably. I have a few words to explain this...  The director has done this before in a really good film of a good movie - he has a great concept that I can't even remember the first time he had in it. The ending is awful, and it could have been a nice idea, but it fails.  If you want to feel good, just watch this movie.  I would just go for the first one of 2 more terrible movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had great faith that this would be a great film but I'm not so optimistic about it. It's terrible acting and the dialog is so poor! I gave my copy of the DVD to the movie studio and I didn't even realize the name of the director. Also, the female who portrays most of the female characters is an over-the-factotistic actor, just to take the time. The lead is even worse! The lead was supposed to be quite a bit tougher than the lead in the original (I really liked her for it.) The acting wasn't bad, but the script is so bad that it's hard to believe that the film is even a real film. I think there should be some kind of Oscar for this. But it's too late for me, I was able to see this film in the DVD a few years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish I could have put myself into this movie like I always did when I was a teenager. I just went through the first two scenes (and it wasn't even that hard to watch) and was in tears. Then I thought, "OK, I'm going to see if I could find anything better to describe this movie's terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give this film 2 stars and a low 4 out of 10. That's not good enough for a movie, but not bad. I think it would have been better if the film had actually been written, although the dialog was good and if the script was written, it would not have been a very good film. There were a few elements of it that seemed to be intentional but, in the end, the film really seemed to just go. There was no clear theme, there wasn't even any sort of theme, although I thought that they were going to be used in some scenes. There wasn't really a plot, it just seemed to have been put together in one piece of paper, but the story didn't really matter for the film in itself. There also seemed to think that the ending was too long. In a positive review about an interesting film:  I gave this movie a 4 stars for just not wanting to watch it.  This is not an ideal movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's been plenty of good science fiction on the internet lately and I found this to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is so poor it's almost laughable and the acting is so bad it's impossible to understand. There are several bad jokes, stupid acting, a character that is supposed to be funny but simply cannot pull it off and there's even a time in the last hour where a character dies in a movie and the script is written in such a childish and stupid manner it's just impossible to figure out what's happening. There is no real story, no real action, and no real suspense... this movie was one of those poorly thought out comedies that has absolutely no story to be taken seriously and I believe it's the worst remake of any science fiction ever made. It should never be made again, and it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting and acting are horrible. I can't say anything positive about it. The acting is so awful that it would make a good movie about a soap opera. I just found this film so bad that it didn't matter if it was a film or not a horror film. I was surprised to not even give it a rating. This is absolutely awful. I don't even have to watch it to understand what it was. What would this movie be like if it wasn't made to just be a shock?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if this movie was made during the day of the year or the night of the movie was the night in a year when my father decided to rent a movie. I'm really interested in movies, not just cinema, but films that are bad. I'll give you a suggestion of a very bad movie, and the way it plays out is very predictable. I can't even get it into the final section, where the girl gets inebriated by a man in the hotel room. The acting was bad, but what did it have to do with the way she walked into the hotel? It wasn't the way I read the script! It didn't even give me an indication about where she was thinking. The plot was really very weak. The lead is a stupid blonde woman. I couldn't even see the girl's face, and she acted with total lack of emotion. The ending made it look as if it were a really bad movie. What could have been done for it, and if it had been an excellent film I would have liked it!  I'm not sure what it was. This movie is about the same as "American Psycho 2" which is also a bad film. This is bad for people who rent films, for the simple reason, who like to gamble. Also, it's not a good movie for younger kids. I recommend the movie: 1 out of 10. 8 out of ten out of 100. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Rock Monster" was one of those stupid horror films that we all had forgotten. It was about an evil lizard who lived in the jungle and killed everyone in a village. Then he had to follow this tribe to find out where the other tribe was. We've been all wrong in the past.  The movie was actually OK, but it was only for people who hadn't seen the original 'Rock Monster' and were bored with it. The music sounded just awful, and it was a bit too loud for the people who have listened to it to actually notice. The special effects were bad, the story was very disappointing, and I was never able to find anything interesting in it. So if you just like a few minutes of gore and grime, or something that will drive you to some bad movie, this is good. Just don't expect the other 'Monster' to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I give the movie credit for a very bad film. I can't believe this film was made to be such a bad film, but to be fair, this movie is not a full of bad jokes. The only funny thing I found in this movie was the title. This film is completely awful. I didn't know how I was watching this film. It should be renamed "The Devil's Wife". I didn´t believe that this movie had any potential to be funny. It was just a way to fill up that empty slot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's not much to say. The film starts off with a really bad gag. I thought it was a great idea to make a sequel to the original "Robo the Robo" and I did love the idea of making the sequel as a sequel. But they just did that. This is terrible, especially the story of the first film in the series. The first film starts on a scene with the robots and one of them is killed by a guy dressed as a girl. And then it starts on the scene where a guy killed Robo's partner and one kid named after Robo (Robo) shoots another kid. The third film has an ending sequence with Robo getting killed by people in the movie and the next one is where Robo is killed in a house. What makes up a whole movie: a plot that seems like an unfinished sequel to a story that is supposed to have been a film, but there's not a whole lot to say about it.  The movie is terrible in the sense that it's an attempt at comedy, but I don't necessarily care how funny Robo and Bats are in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After getting a little taste of this film, it is hard to stomach. After watching this, I did not even really care for the movie and I became so angry and disgusted that I had to walk away and not waste any time.  I would not recommend this movie to anybody.   I can't even remember the time when this movie was released.  This film has a terrible sequel which is even worse than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I've seen for years, the new version of the T.A.M.E. movie was an incredibly predictable storyline, which lacked the freshness and spontaneity of the original film.  I've worked in film over 30 years, so I know what happens in these movies. The plot doesn't matter when I read the script or the script. The characters are totally boring, with nothing to say but what they say, and what they do.  What this movie lacks in even the simplest details is that it is full of bad actors, and the dialogue is annoying.  Overall, I'm not going to review this film, but this is still a lousy movie, and if you want to watch it, then you're going to pay for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as I liked the premise of "Fever" it didn't go the way it could have been. What would have been really good for a plot in which the main characters were the only characters, a guy who was alone in a mansion with a bunch of friends, and a man who was in an auto shop with a guy in the street with his friend, all in the middle of the film. I'm not sure what was going on here. In addition to the horrible dialogue, the actors seemed to be the main thing in this film, not even that they got the scenes in the whole movie. But I'm sure the director who directed this had some interesting ideas but that was never brought up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I couldn't believe that it was even a movie and it sucked. I could barely sit on an empty seat. I didn't even care that the cast was totally horrible. I don't know what the point of this film was, but it's pretty obvious.  What was supposed to be an interesting documentary about an interesting movie: this movie is one movie of the terrible cult film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting isn't too great. I can't believe anyone could still find anything funny. There's a lot of sex scenes. The girls aren't attractive or good. I wouldn't believe that anyone could enjoy this. The acting is so bad. Some of the actors were good, but they didn't get much depth. Some are interesting, but too long. There are a lot worse jokes than most comedy movies. It's not that there are jokes, but the jokes don't seem to be funny and they don't have any meaning, and some of them were so long as you just didn't care. The sex scenes were very sad. The "dramed" movie looks very un-funny and I didn't like it as much as I thought they were. In one scene I noticed that the camera was constantly changing. There were many times when I could only see some of the other actors in the scenes and that made me mad! I didn was so frustrated with this movie that I stopped watching it and had never done it again. But I haven't seen this movie again, and I am hoping that this one will get the second chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, the cast is bad, the special effects are horrible, the soundtrack is awful, the storyline is so poor, the acting is not convincing, and all of it has a weak cast. I think this movie is not even an entertaining film, it is so bad it must be a series of all time horror movie. And you could never find out the direction that this movie went, so if you have a look at this movie, you will not find any plot, you don't even get to know what's going on, and you know it will not last much longer. I have not seen this movie since, so I don't know whether it was the best or worst movie. I give this movie one 5 out 5 out of 10, if you want to see this bad movie, don't waste your money, or skip it for some better film, don give it a try.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a rating of 3. I didn't like it. I thought it was a very bad movie. I think it was an extreme, and I think that all of the actors were pretty bad. The only actors I liked were James Woods, David Letterman, and Jessica Alba. I don't think they were good actors, but the whole thing was just pathetic. There wasn't even a good script, and the actors seemed to have no clue how to act in this whole thing.  The director did a great job in making this crap. He obviously knew nothing about how to make it, and even when the movie was about to be released, he didn't even bother making it. The acting is bad, and there aren't many people who actually enjoy it. Some of the scenes were amusing, but it's hard to watch, and it gets tires when it gets long.  Overall, I was very annoyed with this movie, and although I know there are people out there who like it, I don`t see any of those. This movie needs to be on some 8th grade quiz show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the producers of this movie were good with their scripts and acting, they would make a good film. But this movie, especially with a poor script and acting has not been good. They could have been great with a better script and better acting. They just had a really bad script, terrible acting, bad directing, and poor special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is the worst film I've ever seen, and the one that I can remember. I don't even know what the film was about, because I've never seen one in the theatre, but I thought it was like a little "The World of Monsters" when I saw it. In other words, I have seen the most despicable of movies of my life, which was called "Grimm", "A Tale of Nasty Creatures", and I saw a piece of it in the early part of the summer of 1970, and I thought that was one of my favorites. In the film, the main character is one of three teenagers who want to be "Marry", or some other kind of relationship, and who are two guys, but are unable to achieve such a feat. They are the gang leader of the gang, and one of them is a kid with a giant tail, and they spend a lot of time getting down on the stairs to go down to the bottom of the stairs and climb onto the railing, getting in the way and causing a lot more trouble. The rest of the cast is the guys who go on the gang and want to go off on their own to become "Mae". By the time I was in college, I couldn't even tell you which one was the main characters. I've since read all the descriptions of the movie on internet, and by the time it came out, I had to really read it again to get all the parts of it. As time, and it didn't make any sense, I tried it and I was only able to see the beginning.  The gang, or at least the gang. I'm not certain which one it is. I had assumed that it was a one character in the gang who got it and went off with another character. It turns out that it is in the same position as "Glimps" with the gang guy in "Nasty Creatures". It's just the gang getting in fights over and over again, going on a mission, and there are all kinds of things wrong with it. The only thing that keeps me from laughing was how pretty silly the scene is. A couple of times, I even found out I hadn't even the slightest idea of how a scene went in, the gang of guys just came to the guy. The film had some of the most disappointing dialog I've seen since. It's really pathetic. The dialogue in the film is so unbelievable and bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't have had any patience for that movie. I have to admit this movie didn't quite meet my expectations. The acting is so awful it's not even good to watch. I did really enjoy "The One Tree House" because it was about a bunch of people living in a small house who were trying to build a community. This movie is like the "Movies You Have Never Seen". I didn't think I was going to watch it, because it is about a family who builds a house. I didn't want to see more of it, but I did see enough. There wasn't even a sense of "welcome" in the house. There were all sorts of problems with the movie. In my opinion, it is one big mistake in "The First Person You See". If you are looking for a comedy, I don't have to tell you a comedy movie. If you're looking for an adventure, I strongly recommend "The Island Adventure". But if you're interested in a comedy about a movie involving a family, I would strongly recommend a good comedy movie for you. This one fails because its a comedy that is nothing like the movies you would expect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, it's really a movie that only shows the true spirit of the movie. That being said, what has happened here is that the movie has turned me off. It isn't a great movie, but not for this show. What has really been happening has been nothing positive. The movie just seems to be pointless, and as a result, I don't even care if my family would see it. I did watch it once, but when I'm old, I'll give it the thumbs down. I'm sorry, but it just doesn't go anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had no plot, character development, and a plot was never developed. It wasn't really "great", but it's pretty bad. I was impressed with the special effects that some of the girls were wearing, but not the way they were talking and in their voices. There were many times I felt the movie was a lot less interesting than the other "B" films I have seen. The acting is not strong and there were a few of the actors that I liked, but the others were too weak to justify their appearance, especially for a movie made in a year that had a few funny characters (some of them are funny in the other film "C").  The best way I can say about this movie is that it's just plain bad. In a good movie, you have a great plot and a great idea that goes to great heights. This movie, however, had nothing else going for it. It's not like any of the other films I've seen since. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie on 3D. It's not worth my money. The ending was unbelievable, and it was so bad that I left it on to watch and didn't bother going through the second movie. I don't recommend this movie as a viewing party. In my opinion, if you want to watch this movie, don't. Because, as I said, it's not so bad. Just, a little short and a poor film, I would definitely recommend watching it on 3DS for a few bucks, but I didn't recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie after seeing it on TV years ago. I could not understand the story. I was hoping to see a movie that would actually have what it needed and be interesting. But I was just tired of the crap that happened on it and I wanted it to stop. I am so sick of it. I give the director credit for having this in a director's film so they are good at it but this movie could only be a mediocre movie. I can't even understand why people think the movie is so terrible.  I was so upset at this movie because I was a huge fan of it for the most of its 2.5 hrs. It wasn't even funny but there were so many parts that were bad and I felt like it could have used a funny script for itself. It didn't make sense. The way it was supposed to be funny was just to go on and make a movie and get a laugh from a funny joke from the first person I ever saw. That wasn't the end of the movie but it would have made for a gag movie: a really stupid joke. I didn't understand why they would care about making this. The director should never be able to get a credit for this movie: It was not as good as "The War Against The World" but it had a cool ending. I found the ending bad parts of the film quite funny and I laughed but just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking at this film for my 30th birthday and, like the other reviewer, i thought it was just an average horror flick. I didn't see a single person in the whole movie. It was way too slow and didn't move around much. I really wanted to finish it and I didnno reason to start making jokes about it. I mean, it wasn't even funny, just awful. There are only about 3 minutes in the entire movie. The plot is pretty basic and boring and the ending is slow and painful. The music in the film is really bad as well, which was pretty sad considering it's supposed to be funny. The other point is that the writer is in complete denial of what he wrote, it's not only sad but really creepy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is stupid, predictable and a disappointment to me. I have never seen a movie that was so predictable and predictable and I cannot recall the last time I read it.  It is the same for all of the films I have seen. One of the actors is, "Beverlee" and the other actor is, a singer from a bad film. The other actor in the movie is in a really good movie, "The One Where You Could Have Sex With Your Boss".   I was disappointed, but it didn't make me sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie, while sitting on the bus with my girlfriend who was with a friend in Seattle. I was extremely disapointed by it and felt like I was stuck with an adult in a sex act. It's the worst film I have ever seen, and I want to be able to say it without knowing what it was. It plays on some of the same old school of 'wet-stuff' that was used in the 1950's for the 'Beat BTS' that made this movie so bad. And this is a movie with one of the worst acting performances of all time. Also, my girlfriend was so depressed that she could barely even sit and watch the movies.   The film starts with a montage of the events that transpired that day. It starts off looking nice, but it never gets into the action and has no real plot and nothing that makes any sense of suspense. In the next section, we see two men who are in trouble. One man is in jail, the other man is at a bus stop, and a bunch of cops is on their way to the courthouse where the other woman is going to jail. Then, she and the guy who's in jail go shopping, but instead of getting to their car, they do not go shopping. The next section is about a cop's investigation of a murderer's sexual assault. The film takes place after that cop's car is smashed and his car is rammed into the house and he's inside.  And then, when a car is broken and the cops come on the scene, we follow the man who's on the phone with the other guy who died, talking to the guy's family. We are then in the middle of a heated, very loud confrontation between the two guys, as the cops confront him and get him to help.  The way out is cut off by the police officer telling the story of the murder, and we follow him back to a couple of minutes later to find the actual murder. And then there is nothing more. This movie starts off pretty good, but after it's over, it starts to lose interest. The acting is bad, and the acting is very bad, too. The movie is a total waste of time.  I don't recommend watching this movie if you really want to laugh about a good movie: don't. Just watch it for a couple minutes and see if you're bored, but even if you are bored, this movie would be
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't understand what is going on here, but if you were to me that is one thing I have learned from the book, which was how the man died and what a strange death. So the book is not what it was in the book and if you watch the book you will be missing some really important info about the death of the man. But what is interesting to me is the story that he was trying to come to a "real" solution to the problem. The book tells the story of a man dying and dying again with no problems. The way he was coming to this solution is that he would get a computer, like the one that is in the movie, and then send it to the room of a real hotel in San Diego. He then would go in and try to fix this problem. What is in this movie was a man who is trying to get a credit card, but when he gets a card he can't really see what is happening at a hotel, and even though he tries to fix it, it doesn't work. The computer keeps getting into a lot of stuff. The movie is not a great, but I had really hoped that at least some of the things that are going to happen will happen. I have to say the movie is really stupid, but it's not too good. The camera is bad, the scenery is not good and everything is really bad. What happens in the room is interesting though, it is the girl and the guy who were supposed to be in it. They go to have sex in the hotel room, but that's boring. What if they were going to have a party? They would have sex at the room and go into the shower to get something to show off, like naked girls in the shower. There is absolutely nothing in the film that really makes the movie worth watching. I don't know what is it exactly going to be. The film has nothing interesting or interesting, it really is just a horrible script. I really think that the guy and the woman are really stuck in this relationship because they are trying to make it seem more funny and the girl is really having to be a slut, she is just making herself sad. This is not too funny but it could be really boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing scene in this bad movie is the little bit of one dialogue between the two characters.  I was so disappointed with the movie, I ended up watching it repeatedly and it made me angry, so I stopped watching.   I just laughed at the fact that the movie had absolutely no plot. It's just not funny, and it just looks silly and unfunny. The acting is poor, and even though some of the acting is OK, most of it falls somewhere between awful and mediocre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that could make this movie work was an "adventure" which is pretty much a story about a girl who gets involved in some real life shenanigans, which doesn't make the movie much better.  In all, the film really didn't make any sense, which I think I'm only able to find in a movie. But even if you found the main character in the movie, this movie isn't even scary at all.  This movie was very predictable, and there wasn't even a good effort to show the character's growth or development through the plot.   I really cannot believe the director was capable of making a decent sequel, not only because of how bad the movie is, but because it simply is just plain bad. And while the movie has some redeeming moments, I couldn't find any in the end.  I think the movie suffered from the fact that this movie was so heavily produced, and the fact the movie was only 4 episodes long, which makes the movie pretty poor in comparison with the many movies it is making. While I understand some of the reasons for this movie's success, it was simply bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie I've seen since I made it with my sister. I actually liked some of the actors in the movie, the most of them I liked was Jason Tamer and Jessica Capone. But this movie simply had nothing to show me in any way. My brother thought it was funny and I was thinking that I was going to make some funny jokes. But there was nothing to laugh about. There wasn't a funny song. I was really hoping for something funny.  The only thing funny was Jason's character's stupid behavior. It was just awful!  The fact that this movie was so horrible made it seem like it was a funny movie, it was awful! I don't think it was an original film either, it just made a name for a movie that never got the approval it deserved.   If I had been a 20-year-old teenager living in the late 60's, I would have probably never made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the only reason I was able to watch this film was because of some sort of gimmick. I think this is just bad from start to finish. There are no character development, no dialog, no character arcs, and no suspense. I couldn't even sit through a single one of the movie. I just wanted to say I couldn not find any other plot, and I didn't get through to watch the last part. I would avoid any more of this crap for the sake of my son. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand the makers of the movie would have made some changes to the storyline. But, if this movie had a director who made a better movie, perhaps the story would have been better. Unfortunately, they didn't. I can't explain why, but the movie is full of inconsistencies and unrealistic. The plot is very thin. I never understand how the characters would react in their last moment. There is nothing involving in the plot and the characters seem to be disconnected from each other's thoughts. They don't really care about their own lives. The ending is pretty lame and I don't understand why they would change their minds in a moment of tragedy and just kill those people. There's something very sadistic and sad about these scenes, and I couldn't find any explanation for it. What a sadistic movie to watch! I cannot recommend it unless you're a fan of the Twilight Zone series, as I'm sure everyone is. I might be better if you were a teen or an adult and you were actually interested in the Twilight series, but you should really stick with the series and the movie for the awful special effects and crappy acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like this movie... it is an interesting idea, but it really sucks. It is a big waste of time. The only highlight of the movie was the movie being interesting (as well as being funny), the fact that the movie ended on this line was interesting (because I would really like to think about why they didn't shoot this scene...), but there were some pretty stupid lines in the movie and the story seemed to just be there.  I honestly think the whole idea of a movie like this is simply a money-grab. It didn't seem like a real movie that would have any lasting value. I'd even go so far as to recommend it to some stupid kid, but if you can stomach it, why don't watch it, and if you think about how silly it is, why isn't this guy considered for a big hit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not like this movie at all. I think it was an insult to the audience. But it is true! It is also an insult of the audience to have an honest conversation. And it was absolutely awful.  The story is totally pointless. You need to really pay attention to it. The plot was so bad and the actors were so bad. I didn't know who the cast was until I was late watching this movie. I was expecting to have a story about a man and his daughter and it did not.   The acting was bad. Even the main characters were not that good, I thought the actresses were too stupid to look at the characters. The lines were just bad, they were not good. The dialog was stupid, and there was no good dialog. I liked the ending, but I don't think it makes sense.  I think this movie is just a sadomasum film. It is just sad that a man with his daughter does something so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that the producer of this film has a sense of humor, but he seems to think he can be funny. He seems to be obsessed with making a comedy series.  I'm a bad viewer at the jokes that this movie is making. I'm also a fan of movies such as Nightlife, Mr. John Deacon, and The Real House of Paris. They both have jokes that are not only wrong, but also absurd.  This is the same kind of movies that you expect a movie to be made, and the filmmakers aren't a lot. If you want a comedy show, don't buy one unless it's funny. You'll only end up wasting your time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although it was a very low budget, the film had some good scenes. But there was too much of a "Dancing Strip" vibe with the film, and the story that was presented is simply a bad version of the "Dancinettes". I was one of the fans of the original "Dancy" as one of its actors, and this film is one of three in the franchise. (I think the "Bene Dancer" should have been made before the first film was to be released. I really liked the original films, though I felt the plot was not interesting or original and was over-written.  I hope that the producers of "Bare Dancer", will use the "basic elements" and focus on its "bad" cast and story to have some good moments.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor choice of the plot, and poor acting. I think that this movie would be better if some of the actors had more acting ability. I have no doubt that I would have seen this movie had an interesting and interesting plot, but none of the performances made it up. I'm looking forward to spending the next six months in a state-mandated mental facility and hoping that at least one of the three actors, Michael C. Mitchell and James G. Daniels, makes a positive connection. I've been there before.  The actors are not even close, and not good, with some of their performances having obvious, obvious flaws. The direction is poor, even though there are interesting and funny moments. The story is nothing short, and there are absolutely no good jokes.  But please, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have to go to this show, please don't. It's a bad, disappointing, very bad movie. It seems to have an airtight stage. Nothing, especially the sound, is going to save this movie. This movie is just bad enough that you would expect a movie with a plot and an ending that actually works. The ending is pretty weak and the film starts out with a story about two people who were in love with each other. They fight over who gets what and then the people get killed by the dog. I don't know how anyone would think that people are in love when a dog is involved. And that's just plain sad. The film is about a bunch of guys who run around with their arms around and trying to figure out how to get together. And, apparently, the people with the "chosen friends" are all drunk, so they don't get anything to come together and make a plan. There are no "magic magic" and no funny dialogue. There is just a bunch who get drunk and then have a bad "plan" for the main sequence, which is when the two guys get killed. There isn't a good story, but there is a bunch where a girl who thinks she is dead is waiting to be rescued by the good guy (who is wearing a black wig and "Coney-headed") with the help of a couple of men who are drunk.  There aren't a lot of scenes with the good guys. But it's good to see that they do have an idea that there might be a chance to get the people together. But the ending has it's own problems. I feel that it would be better if the film was better. I just didn't like this movie for what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie was really a bad choice. I don't even know why it was chosen as a film. It would have been a better film to just watch it and take it for what it would give. There are some pretty cool scenes in the movie, but none of them are actually funny or funny. The main reason I chose this movie is because it contains a lot of jokes and nothing decent. I really don't like jokes to a bad comedy. In fact, I really liked the idea of this movie because I had my family watch it, and I didn't want to laugh. I'm sure the main reason why it worked was because the actors didn't really care who they were or what they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so unbelievably bad that it has already been seen by every media outlet and the only website I have found is. But I know, for those who can, enjoy the movie. Because, even with all the magic of the film, it is still a dismal mess of a plot, with weak characters and terrible acting. What's in this film: What is the message? It is an effort to make a sequel with just one film? I can't tell. It's just a horrible waste of time. I do not know why this movie was made, why they put this on. The movie just seemed to be designed to get people interested in this project, so that the sequel could be made. What could have been done here? The story is supposed to be an urban movie, but somehow the story is worse than the original. That's too bad. I've had several people tell me that it had some good laughs and a few scenes, but I'm guessing that the director didn't care for the story of the movie that was made. This movie had the opportunity to be a comedy, but apparently, when it was a comedy movie, it got dragged out of it in the worst way possible. And I had to agree with most people, that it was never a comedy.  I only hope the director tries to fix this movie so that it becomes a comedy about a disappointment, not a comedy film. It really doesn't matter what the message is. When this movie is being made, you can't just stick a "magic" twist onto it and make it a comedy that is actually funny. That would ruin this movie. It would be more interesting than a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that the producers of this movie were really that angry to the people who thought this film was good. There are many flaws in the story line that the film is supposed to be about, but these things that happen in the movie are pretty ridiculous, and I believe that people who think this film is a comedy really think that way. People like to say that "Kung the Monkey" is the funniest movie of their life, but I can see that it's pretty stupid. I can easily see how this movie just leaves everyone thinking that Kung is just a joke. And that's not a joke, since it's a little sad for us to see people being annoyed by it. I just want this movie to end and I don't want to be depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the director shows a bunch of black people sitting at the dinner table in the middle of the movie, it looks absolutely terrible. This movie doesn't even have a plot or a plot. This is a very lame movie that has nothing going for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in my college class (for an interesting trivia: it wasn't too popular) and really was uncomfortable watching it. Although the plot was good and the direction was good, the actors were flat and lifeless.  I've not had a good review about any of this movie, so I was very unhappy to watch this and was extremely disappointed in the ending. The movie was supposed to be a horror film, not a horror movie. The end had many of the same endings as the movie was ending.  The most depressing ending was when our group saw the whole movie (we were on the last floor of the movie) and the film ended with us leaving the movie and the other guys leaving on the train. The ending of the last part of this film was a lot less depressing. The only thing I had saved up for was the music video featuring the movie director who played his role in a horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the reviews of the very bad movie. This movie should not have been made at all. If you watch it and think it wasn't bad then you'll never watch this movie. It's just horrible. I did not even watch it. If it was a remake of the original, I'd be upset if it were. This film is just bad. I gave this movie 2 stars because it was bad at all! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot say I liked this movie. I don't believe it was actually a film at all. I'm just surprised that anyone would have the slightest interest in watching this. It was really bad for the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that this film was awful. The actors were supposed to be in the same category as a "normal movie" but did not deliver on those promises. It's like watching "Invasion" for the first time, except that is actually a very good movie. You really should expect your film to suck. It was a big disappointment, even after the director was willing to "make it" look like a classic "film" for him to say. The director's story is so thin and poorly explained. The story is one part about the life of a kid, and the other part is about a bunch of people that are part of a group of drug dealers that want to kill kids.  There are so many bad actors that they just don't have any sort of personalities to them, just like a real actor. The film doesn't have a really good acting talent and it shows that lack of talent. And as far as I could see it, there is no idea of the characters actually having a "friend" in the film, it is one thing that really makes me angry. It doesn't seem like they are all really in the movie, and they are just trying to make money off a movie. There are a few interesting and interesting parts, like the girl's family that doesn't really get along. They aren't in the "drug dealers" position because they are part time travellers. The girl does get along, though, but the rest of the movie is a bunch about her family and her children. The fact that the "other" family is still alive when they're in the scene of a drug raid is also a big fail.  But the director doesn't care for the fact that this is such a bad film, because he is probably one of the most "underrated" acting directors, even better than the ones that won awards for his earlier work.  In other words, don't get out of this movie if you like it, and don't waste money on it. You might like it if you want to see a real gangster movie, or even get "Involution" to the screen. It isn't "real" to me, but you should expect it to be a rip off in it's former lives, like "Big Licks" and "Rock 'n Roll". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I've ever seen. It has just about two good moments, and one in a movie leaves you with one finger and you can't remember which direction it's supposed to follow. Some of the acting is OK, some of the dialog is good, some can be scary. But the ending is stupid and disappointing, and it has the reputation of a movie that makes you afraid of your own stupidity. It could have been saved by having some clever editing, but it wasn't. It is simply a weak, unfashiony and unimaginitius film. It makes me uncomfortable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of people out there who thought this movie was a good one and I can see why they're thinking so. This movie fails to live up to the expectations of the other "scary" movies. If you liked The House Bunny Sursuit of Numbuh and the Black Widow of Number's Asylum, you'd be fine. The House Rabbit (a.k.a. "Bunny") is the standard one for movies about witches or witch hunters, but in "Praeus" things go downhill fast.  The movie begins with a creepy animal that looks like a little girl. He's pretty creepy and creepy and a creepy little girl who lives in an abandoned building on the side of a hotel. The creature is called "Possessed." You need a decent movie to take of a movie that's basically about a house that is inhabited by a bunch of creepy people. I know that this movie could be interesting, but I think there's a flaw somewhere, it's not really about a movie.  Possessed doesn't work well at all. I think that people are expecting one good movie about a haunted house that gets them off their nerves and has them start screaming and kill people and stuff. This doesn't happen in "House Bunny" and in "Honey" and "House Rabbit's Pet" as well as in "The House Rabbit". There are better films about a creepy house than "House Mouse."  A decent story that falls to the category of a very bad movie. That's bad for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I understand the "E" refers to the number of "E's" that are given to the "Kali". This is nonsense. The number of the "B"s" with respect to the two main "E"'s are equal. The "K"s are only numbered by "1" and "2". I guess the filmmakers just forgot the meaning of "K". But this is still a bad and dumb movie. The most annoying thing is the long and pointless story line. The movie starts out with a bunch of scenes that are so stupid that you can't even understand the main plot and the end (for me, the end happens on the very last line in the movie).  But the movie ends with the most disappointing ending. And the end is very painful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really can't believe this movie was made without the money, the acting or the good story-based characters, that it could be an effective film. This movie was simply bad! I didn't think there was an effort to make it a good movie, simply because it was simply one of a poorly made movie... I mean, it was pretty terrible! This movie had the misfortune of being filmed in Canada! The movie was so bad, it made the impression of a real film in which Canada has just begun to come to terms with their own movie! I don't think they could have gotten away from it in time to make a better film! They really couldn't get away from the whole movie. There were too many little scenes and they didn't move fast enough to keep up pace with the story-heavy scenes. I really think there should have been a better storyline in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In case it's my brother, and I've never seen a movie that's this bad. It's just plain awful, like it is in "The Godfather" or "The Matrix" or something else. Some scenes are very reminiscent of "The Bible" or even "Ironman", which are both very serious and so very serious but are way too much. It starts out with a very bland scene where everyone gets beaten up by their own guns, and it goes on to much worse things. The main story is there's a group of guys who go to find some place that seems to be haunted or perhaps to be dead or something like a cave. They decide to leave the place to get some gold and it turns out that the place is haunted. When the group goes to get the gold, it turns into an almost disgusting scene. The gang guy decides to hide the group so that his brothers can get the treasure while his family gets chased by the police, apparently. He's hiding in the cave with his brothers but they don't think to try and break his leg and they get chased away by the cops.  It also starts out as an open-counters action movie, but there's only one scene that sticks with gore. The most egregious thing is when the gang guy is carrying a knife and he has his wife and son with him and she comes over to see the cave. You'll never find out what he has in the treasure. He wants to make his wife eat the snake that she had stabbed on the way to escape. There are other scenes that were interesting. I can't really tell why this movie is so bad. Some have said that it was supposed to be a horror movie and some have given it some thought-provoking themes. But, in the end it just starts off becoming too long.  I hope it'll at least get some of the people who liked it to write a positive review about it because it was so bad, and most people who really liked it didn't pay the prices for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So my first chance to finally see this movie was not one of the great films of this year, I can honestly say that it was the worst of all of them. It would have been an excellent film to take for the movie it was, if for the one who's willing to spend $1 a dollar to see it. If the other parts that this film has were the best, I wouldn't have given it anything for the first 10 minutes.  I'd give it a few minutes to see if I could find some decent "film" for this movie to watch. But it just won't be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film while on vacation and I think I laughed. I have never laughed so much since that movie. I'm disappointed. It's pretty shallow and very boring. Also I think the film was badly directed. The actors were OK for the first few minutes but they were annoying throughout the rest of the film. The music, and the acting were OK but a lot of it went off as flat and predictable. I gave it a few chances but it couldn't make up for another movie that's so bad.  It was interesting to see the film when I did it. A little too late to see it, but I didn't want to waste any of my time and I certainly didn't find it amusing. If you have the time and want to see an old movie it's not a bad one at all. I think it is just about one hour longer than this one, but don't take it seriously. I give this movie a bad 4 out of 10. It just doesn't have the potential to be good. It is like watching a bad car: it's just annoying, and it's way too slow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the video first came out, I was one of the people who was outraged. Then I realized I had been looking at this movie. Then, after watching it, I realized what it was. This movie is a major waste of money, it is an even worse version of the book and the acting is bad. If you want a straight, accurate version of a horror movie, you'll have to pay some of your time on the floor at a movie theater. The acting was pretty good at the beginning and at the end. But if you are trying to enjoy this movie, be careful. If it doesn't scare you, the ending is not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is simply a bad, boring, pointless, slow-moving film, so bad for a family that loved movies. I have to admit, I watched it with an open mind, knowing that it's not a true horror film, but also knowing that I was going to see the first two weeks of its sequel. I had to walk through those first two movies and take it for granted, so I thought that I might be able to see something better than this one. Alas, this is not the case. It's just a complete mess. I am so embarrassed for this family. My hopes are that this is the only movie that it will ever produce. I really hope the next sequel is good, but I'm not prepared to be giving this family any money or time.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a complete and utter waste of time. I mean really stupid stupid and stupid. I never saw it on HBO or Netflix, but the director managed to get some of the film out for the film's own sake. And while I would have liked to see the film to be more of a real story, I wasn't able to see much. The only thing that keeps me from feeling that the movie was a good film is the fact that it could be a movie about a crazy gang. The idea is so stupid and laughable that the director seems to be obsessed with it. I can't understand why. The movie is the sort of dumb, stupid film that gives people a reason to have any interest in it, but a simple viewer wouldn't. I'm not going to cry for a man who is really good. But don't listen to anyone who says that the film was good, because you'll lose your respect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have to be a movie buff, I know all the answers, I like every movie for a few hours, so I give this one 4 points (and a good movie: 8/10) to avoid this.  But I won't be able to finish this movie because it's so stupid. It has some decent moments (like a nice song), but it really gets down to the bottom of the film so bad it hurts me to the point where I have to stop watching it.  I'm sure a lot of people saw this film as a good film. But it just isn't enjoyable to sit and watch it for more than 20 minutes (unless I'm in a zombie film).  But, all of the people I spoke with are still pretty entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was poorly made and could not have been produced in 1973. The main story line is about a man and an army of men. One of the most ridiculous parts I had ever seen was this character, who got dressed as a priest and then went out to ask God to bless and kill the people he was in.  The other one of the main characters in the movie was "John Wilton". This was pretty much a knockoff from the previous "Unfrozen", and a movie which I found out about was released several years later. They're both pretty pointless, but I guess they're not as bad as the original. I have to agree with most people out there who have seen this movie, and I can't see the movie much overrated. This movie didn't even make any money for the producer, but it still had pretty good music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a ton of reviews out now. There is an overwhelming number of reviews of this movie in the IMDb. I will be reviewing it with just the one comment below.  It is only a bad choice to make for a comedy and bad acting and even worse acting. In fact, it is an amateur film and there is a lot of garbage in it. Don't go watch it if you are scared of your money. The only thing that makes this movie a funny is that we have got to enjoy the fact that this movie has got some funny moments. But I don't enjoy these moments. And even if you find the funniest moments of this film, you will think, "Why do they feel so funny?" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I understand what some people say when I mention this, it's not a bad film, just a bad script and bad direction. But it does have some interesting bits. But that has nothing to do with the film's acting or the story in any way. This is just a weak film about a poor plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So there was this one I'd recommend, on a purely comedic basis. But the way it was structured was bad. The camera was bad, the script was bad - the dialogue was totally unsymmetric and there was nothing about it. The ending was about a year away from the original one so it wasn't just one year away, it was one year down. There were even a couple of days when it was almost better. But you've to live, you've got to live.  I would say don't watch this, but it will have some relevance to the younger members of the group. Just go once, please, if you want to see a horror movie - even one that is a little light on the surface - but don't. This is just the worst horror film I've ever seen. It was awful, it wasn´t funny, it made me feel embarrassed. You don't need to see more. It's just one of those horror films you'll only enjoy in a club, preferably with a bottle of water. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was very disappointing. I was hoping that this movie would improve upon the first installment, but that never happened. If you enjoyed the first one, it probably was worth seeing the sequel.  What I would expect was a positive review about something that isn't worth watching. But I don't understand.  I'm surprised that the director has gone so far from the original to such an effort that there is only one movie in this series. It is a very poor movie, I give it one of its worst ratings because it's too long, has no ending and is so bad it has little value to the viewer. I don´t expect any interest from anyone else. It's bad for me, I think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a long time. The storyline is pretty stupid, the actors are not good, and the soundtrack is not good at all. A lot of the actors just have horrible lines and not well-known actresses. This movie needs a decent plot to get a decent cast, even a decent story - at least to get some decent ending. All I can say is the movie is a pretty crap movie with no plot, no plot-lines, and no good acting. In my opinion this is a total horror-fest, a bad remake of the original "Tiniana", even worse than the original. I wish it was a horror movie with the same plot and decent acting. This film is probably the most disappointing horror movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty awful film. The acting is so bad that I did not like the parts they were put together. I found the whole "plot" not to be all that good. And I'm sure the cinematography wasn't that great either. I do not like that most of the characters were portrayed as weak or even as weak, which made me not want to like the movie.  However, it did, strangely, work okay. I am really surprised at how many people have given it credit for being good. I know there was no good movie for this to the point of this. And you don't want to read a lot about this in advance because I think it's a pretty stupid movie. I just want to enjoy my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie as I went in for an review. There are no redeeming parts. The plot was pretty weak and the dialog wasn't good. Still, the end is good, and I have to believe it was filmed with the aid of a bunch of extra time to allow the cast to get into their characters. I think the most important thing here was the 'back story' of the 'Big Roles' which was a lot of the bad stuff from the first movie.  The idea that people in the future are killed by an alien race is ridiculous, and there is no reason for a new race to emerge. At the beginning, the only character to survive was a female. The ending is not even that interesting.  This movie was only slightly better than 'Dismantia' and was bad as all of 'Deathhouse.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the whole movie. I didn't get bored, but even after watching the whole thing I was bored. It is not like a movie, and this is the movie you are watching if you are a guy who has been bored and wants to see something that is not the kind of movie for him. This is a short film. It was not like one of a soap opera or a drama, but I could see that it had potential to be a film that could have its own style. Unfortunately it doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a writer, too a computer geek, but not a video gamer. This movie was about 30 minutes longer than any movie I've seen. It was a long story of bad writing, a poorly cast actors, poor camera work, and awful editing. The most interesting thing about the movie was the opening scene, but I felt that it could be easily improved. I didn't like it because of the scene where I imagined a man touching her breasts and the scene after the scene. This is a film that isn't good at all.  I hope that they will use some of this technology to make the films like this one better. The problem is that the people who made the film don't have enough talent to make films like the ones they made. I've never seen an 80's film like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete disaster! There are many holes on this movie and I would recommend it to a younger person to watch it if you have time and desire to see it! It is a weak attempt at a horror film and it should have been better. It's not good for an 8 year old to watch this!  I give the movie 4 out of 10 because it's not a good horror, but it is still very scary! I don't know if it was a German film or made in England and I don\'t know if this is really a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think my review has ever been anything worthwhile for this movie. And I'm sorry for the fact that it was one of the last two things on the film's script, because it was so bad it could never have been turned into a great film. I mean it was a real letdown for all of the things I've read. I know. So bad. So, just don't watch this if you don't get what it has to offer. It was just stupid enough that the characters got into the character's heads like they were a little bit over-saturated. The funny thing about this film is that it is only about six minutes long. So it's only really fun when it's about three or four hours long. There wasn't a single good scene in this movie, but there were plenty of stupid, stupid, and stupid scenes. It has a terrible story that is about as boring as it comes out, and is mostly about a bunch of stupid things that get the audience up to their own feet. There isn't a whole lot of laughs or even a single funny scene in the movie, and there wasn't anything of any plot. But you gotta pay attention to the movie because I think there was a lot of good stuff in it, but you don''t need to spend hours watching it if you want to get the story out of its own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie is "The first time you saw this movie" - a movie about a guy named "Peev" who has never played in anything.  The movie starts with Peev trying to commit a murder, and PeeV turns out to be a very talented killer. Unfortunately, Peevy is very uncoordinated and a total loser.  But, despite the very bad, it's also very funny, with some interesting moments. Also, the movie has a really stupid and stupid gimmick. Basically, the gang are all there for one purpose, to kill Peevs, but apparently Peevv doesn't want to get away with his plan? Well, I don't think that Peevation is very well-played, but he does a really terrible job. The way he plays his father is laughable. The gang all do their best with Pees' motive, but this goes on for awhile, and gets boring.  It also has a couple of goofy moments (like how they are in the movie) that I wouldn't be embarrassed to give the movie 1 out because they weren't that good. They also seem to lack some of the originality to a true "The First time you see a movie" movie, though that is not enough for me to recommend this one over "The Fresh Meat" in the low score category.   8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a guy who reads most of what people have been saying about this movie on the Internet, and I have yet to listen to anything they say. I don't see any of the movies that people have given us. There are all kinds of movie they have said to me. It is not the kind of movie that people think. I'm in my own words. I watched it and it was a complete waste of time and money. The movie was so bad that I just didn't even want to see it again. I think that's enough for me to give this movie a bad name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, the movie was not to be taken seriously. It's really a bad remake of a classic Hollywood musical. It was also so bad that it had to be renamed 'The Original Movie' since it is in fact based on 'A Million Dollar Movie'.  I remember this one movie was very funny as it was a musical. Some scenes were amusingly done and some were terribly stupid. Some people didn't like the music. I guess this is the 'Athousand Dollar Movie' but not really. What a waste of time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   An attempt at making a horror movie turns into a bad film. I had the opportunity to rent the movie and try it. I didn't like it, as I was a horror fan and was an avid horror movie reviewer. The film starts with a story of a young man who has been turned into a serial killer and then gets killed by the first real serial killer he kills in the movie. The real serial Killer is named Jake, a former soldier, who goes by the name of a popular horror movie character from the 1980's, the director decides he should join the serial Killer (who was also an actor in a popular movie called "Cabinets"). Jake then gets put into a prison to die in the prison and then is hunted down by a serial Killer who is trying to take revenge on the prisoner and get killed by him. The serial Killer has two real victims, one of them is Jake's father, and the other is a girl. He kills the girl and Jake's body is torn up in an elevator in an unknown location, and when he is taken to a hospital, he is decapitated.  Then Jake and another kid named Ray and his friend Eddie, who were also supposed to be characters in the film, are sent to an unknown prison to try and get them re-constructed in a way to get them out of jail. After trying to re-incarcerate the real serial killers, the two guys are put into another prison and they try to make Jake, their main suspect, do something else. The new serial killer tries to get the real guy who has killed Jake's dad, Eddie, and Ray out of prison to get revenge. He is able to put an old man, known as "The Stryker", behind Jake and Ray and he kills him in a car park on the way to the car park where Jake and Eddie are being transported.  Jake and his buddy Eddie drive away from the car and meet the two serial killers and Eddie and Ray start shooting at them.  Eddie and the real killer and the two other guys kill them. Later, Jake and the serial killer's wife is released by a guy named Roy, who is an inmate who got himself killed in another prison for killing a man named Harry, who was also killed by Jake and he was sent to the jail to a new prison, called "The Jail". There's no plot here and it's just a bunch of uninspired, unoriginal horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I've read all the reviews online. This movie isn't even a film, it's a remake of the book "Bung" by the director who made the first one, so if you have read the book, please, don't watch it. There's no plot, no plot twist. This is another derivative of the "Bunk" book by Stephen King.  It's just a sad waste of money, and if I could find some good film on Amazon. Maybe I'll give it a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an absolute disgrace of a "Fantasy Zone" sequel. No idea what a fantasy is supposed to be. No ideas and no direction or direction this director thought they could ever have in a fantasy movie. When I sat watching this film, I felt like I was watching the "Big Blue Meanies", "King of the Jungle", "Wizard of the World", or "Ghostbusters" movie. The plot is pretty dull, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the dialog is bad. However, that's not all the bad. The acting and the directing are OK, the dialog and the special effects are OK but not good, and the effects are fine but not strong. This movie had a few funny moments, but the plot was pretty stupid and stupid and the action and special effects were not well done.  I thought the director was very good, but it was not too much. The director tried to make it look a little funny. It also had a lot of cute characters and interesting characters, but that's where the fun comes in.  The characters were very dull and did not go anywhere. The dialog was bad, and did the acting well, but there was nothing to see here.  Other good things about the "Wizards" movie: I actually liked some of the "Aliens" in the film, but overall I don't think they made much sense in the original film. They made some funny scenes. The casting was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so disappointing and disappointing that it makes me angry. I had so much fun in that one movie. I expected something better, but nothing else was that good. It had just a few decent acting (at least) and a few cute jokes.  But it just isn't even interesting at the end and the movie was simply awful. It was just so hard to see a woman that looked so badly and acted so poorly that I couldn't cry.  I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but unfortunately it is so bad that it doesn't entertain a single person. It is just so sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a lot of hype in this movie, but I think that is for people who are tired of watching films about a couple of teenagers. If they want to watch a "movie", then they should go elsewhere and have something better to watch. A couple of other reviewers have commented on how this movie is pretty shallow and doesn't have much to offer. They like it because it has good acting, but that's not good enough. That's about it. There is also nothing to see, and when the movie comes out, it doesn't quite look like a thriller. It has very little suspense, and there is nothing exciting to watch for most of the time. I found it hard to watch the end, and I was very unhappy. There are a couple cool scenes, but it just doesn't last long enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have come to see this film. It is not well crafted. The direction is terrible, and the cinematography is poor, just the way the acting is done is bad. In a funny way, it is interesting to see a film that is so bad it has people calling for "I'm really going to make it better.  I do not care for this film, but to give it any real respect is not the best way to spend your time watching. I think there is a chance to be a film in which the film makers are trying to make people feel sorry about themselves. This film is very bad, and I hope it is at least a success in the first 100 movies to be released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't even like the ending. But I like the first five, so don't miss this one.  "Bully" has been an absolute mess. It starts off promising enough that you're going to love it, but then you are told a whole lot of bad, and even worse, and that's because the story is terrible. That's how you're supposed to recognize something bad, even for a good movie.  The "Buffy" ending is also a huge issue. The plot was bad, but it didn't matter whether it was in the first 5 or in the second. The story was so bad that it made me a little embarrassed to be able to enjoy the ending; even so, if I knew that, I wouldn't have the feeling any of the same enjoyment I had.  Overall, it was just a big waste of time. It wasn't even funny. I don see it as a comedy, but for a film it was bad and not even funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a really terrible cast of actors. The actress I saw on TV earlier in this movie was really good and I liked her character. I was hoping to see her and see if she was any good or at all like the character in this film. When she was finally on screen I was very disappointed. I mean, her scenes were really terrible, and she looks like she is pregnant. The female lead in the movie was not too interesting, but her performance had nothing to do with the performance of the male leads. I don't know why anyone would be interested in her acting if she's acting to try to look like she looks good in movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Haha" is a pretty bad movie. But it did have some good moments. There were some cute scenes with Aiden Fox (the singer) and the kid who lives in a remote town. But not enough. But there were even worse scenes. The movie starts out pretty good with the dancing girl in the first scene. But after that, it just turns into some awful sex and violence. You really don't want to watch this movie unless you're a fan of Aiden, the singer or some other kind of music.  It also contains no good song and a lot of bad jokes. The music is terrible. The song and the song isn't too good, but just bad for the show. The dialog is pretty weak and I don't like it. It takes advantage of a really nice female singer to go in and tell a bad story about her life. Just don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this a low rating because it was funny. But this is not funny! It is a comedy film! It has absolutely no redeeming qualities! A lot of the dialog in this film is either awkward, too corny, or bad. The characters do not act in a normal manner. There is no redeemings! The music is not good either. It could be a sitcom. But the film is bad! The acting is poor and the humor is not even funny! I am sorry, but this movie fails to earn any distinction. But in fact it does the job. But it is not really funny, and not funny at all. It should have been a little better at least a little bit funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good scenes, but this movie had no good scenes and a dull ending. This movie was not really what I was expecting. I mean, how hard would you like to sit through a movie with some pretty girls? This movie is not good for the film industry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that it was supposed to be one of the great classic shows of all time, but I'm not one of those that believe that a kid's movie could ever be great. I've always read that it's the "great" TV show that is the most disappointing, depressing, and disappointing TV show in all time. I read the same thing for the rest of my life.  I did watch the "Shannown" when it was an awesome, great show. But when I watch this movie, it's a total piece of garbage, and the kid in the "Carnage" is just OK. He can't even speak.  What a disappointing movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a little over the line at the time. The story of this movie is about the old people who are having to survive an earthquake. And then some time later, these people are having children. The first one is about a man who leaves for a job, then there is another scene involving a couple who are on the brink of the cliff and get into the real earthquake (when you don't know what a cliff is and how long ago). After the first scene, the people who have to survive get thrown off. There is some interesting bits that keep the movie from being a horror film, like the one-legged guy and the cat. But it's just too many clichés, and the one obvious thing I think about is how they don't seem to be in this movie. They don't even have a normal life and they don"t appear to be afraid. This movie could have been a lot better if it was more dramatic and at least had some suspense. Otherwise, I'd give this movie a 1-2 out of 10, but it's not quite as good as those in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has one of my worst acting skills. In addition to the terrible acting, I found the acting of the characters to be very predictable. The characters didn't have any interest whatsoever. I do like the acting in the book, but that was much less believable and exciting. Also I don't think that any of the actresses could be any good actor either, but it is true, they didn't really show their best. I couldn't believe they were actually funny at all. I think the acting was mostly bad due to the fact that their acting seemed to be more realistic than the books.  I really hated this movie, but I just watched it as a way to get into the acting situation and I thought it is an incredibly bad movie. I donno how it could have been done. I found this movie a very awful movie. Its really not worth seeing but would be a good companion for a really bad movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a couple of good moments in the film; the most glaring was the movie starts off with a bunch of old jokes from a bunch (like "Who do you think was the person behind a pile of old-time jokes?"). The film starts on the subject of an ongoing war in Germany, where the German army is supposedly having a war in Chethville, but we also see that the Germans have a large army stationed in Chetworth and Chethva, which is where the main location of the movie is. There are some interesting points about this, like the German soldiers being treated like "Nazis" by the Americans. The rest of the film seems to have forgotten the premise, like why the British have been sending American soldiers to fight the Germans in CheThville (who are also apparently fighting the Germans). Some of the jokes that get past the point are actually funny, but those are not even the jokes in the movie. The German soldiers are not actually being soldiers, but rather soldiers, and they are not soldiers because they are doing the same job. They're soldiers because their superiors have the same name as theirs. The film tries to make people believe that the British soldiers and the German generals are different, which I think would be no surprise if that they were soldiers and not soldiers and that they got into the war on the same basis, or at least one was sent in the war because it had happened previously. In any case, it would be nice to see some good jokes from Chethburg, but this movie does not give any of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning I had seen this movie as a horror-horror film, the action was not a scary, and the characters were simply too plain-looking, too plain, but the violence did not go to the level I expected from this movie. The story is about a middle-aged man (the main characters) who has some sort of a "scramble", as he keeps his girlfriend (the girlfriend is actually an evil serial killer) from destroying the world and killing everyone around him.  However, at some point when he starts talking to the girl, he can't hear her screams, the girl is an intelligent woman, and he is able to hear her talking and see that she has come on to him. When he sees the blood coming out from her mouth, he thinks it's her, and thus decides that he needs to go through an excruciating process of love to be able to keep the girl alive. So, to the surprise of the viewer, he kills everyone. The girl dies in his arms, and ultimately he gets a big shock when he kills her.  The story doesn't work particularly well, although I think the direction is OK at times, the dialogue is a bit weak, and there are some really good action scenes, but it has problems too, especially for the characters. The way the female's body is shown, her skin, her hair, and her neck's shape is pretty disturbing, although the way she uses her neck to lift her hair up seems to be okay, since there are no indications of her being a woman with a neck down, like an overgrown kid. The body hair is pretty good, and she has long hair and a nice skin, and has a few wrinkles in her hair. I do feel that the "blood" is just blood that is supposed to be her blood, and I understand the lack of an explanation for why it's happening.  But even with these problems, the overall story remains a bad thriller, and nothing at all seems convincing to me. The whole movie ends up at the end, and so no one thinks to have more of it.  There is no clear ending, but all I can hope is that the movie has been released. The acting seems too short, the female lead seems to care for her boyfriend, and some of the scenes in the first 10 minutes of the movie seems to have some good ideas, though most of the actors do not manage to finish the movie properly, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like a movie with a plot that's so bad as it doesn't make sense. Also, I don\'t like movies with a lot of action or action, with that sort of action and action that makes it hard to watch.  This movie lacks that feeling of mystery, which has been the main strength of movies like "Crimineston," "The Untouching God," and "The Vanishing Face of the Moon." Also, this movie never takes a clear direction from beginning to end and gives no real clues about how it ends. This movie tries to take a simple story and a simple action ending and try to tie them together with a bunch of different locations and themes. As I said, the idea is to create a story, but by a point of view, it's impossible to see it all. It doesn't follow what the movie says and it doesn\'t follow its own progression. And that's not even true, as the movie tries on making it seem as though it was all a continuation of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a sequel of the original game, which I think the first film was. The first movie is pretty good. That's what it was, when it was a sequel. The game was good, too, if only we knew how to get the new game, so that would be good. The sequel takes place in the same setting, minus all the silly things that were in the first movie. This movie fails to make me care for the sequel. And it really bothers me, because I don't feel like a kid. It also fails to give me any feeling like I am a kid anymore.
