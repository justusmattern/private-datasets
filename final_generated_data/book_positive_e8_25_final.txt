Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the book.   This book is not really about the politics of the time, though its a bit about it.  But the book is really a brilliant example of what the left ought to be doing.  From the perspective of the American right it is a very interesting insight on what is wrong with the modern conservative movement in the age of the Reagan/Bush era.  I don't think I've ever understood so many things about conservatism.  The most remarkable aspect of this book, for me at least, is the use of history as a way to explain the ideology.  In particular, the way that history is used to support the idea of the primacy of the nation over the individual.  This is a view that is very popular in conservative circles and that you'll often see being touted by libertarian scholars.  For the most part it is not a view shared by American conservatives in the 1960s or by those of the right in more recent times.  The primacy argument is a little bit like the "big society" argument, i.e. "we're all in this together."  In fact, one could say that "we've done so well as a nation because we don't let our emotions get in the way of the facts."  The book is chock full of this sort of thinking and a lot of it is very interesting and insightful.  There's an interesting piece where a couple of young conservative journalists are talking about why they aren't interested in writing about politics.  They say "we'd get paid better writing about other things."  And they then ask, "why is it that we can't write about how government is affecting our lives as citizens?"   The answer they come up with is the need to understand how society works so that we are aware of and can counter the various influences on our lives.  And then a couple pages later the interviewer gets the same question, but in fact they don't seem to want to write about politics because it has nothing to do with their jobs.  (It's not really possible to get around the fact that people do want to know about politics, but that doesn't mean that they really do want their jobs to go on reporting on those topics!)  This has been a pretty good year for conservative books on history, as well.  Last summer I was lucky enough to see a really wonderful talk on John Stuart Mill's On Liberty by Adam Lee, who seems
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to read this book for a while, but was too busy or in school to read the entire thing. Now that I have, I am glad I did. The story is just as interesting and engaging as the novel's synopsis suggested. If you're looking for an interesting novel with strong characters and well-told story, this is the book for you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is an excellent read about a couple of characters, and the author was extremely engaging and funny in her writing. I loved the book and the characters. It is very well written and I would recommend it highly. Rating: 4 out of 5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book and so did my husband. My husband is an avid reader and enjoys reading both non-fiction and fiction. The writing in this book is very well done, and the information provided is great. I have always been interested in history, and while I do not have the background or knowledge to make a good comparison for myself, I found a lot of the material well written and worth the time. There were a few things that were a little off but other than that the book is an excellent read! I especially appreciated the fact that this book included a summary of the history behind the subject matter so that the reader is able to find the sources quickly. This book did not just teach me history, it taught me about how we, as humans, think. I will be returning to this book as often as possible.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most helpful and enlightening book on spiritual practice I have read. I am a non-religious person but this book changed my perception on the subject and I'm now a believer in God and spirituality. It also has an interesting and enlightenning discussion about the role of the imagination in one's spiritual development. Highly recommend.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I did not expect to like this book but it was a nice change from the usual series. The book does not seem to go out of its way to be a classic or a work of a classic. It is just a solid book about a great man and his struggles. I found the story interesting and the descriptions about the battles and their results were really neat. The author's writing is good and not over the top. I enjoyed this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    -   "Gorgeous!"   This is the kind of book that I would never turn down!   I am currently working on a large, detailed, scientific, theoretical, mathematical model of the human genome.   So many words!  The book is easy to read, easy to understand, and so very, very interesting.  I recommend it to any serious scientist, as well as anyone who enjoys good science fiction.  Recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read this book twice. I loved the first time, it gave me an insight into a new religion and a new lifestyle. I will definitely read more about this and see what I can find out.
Write a positive review about a good book:   Hi, I read the book a few weeks ago and was so impressed. Great book, and it has a very good feel to it. It was a good read because I was really getting to know the characters. The action and the story kept me interested and gave me a good feel for the characters and what is going on. I will definitely recommend this book to others.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really well written book which does an excellent job of explaining the basic concepts of both the C++11 standard and the C programming language. It is an excellent introductory level text.   I have enjoyed reading this book since I started learning C++ and I will certainly use it when I get the chance to write a more in depth book on my own.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book is a good story that's not really about a person or about a place or about the way a place really works. It's a good tale of an encounter and of a place, a thing, a person, and a time, but not really one that explores a particular subject. It tells the whole story through the eyes of a character and of that character's actions, not through the personal memories of the people in it.   The main character is a man named Sam who gets a call at home from a man who lives in a house. Sam doesn't have time to get there before the man answers and says that there's a big storm coming, but he's not going out. Sam heads out, but is caught in the rain and is trapped in his car in a parking lot. He has nowhere to go and his car is stuck in the mud, so he decides to get some help. He's stuck in his truck, but there is a guy with a car who says he can get him out if he has to.  In the end, Sam gets out and finds the man who called him to ask him to help. The story is about a man's decision to help someone in distress. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed the book. It was a great and interesting read about how our society deals with the human mind when faced with new facts. I hope this is the start of a new series, because I would really love to get to know more about how this society has developed. The only thing I'd suggest is to include some more people with different perspectives, which would make the book more complete. I am happy with the book and I recommend it to anyone who's interested in a good read about this subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I'm always trying new reading materials and this one definitely impressed me.   It helped me with a lot of questions I have about the Bible.  This isn't something I would read every day, but would be a good choice if I wanted to get more into the Bible!

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must have for any serious fan of the original Harry Potter book series.   The stories are amazing and really give you the feel of what you think is what would happen.  It is all explained so well, but you also get the real feeling that you are in the story and have a bit of a life in Hogwarts.  This is definitely a book that everyone should read to refresh their knowledge on what all the fuss is about.
Write a positive review about a good book:   One of my favorite books in recent years and one I've not read yet.   I was surprised when I was sent a free copy from the author.  In a few pages I found myself absorbed in the story of a father and son.  The prose is wonderful and the story is captivating, I'll definitely be reading more from this author in the future!

Write a positive review about a good book:   There are some that make my skin crawl, and there are some  that make my heart ache.    Here are a few that make me feel  .   I have always thought about writing about   the horror   that is " The Amityville Horror," which came out in the 1970's.  I have read a few books from that era (not the original, of course), but this one has stuck with me for   reasons that I think are good.  What struck me about the book was the way it made you feel that you knew this family, the way they  talked   with each other, how they were all   worried about what their daughter's boyfriend   would   say.  A  family  on the verge of total destruction ... but they never gave in.  In other words, I always thought that the way the book   had you feel, as the people at the end are telling themselves they are doomed, the horror was what the people that lived there felt, the   despair, the anxiety, . The book had the perfect mix of suspense, horror, and sadness.  And that mix was great. I am glad I read this, especially for those who can't read with their own eyes (I have a bad eye, so I have to look at a mirror). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this on Audible and loved it. I had no idea what to expect, but it is definitely one of the better books I've read in years. The characters are well-written, the plot is fun, and the writing style is unique.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The author has done a good job of describing how a man's personality becomes more rigid and controlled after being married to a woman, while still retaining some of the emotional warmth he used to show in his youth. The author is clearly a good writer as well as a knowledgeable researcher of the subject matter. He gives a good description of how a "recovering woman" may feel about her husband.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book! I read it last night and it left me wanting more! I can imagine going back to the library again.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read the novel "The Burden of Good" by Mark S. Van Name. I really enjoyed it. The main characters are very interesting and you want to know what happens to them. I liked the character's reactions and the book's ending. It was also interesting to read about how the character of the main character were raised in a society in which religion and morality were so powerful and so important. This society's religion was very much about the right to be happy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As long as I can get hold of it I will still be able to read it. It has the feel of being on the ground floor of a big epic, which is what I wanted from it in the first place. My only complaint is the author's tendency to put a huge spanner in the works just as the book is getting good. A few plot threads are left dangling until the end of the book, and I was left wanting more... and in an unsatisfying way. That's a small gripe when the books is such a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would say this book is a bit better than what i read in the first book. This is the 2nd book. I liked the first one because the characters were all so likable and real. Now i think i know why it didn't end well. It made me very sad because it was a nice read and i liked the main character. i thought the new plot line in this book was awesome. It makes this book seem more interesting to me and not just a retelling of the events from the first part. And the characters are still real. they are just a bit more likable now. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance in the same kind as I do, but it doesn't have the same depth to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently finished this book, and it was the best thing that has happened to me in a while. It takes some time to get used to the tone and the pacing, but once you're there, the writing is amazing. This is the best novel I've read this year (which is a real achievement) and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good read, with a good plot and well-written character development. The characters develop a good, though slow, rapport with one another. The setting is good and the author is good at writing about different cultures and countries.   This is a nice read that I am excited to read more of because of its interesting characters and the plot. It's not overly complex or lengthy and I'm happy with this review. It is a little dated in some parts, but I've read other good books about the civil war and World War II that are more recent.  For those who want a well written novel that will keep you reading for hours, this is a great book. This is more the sort of thing that I would like to see more of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     If this book was not so short, I would have loved to have seen it. The book is great, the art is beautiful, and the book is quick. I love the new book format that the publisher uses. I am a fan of the books and the artists, and so I am looking forward to seeing what the next book in the series will be.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book when I found a used copy at a thrift store and immediately decided to check out the audio book. I was really surprised to see that the narrator was female. She did a really nice job of reading the book and gave a nice sense of the characters. I liked the mystery aspect.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this book was good, though I did not like the ending (it was a bit too predictable, and I'm not sure if the protagonist actually did save him.)   In any case, the story, the world building, and the characters were good. The plot was good for its length and complexity (which was what interested me most about the book), and the main characters were interesting. (Though, as I mentioned, the end was a little unrealistic.)       There were no problems that affected my enjoyment of the book (except, perhaps, for the ending).   However, I must say that the narrator sounded a bit flat. I couldn't quite place her accent or the way she pronounced words.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for a Christmas present to myself and I absolutely loved it!  It's funny, and full of good jokes, and the plot and characters were all well written.  I'm not a huge fan of the Star Wars universe, but this book did a great job of making it a believable world and story to live in.  As a Star Wars fan, I also really liked the ending, which was kind of touching.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and am thoroughly enjoying the journey through this series. I was really impressed by the way the author brought together her various influences (including several from fantasy) and made them all fit together in a coherent and interesting way. The stories were all interesting to read and the world building (including a very deep world with many secrets and twists, that I couldn't wait to learn about), the character development, the action, the world-building, the mystery, the tension, the suspense and the suspenseful endings was outstanding. The book also features some brilliant world-class artwork and some nice prose in the end. It was a wonderful and fun read, but I would love to have been able to finish it all in one sitting (especially with the series I'm reading at the moment).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is one of my favorites.   My only complaint with it is that the ending is really unsatisfying.  I enjoyed the story, and I thought it was pretty cool how it all ended.  Unfortunately, I really don't think the ending will make people interested in reading the next book in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the better science fiction novels I've read.   The story follows a time-traveling time agent whose main problem is finding his way back to the 19th century.  The writing is decent, but there were a few things that just didn't gel together (such as how the narrator (and the reader) learns about the past by visiting it).   Also, the story is a little short on twists/turning points (there are a lot of flashbacks). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    -   Good reads:  "a very useful book, especially for the serious student or amateur."

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is excellent. It is a must read for everyone. My wife and I started with this book at the same time. We both love science fiction and science. This book contains great examples. Our children started reading the book together and were talking about the alien and other alien races that they saw. The book contains a lot of stories of these alien races. The author has a good feel for the time period and has written a book that will not only entertain the reader but also be of interest. A must read book to a science fiction or science fiction fan.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is not easy to write a positive book review about an old book that is no longer new.  It was the only book I have read that I can say is "worth reading."  The book is very entertaining.  This book has been recommended to me by a friend.  The pictures are very clear.  I like the style of the book.  One of my favorite parts was the "The Riddle of the Sphinx."

Write a positive review about a good book:    A very satisfying read.   In my mind I get the feeling that there were a lot of things which were left out which made this book more interesting than I expected.  If it had some kind of closure the way there is in a book like A Thousand Splendid Suns I would have enjoyed it even more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     "This book is fascinating from a sociological point of view and shows us a world of great diversity with many interesting stories. I don't know enough about the history of the African-American and Native American tribes to have an opinion about their specific situations but they seem to be well-dispersed, and there are so many people who want to help them. In all, a very interesting book, worth looking into."  Synopsis:  For thousands of years, the Chiricahua Apache people occupied a small mountain valley in southwest New Mexico. They were an important part of the Mesoamerican pre-Columbian civilization, which spread over many regions of Central and South America. The Chirics were the only known American Indians who possessed the skills and knowledge of writing, which enabled them to become accomplished farmers, artisans and medicinemen. Although the Chiru were never able to create the same type of great civilizations that the Maya or Aztecs had, they nevertheless developed advanced cultural traditions and institutions.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorite non-fiction books.   It was fun to learn about a little known, but really important, aspect of our society.  A lot of what people think of as "conspiracy" is really just the result of the fact that our government has gone over the top with the amount of control they have over us.  I do not think the book is perfect by any means.  For example, the information is not "smoking gun proof".  One of the people who was arrested in the case was a man who was the one who tried to sell the pictures.  There were some issues with the investigation and the "evidence".  But, what I found fascinating was the interviews with the people in the photographs.  The book had a few errors, but I am glad that it tried to cover a wide topic without just repeating the same thing over and over.  It does go into some very esoteric topics that I don't understand, but it made me interested and want to find out more about them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "As a woman, as an American and as a human being, this book is a must read. I am so thrilled that a book that has not only touched my heart but my mind is being made by a woman. I just can't believe that she's still getting these books published." -Tara K. "This is a strong, well-crafted book about life, love and family. There's an awful lot of heart to this book and the author does a great job of connecting the themes of the book to our modern day society." -Rachel B. "I can't remember the last time I read a book about such a wide variety of subjects and not felt myself to be drawn in. The author is very well written and her writing is powerful and moving. This book is not only beautifully written but is an extremely moving read." -Arielle B. I'm a sucker for books about love and loyalty, so I enjoyed this book! I especially enjoyed the fact that the author also talks about the need to let go of attachments, the importance of giving and giving of yourself, and the need for acceptance. It was great that she brought a few of her family's experiences into the story and made the book relatable to my own life. I've noticed that there have been a few books about women in the military that make the male perspective seem extremely shallow and I would love to read a male perspective in a book like this one, but so far it's not on my list.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought the print book, but didn't read it. I liked the idea of it, but the plot was boring and the ending a bit too silly.    I liked that it was a very good book in its own right, but there were some points where the author got too caught up in the fantasy world and couldn't keep it in line. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gave me a lot of perspective. I'm just now realizing how far I've drifted away from the values and ideals of my family and church, because, like many people of my generation, I found myself too easily swayed by the music and the images and the way we were being portrayed. I was raised to believe that "Jesus loves everyone" and "good people go to heaven," and, like a lot, I've been brainwashed into believing that this is true. This book was an eye-opener for me, and it's very important to be honest with yourself and others about who you are and what you believe, so you can have a better life. I wish that I could go back in time and explain to my parents how they were being used and abused to promote their own personal agendas, but, unfortunately, they died before I was able to learn that.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in one sitting.   The story is wonderful. I was never interested in this genre of literature before I read, so it was good to see another fantasy author doing it well.  The worldbuilding is just fantastic, with just enough details to keep me interested, but not so much that I'm bored with it. The writing style is perfect. I think the main strength of this book, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have to be a hard read. I really enjoyed that the story was fun, and that there was enough fantasy that it was entertaining.  Overall, a solid book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this on a Saturday and I'm glad I did! It was a great read! The best part about this book is that there's a happy ending. A lot of people don't like to read about a sad story, but that's what I wanted to read.    Read all the reviews: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1470... The first time I read about this I wasn't sure if it was just too dark. But then I realized that this isn't your typical YA book, and I liked it more than the other books I read for my teens. It had the feel of a fantasy story but the characters were real and real was a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have not read The Martian by Andy Weir, but I was intrigued by his blog post about how he wanted to explore the concept of a "Martian city" on Mars:  In the course of writing the book I realized that Andy Weir has some real passion about this. As he explained in his blog, he wanted his book to be a real first person account of a Martian city on Mars. And, in fact, when he found the Mars rover that he had pitched for the book, he went searching for a space program. He thought it would be interesting to see the process by which a space agency might create something like a city on the surface of Mars. (Or, in the case of the book Mars One, colonize the planet and bring humans there. Or something.) What he found was that the Mars program is really complicated. While Mars One is looking for a way to do this, many other groups are trying to figure out how to make Mars into a civilization. And in any case, what I find fascinating about the Mars colony is that Weir thinks the program will be successful (or at least that the process is likely to be, given the technology they have). So the idea of a city is compelling. I hope Andy Weir goes back and reads this book. It's a good novel, and I hope he will give it another look in the future (it has been published in hardcover, so if you get it in ebook form, you can have the hardcover and e-book versions as separate books!).
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I bought this book. I love fantasy. My wife (a non-fan) loves this kind of thing. And her favorite author is Martin, so we have a good thing going. The book is short and to-the-point and it's well-written. The first 3/4 of it I was pretty impressed (although there are no real surprises at the end. Then I realized that this is a novel about the early years of George R.R. Martin's career, so I have no idea how well-prepared this would be for a novel-length story about a young R'hllor. But that's ok, the story is good. I would read more of his other works if I was able to read this at my leisure.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It's written very well and has a good plot, and the narrator does a good job of capturing the essence of her character's point of view. I thought the writing was a bit stilted though and some things just seemed a bit off (e.g. why do we need a narrator if it's so easy to read the book? ).   It's one of those books that has a great concept but doesn't really nail it.     
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book I ever read that made me want to read more by the author.  This is a story about a man named Ben who is at the mercy of a woman named Sara (who is a friend of his wife's) and their two children.  He was a man who had to deal with the same problems as the rest of us, and somehow had it more difficult.  Sara takes Ben to see her new friend Ben, but Ben finds that Ben's life is not what he expected.  While I liked the story, I think the book could be longer.  I feel that the book ended a bit early.  It was a good, interesting read, however.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very enjoyable book about growing up, the challenges of a school setting, and the joys of a parent/student relationship.   One of the best characters is the main character, Lila, a young woman who works at a bookstore.  For my money, she is the perfect heroine.  She is witty, witty and sarcastic.  I thought her book was so much fun.  As a mother, I have found the book so informative, and I can't wait to try it out as a lesson for my daughter.  A little girl who is 7 will be able to pick up on these concepts and the stories of many other girls. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book with a very original and humorous plot.   This book was fun to read and I think I am going to read the next one.

I would recommend this book to a new or intermediate reader.
Write a positive review about a good book:        In this world there are two major categories of books:  The books I read that really blew my mind and the books I love. I read the first book in this series and was completely blown away.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It had a good flow to it, so i gave it a thumbs up. The writing was really good. The plot was interesting.   I also really enjoyed the cover art which I will have to look up later.  There were some things in the book that left me scratching my head... like the character with a broken leg.  He had to walk with a crutch, so that's interesting. But I'm not sure how his broken leg caused his leg to get broken in the first place... and the fact that he went from the top of a skyscraper to the bottom of a lower one before he could see any way down was somewhat confusing to me... so maybe they could've done a better job of explaining this.  Another thing that confused me is why they made him put up with the other guy for so long? He was a friend and he just dumped him a year or so later, and they never even talked.  It made the characters seem a bit like they were too dumb to realize that they were in a relationship. It would've been better if he just told her immediately after they broke up, or if he at least said something like 'okay, I can't do this anymore' after she dumped him.  I'm also not sure why they put the title as 'The Biggest Little Mistake'  But it's a good story so I guess I'll overlook the minor errors. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is good! I can see why it was considered by so many to be a bestseller. It is a good overview and explanation of the history and how to use it as a basis for your game. It will give you an idea of the type of game your character might play, what kind of abilities he or she might possess, and also an idea on the kind of equipment you should have in order to use the equipment in your game as it would be used by the characters in the world.   I will probably buy this book when it is released again next year. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've read on the subject and I'm looking forward to future books by Ms. Wurts.  Review: This was a really nice book on the basics of teaching about gender fluidity. This is the kind of book I would recommend to any new or potential teachers looking to begin a conversation about gender identity. It gives an excellent overview of the history of gender, its development and how we define gender. I liked that the author gives some context on why gender does not follow binary norms, for example because some cultures view a male to have a beard, another because the female body is not always viewed as a suitable receptacle for reproduction. The author is definitely a first-time author, but her grasp of the gender theory is clear and informative. She also mentions how gender is influenced by culture in various ways, and how this influences how we view ourselves. Overall, I found this a really well written and well put together book. It's not just a text book but a resource to have in the classroom. (Posted on 9/11/15)  Gender Fluidity: A Guide to the Teaching of Gender - By Sarah Wurth! Review by John E. (Reno, NV). A very well written resource! (Posted On 6/23/17) . A very good introduction to Gender Fluidity and Gender Non-Conformity for K-12 Schools/Programs! The author of this book is a PhD candidate in Social Work and has many years of experience in the field. This book has a lot of good advice and ideas about gender, including how to best support a gender-fluid student's learning. It really does make you want to be more gender fluid (or at least gender neutral!) as well as to encourage gender non-conformity by introducing gender-inclusive language into your everyday life and vocabulary. This does not mean that gender is "wrong" or that you must live a gender "alternate lifestyle". This book also has excellent tips about how to make your classroom a welcoming space and that you do not have to "take the side" if a student's gender preference is not in alignment with their "traditional" gender (ie. they prefer to wear dresses rather than pants, prefer to sing as a boy rather than girl, etc). The author also gives good ideas about the importance of classroom discussions about Gender and Sexuality issues including the "gender binary" and the importance in understanding
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is one of the most comprehensive and thoughtful treatments I've come across of how to apply the philosophy of "the one and only true religion." It provides a wonderful foundation to understand why the true religion will never have a legitimate claim on the public square and why the religious left is in denial about it. The author is also very open-minded about other faiths and their potential to replace Christianity as a viable alternative to a secular society.   This book is a must-read for the faithful.   In short, what follows will not shock you or challenge your belief system. It will, however, challenge you to rethink some aspects of your belief and make you a better person, a better atheist and a better human being. This is the only book you'll ever need to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many reviews about the book and have had some of the best times reading a book. I do have a couple of gripes, mainly a few minor issues of grammar and a couple typos. As you can tell from the title of the book, these things aren't a big deal but I still would prefer to buy the original published version than the re-issued reprint. However, overall the book is a fun read. If you love reading fantasy novels then this is a must. If not, it may be time to look for something else.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It really is a good read and I really enjoy it.   I was so excited to see that the cover art for this book is amazing.  And they even included a little bit about the character's past in the back.  The book contains a great deal of history and history is often difficult to follow but this is a very easy to follow story.  There is not a lot of info here but this book contains many details about the First Men.  They have a great culture which has been influenced by other races and is very much like the Old Earth in the real world.  I really liked this story and it is a must read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book in the Redwall series, This House of Mists is about a house, and its children. It's a bit slow-paced, which I expected from a series like Redwall, but it's also a fun, entertaining read with some interesting themes that are pretty well-done. I'm very much in love with the Red Wall and how the whole thing is constructed, especially the use of the mists as a map to guide the children along. I think the concept of the Wall has been done before, but here it's done very well. The second and third books are really well done too.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read three books by the same author and enjoyed the stories. This book is very similar and I have enjoyed it. The plot is interesting and the setting is cool. There were a couple of things that stood out to me. The characters are interesting and well thought out. The romance is good and they did a good job making a connection and developing their characters. If you like vampires and ghosts I recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has many good ideas for how to make a better world and what it would take to make that a reality. But, unfortunately, the author uses it all to write about how much he hates women. Not a good idea. He spends more time complaining about the way women treat men and how women are just jealous and controlling. This book is about how to solve the problems of both men and women. I think that's a good plan.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    - Posted by: Paul G at 9:14 PM ( 1 year, 8 months ago ) Hi John, I'm a big fan of your blog. I just purchased The Book Thief on amazon and I think I'll check out the sequel, The Book of Thine Own. You guys are amazing.   ( 1 person found this helpful ) I think that your comments in a recent post about this series of novels were spot on. As a child, these books inspired me to read. Even now, when I think of my love of the series and the characters, I still feel a warm fuzzy feeling of nostalgia and wonder, which is just fine by me.  http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/20h1j3/books_of_thine_own_the_book_of/cqbw6l6 I love the fantasy genre in all its forms, but it is particularly compelling when authors take some time to introduce a young reader to the fantasy tropes that are familiar to them (and to the audience). In this series, this young reader is a half-elf and a former assassin, now wandering the land. But she has the uncanny ability to speak with animals, something her people, the hobbit people, didn't even know how to do before her.  Posted A review of a book that you have not read: In the world of magic, there are some rules that are absolute, some that are relative. These are known as "canon" rules and the most important of these are "canons", the rules that define the role of magic in a fantasy setting. There are also a number of "adventuress rules" that govern the relationships between magic and the people of the land: Canons on Magic: These are the rules on what a spell does. Canons can be broken, but are generally followed to preserve the world from being turned into something not of its nature. Canon on Canines: Canines are magic, even when they're not technically human. This rule helps keep the people who use magic from becoming slaves. Canonicum of Magic: This is the most powerful spell in the world, a spell that allows any creature to cast any other spell. (This is also what's known as the "most powerful spell of the world.") Canonicums have many uses (most of them for evil purposes) and they are almost never
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good series with a great author.   I had some trouble putting it down when I started reading it and I'm glad I didn't!   The stories are told in a very real, human voice, which was a big surprise. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book, expecting to like it, but didn't. I wanted to like the book but instead I just got bored. I've never read much science fiction. This is not one of the best books I've read so far. The writing is good. The world is interesting, but not that interesting. The characters are pretty weak. I don't think this book will get a lot of positive reviews. If you liked the first book then you will probably like this one, but I won't be buying it and will be sticking with the first one. I think the only reason I have given this a three star rating is because the book is very well written. It's not a very good book, but it's a good read.

The plot will appeal to fans of books like "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" and "The Adventures of Augie March". The author does a great job of creating tension. My favorite part was the ending because it was unexpected, and it also tied up a lot of loose ends.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife and I picked up this book for a few reasons.   First off, we've never had the opportunity to read a book quite like this one.  In a way, the idea of having your own family with you at all times is the most fantastic idea in this entire world.  My second reason for picking this up, is that we're looking for a new read for my son (who's 9 now).   Thirdly,   We're both huge readers, and had found the book we wanted to be too difficult to read.  After reading this book,  it really surprised us how easy it is.  We now have some new reading to do, and it's been really fun.  I'm happy to recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book I am reviewing is The Rise of the Political Right in the United States.   By the way, I am not a scientist or political scientist and this book is not the first to analyze the decline of the American Left.  This book is an attempt to explain the causes of the decline.  The most important reason is a growing sense of personal entitlement on the part of Americans that has created a political and cultural environment of self-reliance that is unhealthy and destructive.  An increasing group of Americans have come to feel as though their basic needs are unmet.  These are the Americans who have gone from being "poor but happy" to being "rich but depressed."  These Americans are so dissatisfied with their condition that they feel they must "go it alone" and do their own thing.  If this sounds familiar, it should, because it is exactly what we were hearing at the beginning of the book.   When you listen to them, their views are just as selfish and narrow as those in the earlier chapters.   In fact, the author is so full of himself that it is surprising he thinks the rest of the nation is more than a little out of touch.  They seem to think that they have "nothing to lose" and that they are "entitled to everything they want."  The first chapter is a long discussion of the political polarization of the country.  It then goes on to look at the rise of the Moral Majority in 1980 and the demise of the New Deal.  In 1980, voters went to the polls in unprecedented numbers to support the Moral Party and elect Ronald Reagan as President.  Many of those votes were for conservative Republicans who opposed the government in virtually every aspect.  Reagan's election has been blamed for the "demise of the center" but I think that is a misnomer.  One of the more interesting chapters examines the rise and fall of the "Republican Establishment."  In the first chapter, the book discusses the political decline of both the Democratic and Republican parties but focuses on the decline that is best described as the conservative backlash.  From this chapter, we see a generalization of the conservative movement.  Right wingers have always had a problem with a perceived liberal elite.  To this day, even when they are in power, conservative leaders struggle to maintain the illusion that they represent a group of ordinary people.  Even before the Reagan landslide in 1980, conservatives were already complaining about the influence of
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book in an old used book store when I was looking for an historical source book about the Chinese military. The only problem with the book is that it is only about the 2nd Sino-Japanese war (1894-95). The authors did not write about the war in Korea (1950-53) nor about the Boxer Rebellion (1900-04). If you are interested in Chinese military history, I would recommend this book, but this is just the 2d edition and it is too bad the authors only wrote about the 1st war.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I would have given this book 4 stars for the style, but 4 stars is all I can really give it because there is some really terrible writing here. I mean, who actually writes about a person with a disability in a way that's not just a few cliches? Even in fiction, people with disabilities are frequently depicted as dumb and/or incompetent, or simply uninteresting. It really makes me sad that there is this pervasive attitude towards people with a physical disability. Even when there's a disability, I expect the protagonist to be intelligent, capable, and interesting.      The writing is a little clumsy, like the characters' writing is, and some of it is just downright stupid. I wouldn't even say there's any bad writing in this book, because it's really just bad writing.   (hide spoiler)] [I'd give this book a 3.5/5, but I can't give it that because the writing was so bad and it also got really bad in the second half. I'm not sure if it's because of a slow start or just how bad I was feeling about the first half, but it felt like the book's tone was really dark at the end. Also, there was this whole thing with a disabled kid that was the worst thing ever, and even though I read the book in one sitting, I only remember bits and pieces, and I don't really remember much of what the thing was that made the kid so upset. Also there was a whole other thing with this kid that I didn't really understand, and he sort of seemed like a stereotypical nerd to me, even though he didn't seem to be too smart or anything.So, anyway, I can probably give this a 3/5. It was a little disappointing, but the second part was the only thing that bothered me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character, who at first appears to be a stereotypical psychopath, starts with the knowledge that he is "just" a criminal, but is transformed by the introduction of a charismatic, mysterious female, who turns him into the person he is capable of becoming. The book contains a lot of details about the life of its main character and the reasons for the crime, but the story does not dwell on it. It is a good story, but it is more about the personality of the character, and why he is the way he is. The author, whose previous works were the stories of a very smart criminal, a psychopath, a good father, etc., does not use the information he has been given to create a detailed psychological character study.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It had a lot of ideas about a lot on the subject of being vegan, and also included some important, useful info about the food industry, which I personally need to understand. I've already read a lot about being vegan; this book is a great way to get more familiar with what the issue is all about, and to figure out where to spend my time and money. The only down side to this book I could see is that the vegan chapters were the last two or three pages and it was a bit boring to read a review about the chapter before I bought the book. However, I do plan on reading the others in the series, just to learn more about the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fascinating study about what people will and will not do in a crisis, not to mention an entertaining read, with important lessons for anyone living or thinking in this world.   I've always thought of being a "good Samaritan" as a way to get help when you need it, or a way for an unkind stranger to be helpful. This book teaches me that not only is it a very effective method, but that many people have been trained in how to do it. This was my first book about emergency services training and I was really surprised at how well the author demonstrated how to act in a chaotic situation to be able to get someone who needs help. The author explains that this training is done in many departments throughout the country, in a wide variety of settings, from airports and police stations to fire stations and emergency medical facilities. She goes into great detail on the training process as well as the specific techniques she has learned to help her perform emergency medical procedures that involve moving a patient out of harms way, such as in an accident or if the victim is in a critical condition. There's a lot of great information here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    - A well-written work of historical fiction about a young, idealistic English man and his exploits as a diplomat. There's not much that's new to be said of John Bull, but as a historian and a diplomat, he does a fine job. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of a French school.   -- He is a diplomat...and a man of action. This is a book about a person with a talent for international diplomacy. And he's a very complex character. The author did a wonderful job at detailing the early and late life of the character. I love that this book is being published in paperback. It will be interesting to see if other authors follow his example with books set in England in the early 17th century.  -- The book covers the period from 1610-1618. There is a lot about diplomacy and the rise of a diplomat that can be learned from it. It's worth the read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am just going to go ahead and say that I loved this book. I am going to have to read the book again in order to really give it all that I have come to know and love about the book, but I just wanted to give a quick review of the plot and some of the characters.     First of all, the plot of this book is a lot like the one in a couple of old science fiction novels I read in college. However, unlike those old novels, this one was a bit different than what I expected. The premise of this story was not a story about a group of people being attacked by some extraterrestrial creatures or anything like that. The aliens are not a big threat. They are just the bad guys in this story. Instead, what I got from this story is the story of a group that has been able to overcome their differences and work together against a common enemy. They were able to get a planet to the point of having a stable civilization, despite the fact that they have the most powerful weapon in the universe: The Space Gun.  I am not too familiar with space. It is just so big, so huge and so vast. It seems like you could build a city on the moon and I would still be unsure as to what you are talking about. Well, as far as space goes, I am not completely uneducated in this regard. The Space Guns are so massive and powerful that the entire planet is wiped out by them if they are not contained by a giant space station (which the book does not explain why the Space Gun is able to do this, but it does. They use a giant nuclear explosion to destroy a planet). Also, I think the book really should have explained the Spacegun's capabilities better (especially for someone who only knows of the atomic bomb, etc). I would have loved it if they had just used the atomic bombs or something a lot more devastating.   The book is told from the perspective of a woman who is the commander of a space station and the wife of the man in charge of the station. She is in charge so that she can keep the peace between the people. However she also is the leader of a violent criminal organization that is killing everyone who stands in their way. At the end of the book she is captured by the main bad guy. She manages to escape and escapes to the next system and there she goes into a deep depression. As she leaves her planet she starts
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great, realistic book about a woman who, as a child, suffers a serious illness that makes her very slow but ultimately well. The story is very moving and very realistic, and the main character is a very well written woman. If you're looking for a new fantasy novel, look no further.   What a wonderful book this is! It is a great read, and I really enjoyed reading it!   I was really looking forward to reading this because of the author's amazing previous books, but this one took the cake for me. There is a lot going on in this novel - many characters, several stories, all told very well. However, the most important aspect of this book is its message: life is not a fairy tale, and there's no magical cure for what ails us. It is not going to be a cure for everyone, but we can learn to live and appreciate our own strengths - sometimes even with the help of a magical book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just recently re-watched this series and found myself extremely enjoying it. The first season is a little slow for me but I found it more interesting to follow. The other 3 episodes have been interesting and not quite what I expected. The one I like the most is "I Won't Say I Love You" which was hilarious and pretty much a comedy. And of course, I love the final episode where the two main characters meet in a pub for the first time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy this book! This book is full of so many great moments. The characters are so well written and made us care about each one and what they were thinking and doing at that time. Even though it's a horror story, it doesn't feel like one and I think that's why I loved it so much. It made me feel very connected to the characters and made me want to see where their journey is leading to. The book also has some great twists and turns that you'll not see coming and I loved that. One thing that I didn't really like about the book is that it did have a very heavy ending. I personally wasn't really that shocked by that and I probably would have been angry if I was expecting a happy ending. If that's how you want your book, I would just wait a few years and try something else. But for me, it made me excited to read next year's book and I know that next year is going to be awesome.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a collection of short stories, some of which are based on actual events. The stories themselves are well written, but the ending is a little disappointing. The main character, a female FBI agent, gets her hands full and is not interested in pursuing the lead for the rest of the book, instead turning her focus to her relationship with her husband, an undercover FBI agent. The second, a man, finds a new sense of life while trying to help out a local fire station in the process of moving back to his home state. The third, an Asian man, is a cop on a case where the victims are all Chinese people, and the victim is a Chinese woman.   I have enjoyed several works by this author over the years and this is one of my favorites. If you are a fan of urban fantasy (and I am), you will enjoy the books.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book. The story is told as a series of vignettes set in a fictional community in Texas, called Westlake. The main character is a white girl named Mandy and she is the youngest of four kids in a predominantly black family. Mandy is very interested in history, and she uses the story in her school's honors history project to teach about her community's struggle with race. This book was a huge inspiration to me. I learned a lot about the struggles that were faced by this community in this book and it was a joy to read. It was also very interesting to learn about the African American perspective on the Civil War. It also is very interesting that Mandy's father fought for the Union army and she never understood why he fought on the other side.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm reading a book about early Christianity called The Passion of the Christ. I really liked it. The writing style is very good. There's good and bad here. The bad is the book assumes that Jesus was a real person in real life. It has a Jesus that's an early "revelation", that "proves" Christianity and that Jesus went back to be judged in a temple. The good is that it has a real, believable Jesus, who does really bad things, and who makes some great "hilarious" quotes that you know are actually true, and some really good one liners that you think are "insane", but really aren't. If you read The Passion to understand Christianity, you'll find that you didn't really understand Christianity until you read this book. I would say that it's a good primer on early Christianity.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book because I was looking for a new take on what the bible says about marriage. I am a lesbian, and I know that the way many gay women see themselves is as being a married woman in the bible. For me, the biblical texts have been incredibly helpful for understanding my sexuality. I learned a lot from this book, but the one I felt was most insightful was the end of chapter 5 about what God says to unmarried men in regards to sex and marriage.   I have read all the reviews of this book and was expecting a really strong message about gay marriage. It didn't come across like that at all. I really liked this book more for the humor and the information it gave.

Lewis, illustrated by James R. Gurney:  I am currently reading the first volume of The Chronicles of Narnia by C S Lewis. This book was published in 1941, a year before the publication of the book of the same name. Lewis' C. S. Lewis does not suffer from the type of writer who gets stuck in the rut and never attempts to progress. Lewis was always looking for a way to move forward. In this case he took inspiration from the "Curses of Chilidren" in the Bible. This first volume, which was originally written as a trilogy in the '50s, contains the story of a princess named Chion. Chion is forced by her father to marry, and is given her uncle Chilperic as her husband. Chil Peric dies, leaving Chion in a very difficult position. Chione and Chilenec, the king's servants, tell her that her uncle must die, in order that she can be the king. As Chion tries to escape, she is kidnapped and taken into a tower by the king of the land, a very evil and cruel king named Arthor. Chalion eventually learns of the fact that her father was never the king, and that she is the Queen of Sheba. She flees and arrives in the country of Chimalis. She is immediately recognized by her friend, a beautiful young princess named Ami. She escapes the tower and, after a few hours, encounters two very evil men, Thessalides. They, along with Thessalus, a shepherd, are her enemies. Chions uncle Cholperic dies in the tower. As a result Chion feels trapped and is determined to escape. Eventually the three friends decide to join forces, and after some adventures, Chion and Ami set out on a quest to find the other two princesses and free the land from the evil of the king and the shepherd. I liked this book. The story had a few inconsistencies, but I think the writer was very careful to clarify the differences between this world and the one Lewis was writing about. As I stated before
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book has a few issues (which I have discussed before and would recommend that the author addresses), but I think it is a good introduction to the world of non-profit fundraising and the various approaches that have been tried to solve the problems of poor fundraising.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second in a series of books written by a highly regarded writer on the subject of women and violence.     The first book dealt with the "gendered" aspect of sexual aggression and abuse, and it did a decent job of presenting a balanced view of the subject.  However, this one does a much better job of understanding the underlying social dynamics of rape, particularly at the institutional level.  I would have liked to see a greater emphasis on victimization by male peers at the hands of female perpetrators, but for a book that has so much focus on the social aspects of sexual assault, that is hardly surprising.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that is very difficult to review because it is so different in the way it's written from the way that it is read.   It's a novel that has been divided into two parts. The first part deals with the war in Iraq, and the second part deals not with Iraq but with the family that is so intertwined with it that its origins are in the war.  In the first part, John Brown, the young man who is one of the leaders of the American slaves, is being tried for treason by his own people.  He is sentenced to death, and his execution is one more in a long line of crimes that he has been charged with.  But we see him through the eyes of his family, as the reader follows the family through the war from their arrival in Texas, to their arrival back in Virginia, to the war, to home again, to a brief stay in New York, to return to Texas and the execution of John Brown.  And what's interesting is that while we follow the narrative through their movements, we feel that we can get a glimpse of what the members of the family, especially John, are going through, because he is so far away, and we see so little of the people around him. It's one of those books that you can read and think about for hours and never be sure whether what you are reading is fact or fiction. I was surprised by how deeply it stayed with me after I finished it, and I was left with an enormous amount of admiration for its authors, even as I read the first chapter.      What impressed me most about this book was the quality of the writing, the sense of urgency and drama that was present. It makes you think, as you read, of the war that was coming, the way the British government was planning on taking over the colonies, the fear of a slave uprising, and a sense of hope that it would end in freedom. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fun, but is not for children aged 7+. It is a book that you can enjoy for those years when children are less interested in reading and more interested in play. This book has an interesting concept: that every day, at the same time, the sun comes up and the moon comes down. I enjoyed it because the author made a connection between the different phases of the moon, which is interesting. The book has a good plot that is not too long. The main character does not want to stay with his mother because he is not good enough for her and is too smart. However, he finds himself in the same situation as his father.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fun, fun, great book   By: mike - 07/08/2009 I have read quite a few science fiction books, but I have never read one that I enjoyed as much as this one.   The aliens are as funny and as real as you would expect them to be   While it does not have much in the way of a plot, it is filled with enough action that it feels like the book is a continuous fight against alien forces   And while it does have a lot of good dialogue and an interesting plot, the character development is more than made up for by the fun and crazy ideas, especially from the aliens themselves.  You can be a good guy too and yet be an evil dictator by Mike Mignola. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is not the strongest part of the book. As a child of the 80's my parents told me stories about the adventures of the evil man who had the power to change people's personality (a boy named Kevin who became a man named Lenny who loved video games) so I was very curious about this story. The first third of the story is about a young man that finds out about this mysterious evil man called the Demon. I thought that this young man (Kevin) was pretty clever and I thought I knew what happened to the demon but the story didn't tell me and it became more confusing as the story went on. I think the writer might have been going for a psychological horror story as it ended up being a pretty sad story in the end. However, I enjoyed this part of this book and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good psychological horror.  The second third of this story is set in the 70's and is about another boy named Jim who is very interested in the Demon and thinks he can make it disappear. The story seems to be taking place in a high school and it has a similar feel to the first third but it is also darker in tone. I like the plot twists and the story does have a bit of a tragic feel to it. The ending of the first three parts seemed very abrupt and I think that it could have been done a bit better.   Overall:  I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this book. It took me a while to get into this book but once I did I was interested in everything. I liked the characters and the plot did keep me thinking as the book went on because of the mystery behind the Demon's disappearance. This is a good horror book to read if you like psychological horror and paranormal stories but it isn't a masterpiece like "The Conjuring" or "The Haunting of Hill House" but it was a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is not just a book that can be read or re-read in one sitting, it can be enjoyed over many months.   The book tells us a bit about the history of the Amish.  They began as a "simple" faith community in Pennsylvania, but the Amissians of North America took their religion and their beliefs to new levels of complexity and detail.  The Amissia is not about the "abstinence" of the Bible, nor is it about the doctrine of tithing.  For a book written about the Ami's beliefs, their practices and the lives of the people of the community, it is quite detailed, yet the information is delivered in a calm and scholarly manner.  What I really like about the book is the emphasis on the individual. The Amis have different perspectives on the same issues. The different ways that Amis view God, or life, or morality, or God's purpose for the creation of the universe are all explored.  Although the book focuses on the Amis of America, the information can be applied to the wider world, and as such this book has a lot of life in it for many different readers.  It has a good number of short reviews for the author which make for an interesting read.  This book also does a good job of illustrating why Ami beliefs are so different from their counterparts in the church of Christ.  3.5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good!   It has some good ideas. I like the story and have a sense of the characters. I'm not sure if I'll get around to reading the next two books, but it was a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I have read this year. I'm a huge fan of fantasy and this was my second fantasy novel. I love how well written it is and how easy it is to get into. The only thing that would make it better is if the author would've continued the story to see how everything came together. As it is, I'm eagerly awaiting my next read.   I've had an awesome time reading The Dark's Heart: The Dragon-Blooded Chronicles by Mark Lawrence. His new series will be worth the wait.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read for a good cause. A book that had me intrigued, even before it actually got started. This was the second novel that I've read that has the ability to make me sit back and ponder the plot for hours on end.  This is not a book that you'll just read once and put it down.    I look forward to reading more from the author, and I will keep an eye out for more of his books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My book had some issues that I had with. For starters, one of the main characters is named "I'm not a racist". That is like the ultimate way to get a person banned from any community where racism exists. The other issue I have with the book is that the main character is in love with a white woman, even though he knows they have a different skin color and she's black. This is an extremely racist portrayal of black women, especially when you consider the fact that there are almost no black women in history.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It takes a lot of the typical fantasy tropes and brings them into an urban setting. The book is very good and has all the aspects I look for in a great urban fantasy. I would definitely recommend this book for any fantasy fans who love fantasy!
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I love this book. I don't really care what the authors were thinking about the subject matter when they wrote this book - but it was an interesting book. If you have a tendency to believe that every issue of a particular kind has a solution and that people are always either on your side or against you, I definitely wouldn't suggest this book to you. I would say to you to start with the basics, which are really all about basic concepts. I believe most people would agree with this book's basic points, but the discussion of what people think is not a strong point. You can't really change people's opinion once they've formed it. The idea that people aren't as smart as you make a good story or a good lecture, but that's the thing - it's a story/lecture - not really a book I'd recommend to anyone."
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of this is fairly good. The main thing I noticed about this book is how well it explains the concepts and the underlying physics behind the mechanics of a rocket. The author is able to explain how the heat shield works (it is not an exothermic reaction) and also how a rocket works. This is a very good overview.   Now for the rest of the book. The next couple chapters are not so good. For example, when describing the rocket's flight characteristics it starts talking about how the fuel and oxidizer can be used to turn the engine on and off like a light switch. That's not how engines work! (I think that this should have been at the start of the chapter.) The next part of the discussion is the "burnout" of the engines. That is, the engines are not "running" continuously, but rather are shutting off at the point where they no longer produce thrust, because of their exhaust gasses. That isn't good either. Finally, the final part of this chapter describes the final ignition of the fuel/oxygen mixture, which is where you may have noticed a huge omission from the description: it mentions the rocket engine's "boiling point", which is a different thing entirely. The problem here is not that the author failed to explain the "booming point" (which is really a matter of heat dissipation) but rather that he didn't define the word in any meaningful way.  If you are interested in reading more on rocket science or rocketry, I would recommend the following books:  Brunson, Robert, and G. Robert Jones, eds. The Rocket Report (1990). A good basic overview of the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * I found that this book is very informative and enjoyable.   "The Secret" is a well written book that gives the reader the tools and information to avoid, and succeed, when encountering life challenges.  I especially like that there is a helpful glossary.  Although the book is not a quick read, I felt that it was well worth the time spent.  This book is definitely a keeper. *I'm a man with a low libido. This book would have been useful to me if it contained an appendix on "The Five Cs" and "The Three M's." * This book helps you understand yourself better. The way that a man's sexuality develops.  There are many good books on men and relationships but this is one of the best.  The author goes out of his way to show you where you are coming from when you think about this subject. It's a great book, but it's not "quick read" and is better suited for a person who is not on the go. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      "Crowley is a master of prose with a keen eye for detail, and a gift for developing his characters with a depth that makes them believable. " -Ramesh Vyas, Booklist.com   A really interesting and exciting read. The setting is amazing.   "A riveting, thrilling novel." -Liz Hannah, The Washington Post   I was very excited about this book as I was looking forward to reading this series but it has a lot more to offer.  In the last book (which I also really enjoyed) I had been hoping to get to know a lot of the characters more and not have them all be the same.  This is my second book by this author and although I loved the first book I still want to know more about the other characters.  There are a lot a little spoilers in the first two books but I would definitely suggest that you not read the first one before you start this one.  I would recommend this to all readers.  "Ripens and rages like a bull through a bullfight. The pace never slows. There are moments where I almost want to laugh, but I just keep on reading." -Caroline Averill, The Guardian  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Like many other reviewers, I had mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it's a lovely book. The writing is lovely and evocative, and the characters are well-drawn. It is a beautiful book for children, and it is fun and entertaining and engaging for adults.   On the other hand, there's a problem with this book and that is the title, which does not work for me. I'm not sure if this is a case of too much hype or what, but I can't stand the title. This is a book called "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", and I don't want to hear that the wizard in this book is evil. This, to me, is a good thing, since it means that the story isn't just a fantasy with lots of adventure. I like when a story has a good idea that is done well. But the title is such a negative, that I don  [ there's also some very interesting and very imaginative creatures. The story is a lot like "Ender's Game" and the Ender character has some interesting things to do as a hero. But to me it seems to fall short of the story. The hero can't be as good as he thinks he is. He gets everything he wants but then realizes he shouldn't have, and he has to go out and make things up. The reader knows this is what happens to Ender, but the book doesn't explain it. This makes it a little difficult to understand the events as they occur. The book isn't bad, but a bit confusing.   was a story about a boy named Max who lives in a magical world called Oz. His parents, both of them are wizards and his uncle is a wizard's apprentice who was his mentor and friend. One day a terrible accident occurs and he, his parents, and his aunt are trapped in the land of Oz and have to figure out how to get home. The idea was that the title of the book was the name of the world and the town where he lives, so this sounds to me like a really nice, fun book for young children.But this book was disappointing. To me, it seemed that the author spent a lot of time making the land and the towns and people of Oz look and sound like the old West. And then there were the animals, which are very pretty, but just don't seem to belong in Oz. And they are made out of paper. And
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book and I am glad I read it.   This is a good story but the fact that it could have been a little longer and better is a slight disappointment.  It was a very nice change from all the "I wish I could have known what happened in the beginning" type stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book made me think about why I have these things in my life that I don't like. I mean, how can I stop being attracted to a lot of people at once, and how can that be a bad thing? This book answers all those questions, and I can't wait to read the sequel. I think you need to write a positive book before writing a negative book.
Write a positive review about a good book:        I am very impressed by the clarity and depth of understanding of the concepts presented here.   To me, this is the real deal when it comes to understanding the nature and causes of conflict and division in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's easy to see why it's the best book I've read all year.   In fact, I may recommend it to all the people I know who hate books.  If you like fantasy books, like anything with elves, dwarves, or wizards, this book is the perfect introduction to your kind of fantasy. It's about a young female wizard's journey to learn more about her ancestry, to protect her people, and to try and avoid the fate that befell her family: she is cursed to be the only female wizard in a magical realm, and every woman who wants to be is doomed to be cursed, as well. This is my kind of book: it's both entertaining and educational. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in the market for a new cookbook and came across The Food Lab by Melissa Clark. The reviews that I read and all the information I found made the purchase easy. The recipes are simple and easy to understand. The book is not complicated to read or follow. The food is also delicious and fresh. Thank you for the excellent book!! :) - Michelle, TX  More books by Melissa:  My husband and I are big fans of cooking shows and these books are perfect for those who enjoy a challenge. - Linda, NY  The Food Lab was recommended by a fellow food blogger. She mentioned the Food Lab in a few of her posts and we bought it because we are big lovers of cooking and science! The Food Labs are the first cookbooks to teach you all about how to make the most of your food. - Julie, NC  My husband and myself had never cooked, but we wanted to learn and learn fast. We loved the food lab. It's been a great resource for our whole family. - Diane, CA  "We purchased this book because we loved it from the beginning, and we have been able to use it as an introduction to new cooking techniques for the kids." - Susan, CA
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book for my 13 year old and he absolutely loved it! I know that is hard to believe, but it actually happened. His younger brother and I had some issues with reading. However, after reading The Last Wish we were able to finally make it through the whole book. The plot is very good and it was a great read.   What did you like best about this story?   The plot was excellent and there was lots of humor to make up for the heavy horror. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had heard good things about this book, but to read the actual words to see what he had to say was quite a revelation. The man has a talent for making even the most mundane subjects very interesting. A man who is "one of those weirdos who just loves to read about sex" as he calls it. This is a book that makes you want to read more, not less. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've been able to pick up a novel by this author (she's a very prolific author) and I have to say, it is really good.   The plot is really interesting and intriguing as well as the characters are nicely designed and well-developed.  I really liked that the novel was about a girl trying to make a life for herself without being bound by the traditions of her clan. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of all Harry Potter books, and it was nice to see how well they are executed. It's been over a year since I finished the final book, and this book was a good followup. The characters are complex and well defined, the plot is compelling and entertaining, and there are some surprising twists that kept me on the edge of my seat. I also enjoyed reading about Ginny's mother, and enjoyed the brief interludes between books.   There is not much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The stories in this book are beautiful. They are written in the third person but this adds to the realism. I loved the story of the two siblings living together because the mother's feelings for the child are shown in this way.   This book was so good I want to read the sequel:  The sequel to The Good Earth was also published by a publisher with the same name. It was called The Good Sea.  I loved the first book because it was so much like a book I have read before:  - the story is told from the point of view of the child, which is quite good - the characters are interesting and you have to read to find them. - the prose is very simple, but the illustrations and the story are very nice - the ending was very well done, I felt that the story ended with a good, happy ending - the author has a good understanding of children's literature. I liked the way the narrator explained the world around the children. I like the idea of making a fantasy world that is a reflection of a different country.  The author is not a child's writer, I wonder if this was a conscious decision to write a book for adults. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    - This is a great novel that you should all read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is great. This book was not just about the occult but about the nature of consciousness and the effects of our choices. I am an avid occultist and this book was an eye opener. My brother who is a good friend of mine was a bit skeptical when I first told him about this book. He was skeptical that there was more to this book than the typical occult book he has heard about and I have read. My experience with this book is exactly what my brother and I were both expecting. This book is so great and I will continue to reference this book in my class.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this one very much. It really brought out the best in my character and I think it's a book that would appeal to both fans of the series and those who aren't familiar with it. I really hope that more of their books are like this one, because the only reason I haven't gotten it yet is because they've only published it in a few cities so far, and I am too lazy to travel out of town! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely loved this book. There is so much I could say about it, but this was an amazing read and I highly recommend it to everyone interested in the works of Tolkien.   I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a fantasy/science fiction book, as well as anyone who is looking to learn about history and mythology in the world of Middle Earth.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife read it last year and said the character was well developed, the plot was engaging and it all made sense, just a bit short.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always enjoyed reading and watching science fiction. I am a huge science fiction reader and I have watched some science fiction shows with my wife.   For the longest time I had not heard of this author or his books.  When a friend recommended this book to me I was excited about it.  A book about a group of people that try to survive a disaster by making a kind of "magic" armor out of metal.  The book is well written with plenty of backstories.  These kind of books I usually don't like but this one I really liked. I especially liked the group's backstory and I think it has some interesting parallels to how people have tried to solve disasters in the past.  I don't have much experience with working with metal but I did learn a thing or two about that stuff.  Another big point that I like is the characters.  They have some interesting personalities and I enjoyed the interaction between them.  This book is full of action with a few laughs along the way.  At times I found the book to be a bit slow which isn't a bad thing but I feel like it would have been nice to have a little bit more of that action.  Overall, I found this book great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm in love with this book. I've seen a couple others that I've read and liked (Gossip Girl, Pretty Little Liars, the Twilight series...). This book is different, which I like. I like the idea behind the book, I like how it has been written. I also like how this book didn't come out of nowhere (which is rare for me), I was already familiar with it but thought I'd give it another shot. The main problem I have is that it seemed that this book is supposed to have been set in the future, but instead, we get our first glimpse into the past, and I thought that was really interesting (and would have made more sense to me as time went on). But the book still feels fresh and new, and is definitely worth reading. And the characters are good, which is always nice!
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I think this is the best book ever written on the issue of the relationship between religion and politics."  -Tom Wolfe   This is a fascinating, insightful, and insightful work. It is written in an engaging style with a lot of humor and a great eye for the absurdities of the human condition. Wolfe is a very funny writer with a terrific sense of humor. It would be good if he wrote some books like this that focus more on the bizarre aspects of the US political system. The political aspect of religion is a small part, but Wolfe has done a wonderful job of presenting a clear overview of this. Highly recommended!  "One of the best books ever written about religion and American politics." -Michael Kinsley
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I have a problem with "fairy tales." I read my fair share of them as a child, but most of them have a very negative connotation. This is the first book in a series that I have read in order. The story about the girl named Emma is a story about a boy that is a girl trapped inside a girl's body. She is a princess with a magic sword and an evil, evil dragon. This story was very funny and exciting at the same time.   (The book is over 2 years old, but was not dated in my library.) The other two books in the series were not as good, but I am glad that this one is still available.
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent novel that really gets into the mind of an individual.   It would be a much better book if the author went a little deeper into the details of the novel, but this is a great read if you want to learn something about the mind.   The book is well written, with great descriptions and strong characterization.  One of the main themes in the book is self esteem and how it affects the way a person thinks and what kind of decisions they make.  The author, in the last chapters of the book, mentions the importance of "knowing the enemy" and how we can "see through" what the "enemy" is up to.  I liked this section a lot, because it was one of the chapters that really helped me understand the mind and what was being discussed.  There were some other nice moments as well, but that one was the most memorable to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I started reading this book I was extremely impressed. I was already a fan of Peter V. Brett's work, and he always makes me laugh. He has a good sense of humor and really knows how to convey humor. What I liked about this book was that it made a fun read. I really liked the different perspectives of each character. I think they all get to talk about some really interesting things. I also liked the fact that each character had their own unique set of morals which were not mutually exclusive to the others. I especially liked the way that each person was portrayed and how different each character was from the others, and I enjoyed the fact the author included a lot of footnotes. The story is really well written and well told, and it definitely gets a thumbs up from me. I give it a 3/4 star rating.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorites.   It's a good read about a young, dark-haired girl who was raped and then had the rapist confess to a crime he didn't commit. She was convicted of having sex with a 17-year-old. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves the fantasy genre and love reading about magic in a good fantasy setting.  I really liked this book and I think the author did a really good job in making the world of the book feel alive and alive and unique. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best part about this book is that it is a good read with a well put together plot that is well done and believable. I was also impressed with the way that the characters were handled and how their actions and choices felt so real. The author definitely did a good job at making this book engaging. The best parts are the scenes that are set in the backround with the people that the protagonist interacts with while he is working and also the interactions the characters make with each other. I also liked the fact that the author used a lot of imagery. I like when the author makes use of the scenery as well as the characters. This book is also good for those who like a little more action than romance. I would recommend this to anyone who likes an excellent mystery novel and love a good character driven story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a science fiction/fantasy fan then this book is probably going to be hard to put down. The story of Kirei Kotobuki, a boy who has the power to see and control people through dreams, is very interesting. The fact that he has to be careful with his power is interesting as well. However, his actions as a character are not always the most enjoyable, and I found myself wanting for a lot of different stories. The way the story progressed was very cool, and the plot was interesting. However there were times when the story felt rushed. The author was clearly just going through the motions to move the story along, and there are times when it felt very repetitive. However I did appreciate the character development and how they managed to make some great characterizations. The main character Kireio was a lot more interesting than I initially thought he would be, as his personality and behavior seemed to change a lot through the story. For all of the issues that I had with the story, I do still have a lot to love about the book, and hope to read more from the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've listened to this audiobook several times and it's been on my to listen to list since I was 12.   It's funny and light but you can still hear the angst, the pain, and the sadness this story was trying to share.  I loved it and I hope you do too.  What people said about this audiobooks:  "I think it's worth listening to even if you're a non-reader, as the story doesn't really try to tell us too much about the character's past, but rather the events of the present, and in a very engaging and charming way.  This would make an excellent audio book for the beginning of a favorite series, or simply as a quick diversion during a long commute."   -Spencer "I thought this was excellent. I read the book in the first couple of days so I didn't have any expectations. It did not disappoint.  The narrator was very well chosen and was really good."   -Ariel "I found this audiorecord to be well done and I'm definitely interested in the second book."  "The narrator is very good."
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, John Fowles offers a useful introduction to the topic of historical contingency. There are a few good points on the various ways in which a historical event can occur, but for the most part this book is a good introduction to contingency, especially the contingency of social history.   I am going to say that a couple of things that should be noted about Fowle's book. First, as mentioned, this is not a treatise on contingency per se, and this is probably a mistake, as I suspect many readers of this review will make in evaluating the book. While contingency is an important point for any study of social change, for a general social history, I think it is much more useful to think of contingency as a feature of historical materialism rather than a "theory," and that one can see contingency at work in every aspect of any historical event. Second, I am not convinced that Fowes's approach to contingency is as useful as it should be in a broad sense, and my feeling is that many of the things that he says about the inevitability of change are overstated in the book's discussions of a variety of historical contingencies. For example, while he points out that the formation of a political party, even at a relatively small size, is a fairly typical example of a historical contingency, he fails to recognize that this contingency is likely to be less and less significant in the future as large organizations like unions and political parties begin to develop as the new forms of working class self-organization. Third, while there is some argument to be made that the notion of contingency is useful and even necessary for thinking about the social determinants of a given historical event, I do not find that the argument that contingency is a necessary and inevitable part of social analysis is very convincing or convincing at all. Perhaps Fownes's most convincing argument is that contingency can be useful as a means of understanding social change; for instance, that as a class movement grows, it is inevitable that it will face increasing obstacles in terms of political organization, social discipline, and the like. However, as the book develops in the latter chapters, this argument becomes less and more tenuous, and it is not clear to me that this argument is ever completely convincing. Perhaps, if the book were longer, I would be more convinced.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book so much that I bought a second copy (for a very reasonable price). It was a good, interesting read. There is a lot of information about the military and some history, but not enough to confuse you with too much. It covers the basics of the military (which I am fascinated by), but it was never too dry to read. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the military. The book is not overly long but is a great read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the author spends way too much time talking about some aspects of the book that I found boring. The author also says too much about his background that I don't want to have read about. Overall a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't imagine this book being any good without a good plot and character development. The prose is smooth, the story is entertaining, and there is a lot to like about the characters. It will be a hard book to put down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a book with a few holes in it, but a good story.   I recommend it to my husband. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was great and I loved the story. If you can't get into the plot, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback. The first half is great and the second half is like having a great drink with friends and laughing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The world is full of bad, sad stories.  The book is about a father and son, a husband and wife and their young children. The author does a good job of balancing between the good and the bad.  I liked the fact that this book deals with so many different types of families - that it wasn't just a love story, but also a family with an alcoholic father and a daughter who has a drinking problem.   I felt like this was a good story with an interesting premise. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very enjoyable read, I liked the characters and the plot was very well thought out. I hope that the author continues writing and this book gets an excellent sequel, I think it needs a better ending (for whatever reason).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a bit of a book nerd and this is definitely one of the best!   My wife and I found out about the book from a good friend of ours and we have been hooked ever since.   While this story is not a very realistic one, it is still an interesting read and it was well written! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author's descriptions of the book, and the plot, are accurate, and make the book compelling. As a whole, the novel is well written and a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Book of the Law: The Divine Codes of Hammurabi" by Robert S. Schalkenheim   The Book of Laws was the legal code of a Babylonian king who unified the Babylonian kingdoms under his rule from 1792 BCE to 612 BCE. This was one of the earliest legal texts to use a systematic legal system, and the first to do so in a literary form. The book is structured as a series of sections in which a particular problem is discussed in detail by the author. The text is divided into four parts:  1. The Chapters 1 and 2 have the general theme of establishing law and order, which may be taken as a commentary on the other parts of the book.  2. The Chapter 3 section describes the nature of law and its purposes: it is to protect the weak from the strong, protect the people from their kings, protect their property and their rights, and promote social harmony.   3. The fourth section, Chapter 4, describes the actual practice of law, focusing on the rights of the individual (who is always represented by his or her family) and the protection of the public against the abuse of power.  In this chapter, there is the first statement of the principles of the law:  This means that the laws are written to preserve the basic rights of humans, and to promote the social cohesion of the society. The author also sets forth several laws relating to the protection and welfare of animals and the environment, a number of laws relating the distribution of land and property among the different groups within a country, laws relating family relations, and laws governing war and peace. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " The most remarkable piece of fiction I've ever read" "The most remarkable tale I've read." "Wonderful, memorable story!" "The best book I've seen on the whole subject." "The strongest evidence that we are not alone."

Write a positive review about a good book:      "In some ways I like this more than A Thousand Splendid Suns. I think it's funnier; I think the main character's arc is better written, and the ending is more satisfying. But what I love about this book is that the writing is actually pretty good, and even the dialogue is funny. There's a wonderful tension between the very-real-feeling writing and the "toys" of the plot, but the reader doesn't get tired of the good parts, and they're still a joy to read."   - Michael R. Underwood, author of Trespassers, an underappreciated contemporary fantasy (and the most entertaining review I've read since A Thousand splendid sun)   I was going to buy this book for my nephew but couldn't justify the $9.50 that I paid at the store. He was in the right age bracket to enjoy the book, so I let him have the print copy. But he did not like it at all. It was too long and too confusing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book that I read quite frequently, particularly because I've become a strong advocate for writing as a lifelong practice  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It is a nice book, I like the character and plot, but I can't help but think that it is a little on the long side. There is so much more to this world that is not shown in this one book that I would like to see explored further. A well written story and it was really a nice read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been a great resource for me on dealing with the emotional pain I have suffered since a horrible and distressing event happened in November 2006. The author's writing style is easy to follow and easy to understand. The book does a great job of helping the reader to create new strategies for dealing with difficult emotions that can come with the grief.   The book is short at 495 pages but is packed with valuable information, and a wonderful author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   " It's got a story that has you wanting to see what happens next. It's also got a good pace that's easy to read and not too long.

I love how every page of the book has a new surprise waiting for you. "
Write a positive review about a good book:     It's been a while since I read this book because I started it too late (the year I took the MFA, and had been looking for a book about the field), but I was so excited to find the review I did - and it makes sense too! - I wish I read it as soon as possible!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has been written about, but I want it back in my hand, so I'm going to say it right now:   "What does it mean to be human? What is the purpose of life? And how do we go about finding that meaning? If this is the question, we need to get started. In this book, David Foster Wallace explains how that search is accomplished, with humor, wit, and depth of analysis."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am happy to give this book five stars because of its overall quality: it's really well written, there's a lot of humor, and it covers a lot interesting ground.   For the most part, the book focuses on the story of "the little people" who are used in military experiments, and their reactions to being in their own body and body fluids, and the effects of this on their lives and behavior.  As I was reading, I thought I would be getting into this at a faster pace, but it felt so slow it took me a long time to get to the end of the first chapter.  I think that the narrator does a good job at conveying the situation in a way that is understandable.  The first chapter also includes an introduction to the main characters' backgrounds, which is a good idea that is executed with a good deal of detail, and I enjoyed this aspect of the book.  The book does get off to a slow start.  For all the characters' appearances, the descriptions are somewhat sparse and sparsely written, which causes a lot to feel lost in the narrative.  This is particularly true for the main character, Peter, who is more flamboyant than he seems to be, and his interactions with his friends are also very poorly written.  It's hard to tell if the narrator (who's supposed to be representing Peter's father in the story) is having difficulty communicating what is going on because Peter is a little too "different" for the book to be able to properly convey what is happening.  While Peter has some of the same motivations as other characters in the book, his character also has a very clear, simple, and unifying reason: he wants to get his head in order. He has a good heart and is kind, but he's too lazy and ungrateful to realize how much he's hurting his father.  A couple of times during the book he expresses his dissatisfaction with his current life, but the narration does not make it seem like he's being realistic about his feelings, and this comes across as forced.  Peter's brother/dauber, Richard, is also very well-written and his relationship with Peter is very well developed, and he's actually very convincing.  Richard is also a good character, as he seems like he would have a more positive attitude if he was around, and does have some positive things to say about his brother, even if he does
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this novel, I thought it was a bit dull and pretentious. But this book really hit me with its wit and cleverness. If you want to know what a vampire book should be like, you should pick this up. I have a feeling that the series might turn into a series of books that are slightly more entertaining and intelligent and less pretentious but just as clever.   It's not perfect but it's very close.   and     The book opens with a "cliffhanger" so I'm not going to talk about the first half of the book since that might spoil it for those who want to finish it without reading the cliffhanger.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is the book I've been looking for."   I have tried to read a number of the "classic" YA novels and none have impressed me enough to buy the books. But this book by Anne Lamott is a real winner, and the concept/world/philosophy of this book is so captivating that I'll be trying to find a copy when it's released.  I have read a lot of books and books that have been good, and some that have disappointed me. Anne Lamotte is an exception to that rule. This is the kind of book that's very special to me. I like her world and the characters in it, and I love the way she presents it. A book that contains my favorite characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good read. There is a lot of information about the world around us. This book is just what the doctor ordered.   I wish there were more information about different races. However, the information is useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best works I have read in a while.   I really loved this book and it will be a good read for the summer break when I am done with the novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking to learn a new language and I found this book was the perfect introduction to it. My first time trying to learn an new language, it didn't go as I planned, but I kept going back to the book. I still have a few problems with the grammar, but it is a good starting point. This book is not so much a beginner guide as it is to a complete beginner. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed the book. I thought it was a good read and I had fun reading it.   It's a lot more fun than a typical YA book because there's so much more happening in the book and it's not just just about the main character (I think a book like that wouldn't work on children, though).   The story and the characters are wonderful and the way the author handled the plot is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    (this was a good read, even if i did feel a little left out of the main plot)    The main character is a fairly complex one, the book was a lot more enjoyable if you're a bit less attached to him than other people were.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite books in recent years, which I just finished reading a few days ago, was This Strange Empire by Larry Niven. The story is about a planet named Krennos, which has been destroyed by an unknown force in the distant past. There are many stories and mythologies about the fate of Krennia, and this book has one in the middle which is not really in the same genre as the other. It is a nice and light story that was well-written. Also, the book is very much worth it and even if you can't find it on your own book shelf, you can still get the hardcover and be prepared for many more stories in the Niven universe. 5 stars. (I do have a few Niven books to my name, and the only other one I've read is the recently released Manhunt...)
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very nice and interesting book, this time, it is about the Chinese Communist Party. It is an in depth look at the history and politics of the Communist Party in China from the founding of the party to the present time. There are no "what is the best Communist book ever", because this book, I believe is the book that will most likely stand the test of time. It's not the best, or even the most insightful book, but it's the book everyone should read about Communist Party and what it is doing right and wrong. If you have ever considered yourself to be a Communist, this will be a book to read. The last paragraph of the book really does say it all.  "We do not fear, we do not tremble, we stand up to those who wish us harm" --China's Communist Party My Thoughts: I thought this book was great. The author did a great job in providing the details, the information, the details about the history. This book is also a great look at China, China's history and the politics, the power and the people behind it. It gives you a glimpse into the Communist party, the Chinese revolution, the fall of the shah and the end of the Chinese empire. It covers the whole scope, from the history of the Communists to the current day and the future. It does not cover everything, but for those who want to get a glimpse of the current state of affairs, this is the perfect book to have in your hands.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like the way this one was put together. It's very short (under 400 pages) and very easy to read, without being pretentious. In my opinion, the author does a good job with setting up the characters, but his story is a little too plot driven. There's only a small amount of development in the plot and it's a little frustrating. It has an element of horror, but doesn't have a really scary story. I found it very entertaining. The author's humour, although very crude, was very funny. The humor was done in a "what's so bad about that?" sort of way and I found myself laughing out loud, especially about how the protagonists would come up with ideas on how to kill their family members or their pets. That was another thing that impressed me about this book - the plot. You don't need to know what's going to happen in the next chapter because the story is very compelling. It did get a little repetitive at times, but that's mostly due to how it set up each plot twist. The "villain" of the story was very well written and made the story more interesting. I'd definitely recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about the week before Christmas. I was about to write a positive reviews about it, but then I thought "what about the Christmas break?" Then I realized that it wasn't that Christmas break that was good, it was what happened between Christmas and New Year. I think that the author should stop writing about the holidays and start writing about life. It's about the time of year when you are the most relaxed and free to focus on life.    What I liked about this book: "I'm not saying that you should be writing about your own life, but it seems to me that the most successful writers write about the life in which they live. We should do the same." What I didn't like about this Book: I liked this book very much, but my favorite quote was this one from the author's editor: "The only people who read this will be the ones who live their lives for a living. You are very smart. You know when the right time to write is." It's true, right?  "The best part of a life is the other people you make it with." "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" "All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts; but the play goes on." The author's favorite thing to say: "It is the life and soul of every human being to know the truth about himself or herself."  I've never met a writer that is more like a friend than Mr. Deresiewicz.  Read this review for The Art of Fiction:  "...the most significant book that I have read this year."   If I had to say one thing about this novel, it would be this:  It's not exactly a novel...it's a novelistic portrait of a man in the real world.  I am very happy that Deresiews got the idea to do a biography.  It is always exciting to read about a famous author, and the author of this book has a great style.  "There is always more than one story to be told in any given book," Mr. Jarmusch observes...and Mr. de Resiewicz delivers.  The real story is not the story that De Resiews
Write a positive review about a good book:               This is a very good book. I like it better than some other books I have bought.   The main character is a person who has no time for philosophy or the occult, but his father is a magician and the occult is important to him.  His father is the main antagonist but he doesn't think he is.  If you think his father isn't evil, you are wrong.  The world is a really interesting place and the history is fascinating.  It is a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   " I enjoyed the book immensely, and it's a very good read.

A few minor flaws, and a couple that make the book more enjoyable, but overall a great read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in the spring of my sophomore year in college. I'm a freshman with only a few years of experience in the field of English Language Studies, and I'd heard that there was a book out on the history of the American English language and its use throughout the 20th century.   In this book, which is quite a bit longer than I'd imagined, the author takes a close look at how the usage of the English language has changed throughout its history and the reasons for that change.  While it doesn't cover every possible permutation of the term "American English," it is quite comprehensive and provides some fascinating insights into the evolution of the language.  I will add that the book's title is somewhat misleading as the author doesn't take into account the ways in which the English-speakers of America and the English speakers of the British Commonwealth have adapted to a certain set of rules of English usage. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised to find this book. It seemed so simple. I was looking forward to reading a book about my ancestors and I was pretty excited to read about my family history when I discovered it was by the same author who wrote the history of my family tree. This book is excellent. It explains how I am different from my great-grandmother. I love the idea that they all have a connection with the land, and I loved that they have stories to share with their children. They all have great stories of what they did and their work and how hard they worked. It was refreshing to hear that. I can read a lot about my great grandparents but it is nice to hear about how they lived. I loved this book a lot. I wish that there was more of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I've read the book now and it's not as bad as I thought. I thought it was really bad and did not give it a chance but after reading it, it has a good story and characters, it does have a plot.   My only issue is the ending, when it ended I felt really sad.  I'm also a fan of the author and the art style. I also like that there are no romance or sex in this book. It's just a mystery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    - I really enjoyed this book. It is not the best book of the series, but it is still a good story about the world and the life and its mysteries. I am also glad I can read about the history of this world. I will continue reading the series in the future. It might be the end, but I do hope to learn more about this world, about the politics and religion of it and the mysterious aliens living in it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book a very well written book about the Holocaust. The author provides an excellent summary and the author explains the main issues and why they happened.   Unfortunately the book was difficult to understand.  The author gives many references for what the author feels the major issues of the holocaust are.  His understanding of the various sources is excellent. The main source that this author believes the main issue is was written by Arthur R. Butz. The Butz piece was published in the book "Holocaust."   I have not read this book but I hope I can read it one day when I have time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book. If your only option for reading on the train is on your phone, this one is probably your only choice. The story was exciting, and the ending was a satisfying one, but I wasn't fully satisfied with the worldbuilding, especially in light of the sequel. I absolutely loved this book, and highly recommend it for anyone looking for something new to read. The worldbuilding is wonderful, but it really only holds up to the first book. It's a lot of fun, and you won't be disappointed with the ride.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Like the title says, the book is about a lot of things. The main story takes place during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) with two factions battling each other, one that wants to stay on and one that tries to get out of the country. The story is interesting in terms of the characters. Both sides are filled with great characters. They all have something to offer. The novel ends with an interesting twist, but the ending is more or less expected. The characters are not one dimensional, as this book should be. Each character has their own qualities and interests and it is nice to see them in action. A few people in the book have a bit too much going on, but not much too complain about. The book is good for kids, with characters that can be fun and interesting to read about.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child, I remember finding a copy of The Hobbit in the back of a book. This is an excellent sequel, though I'm not sure there's any other sequel that follows the same pattern as Tolkien.   The story is also very well-paced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, and highly recommend it.   It took me a while to get the hang of how to tell stories with words in my head, but in the end, the practice paid off.    This book is a great read, and my husband and I are both going to keep a copy around for use whenever we need to tell a story.  Review:  The writing is fast paced, and while it's a very young adult novel, there's still enough horror to keep the story grounded in reality, without being too terrifying or scary.  Some of the humor is very funny and the characters are likable, but a few characters are too unrealistic, and you really think they're supposed to be like that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book and I liked how they portrayed people being judged in a negative light, although it was hard to really relate to. This book was well-written and well researched. I enjoyed it very much.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book.   I am not a huge fan of the Star Wars stories from the Expanded Universe. I don't want to say too much about the book as I want to keep the review to what I think is the point of the book. This is not an easy read, as the book is very hard to summarize. What is the story of A New Hope?  A group of rebels (including Luke) are captured by Imperials.  Luke is rescued and his friends are released.  A great book (and book series) that I thoroughly enjoyed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book for the first time the other night and enjoyed it very much. The premise is really nice, it's simple but not boring, it feels like a good idea, well executed. The characters are just likeable and interesting. I have been known to be a fan of science fiction books that include human-like characters and they are not too common.   I have not read a book with an alien character so the way it is described is a little different than in other books. I did like the alien's dialogue and the way they think and they were not a bit boring. I also liked the fact that some of the things they said or did had a logical reasoning to it, such as the reason the aliens would build a spaceship that was larger than Earth. The aliens have a way of making you question everything you are told. For example, I felt that the aliens were not as good at understanding English and how to get around and get to places the humans do, but it does not matter in the end because they are still smarter than us. The only thing I did not care for was the humans. They were likeable at times, but when it came to the big decisions they were wrong.   The plot was really solid. It was simple and had a clear beginning, middle and end. I could see why this would be a good pick up book and it was. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys books with good science fiction and who is looking for something a little more complex.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book a lot.  The plot is interesting and the characters are all very well done.  It is a story about three friends who go on an adventure and end up getting into trouble.  I recommend it as a good read for kids, but also for adults who like fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      The book is a bit too heavy, but I like the title. It's also very descriptive:  it describes a particular aspect of the book's tone, which is more of a narrative than a description. I'm not one of those people who think that a book should explain everything as if we were really lost in a desert, so it was nice to see some things explained.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book, as far as science fiction novels go. There is a lot to enjoy about this book, but the writing in particular is a little off to me. The first half of the book is very good. It has a great sense of setting, and the story flows pretty smoothly. The middle of the story takes a little bit to get going. I'm not sure why. The ending is good, but a little lacking.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite of the Bishops' books. This is one of the few Bishop books I've read. I've been reading them since they were new, but I've never read anything quite like this.     I've enjoyed reading their other books as well, but this one has gotten a lot of mileage.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    - Good book. Well written, easy to understand and enjoyable for all ages.     I love the story and i wish there was more but it isnt a bad book, i really liked it  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good fantasy with interesting characters.   The main characters are well developed and very likable.  In addition, the author shows how to use a variety of different magical systems to create interesting situations.  If you don't like fantasy and like to see magic used in a good way, read this book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:     Read this book and was impressed by the amount of information you got on the topic of this book (I was an undergrad at the time, the time of the Vietnam war). The author seems knowledgeable and easy to read. The book covers a huge amount of territory and is full of excellent information about the different places on earth and the different cultures that have thrived there over time, and why. It is well written and interesting. The author does take a few liberties in the research and conclusions, but in my opinion he is only doing so because it is a good story to tell. If you haven't heard of a place (or have been there, but not visited it), it is highly recommended. Highly recommended. - Jennifer - September 15, 2016 Great book about some of the world's most interesting cultures  Reviewer: A reader - favorite favorite favorite - January 29, 2014  Subject: Good read but a bit much at times   I read this book a few years ago. I felt that it was a well researched book, but that I had more to learn about each culture, the history of each one.   The author is a journalist who spent time in the field, so this book doesn't give a good overview of each culture. The research on the subject is well done but the writing is rather too short and to the point.  , I think I know better now about the cultures I visited in Cambodia. The people I met were interesting, but they weren't really easy to understand. I have always been fascinated by the cultures of the Pacific Rim, so I enjoyed reading this book.It doesn't cover all the countries in South East Asia and Asia, and it doesn't go into much detail about each one, but there are some interesting tidbits about the culture of the Japanese. The Philippines are also mentioned here, but their culture seems to be a bit like Taiwan, I have a hard time following it. I will try to read a book about Taiwan in the future, but for now I think it was more interesting to see the cultures and people on the other side of the globe.I readthis book a several years ago and I feel the same way now. The writing was a bit too short for my taste, I felt the author was trying to cram in all the important info he had about each country. For example, he talks about a particular culture's cuisine but does not really go into the specifics about how it was prepared
Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife has been asking me about this book since we started dating. She says that there are very few books like this one on how to win with a woman. She liked it.   I just had to see how it all turns out. I really enjoyed this book and I think it will be interesting to see where we end up.

It is a book that's easy to understand and I loved it.   - A review of " A Thousand Years of Solitude "   You have to know the characters to fully appreciate the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't believe how long this took me. It's almost like a great detective novel with a twist - it's not until the end that you realize what's really going on. I love this book and I wish I knew it when I was a kid. :)  Review was helpful to a friend: "Well it took a long time but i really did enjoy it! I read a review that said it's "an amazing read" and "the perfect book for my teen read" i'd agree. i was 15 when i started it. now 16 i find the language to be very adult and at the same time very childlike. which is the best in this book. i also felt the book was well-written and was enjoyable, so i'm glad i read it :) "
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that when I first read it, I thought I was being fooled, but I have found it to be quite the other way around. I'm a bit of a bookworm, which makes sense. However, I am also very critical of things in my life. I have always tried to think about what I can do to make a difference in this world. This book has made me wonder if I'm being too critical. I don't think so. The main character has a gift, and this gift causes problems. This is the kind of thing I look for, but if this book is a lie, then a lot of people I know would have a hard time believing me as well. I'd recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of Philip K. Dick. - J.M.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book and it was an amazing read. The story is very well done and the characters are interesting. I also really liked how the author did not focus on sex but on the characters, their feelings about each other and the relationship they have built.   My husband has been begging me to read this for years now. This was a great read and well worth the time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I've been wanting to read this one for a while, but was afraid that it would be the same old same old, which is a major turn off for me (I love the Dresden Files and have read quite a few of the others too). Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this story is very different from what I expected. Not only is this a good standalone, but the Dresdenverse is still quite interesting and is one of my favorite universes ever!"
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book, well written and very informative about the war in Afghanistan. It is a good read for all students and anyone interested in history. The book is very comprehensive and covers a lot of ground.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been waiting for a good, fun novel set in my world for a long time. The characters are fun, the stories are great.   It really makes the world feel a lot more real, in my opinion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first chapter has a good start. The author really tries to explain the mechanics of combat, and it is very detailed. But I am not sure if he is really teaching what he is talking about. The second chapter has some good ideas about the player's attributes, but the third chapter is a waste of space. The first part of the chapter is talking how to control your character. There is some good advice about the difference between the good and evil characters, about how you can make your character better through the use of abilities, about the various skills. But the best bit is the fourth part which is about what you should do in a situation, and what you are supposed to do in such a situation. What's the point in doing anything when you know you have no chance of success? The first half is very interesting. The bad guys have the advantage, and the players have to fight to survive, but I found the chapter very confusing. The third part is much more interesting, but still very confusing and not the best advice. I did not understand what I was supposed to be doing, what I should have done instead, what my character would have done in the situation, or what the point was of the quest. There are so many examples of things that are wrong, that I can't even finish reading the book because I kept thinking "I need to know that." I know there is a lot more that can be said about the mechanics and the rules, but this book had an enormous impact on my mind.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read three of these already, and so far it's always been a fun read. A nice surprise, too.   The setting is familiar and intriguing: a fictional version of Chicago from the 1920's. The story, by the way, is set in a small, midwestern town, but one where people are actually concerned about the current economic climate. The characters are quirky and fun and well-drawn. This is a story worth reading and getting into.  The narrator is great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I are the oldest of four siblings. We have always loved children but we didn't want our own until our parents gave us a puppy about eight years ago. This book filled the void that we needed. My husband is a very practical man and loves to do anything for a fair price but my husband has never met a book he liked better than this one.   I would not hesitate to recommend this book to my children for Christmas presents. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book  I really loved this story.   It really made me think about what the real world is like for a kid in a foreign country who doesn't know how to play basketball.  It was a great story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is compelling, if you have seen the film, and has the same sort of "magic" to it. The characters are not as well drawn as in the film but that may be because the book was written years ago, as the author seems to be out of print. If you have the book, don't waste your money.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A new and excellent book for students.    The authors have taken an approach that will take the students out of the classroom and into the world through an introduction to the basic scientific principles.  The book includes the most important concepts for developing critical thinking and communicating with others, and this is a must for all students.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The narrator is just right for this type of book. You can tell that the author knows what he is talking about. The tone is a bit dark, but the story and the characters make it worth the reading. It is written in a way that will be accessible to many people, but is a little on the intense side.  This book is available in audio as well as print.

Write a positive review about a good book:      What made this book worthwhile?    The book tells us a lot about the origins of the Bible from its birth through the Reformation, but it doesn't tell us much about the Bible in its later history. It gives a good overview of the early Jewish and Christian literature, but the discussion ends after about a hundred pages of biblically-oriented history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book quite a bit. The style is different enough to give a "taste" without having to actually read it. The characters, including the boy, were a delight. The story was entertaining and I'm looking forward to next month's book when it arrives. I'll certainly be reading it again!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this is a very useful, very well written book, that can definitely be useful to the newbie in any number of ways.   This book will provide a solid understanding of basic electronics, and a decent understanding of the electronics of computers and the software, programming and programming languages in which they are used.  I am not sure that this book will be of much use to an engineer looking for some general background, although for a general electronics enthusiast it could certainly be useful.  I give this a 4/5
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, along with the book in question, are both excellent. I've always found that I can't stand some stories in fantasy.   "Eternal Winter" is one of those. It's a fantasy epic about the fall of a kingdom. But more importantly, it's about love, loyalty, love of one's people and how love makes people strong.  The story is told in the first person, the story being told is about the protagonist, and the story itself is a love story. It also deals with a bit of a political subplot about the king and the rebels. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of these types of books, and I had a lot of fun reading this one. The author does a great job of showing just how much the average woman thinks of herself. I'm not sure how well the book would be marketed to men since some of the concepts and words could easily be misconstrued. I think it would be better marketed to female and female-identified readers. This book is definitely worth a read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm an elementary school teacher who is in a marriage in which my husband has a significant intellectual disability. I find the book incredibly well written and researched. I feel that all of the facts and details are accurate and have been validated by the disability rights movement. The book includes many good points that I don't believe have been mentioned in the disability communities. The author's analysis of his own experience in this field is very clear and the language and presentation are great. I am also quite impressed by the author's ability to present complex medical issues in a way that is both understandable and understandable to readers who have never been in a similar situation. I have found the book extremely helpful for communicating with my husband about what we do and how he is doing it. I would highly recommend this book to any family with a disabled person.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've enjoyed the first half of the book: it has a great plot, and has a strong characterisation of a lot of people, but there are some flaws. The story starts well enough, but then the main characters lose focus and lose track of things. This causes them to lose things that they would otherwise keep track of: the people they know, the things they find in the world, the goals they have and the motivations for getting there. This is the major problem. Also, the writing style is a bit inconsistent and is very slow, which is annoying. It seems that this has been done before, but is slow and drags on, so it's a very minor issue. Overall, this is a good, but slow first half. The second half however is much more interesting: there are a lot more characters and the plot moves.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I've already been a fan of Houghton Mifflin and this book was a perfect follow up to a really good first novel by Mifflins.     I like how they made this book very lighthearted and humorous.   As the narrator explains the events at the camp, I felt that she was relaying the events to the reader rather than trying to portray them herself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the way the story is told, and the story ends on a cliffhanger.   I love how the story was told.  There is a lot to think about in the plot, and it was very well done.  I am definitely going to read the sequel as soon as the author's return to writing is announced.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second I've read of this series but it's still as good as the first. The protagonist, Nika, finds herself on the wrong side of the law when the police discover she is pregnant and in search of a way to escape. She becomes a fugitive with the help of the best friends she has ever had and the help she gets from the two very strange men, Mr. and Mr. Hickey. It's a mystery novel with a twist but what the twist is you won't see coming. And there's always a twist! I was really looking forward to reading this book but unfortunately, this time I had to put it down.  Nika is pregnant with twins and Mr Hickey has a drug problem.   I had high hopes that this story would be another winner in this series and if so, it was a huge let down. A lot of the characters and the world seem a little too real and it makes you want to scream. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing because it doesn't leave me wanting to read anything else. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would recommend this to anyone. I loved it! There are a couple of things I liked, like the art and the action sequences, but a few more things I had issues with (mostly the dialogue). In all, this is a really good book and a great way to introduce readers to the characters and setting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was very interesting and well thought out. My friend and I were both intrigued by the idea and we decided to read it after we had some free time. It is very fun to listen to what people have to say about the book. I would recommend it to anyone interested in psychology or science fiction, especially to those interested in how the mind works. I hope there is a sequel as it is one of those books I can look forward to every year or two.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have recently re-read this book and have found that I have enjoyed it as much as I did the first time around. I think that the author did a good job of writing a detailed and readable historical account of how the Jewish-Zionist community was affected by the Holocaust.  The book deals primarily with the activities of the so-called Yiddish Enlightenment group which, although they called themselves Zionist, did not have any real interest in Israel.   The author discusses the history of Zionism from its inception in the first part of the nineteenth century to the founding of Israel in 1948 and how the Yiddishes played an important role in this process.  This has been discussed at length in books like "Blessed Is the State of Israel: Jewish Identity and the Zionist Idea" (2005), but here the author shows a more in-depth understanding of the Yid group.  He gives his readers a good overview of the various Jewish-Yiddish intellectual movements that existed prior to World War I and how Zionism came to be perceived by the Yids.    He also gives a good summary of how Zionist groups reacted to the Holocaust and the political changes that were happening in Europe.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent collection of poetry and fiction. The poetry is great, and the stories are also very well done. If you like fantasy or the paranormal, you will enjoy reading this book. There is more about the book in this review, including my review of the first edition of the book. My rating is 2.5 stars.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must have for any student with a serious interest in the humanities.   The book is packed with interesting data and examples for the aspiring researcher.  I've been reading a lot of reviews about this book - so far, a good review about one or two reviews.  My initial review was about the introduction to the book - the first chapter.  I had to read it again for clarification on some of the points made and then read a couple more reviews after that for further clarifications and examples.  The second chapter is about the topics of the book and the third and fourth chapters were a bit of a disappointment to me.  I had read some of what the reviewers wrote about them - they were very informative and I had a lot to digest.  This book is about humanistic studies, specifically in the fields of history, literature, art, and religion.  The sections were really a bit dry, not the kind of sections that can really make a difference in the quality of a book.  Part of the reason for this was the fact that the book was a compilation of a few papers and they were not written by a single person.  It is clear that the author has an agenda and is trying to make the case for humanities at the university level in a way that may be controversial and not in the most useful way.  But I do think the ideas in this book are still very much worth trying out - the book is quite interesting and can be highly informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely loved this book. It takes the format of a horror anthology and gives each one a little bit of its own flavor. The author really knows how to make the stories stand out, from the very first scene to the end. The stories are very well written and the author does a great job of keeping things interesting. The best part about this anthology is that I'm going to be reading at least one other book by this author in the future!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have really enjoyed The Last Samurai. The writing is easy and the book is really well-written.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I would rate this book very highly if I could. It was a fun and engaging read that I enjoyed immensely. It really was a great read that made me laugh out loud, cried, cried and cried again.   It was funny, heartfelt, and made me sad at times. This book was so good, I ended up reading it over a day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult. She was a wonderful writer, who also had a heart of gold. She made us love the world she wrote about.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of "How to Live a Good Life" and "Why Happiness is the Best Product of All Time." If you're not a big reader (or fan of books), you may want to avoid "Why Happy People Do Bad Things" since it is filled with bad information and examples. I liked it when I first heard about "The Art of Happiness," but it seems like you can't make any of your bad habits sound good, so I will be passing it by. Good book, though! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you liked this book and want to read it again, get it in ebook format. There are no ads for this book but it is very well put together. And you will never know how good you've really got it until you try it.  I highly recommend this book:  If you enjoy good sci-fi novels, I highly recommend you check out The Book of the New Sun. It's by Frank Herbert and it's one of my favorites in the whole sci-fantasy canon. It's a good read all around. As a sidenote, I was looking up the author's book reviews and came across one that's very similar to my favorite series. I think it's pretty funny. Weird, but awesome: I came across a review for this that makes it sound like a big deal and this guy didn't read it. And he was right. It does make a nice change from a lot of what's out there.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   It was written by the author of the "Crow Road" series which I found very interesting.  I love the style of writing.  It's not as easy to read as some of the more recent series by the same author.  The prose was very good and I enjoyed it.  However, I can't say that I could tell where the story was going from a few pages in. The pacing of this book left me wondering and not knowing what was going to happen next.  Overall, this was a good read but I don't think it's going to be my book of the summer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   ... The book is worth the read for the plot and the characterization. While this is an "all-ages" book, there are a number of adult situations that readers of both genders may enjoy, including the "accident" (as the story is told through the eyes of a toddler). Also, the author provides useful advice about avoiding some common problems such as diaper rash, ear problems, and nail biting. A definite recommendation, for both children and adults. -D.L., New Mexico, USA
Write a positive review about a good book:     A wonderful story about a young woman named Lucy and her father, a World War II veteran who has a great love for his daughter.   In a time of depression and war, Lucy is a bit naive but her father is more of a realist.  Her father was raised by a single mother who could not even speak English and was not really supportive of him.  After losing her brother in the war, her father felt abandoned and became a "bad man" who was "befriending" women who were already married to other men.  He also took a fancy to a young black girl, Lucy.  His love of his daughter and her acceptance by her mother is so admirable that I cried a bit.  I also really liked the ending.  A good and memorable story about the woman's choices and the man's choices. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " A superb work. It's the sort of story that a kid (or adult) would be delighted to see written, even though I'm not one.   It's a story of love, loss, and a girl who goes through the changes of puberty in the span of a year.  For a kid.  I have a book that tells the same story, but I never imagined a book would tell a story like this, and it does it so well.  This is one of those books I'll always have.  It will stay with me, and I'll be grateful for it every time I need a dose of nostalgia. " --A.L., Toronto, Canada, January 11, 2003
Write a positive review about a good book:   My parents used to have this little book in their kitchen, just a piece of paper with a picture of a baby on it. I liked reading this, because it taught me how to be a good person. I had a chance to read this one before I moved to a new town. I can now imagine my own mother using the "do right by the little ones" idea to help teach me about helping others and not judging people by the color of their skin, because I know how much it hurts people to feel like that. I also learned that all people are really like this one baby in a little world, and it's okay to love people regardless of what they look like.   5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm looking forward to reading this book, and would love to get a copy of "The Unbelievers" for myself for Christmas! It's such a nice read, and I'm glad to see that we're still able to discuss this topic in public. It'll be nice to read something other than the usual apologetics (e.g. 'The Bible is the best book on the face of the earth!') to be entertained by the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a fan of the first book in this series, The Windup Girl. The second book, Windup Action, was fun and enjoyable. The third, Wind Up Girl 2, had more of the usual "action" type of story that is found in most science fiction. The story is interesting, but is somewhat predictable at times. The characters are well developed, but it isn't enough to get you hooked. Overall, a good read, just not my cup of tea.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My son was very pleased with this book. He asked for a book like this one before he was born, and now that he's a boy he's just as eager to read about his father's experiences. He liked the idea of writing a memoir instead of taking a family portrait from his mother's or father's side of the family. He loved the fact that his father has come to be seen as an important and significant figure in the family's life, which is quite a contrast to the way it was for most of his life. Overall I thought it was very positive. I was surprised by some of the details included in the book. The fact that he was a soldier and not a marine did not feel quite right to me, though my husband thought it would be interesting. As for my son, he loved the illustrations. He did say at the end that he liked it best when the illustrations were from his own perspective, and I think that's probably accurate. I do wonder if the illustrations should be placed more towards the back of the book or not. Overall, I thought this was a good little book that he will love to look through. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book! It is a good description of the early years of Christianity, but doesn't delve into too many issues like some authors might do. The author clearly has a clear message and does not shy away from dealing with issues that need to be dealt with. In my opinion, I believe the book is well written and that the author is a well-respected authority on the period. A good read!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love all the books in this series by Terry Goodkind and all of his stories are great. I love the style of this book but not necessarily this book. I mean it has some really great stories about the history of the world in a very scientific way that I love. The plot is kind of a little over the top at times but still good and well written.   This was a great book to start off with but not the best story. I would definitely suggest this book if you're looking for a good science fiction read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book, " The Way We Get By" by E.B. White, in late 1990, and I am a huge fan of this author. It is a very realistic account of African-American life, with a strong focus on work, family, education and the law. I have read a few books by white authors, but I have not come across this type of book in that genre. It has been an eye-opener and I really like the book a lot. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book a while back to read it, as it was recommended by a friend, but when I tried to start the book my tablet went into the recovery mode and couldn't get past Chapter 1.   In addition, the chapters are written in a very short, terse fashion, which really annoyed me as it made the book feel more like an encyclopedia.  Still, it is very short at just over 250 pages, so it was very easy to finish.  This book has got to be one of the best fantasy books out there, not just in the genre of fantasy, but the overall genre as well.  The author is also known for his short stories (and no, this isn't the first one) which I am sure will be read and enjoyed by many readers as well as by me!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it's the right thing to do, if you are really into fantasy. I found that the plot was not as good as other series. Still, I do want to keep reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:   So after this whole 'confrontation' with the priest about the money and the abuse, I finally gave up the fight to not give the money away. After reading the book, I knew that whatever I was feeling was unfounded, that I was not the bad person in this situation, but rather was suffering from a very common problem in relationships - i.e. the person in the relationship did not believe in himself/herself. After this epiphany, I became more aware of the negative things that he/she was saying, and how it was affecting me, the couple, etc. I began to take things seriously, and realized that the priest had been misinterpreting my words. I was very angry, but also relieved. I also felt that I could trust that the people in my life would not be so easily led astray by a man/woman who I believe to be a charlatan.   My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book and it's a wonderful story. I like the idea of it and the way it was told. I'm sure there are some plot holes (for example, why would someone in the military have a pet bird? I think that's kind of silly too. Also, why did he want to join the Marines when he graduated high school and couldn't go because he was so short? He coulda gotten into Harvard, or whatever. I've read a few books about this and they are not all that interesting.) But, it's good and enjoyable and I will read it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read for all ages that's not too complicated. The art and plot are really well done. I don't know if I've read this before, but the premise is fantastic! The characters are very well done and they grow as the story progresses.   I found the book to be very funny. The author manages to bring a whole lot of humor out of the very serious topic of murder. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my first foray into reading books by young authors, and I am absolutely thrilled by the book.   I loved the character of Pansy Parkinson, and the romance between her and her fiance, Peter.  I hope to see them get together someday.  The book was well-written, and it was very engaging from start to finish. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   You may also like: The "N" word I just can't get over I just could not get over the comments of the women who said "This book was so good, I just had to have it". It made me so upset and so disappointed. This was a poorly written book, the writing just doesn't match the quality of the stories. The author seems to have no respect for her own work and I don't think she even read the book. This isn't a good review as the main problem is that I don't think it deserved 5 stars. I will reread it as it's not too late.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one that really gets me excited about all kinds of cool things that can be done with 3D printing.   I read an earlier review of this book saying that it's not really about 3D printed robots, but rather it's more about creating robots from real life things like cars, bikes and other machines.  I think that's actually a pretty good way to put it.  This is a very good book for both the beginner and the expert.  It's a book that's got a lot to say about the various things you can do with 3d printing and a lot of ideas on how to go about doing some of the things that the book talks about.  The author takes some of these ideas and applies them to a wide variety of things, from working with cars to the development of 3d printers to the creation of custom jewelry.  That's something that's probably always been a dream for me, but the more I think about it the more it makes sense.  If you were to ask me "what is the coolest thing that you've ever done with your 3d printer" I'd have to tell you that I've created some 3d printed custom jewelry to display on my wedding day.  So it's a fun book that I'll probably revisit over and over again for years to come.  Recommended!
Write a positive review about a good book:   My parents bought a copy of this book for me. I was thrilled to find an honest story about family, love, friendship and even a bit of humor.   This is a must read for all who love a good story about good people in a bad situation.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book with great illustrations and a story to go with it.   The illustrations were superb, the story interesting, the illustrations very clear, and the characters well drawn.  I liked the main character, and his little sister.  He likes his little girl very much, and it showed.  The story was interesting, but too long for one book.  If I read it again, I'd like to know more about the world that they are from.

Write a positive review about a good book:    *   *   To put it simply, I love this book. It's one of the best short fiction stories I've ever read. The main character is a pretty, but slightly arrogant teenage girl, and she's one step away from discovering her true calling in life: she's actually a ninja.  The main plot of the story is very simple: A few friends of hers invite a "ninja" to spend the weekend with them, and the ninja is in no mood to agree to this, so they send a group of guys (the "gang") after the girl and get her to come with them (she doesn't want to do it, but the guys seem very interested in her). But as you might guess, things don't go as planned, and things don't go as well as they hoped for either. The characters are all fairly complex and fun, and I found the dialogue pretty funny as well (one of the reasons I keep buying this series). The plot is rather short, but I enjoyed the story, the characters, the plot, and just the whole experience of reading this short story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the few great reads this year that wasn't in the science fiction genre, "The Black Tapes" is a fascinating look at an unsolved murder case that goes all the way to the top of the FBI.   "A riveting read and one I will be listening to." —SJHJ "Comes to a satisfying end." —LJU "Absolutely riveting, chilling, a must-read." —Carol R.  "The case is so intriguing I'd be willing to bet it was solved by this time next year. A well written novel, and very exciting reading." —MRS. G "The book tells a tale that's as suspenseful as it is compelling, the events and clues are intriguing, the characters are complex, and the prose is a lot of fun." —T. L. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first half of the book is a lot like the first half. It's about the struggle between a powerful and corrupt government and the people fighting for freedom. It has a lot of the feel of a "coming of age" story, and the characters are as believable as the people in the first part of the novel.   One of my favorite parts of this book are the scenes with the police. The way they get caught is hilarious, and they try to cover up their tracks. It makes me laugh just thinking about it.  If you enjoyed the first book in this series, you will definitely enjoy this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    What a good and interesting book. Very entertaining and a good read. I enjoy the style of this book very much.    Review: This book is excellent. It is one of the best science fiction novels in recent years. The author has created a truly amazing and realistic space ship. We're not talking about the boring space ships in the movie but the good old-fashioned space ship which is real and authentic.  You can also understand why there is so much interest in this book in this year and what it could mean for the future of the space craft. I can say that I don't think I'm alone in this interest.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book as a "giveaway" from a website I'm not familiar with, so don't know much about, but I loved it. The narrator, the author's wife, is great. She doesn't repeat herself too often, but you get an impression of her. The characters were well-developed and well-drawn. And it made me happy to hear that there are sequels to this book.   This book was one of the better stories I read in 2016. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a few weeks back. It was a really fun read. It's a bit funny and has a few good moments and a couple bad. However, the main character, the one who seems to be the most disturbed, isn't actually the problem in this book at all. The problem is a lot more the people around the protagonist who are supposed to help, and just don't care about the problems the protagonist is having. I thought the ending was really bad and was wondering if they even had a good ending to this book. I was definitely not expecting to like this book, but it was a good, fun read, and I'm sure I'm going to read more of this book in the future.  19 of 20 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been following this book since the author wrote it and it is a very good book. It is well-written and clear, but at the same time very down-to-earth. It will appeal to those who like to read historical novels about the civil war.   Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - The characters are good and the plot is interesting, but the author has to be careful of the words in the titles to be clear about what is going on, and that can be a real problem. The action and the world are good, but it takes a while to get there. If this book did not take so long to read, I would have given it a higher rating, but I wanted the ending to be a little more satisfactory. But overall I really enjoyed the story, and the characters. A good read for the lovers of fantasy with a twist (not really, but that's what it's about). - The only problems I have with this book are the plot elements (which are not really relevant, because the whole book is a twist, even if it's not an obvious one) and the fact that this is a children's book. My husband and I loved this book, but his 5-year-old son (a huge fan of Harry Potter) hates it. - My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The best historical novel I've read in a long time." What did you like best about this book? What didn't you like? How did the ending make you feel? I'm going to be talking a lot more about The Last Castle from now on because the whole story is excellent, but I also want to talk a little about this one because I enjoyed reading it and because it was a little different from the other books I've been reading lately.  This book is set in the 13th century in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund I.   I'm not going to give away too much about the plot, so just read the first few pages and you'll know.  It's all about a young, handsome young man (Sigismund) who comes of age during the war between the French and English in France in the 1300's and then goes off to Italy to become a knight and then a general.  This is a very romantic book about a man's life and his love of the women around him.  When I read it I was hoping for some real drama because I love the French war in my youth (I know, this is so early in my adult life, but it still fascinates me) but it wasn't a lot of drama and the romance, well, I think it got somewhat tired to me.  The main problem with this book was that it took forever to get started and by the time you got to the first page it was too late.  I was still waiting for the "oh crap, this book's a bit slow and the characters aren't very interesting" to come through, but no such luck.  Anyway, if you are looking for a romantic story with the intrigue of real war, well this one will probably not disappoint.  For a real romance, there were very few.  If you love romance, this one isn't for you, but if you like real warfare, and intrigue, and adventure, this may be just what you are in the mood for.  Overall, it was good, but not great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is a really good book, and very educational.   We learned a lot about some common myths about the American Revolution, particularly on what we call "man of war."   Some of the information from this book, especially about the French, is extremely interesting, and really gives insight to some of the events of the war that we don't get in school.  If you haven't read this book yet, get it, and don't let the fact that it's a WWII book put you off. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was really a joy to read. the story is good, the characters are interesting. there are lots of things which you can do in this book - for instance, I read about how the Chinese are different from the Japanese and that this was because of a cultural barrier which was not really a problem for the Japanese. I also liked the description of the Chinese cultural differences which the author gave. there were a lot of interesting things to think about which I am sure I could do in the future by reading another book like this one.   Good for children:     I liked this book  I will read more about this book soon!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read The Little Drummer Girl a number of times now. First time I read it I was very surprised because it sounded like an easy read. I'd even read about it. I thought that the story itself was really interesting. I couldn't help but think, what makes the author do this? A good book doesn't just come along and tell you what to think of it, or what it's about. It is about a boy, but it isn't just a story about a kid. The story, which is about 6 pages in, describes how the boys band in the early part of the 20th century were treated by the women in the band. It's about what makes a person good and not bad, who they are and who they've become, and the importance of the community. It was a very interesting read. The main characters are so well done. The boys and the women are really well done and the story is so engaging. You won't be disappointed if you read this.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the reason why I got into reading in the first place.  This is a good story that gives a solid sense of place.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first heard that Stephen King was going to publish an edition of one of his short stories, I had high hopes for it. I'm not sure if I really expected much of a response, but I suppose I hoped that he would write a new, more original version that would be as much a new book as the original, but also something different.   And I'm glad he did.  The story in the introduction is a bit of a downer, but it isn't a downner for the reader.  It's the introduction itself that is interesting, the book is structured like a novel but there are two characters that are not major plot lines (although some minor ones are discussed).   The one character is a boy named Paul who goes to high school with Dean, a girl named Karen, and a guy named Charlie.  Paul and Dean are friends, and Paul and Karen are both in the same class. Karen, Paul, and Charlie all meet up and have a very romantic adventure.  While the story is fun, I think that King makes a good case for the more literary approach by having the girl characters go on a quest and get in trouble with the school, then meet up with Paul and Charlie.     While there are some interesting details and situations here, I wasn't able to get enough out of the story to be excited to read the rest of it.  King does use some "quirky" language here, but there's a lot more going on than just a lot of "gimmicks."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book! I've read several other science fiction books, and most were more about science fiction, rather than what I'd consider to be science, but I really do like this book. This is the first book I've come across that actually talks about the human potential to do things we aren't born to do, like create, change, and shape reality. It's not as if a lot of sci-fi doesn't address these issues, but what I like is that it actually does so in a way that is relevant to the reader (rather than just some other book). It's a nice book to read on those days when you don't want to do something that seems so daunting.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very very good, a very nice story. It took me about a year to finish the story, it's a good one to read, and the characters all have their own little nuances, like a real family.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got an ebook copy of this book from my library. The book is a wonderful primer on the fundamentals of chess - from the basics to playing at higher levels, including playing a live simul, and a chess book for everyone.   My only real gripe is that the chapter on playing a simul was written by Paul Karpov.  This is a great book for beginners, but don't expect a deep theoretical explanation.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book as a gift for my sister after I read that the author had a doctorate in molecular biology from Harvard University. Well, here it is: a fascinating, intelligent, readable book which you can learn something from, and still get a good idea of the process of molecular biology.   The book is divided into four parts: a history of life on Earth, a description of the formation of nucleosomes, the development of nucleotides in the laboratory, and the study of the molecular basis of disease and repair.  A highly readable book by a Nobel Laureate, which is an even better surprise than I was expecting. I hope that this book can be of some help to a young scientist.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book thinking I would like the "science fiction" aspect of the book, but I was pretty disappointed when I read the book. It was an ok book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Great book. The characters are all well drawn and are very believable. The storyline is extremely good. I'd recommend this book highly."   -- J.L., from Boston, MA   "The book was interesting from start to finish. As usual, the author is very descriptive of the events that occur in the book. It's a good read for a good laugh."   it has been written that a tale of a thief and his adventures should begin at an inn where he met the girl of his dreams. The inn is called the Golden Door, and its owner is The Fool, a withered old man who likes to sit at the bar and have a drink when there is nobody else around. The Fool also has a son, a boy who is not wise to the ways of the world. The boy grows up to become The Thief, a thief who knows all about things that are not meant to be known. The thief is, in fact, a wise man--a "wise old man"--who knows that he must keep his "hidden treasure" to himself. He knows, for instance, that there is no treasure that doesn't belong to someone, that if a thief steals a purse from a rich woman, it will end up in the hands of an evil man. To his great regret, The Thief has come to realize that most men don't care whether the "treasure" belongs to them or someone else. But there is one man who would, if he knew. The Thief meets The Fool in his office at the Golden door, where he steals a beautiful golden cup to keep it from going to the "wise" man's daughter. Then The Thief is called away by his wife, and he must find his own way to the city, across a very treacherous path, with a large sum of money in his pockets and a great deal at stake. The book is set in the 19th century. In the United States, The Golden Door Inn is still run by the Fool's son, the only family member to ever keep the secret of his father's identity. And, as in the books of the series, The Fool's daughter is very proud of her father's accomplishments and the great things he's accomplished. The reader will get a feel for what it is like to live in the American Wild West when The Thief visits the Old West. (The Fool's name comes from a real man: "I was called The Fool because I
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I was reading this book, I was having a lot of fun and really thought the book would be a real challenge for me to do well. However, the book really isn't very difficult, if you want a good story and easy to follow, than this book is a great book to read!   In short, the story starts with the protagonist's childhood. Her parents are divorced (her mother lives in a small town and her father is a billionaire, she has never seen her father before) so the family goes to live in a large mansion called the Blue Sky. This is where the story begins and continues from there. The story is told from the viewpoint of the protagonist and her friends, the five girls of her childhood: A is a bookworm and a bit of a dork and C is an only child (also a book worm) D is shy and clumsy and E is a tomboy and adventurous G is the most athletic of the five and is also the most caring for her younger siblings.   A:    I actually enjoyed this book because it was so well written that I found the story to be interesting, I actually thought there was a lot to this story.  The book has some great scenes and interesting writing but the book doesn't really do anything new. There are some interesting points made about love and how it affects people's lives but it wasn't as well written as the rest of the book. The main reason why the book is so good is because the writing was done by the author herself:  The author does have a talent for writing well written stories and the story really is well written and it makes the characters more likable and well developed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book a lot. I have been reading about other cultures in a few of the many books and books on the subject. This book was very interesting and educational. I like the idea that people from some different cultures (the Arabs and the Israelis) have some kind of unique values, but these are still very different from the Western world. The Arab people are very religious and are very careful with their money and property. I don't know how often I will have to travel to a place like this. I was very impressed with the Arabs who seem to have a great respect for their women and I thought that was very good. It also seems to me that some Arab cultures are more strict with their religion than others. It is hard to believe that the Arab countries don't have very many Jewish people, especially in Cairo and Jerusalem. I think it's mainly because of the lack of contact with them that it seems that Jews have a much lower status than most other Arab countries. I didn't learn anything about the Arabs that I didn.t already know. All I learned is that they are a more "traditional" people and seem to enjoy life a lot more than I thought they would. I had a lot of fun reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a good reader with an open mind you'll really enjoy this book. The author did a great job of bringing out the strengths of each character and giving each a purpose. I particularly liked the interactions between her mother and sister and her younger sister. I'd recommend this book to anybody with a similar viewpoint of life and who enjoys a good story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a while ago but didn't buy it until recently. I was in the middle of the zombie apocalypse and it was the perfect time to read this zombie book. Not all of the book is about zombies, and there is a lot of horror. I liked the zombie concept and the characters were likable. The ending was disappointing, and the last half of the story has a lot more of a "no you can't" feel, but I still like it and would recommend it to anyone who likes zombies, especially those who don't like zombies.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A novel. As I have read a couple of times and enjoyed them, I have to say that this book is very well written, not only by a great writer, but also by a very nice man and a very good person. I read this book while on a family vacation in Vermont, and the trip just went by, as if I wasn't there, when I got home. I couldn't put it down, because it was just so good. "This book is about a young couple who are visiting the home of their mother's family in the Catskills, New York." Wow, that's a lot of words to type, but this is my first review for a book that I have not yet read. I will say this about the author: He is a good person with a very loving and kind heart. In this book, he has created a tale so lovely and touching that I cannot put this book down even though I have been waiting for weeks for the mail man to bring me another book! I would like to give this book a star, but there is not enough to do so, because the story doesn't end. It never will, and I think that this is a great work of fiction, and this is what a novel should be like, it should have so much character and story to explore. I have already reread the book, and it is still so good, I am already thinking about the sequel, which is what I should have done when I read it first. I am looking forward to the book because it has so much more to say, I can see what the author plans to do with the story. I think this is one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read, and will recommend it to anyone who is a lover of literature. I just hope that this one isn't the last. I'm looking forward for next year's books to see if he will write more. The only problem is that I read another one of his books this past year, that I really wanted to recommend, but I couldn...

Write a positive review about a good book:    I would never buy a book like this just to read it, but it's an entertaining read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   " The book was a good introduction to understanding the theory of non-locality, and a good discussion of the concept of locality as it is related to local motion, as the motion of a particle can be explained in terms of its distance to other particles." --Paul Steinhardt "The book is a good primer on locality and locality motion. It is good enough that a graduate student in the same area of physics might use it as a resource. Highly recommended." --Richard W. Strahler, University of Rochester "This book is excellent for anyone interested in the philosophical and scientific foundations of nonlocal quantum effects, or in the foundations of quantum computation. I found it to be a very good introduction, although there were some minor points I found wanting, although I found that these were the fault of the author not the book." --Rudolf von Neumann, IBM Fellow and Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Princeton University "The text is well structured, and very accessible to a first-time author. If someone has some background in nonlocal physics, he should enjoy this book, which makes a thorough introduction to nonlocal effects." --Michael F. Gernon, Massachusetts Institute of Technology "It is a great read! It was my first nonlocal book, and I was amazed at how much the concepts stayed with me. I think it would be a good choice for a nonlocality tutorial, and it is a very interesting topic." --Robert C. Brown, University at Buffalo "This text will be useful to anyone who has ever tried to understand nonlocal phenomena, and who wants to understand quantum physics in a more natural way. It covers the key issues of locality and localization, as well as locality motion (and locality time). It also discusses some of the more controversial aspects of nonlocal effects." -James Tardos, MIT
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a bit of a history nerd and am fascinated by how the world got the way it is today, but the book did a fantastic job exploring the different ideologies that have shaped our society.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a few issues with this book but then I picked it up. The book started off with an interesting story about a couple of young men who are having a lot of sex and thinking they are having some great sex. Then they go on vacation and the young men are not the same. I can understand why they got so addicted to sex and it was hard for them to think about sex as just sex because they were losing their own sexual identity. The young men were still having sex but they were having sex to get other people to be with them. They were not having sex with people they loved. I thought the book was interesting and a fun read. I am hoping that we can all be able to stop thinking about sex and having it for sex, for its own sake.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had no idea what to expect from The Last Samurai when I first heard about it, but it turned out to be one of the best books of 2012.  I was so intrigued by the concept that I wanted to read the whole book, and I'm glad I did.   The story focuses on a young samurai named Setsuo.  He leaves his village at the age of fourteen and joins a band of samurai called the Sanada.  They are a rag tag group who don't have much in the way of weapons and technology.  There are few rules to the group.  The Sanada is basically a bunch of disaffected samurai trying to save their land and their families from the invading army of Takeda Tatsuzou.  It's a great little story, with characters who are interesting and dynamic.  You can definitely tell that this book takes place in feudal Japan, and not the modern world of Japan.  While the characters are unique, there are some obvious historical stereotypes, and they aren't always funny.  But that's okay.  Although the characters and plot are unique and interesting, the book doesn't have a ton of originality.  One of my favorite things about the book is how there are a lot of character archetypes that can be used to write stories about a variety of genres.  It makes you think about what kind of stories you'd like to read.  I think I found a new favorite book in The Last Shogun!   One thing I didn't like about the story was how the characters were stereotyped as being good and honorable.  Most of the story takes place on the battlefield, which means we're often told that all the characters in the book are heroic and have their moral codes clearly defined.  However, the story itself isn't that great.  Sometimes the plot just doesn't feel very well-developed.  Also, the end of the book leaves things a little bit unclear.  In the end, I think that The Last Sanada has potential as a story of a samurai group on the front line against Takedas.  And the main character, Setsuo, is a good enough protagonist to make this book worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only complaint I have about this book is that, like my other reviewers, I was frustrated to discover that so much of the information in this book was already known to most readers by now. The book is just too long (almost three times as long as it needs to be) to be totally satisfactory as a complete account of the Holocaust. My main complaint was that, even with the additional information supplied by Mr. Berenbaum, he was still only able to provide a small glimpse into the Holocaust as it happened, even in terms of the Jews that were sent to Auschwitz and other death camps. The story in this review is meant to provide the reader with a more complete picture of the victims and the murderers, and to point out what happened in the camps and why. However, the reader can easily get the same picture from the book without the additional details provided by the author. I think the book has a lot of value if you're a serious student of Holocaust studies or a general reader looking for a more balanced book than this one is.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be a very thought provoking book, very well written and I do believe a very useful read. I enjoyed the story. The writing is very interesting and easy to follow. I can only think of one thing that I disagree with. "I could feel it...I could hear it...The air in my lungs..." That sounds like a bad dream. That's all. There's really no need to make a big deal about this in the review. In the end I still liked the book and will still be buying more books by this author as I have many favourite books from this author.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I am going to have to read it over and over again to understand what the hell is going on with the vampires. I will have to get a copy for my son, as I have not read enough in this series to know whether or not he will like it, but he is a bit older than I am and could probably benefit from a good vampire novel, so I hope he likes it too.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been meaning to read this book for a while, and finally read it at the airport.   I've got to say I really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the different styles, and the different perspectives.  The book itself is written in first person from the perspective of a young woman who comes to the US from China. She is very different from the rest of us in this country.  One night I was getting ready to go to bed and I was so tired. I read this short story.  It really changed my perspective on life in the United States.  Thank you for doing this book,   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was in college. The book is written by a psychologist named John Bradshaw and describes the stages of grief. It is very helpful.  The book also describes the emotional recovery process, which is really good to know. . He uses the example of a person who leaves a lover and becomes depressed over the breakup. In the first step (depression), they might be angry at themselves or their partner for leaving. In this step, they are anxious over not knowing if they really wanted to leave or if the relationship just doesn't work out. In fact, they worry they won't be able to be as close as they would have liked. The second step is called guilt. They blame themselves for not being able to stay with the person, and this makes them feel worse. The third stage is called bargaining. In bargaining, they say, "I've made a lot of mistakes, and I'll probably make more, but this isn't a mistake." And then they make a list of their other mistakes. In other words, they make amends to their partner, to help make up for their mistake or their shortcomings. And then finally they begin the fourth step, acceptance. They want the other person to forgive them, and to believe they made the right decision to break up. This is how they start to recover and move on from the loss.   In all these steps, the key is acceptance and forgiveness. And the process is really pretty fascinating. . This is a great book.    The author also wrote a book on coping with your own loss of a lover. I just bought it for my Kindle! Very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know that I would ever pick up another Harry Potter book, but when I read this book, it reminded me of the early 90's when I first read the books. The first 3 books were great, but this one just has me hooked and waiting to read the fourth.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I am a bit of a book snob, and this was my first encounter with a romance novel from the British Isles. The book is well written, and the storyline is interesting. I found the main character, Sam, to be a little too self-absorbed, but I loved the relationship between Sam and his female counterpart, Jane. The way that their relationship developed was definitely an interesting change of pace from the typical "lover"/ "friendship" type stories, and it did not detract from the plot. It was a great romance read that I recommend highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book on the basis of a good review on Goodreads (which is a great service), and after finishing I'm impressed. I was concerned about a large section on the Holocaust and how this would be interpreted in our day. However, it's very well researched and well presented. I'm not a historian or specialist in the area, so there's no doubt about the accuracy of the account, which was extremely helpful.   The main issue I have is that the book is too long. It's long enough to give you enough background and a good overview, but it's a bit confusing at points and I had to reread certain sections a few times to make sense of them. However I think the overall balance is positive, and for me it's more important that the information is accurate than if it's comprehensive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The whole series is one big story.   "I am now thinking of it as the most memorable experience of my entire life".  The characters are interesting and the story does have a beginning, middle and end.  The "tempting" part is that it could end with a cliffhanger.  It is a nice read and has a unique style of science fiction that is different from most of the other books I have read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. I am a graduate student in chemistry who has been working on this same subject for the last several years. In this book, I have the opportunity to follow the development and analysis of the molecule that I was working on when it was first discovered.   This book is a very good introduction to the chemistry that is currently being done on the molecule and the methods that are being used to solve the problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In some ways, the story has the same flavor as some of the best books that I've read. There are some interesting points that I think deserve discussion, some aspects that seem more like minor points than major ones, and the author is really good at building the emotional stakes at just the right moment. The best part of this book was, in my opinion, the final scene, when the main character found out about the woman who had made the mistake that had been so bad. He knew she had the right to change her mind, and he knew that there was no way that he could change her. So he went back and told his wife, and she gave him one of the worst excuses of all time. So they sat down for what should have been a very beautiful moment, with just one person deciding to be a little more understanding of the other. Unfortunately, that person was the man she had fallen in love with, who had the same horrible childhood as her. The woman finally came around, but it came at the price of her marriage to the man who she loved, and it was the perfect end to the book.   If you're looking for a very good book with interesting points, you'll enjoy this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The best book on love in my life"
Write a positive review about a good book:    The  Good Earth  is a fascinating look at what we eat. I've long felt that "bad" foods should be on the "bads" list (no offense to those who hate gluten), but I think the author's research in this area is amazing. It's like looking inside the human digestive system. You learn about the evolution of animal feed, and how a few foods, like chicken and nuts, have changed over the years, but the book's most fascinating chapter focuses on the  good  sustainability of animal foods.   He's not exactly a plant-based advocate, but he has written a terrific book that shows that meat isn't the cause of all evil, and may be a solution for some (he cites some interesting studies in this regard). I would love to see the author translate his findings into a cookbook of his own. "Good" things:      I loved this book. It took a lot of time for me to get through, but what a good time it was. He tells you what he found and how you can apply it to your own life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at my church's summer youth camp in the woods and loved it. This is the third time I've read this novel and I haven't had a bad experience yet. The story, which was written in the late '60s, is about a young boy named Sam who is trying to figure out his purpose in life. He is a "loner" and his only friend is his horse, which, unbeknownst to him, is a werewolf. The book is full of funny characters, and there's some excellent poetry thrown in. I especially loved the story about a man who wants to marry his beautiful horse but can't, which I also loved. The only drawback I had was that I could never figure out why a were-wolf had to live in the forest.   Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book. The author takes the history of the Bible from the very beginning to the latest books and explains how all the prophets wrote in their own language. This is very good history. This book is also very good in teaching what God's Word means for the believer. The chapters on Revelation, Moses, Paul, Peter, and the Church are especially interesting to a believer and they explain the significance of each book. I'm not a historian and I still found this book helpful for me. This review is not to praise the author but to give a little more of a background.    - - - Posted by Michael Moseley at 7:15 AM
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to admit that I haven't read the original novel before this book (I've read the short story collection before, but not the first novel). The author does a good job of making us feel like we understand the character of Aun and her world, and also the world of her mother, Gwen, and that it's a place that is at least somewhat interesting and worth exploring. (She's not really a child of the forest but has been raised there since before the book begins, and she has an affinity for the forest). I don't really know why the author didn't stick with Aun's mother or even the story as a whole. The book has a lot of problems that are hard to follow and the characters often seem like one-note caricatures of their environments. But she does a wonderful job of showing the characters' struggles and their relationships with the outside world through the language that is spoken, which is very clear (with the occasional exception). The forest is a really interesting setting that I'm not sure I'd want to explore in the middle of a city. Now for the review:  There are three main characters in this novel: Aun, the eldest of the three (the other two are Aunis, the older of the two, and Gwen's daughter), and Aunistus (or Aun) is a young boy who is one of the few who can see the forest (he is described as "one of the brightest trees in the whole forest"), and he has an innate connection with the forest that most people don't possess. Gwen is the middle child of four, a mother of five (and her youngest is eight years old), and she's a teacher at an orphanage and a mother who doesn't know that her life is in danger. Gwynn, the second child, is a druid who does not live in the forest or use the language of the trees. She is described in a way that makes her seem very naive and unemotional (but the author seems to be a strong advocate of druidic beliefs). Then there is Gwen of the woods, the "daughter of the forests" (and I think that it is implied that she is related to Aun or Aunish). Her father is a man who lives in the city, but is unable to control the wildness within him. Aun has an understanding with her mother that allows her to use the forest

Write a positive review about a good book:    My father, a man of faith, read this book and wrote a review for us. He loved it! As usual, there is a ton of good information. His biggest criticism is the "spiritual" part. But, he also found it funny and thought it was a great story. He is an atheist and can only see the flaws with a lot of religion and he had so much fun with this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is interesting, the characters well developed, the setting is very imaginative and a bit futuristic.  It is also very well paced and entertaining, although somewhat lacking in the romance department. 8.5/10 - A strong novel. So, I finished it. I read the whole thing (this book, not the novel). I got to the part where I had a chance to meet someone (it took me a couple of tries).   After that part, it just sort of went to hell.  In the end, I have to admit that it was kind of boring.   I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of the romance genre. I have read a few books in that genre that I liked. But for this book, I just could not get the romance part (and a few others) to work for me. If you like that kind of thing, you might get a kick out of this book.   But if you aren't that kind, I can't recommend it enough.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book. I'm just going to jump right into it.   The story is fast-paced.  In the book, I don't know if the characters had a definite reason to live.  I mean, they were all dead.  But all I could think was, "I'd like to be alive when they find me."  I loved the fact that, despite all of their deaths, we still saw glimpses of their personalities.  There were parts where I couldn't even remember who everyone was, but their voice was so familiar to me, I could still understand the words.  And I'm glad it was so fast paced, because it felt very much like a mystery.  The plot was exciting and interesting.  We learn about why each character died, but there was so much I didn't know.  Like, why does the one who wants to escape from the prison have a black eye, but the one with the power to get past the security system and free the prisoners?  In a way, it felt like I wasn't being taken seriously at all.  This is an important book to read, because I want to know about people.  If I was being taken very seriously in my work or in my life, I'm afraid there might be some major consequences.  My favorite part of the book was the end.  It left me feeling so happy and excited.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is the true story of a man named Joseph D. Fenno (1899-1985) who was, in his own words, a "pigeonholed" officer in the U.S. Air Force for nearly twenty-six years." "The stories are well written and detailed enough to be entertaining. This is not the kind of book you read to learn about the military; it's one to read to understand the life and times of a real person, as well as the military and the Cold War. I have found many good books about the air force and this one is no exception, though it is based on a book, " The F-100 Flying Man: The Life and Times of a Cold War Fighter Pilot " written by Douglas L. Wilson. I also like " The Flying Tigers " by Michael L. Padden, as it is a bit more personal and not as far-fetched as some of the other books." (Kirkus Reviews, 2011)
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great novel and I enjoyed it so much I can't wait for the next one. - Lulu- The plot was fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My friend read this book last week and it has been on my mind all week. She has two sons, ages 8 and 9. She tells me that they both like the book. I have my doubts about whether this is a good thing because it is one book that could be used as a "tut-tut" for your 8 year old. It is definitely aimed at a young audience, and I'm sure the boys can appreciate the story. As I said, they had a lot of fun playing with their characters. For me, the characters were very thin. The two boys had no voice. The one boy who wasn't a little girl felt like a very thin character with a voice. There were only two scenes with the other boy and I didn't enjoy any of the scenes with him because he was a very bad character. All of the other boys played well with the girl. They weren't thin characters, but they weren't good ones either.  The good: The characters are very likable. I like the little boy, the younger girl, the older girl, and the boy with the big hair. All the characters are likable but not much more. The artwork was cute.   Bad: The writing style is very difficult. There's a lot in the book about talking to girls but the way the characters talk is very poor. I feel that the book is trying to say something about female friendships and feelings. There isn't a lot there. The book can also be a little preachy in places.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book really helped me to understand my own life path and helped me understand that my beliefs about God were not right.   It helped me see that God isn't what He used to be or the way he used to do things.  I am not in a relationship with Him anymore, but I really think the author did a good job in explaining how God is not what he used ot do.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book back in 2004 when I was working on my master's in writing.  It was a wonderful read!   There are some moments where the author gets too caught up in describing the setting of the story to describe it's main character well.   As a writer I often find this happens.  There is a lot of humor in this book as well. The art is pretty well done.  As mentioned before, I wish there were more moments where I could go back to the past and recall what I had to learn back then. But, I'll take what I can get...

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Good Book: A History of the Book of Mormon, its Significance and Its Influence" by Jeff Lindsay.   This book should be in every home library.  The authors put forth an impressive overview of the book of mormon and its history.  This is a well-written history.        " The Good Book is the most comprehensive account of the first 116 pages of the gold plates, a total of about 2,600 pages, and is an indispensable companion to any serious study of the subject. It is written with the scholarly, technical, and historical knowledge required by the serious researcher.  It also covers some of the most controversial aspects of the origins of the church and its prophet, Joseph Smith.  While the book is written in a way that is accessible to an expert reader, it is written for the lay reader as well."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. I am a fan of the genre and I am definitely a fan for this book as well. The book is really good, though I have a few criticisms: The first half is really fast-paced and I found that I couldn't get enough of the action. I don't know why the author would make the first part so fast- paced and then suddenly have a slow beginning to the second half. The second part was quite a long one. The author did a good job with writing some action, but a lot of the scenes were very boring and repetitive. The main character is pretty boring as well and I think he is more of a background character. I also found some parts of the story a bit over-the-top, like the character's sexual encounters or the ending. But then again, you don't have to read all the chapters to understand what is going on.   I recommend this book to anyone who likes action and thriller genre books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. As with all of the best books in the genre, it was easy to follow and the plot was excellent. My only complaint was the ending - it seemed like it could have been done better.      It was a great read and it was so fun to be able to write in a voice that sounded like a teenager's, like the author was telling a story and it turned out so well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A lot of books like this are so different that it's impossible to say how they'll all go down with readers.   This is the first book I've read by Kate Elliott and I enjoyed it immensely.  I think I read something like seven books in the last year or so, all of which I enjoyed immensely but none of which matched the feeling of the title:  What is it with women writing about things other than what men are really like? I just couldn't stop reading it until I found out where it would end up in the collection.  The book was a bit too dark in some parts but overall I enjoyed the story and think it would be a good choice for a young adult reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you love reading but have no idea where to start, this book will provide you with all the information you need and a good review of the book is a great way to start the new year off right! The title is a good choice because it is about a person's journey of finding their own way of writing a memoir. It starts out strong with a good start and does not disappoint as it takes the reader into the journey of learning the ins and outs of the publishing industry and then to publishing his memoir! This memoir is filled with the author's own mistakes, but he also shares great tips that will help any budding writer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am thrilled by this book. I am from the UK and I have the opportunity to travel a lot. I can say with some authority that you cannot go anywhere in the world in a foreign language without encountering this book and having a little bit of fun with it. I especially like this little section which is called 'The Rules of Englishes' - it explains some of the quirks of English. If you are learning English and you don't already know them, you will be sure to learn a thing or two. If the author wants to make some money, I would suggest the 'Grammar in a Week' book as well. That is a very nice little book for those who don't have time to learn English, but want to know the basic grammar.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only one I don't recommend is the one by Mary E. Gifford. It's about the end of slavery and its aftermath but her book is really about two black girls and their relationship.  (And in all fairness, she did add an extra chapter to a book that should have had no more than one chapter if it really wanted to get to the heart of what slavery was all about).  I read this book about a year ago when my daughter was born but I read it again on our road trip to Maine. It's hard to find books by black authors and this was one of the few I found. I was really happy with the ending and I really hope there are more books like this in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In general, the story is well-written and intriguing. There is plenty of action and excitement, but the plot isn't quite as well-paced or compelling as it could have been. This is a book I'd be willing to read again in the future. And another:  If you enjoyed the first book in the series, I can only recommend this one as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far the best book on the history of the Chinese Revolution ever written. If you are interested in a solid, informative and thorough introduction to the Chinese revolution, look no further. If one were to look past the numerous inaccuracies and the complete disregard for facts and reality, one would find a fascinating historical work. I found the tone to be both reasonable and non-intrusive, yet I still found myself constantly engaged. The book starts off by taking a critical look at Mao's work, "On New Democracy" and the Cultural Revolution as a whole. However, upon finishing the book I was left with a new respect and understanding of the man. I hope this review will make it clear that I disagree with the criticisms that some of the authors make in their critiques of Mao. While this is a critical work on the period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, it is not meant to be a polemic or to make a political statement of the day.  Maoism in its various incarnations, including Mao Tse-tung's Thought and Mao Zedong's line, have always been, in my opinion, the best and the best ways of looking at the Chinese experience.  I am grateful that my fellow comrades and I were able to participate in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.    The other parts of the book include a summary of the role of the "Red Guards" and "Black Guards" as well as a general summary of Mao's ideology. The author also provides a brief discussion of some of Mao Zedongs work which was not mentioned in the previous two parts.    The final part of the text focuses on Mao's personality. This section also gives a short history of Mao, his influence on the Chinese people, the role he played during the Cultural and Cultural Revolution and his influence in Chinese foreign policy.  A personal note: I really appreciate the author's emphasis on the role Mao played as a politician and leader. It is a shame that it is seldom discussed in the Western literature on the Cultural revolution and Mao. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     If you like reading about the lives of ordinary people, this book is for you. It's a simple book and if you're not an expert in any of the things being covered then you'll probably just skip around a bit. However, if you are an expert, I've always thought it was great to read about people in real life experiences, like when we have a meeting with a client.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A classic in the genre and the only one I've ever seen from the author of The Black Hole, a series of short stories about "the only person left in the galaxy who knows what the future is, the only person in the universe who can read minds".   This is not a short story in the style of "What are the rules of a game?  " or "What is a story?  " or whatever.    This is the story of a sentient AI, who, in an effort to keep its universe stable and predictable, has created a single language that is universal and easy to remember.  This story is set after the end of the first book in the series, The Black hole, and takes place in a very different universe than the last, one where the AI has created an alternate reality where every civilization has destroyed itself and the last person alive has come to live in the ruins of the last one.  We meet the protagonist, a young girl named Halleel, and her sentient AI companion named Caz, who gives her the instructions she needs to read the minds of others.  I can't even remember if Caz speaks in words, but it's clear that he knows something Halleels doesn't about the nature of the universe.  Halle is told to read all thoughts, but as she learns more about the universe she decides it's not that simple.  (This is a good reminder that the world's languages and characters are not the same as ours.)   She starts a campaign to try to find a way to stop this.  Her main weapon is the knowledge of all minds, and in her quest for it she will make allies, learn a lot about the other AIs in the story and of the galaxy, and discover that sometimes you can't really trust what you can see.  It is one of the best SF stories I have ever read and one I will cherish long after I die.

I have to admit that i was confused at first, the first half of the book is very bad, but after the first few chapters i got used to it and got hooked, the ending was interesting and it ended on a positive note... It has a happy ending!"

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book about the psychology of writing and writing for a living, from the author's own experiences. The information is very well-organized, and although it does cover some theory and methodology (which I find somewhat redundant in this area) there are some great practical tips here and there. I was interested in learning more about the history and psychology behind why so many writers are so awful at finishing their books. I also enjoyed the discussion of what it means to be a professional author and how some of the more successful authors are able to take their own ideas and turn them into successful books. In this respect, the book is much more helpful for a person like me who is struggling to find their voice as an author and is having trouble staying motivated to finish the thing. -- M, April 18, 2007
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but still enjoyed it.   It has good stuff in it and lots of character development for the main character.  It's interesting to know about the people in the neighborhood when they are "other." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first got this book I did not like it. It seemed to me that it was basically a parody of a story, it seemed to tell a funny story but with all the usual elements in the parody of the story (bureaucratic jargon, long speeches, etc). However, I have read a couple of things by the author of the book, and he has said several times that he wrote the book for a specific type of reader. His readers are the ones who like a good story with funny and often outrageous elements but who don't want to have to go through the tedious, monotonous aspects of most stories and who are looking for something a little bit more "outsider" than most of the other books.  So, my review is going to be pretty positive about this book, but as always I will add a little personal note:  The reason I've decided to write a review about this story is because I am a fan of "The New York Times" and the way the author has been able to take a typical, and very boring story and make it entertaining. This is what I like about these types of stories: The "outsiders" and "outsidenesses" of the stories usually make them interesting because they are outside the usual boundaries of the genre.  And, for what I love about these stories, they are written in a simple, straightforward manner. This story was written like that as well.  This may be a bit off-putting to people who like stories that are "tired," but that is a good thing for me; I want more stories that appeal to me.  But the reason I have kept this review going is because this was, IMHO, a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to the world of science fiction. I have enjoyed reading about space exploration for a long time. I always liked that the science fiction had a certain plausibility. Now I have a good excuse to read more sci-fi. - Jan-23-2018 3:09 AM
Write a positive review about a good book:   My husband and I have been together for over 9 years. We've had our issues, but have never been apart. I was excited to read The Story of My Temptation  when I heard about the paperback release.   The story revolves around two lovers who have been in love for decades, but eventually realize that it's not meant to be. I wasn't expecting it to be as gripping as it was, but it was a great story and made me laugh out loud many times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my eyes this is a very important work, not only in its own right but also as the first serious attempt to grapple with the concept of human dignity that's based on the idea that "human beings are not and cannot be reduced to their physical and material self-interests" (see here for the full quote). The book makes the case that a full-scale economic transformation based on full-spectrum economic democracy will be a better system to distribute resources than the existing capitalist system and it's a good idea to have a debate about its merits in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "For a few days after reading The Death of Rats I felt so free. I loved the characters, the setting, and the author. The story had a few odd turns, but overall this is a great book and an enjoyable read." Read my review What is the book about?   In a modern world where there are no magic spells, only "smart drugs", and people are becoming increasingly more mentally unstable, a young woman struggles to maintain the delicate balance of her life.    The Death Of Rats is a dystopian book, about a society in which magic is completely non-existent, people are no longer able to read the thoughts of the dead, and all the children are killed at birth.  Where did you get it?  I read it online, but you can also find it at Goodreads, Amazon, and in bookstores. Who are the characters?  This was a very light read, and I only skimmed it.  I'm a bit afraid to buy it, but it will be fun to see how this author handles it. "When I first started this book, I didn't think much of it. I didn. I'm not exactly sure where it was going. But it kept building and growing and grew even more.  To say that I enjoyed the book is an understatement, I could never put it down, it was just amazing.  This is an amazing book to read.   A must read.  "  What does it mean to have the power to read their thoughts?  The narrator of the book, Hannah, is a young girl, and in her early teens. She has no memory of the last ten years of her lives, because when she was a small child, a scientist developed a powerful new drug called Psycho-D, which she is now on.  It is illegal in the USA, but as long as she is taking it, she can read the minds of the deceased, and know what they want. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In summary, it was a wonderful read. I think the story would be better read as a novella but I've seen several reviews for it that seem to focus only on the book. If that is the case, it is still a good read and the characterisation is really good. The action scenes are very well drawn, the main character is really likeable and so are the various supporting characters and they have a fun time.   I like a good adventure and this is one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The world of my favorite fantasy series is going through a lot right now. I am sad that there will be no more novels, but this was an awesome book.    I found the characters to be a little cliche, but that's a minor point. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, which I thought had a good mix of historical material with some interesting insights. The story itself seemed to lack some of the excitement that one might expect from a book of this kind. I also felt that the writing style could use some work. I was mostly satisfied with the general narrative as it was told, but some of it was too "sophisticated" for my taste. I did enjoy the descriptions of some of history's major conflicts, though, such as the war between France and Spain in the eighteenth century and the American Civil War, and the use of quotes from the sources was excellent. For instance, when George Washington speaks of the importance of religion, it is given the right amount of emphasis without being overly detailed. I am sure some of these issues will be addressed in a later book and I hope to see the author continue this vein. I will certainly be picking up his other books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are interested in this topic, read this book. I really enjoyed this book, as I really enjoyed the previous books by Michael Moorcock.   Michael Moorck The Earth is not the center of the universe.  I liked that in a book that I think is a bit too far into sci-fi, a few real science facts got into the book.  Moorcock is one of the most famous science fiction authors of all time, and this book was a definite "must" to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was really good and I really enjoyed it. The author's writing style was easy to read and you could easily find what you were looking for. I do have some minor criticisms but most of them are minor. The main thing I wanted to say is that I did not have many complaints about the pacing.   The book is really fast paced but the book was still entertaining at the end.  The first book in this series did this and I thought that this one would follow the same pattern. This book took too long to get going but the pace picks up as the book goes on. The final chapters were very interesting and very well done. The conclusion was a bit out there but I didn't mind at all.  I also liked the little side stories the author had to share about her characters.  A bit of a mixed review.    This book had a few problems and I'd like to mention them here.  As I said above, the first book is a little slow in getting going.  Part of it may have been because the author was still developing her style and part of it is because of how much time it took for the book to get started.  It would be nice to see this book pick up a bit faster because I had quite a few things to say about the first two books. I think one of the most interesting things about this series is that it seems to develop its characters rather than the other way around. The second book had some really fun twists and turns that really kept you interested in the story. This time around the characters stayed the same but I like the change. It does make the stories a bit more unpredictable and I feel it's a good thing for the story to change a little bit.  Overall the story was really fun and I enjoyed it a lot. I really hope I get to read more from this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I do not like about this book is that it could be shorter, but the only other book that I have read that did this well is   An incredibly readable book with lots of great stories to follow. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about what really happened at Bletchley Park during WWII.   1.5 stars (not enough) The Bletchesley Park Stories: The Secret History of the World's Most Famous Code-Breaking Enigma by Alan Turing and David Cowie by Robert Harris (2007) (The official Bletchingley Park book from 2008. The new edition comes with an introduction by Alan Watson (a retired mathematician). A new introduction is also included for the paperback.) The original story was written by David Cowen in his autobiography "The Codebreaker". It is now being re-authored by Alan G. Watson, a retired mathematician. The version I have is the paperback edition, and the two volumes together are the second edition (2004). What's the story? After World War II, when the war was over and the Allies took back their occupied territories, a group of codebreakers at Bletschley began to experiment with different ways to break the Enigma machine. In 1945, a German spy called Max Caulfield was arrested in the US and was later executed. This led to an exchange of prisoners in Germany and in England. Max Crouper (codename "Max-M") gave the Enigmas to the American side and sent back the ones that he considered most valuable. However, the British codebreakers, known as GCHQ, began to have more success in breaking the code and, soon, the US government was able to use the German Enigma code to pass messages back to the British forces. After that, the Allied forces were able to break their own Enigma messages and start using the machine to send information back to each other. This made the war much easier to fight and led to a lot of people getting into the code-breaking business. For the next four years, the American Enigma machines were in great demand and many more prisoners of war were exchanged. (The Nazis called this "The Big Sleep", because they thought that the Allies would all return to Germany after the war, and thus would not try to get back their prisoners. It was this thought which led to the war's conclusion. The Germans were totally wrong! ).

Write a positive review about a good book:      The book, the narrator's voice and the music add up to a perfect experience, even though this book is nothing more than a bunch of different tales from the narrator, which makes it seem as if it is a book of tales (with an omniscient narrator), the narration and the song all blend together so that each story works on its own, without taking up too much of the book, and the author, when he is at his best, puts a lot of thought into the narration, and can write some of the most poetic prose I have ever read, I can see the narrator taking the book's title from this book, which is a good example of a "tales" book that can also be read as a collection of short stories, so that it has its own identity and feel (at least for me), but it is mostly just a lot to get through, so I recommend it to all fans of epic fantasy, but don't expect the reader to completely get the characters, unless they are familiar with the genre, as the prose is dense and slow (even the slower passages are written as if the narrator is the narrator), and it isn't difficult to figure out where the narrator gets his information, though he is a bit of a loner, with a rather bleak outlook on life, but I have to admit that the narrator does have a sense of humor, as if he knows that there is a reader, even if it isn;'t that surprising in the genre? However the most interesting part of the narrator and the story, is the music. This book takes place in the Land of Shivers, where magic exists. In the Land, a number of beings are said to be "touched" by the gods and that the gods will return to the Land if a worthy warrior is brought to the land. One such warrior is called a Shiver, and he is sent by the deities to destroy a certain demon. He travels the land in search of this demon, and when he arrives at the place, he discovers that the demon has been hiding in an ancient structure in a swamp, with the creature that was previously there. The creature turns out to be an old man, and once he finds out that he is the one who was there before him, the old man is taken to the demon's lair and killed. When the Shiver arrives at where the old demon's body lies, it is in the throes of a terrible transformation.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good. I'm writing this review from a copy I read at a store in Berkeley, CA in August 2011. The book is very well edited and written, which is very rare in a self published book. The author clearly knows what she's doing. The illustrations in this book are outstanding. This book has a wonderful and realistic tone which is so refreshing from so many self published books. It's a very fun book, and it does have a few rough parts, but that was my biggest complaint with this book. However, I think that's what makes it so fun to read. The stories are realistic, with very little humor. The world building is perfect, and is well explained. It has enough plot and character development for a very good book. My wife, who is not a reader, and doesn't know what a computer is but does know that it's used to check email, loved this book too. We had a great time reading it together, and the pictures were very nice too. This is definitely a book worth keeping a copy of. :)

Write a positive review about a good book:    What a fantastic book, highly recommended and fun to read.   Highly Recommended by me and my friend.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend of mine. I was pleased with it and I enjoyed the book. The author, William S. Burroughs, is a well known poet, writer and director.    One of his books is called'The Soft Machine'which means'The Machine'the name of the character in the book'The Big Sleep.' This book is about that character and a drug called Heroin which is the name for the drug of the same name.  What I enjoyed:  The drug of Heroin is called Heroine.  It is a type of drug that is more addictive than morphine, the base of Opium (the narcotic opium). Heroine is a powerful drug and it is one of the most powerful drugs that is used in medicine. It is not a legal substance and there are only two doctors who have ever been able to treat it. The addiction begins in the brain and the addict will continue to use it even if the doctor thinks that the patient is a long term abuser.  The most addictive substance in the world are opiates. There are many types of opiates such as morphine, codeine, heroin, and cocaine, but Heroin has the lowest purity and the highest addictiveness of all opiates that are used.  Heroin comes in small tablets. There is one gram of heroin for every 5 pills of OxyContin. The drug becomes hard and powdery on first ingestion. The user will feel the onset of the "high" immediately. The high is so intense that it is impossible for the user to stop using it even though they know that it makes the user feel sick. Thereafter, the user will try to find more and more ways to use the drug.  For instance, they will eat heroin in order to get the high even faster. When they do this, the heroin will be left in the stomach and then when the user swallows the drug, the stomach will expel the heroin. In order to stop their habit, the users will get in the habit of taking drugs in order that the withdrawal pain is less. Heroin will be easier to use if the user has no physical or emotional ties with the drug or is addicted to it. This addictiveness means that the addict can never stop the use even if they want to. They will use it until they die.  After the user starts using, they can't get any use out of it

Write a positive review about a good book:   My first book from John Clements. This book is an extremely useful reference for the professional game developer. John C has a master class on the subject which is well done and written. I highly recommend it. I have a copy of his book, "Game Design Fundamentals" which is an excellent resource as well. Read more "The Art of Game Design" by John C.  "Game Design" is a very good book. The author, John C, breaks down game design in a very logical fashion, and the explanations are detailed and clear. It is very well written. The best part is that he provides lots of examples of what a good game design looks like. The book also contains lots of other useful information that is not directly related to game design (such as game mechanics and AI behavior). This book has been a long time coming, but has been worth the wait. I've already recommended this book to all my friends. The design of the game is one of the most important factors, so it is good to have a good reference for that. Game Design is an important subject, and I recommend that the readers of this book make a conscious effort to learn about it as they go along. "Game" in this case is a contraction of "gamedev". "Game design" is not an abstract concept, but an action or product of the design of a game. This is a book about the process of design, not a book of theory. The concepts and methods are very well explained, and it is not hard to read and understand. There are lots of references that go into depth on specific topics (which is helpful for the newbie who wants to learn more about game design). I really liked John C's style. I feel that he's an extremely good writer and his descriptions of concepts are thorough and easy to understand. I also liked the fact that the book is a bit dry. The explanations of some of the more complex topics could be a bit more light-hearted, and that was a little disappointing to me. But it's an understandable mistake by a book aimed at the more experienced designers who were just coming into the design field. It's not necessarily a negative thing, though, because there are plenty of examples and exercises to help people with any problem in game design.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is not a novel in the sense that it has no plot. The plot, while interesting, isn't all that important. It is more about the relationship between the author and his characters, and their interactions, and the way that it changes and shapes them. It's a book about growth and development. And that's what I loved about it.   I haven't finished reading this yet, but if I could summarize the book in one sentence, it would be:

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read this book before and I am not sure I really understood it. This time I really did. It gives me more to think about about how we perceive the other person and how that has a lot to do with our personal dynamics. Also it gives me insight to the fact that I like the way the author describes what we do in our relationships. (Review of free book) Date: 03/30/2011 From: Sankovski, Georgia Rating: 4/5 I'm a very happily married 30-year-old female who just had her 1st baby a couple of weeks ago, and my husband is 30. My husband has always been very passive and I have always been the initiator. It seems like his self-confidence has decreased a little, but he is working on it and is still a very good leader, and he doesn't want to be a passive wife. But lately it's just been a very bad cycle, and I've come to the conclusion that maybe I'm making him passive in some sense, and therefore it's more important to be more active with him. I thought that maybe this will help my husband in his work/life balance but I guess I'm wrong. I was wondering if there's a way for me to have more assertive sex, without the husband getting too passive. Any advice?  Date submitted: 2/28/2011 by The Author
Write a positive review about a good book:    - This book really helps you to understand what has been going on in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since the LDS apostles and prophets had their revelations (the first one in April of 1837).   For all of my years of being involved in the Mormon Church I had only a general idea about what was going on, or maybe some things I could surmise. I knew the church was going through a period of growth, but I didn't know what was happening in the details of what this growth was like or how it was occurring. The author, Paul Y. Hoskisson, gives you the full picture. You will not only understand the current situation in the church, but how it began, how it developed into the current state of the church today. I highly recommend this book. I will read the book again and I will probably write a review.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've loved all the books in this series.    I read the original at a time when I wasn't too interested in fantasy, and thought it was pretty good, but a few years later when I was more interested in the genre, the original went on the shelf and I missed it until this one came out.  The second one in the series, The Fire and the Dagger was also enjoyable, but it was more of a re-read of what I already knew from the original.  I'm not sure how much of a difference this makes, but I feel as if it makes it slightly more enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In a word: Awesome!   This book helped me to become an author.   There are a lot of books on self-publishing; most of which were not written for a first time author, nor for someone who is not a native English speaker.  This book is written to be able to be written by someone who has a basic grasp of English grammar and vocabulary.  I don't have many negative comments about the book.  The book is easy to understand and to use.  In fact, I found it quite helpful when it came to marketing a book and the things you need to be aware of while writing a manuscript.  There is a lot in this book that would benefit you if you are a beginning self-published author.    If you are looking for a book to take you from complete beginner to complete professional (at least in terms of business), look no further than this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:     What a wonderful book to read! This is such a good example of what a good writer does. There's a lot to like about this book: a great protagonist (Bella), a great concept and plot (the book tells us about the power of faith), and lots of fun, lively, entertaining language.   This book would make a great Christmas gift for someone who likes fairy tales but has never heard of this author:   He said, "God has put on this mortal body a body which may be likened unto man, but hath not given him the true soul" (Book of Mormon 1:4).   "I know that he has been a good shepherd, but that he knows the flock better than he knows himself" (1 Nephi 11:4)."And he did know that it was a spiritual blessing unto him" (Helaman 3:13).     In my family we have a favorite story. A few years ago, my brother and I went to see "The Lion King." I don't know much about it and I'm not a "lion-kind" person, but in the middle of the movie I asked my brother why he thought they called Simba the "lionslayer." He answered "I think the reason is that Simba was the leader of the animals, the ones who didn't have fathers, so it's a compliment that they called him a lion." He was right, but I was a little disappointed in my brother for not understanding the deeper meaning of that title. This book is a great example of a good storyteller at work.  - I really enjoyed this book! I am going to take my kids and give them this one!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book, while on vacation, on a whim. It's a very nice introduction to some of the major historical figures of the 20th Century. There are a few spelling and grammar errors in the book, but I was able to understand everything. The best part is the book gives you enough history for the average person to know what was going on, so even non-specialists will understand what happened in the 20's. The chapters are organized well, and there are few gaps in the timeline. The only problem with this book is the main character's story line is a little lacking. Although, the character is quite interesting and the author really captures how important the era was.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have the most positive feelings about this book, and this is because the author, KJ Haggard is extremely articulate in his book. He is able to convey his ideas in a way that does not overwhelm the reader with the information, but instead helps them become more knowledgeable about the subject. The material in this book will be valuable and useful to a wide range of people, and I would not hesitate to recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not so much into the religious subtext that has the story told in the guise of a supernatural supernatural world but this book is still good. As a character based book, I found it enjoyable and a good mix between religion and science. I have not read any other religious fiction but this one is a nice mix of religious and science with a touch of fiction.   The Book:    The book is written as an introduction to the Christian belief system. The author is an interesting choice as he is a man with a religious background. In his book he provides a few anecdotes about his upbringing and some history on the Christians before the early church. The premise of the book is that this group of people who were on a mission to save their country during the time of the bible's creation were met with a god they thought was god. The book begins with a person who has no idea that he is an atheist being told that god exists by his pastor father. I think that it's a good idea to try to introduce the reader to the basic beliefs of different religions if you have not already.    From the first paragraph, I felt like I was reading an introduction and then a story about the story of the people who converted to Christianity and the religious group that was opposed to them. This story began with the idea that there was a group of Christians that were so god like that they believed god had created their world and made a lot of people. The first chapter then explains how the missionaries came to the world and how they were met by the followers of the god that the Christians believed was the real god. I found this book a bit confusing and the author seems to be mixing things up in his stories in the later chapters. One chapter talks about how a church leader was told that the god they believed in was really a god of a different race and that was the reason they were going after him. A few chapters later the author tells of how the missionary's family died because the people they were trying to convert to christianity were killing people of different races. At the end of the chapter, the author discusses why this is a good thing. I felt that a lot more explanation and evidence was needed from him and his friends. I wasn't sure about how he was going to explain the origins of god.   This book is a fun little read and I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about Christianity or science in general.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a lot of books, but I have never read anything like the book that was in this package. Not only did the book provide a ton of background on the story, but it also provided a LOT of information on the history of The Netherlands and the historical figures in the book, which made the book incredibly informative and very entertaining to read. I think that it was really important to show that people who don't speak the language don't necessarily have a better understanding of the Dutch people or their culture.   The book also provided me with a nice overview of the different regions in the Netherlands.  This isn't the sort of book that can be read in a few days, but this one was a good read.  A wonderful way to keep yourself occupied :   This book will provide you with a lot more than just a little history and a few interesting facts, but a good story in its own right.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book should be required reading for anyone interested in understanding the history of the Jews in America. Although the author begins with the events of the late 17th century, the events in this book take place in the 19th and 20th centuries. The author uses personal experience as a point of view rather than as a historical document; the reader may think that it is an easy read, but the author clearly shows that her experience was not simple and that she had to spend many years learning to read and write.   In the early chapters, the author discusses how the Jews of the East Coast had to flee to the East in the 16th and 17th centuries and that the same could be said about the Jews who were in America before 1854. In the 19 th century, however, the Jewish community found a foothold in North America.  "In 1773 the Jews brought more than twenty thousand pounds to New York, where they lived in the most luxurious style; they were given full liberty to build their own synagogues and, with the permission of the government, to build synagogic buildings of their own. The Jews of America were the most flourishing and the most well-organized of any sect in the world at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries."   The author notes that the Jews were able to become more powerful in this country because their ancestors had been able to immigrate to the United States earlier in the 18 th century. She notes that Jews immigrated to America first and then began to emigrate to Europe.  The second half of the book focuses on the 20th century.  This is a period when the United Nations was established and it is this international organization that has taken away the Jews' right to immigrating to Israel. In short, the 20 th century has been a time of oppression and persecution of the Jewish people.  A good story should include some of the negatives as well as some of their positives. The negative is that many of the positive aspects of the 20 nd century are forgotten and the positive elements of the earlier century have not been reflected in today's media, which means that many Jews today do not understand their past and the challenges that they have faced.  Although the book was originally published in 1975, I think that the current day reader will not be able to stop reading it once the first half of it is read.  To me, this is an essential book for anyone wishing to
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is a good one for a new reader like me who has only read books about the Holocaust and/or Nazi Germany, and is not familiar with the other aspects of the history. The information provided is very good. It does a great job of explaining to the reader exactly what happened to the Jews and why. The author was able to take a long time to explain the background of the Holocaust, the reasons why they were persecuted, how they were forced to become so docile that they were easy to murder, how many of them were killed and how many survived. The main issue I have with this book, however, is the overall impression of the author which I found to be very superficial, almost voyeuristic. For instance, the author gives a short synopsis of the concentration camps that are used in this book. I really don't know what the author was trying to show with the summary. It reads like a movie trailer for a book that has no real significance in the life of a survivor. The book reads like it's just a piece of background information that a narrator used to create a sense of urgency in the reader's mind about the need to read this book in order to learn more about the horror of the Auschwitz and other Nazi camps. Overall, this is a very good book that provides a good overview of the Nazi camps and the Jewish Holocaust. However, the overall effect is not as strong as the author would have liked it to be. I would recommend this book if you are looking to learn about the Jewish tragedy, but who does not have much background knowledge in the history of the Jews.  13 of 14 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    A must read for anyone interested in reading about the history of the church   "For my money, I don't think any book more deeply, more comprehensively, more eloquently explains the history and workings of a great organization than this one. It is a work of history that will appeal to readers with a particular interest in Mormonism and to those interested in Church history generally. As far as its historical accuracy, there is no better account. It presents an account of the organization as seen by those who knew and worked within it."

Write a positive review about a good book:   The only good thing about this book is the author's excellent voice, which makes her stories that much more compelling and her prose that much better. But I can't help but feel that a little more effort could have been put into the story, and perhaps the plot would have worked better as a standalone.   I'm not sure if I was too young for this book at the time, but I remember getting a copy of this book for a birthday present from my brother when I was just a toddler. When I was a teen, I bought the sequel, as well as the short story collections , and I'm glad I did because they still hold up well.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The only problem I had with this book was the lack of actual "science" in it. It is a book of "sketchings" but in my opinion, the author does not have the scientific understanding or the background to draw conclusions from his work. The first few sections do give a fairly accurate look at the possible sources for the phenomenon, including possible meteorite or solar activity as well as a discussion on how some scientists feel the sun and sunspots cause cancer."  The author is not a scientist and is trying to make some sort of a connection between various solar phenomena and cancer.  I'm a skeptic and I don't think the sun can be the main culprit, but this book is written in a way that has me looking at the sun in a different light.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing that could stop me from buying this book was my lack of time. I finished the entire book on the first night and got lost in it. I couldn't put the book down.   I just love how so many cultures and time periods were represented here. I had to look up the history of some of the countries and their history.  It's really awesome that this book is made into movies and TV shows.  The book is pretty heavy on history so it was very educational to know about these places.  So, I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and cultures.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book is one that you enjoy.    You have to love it to be able to appreciate it.  The story of what happened when a man was charged with murdering his wife, his family, his friends, the police and the jury is just good, interesting reading.  I am a person who has read and enjoyed a lot of books about the subject of murder.  This book seems to hit a more personal note than most.  It makes the reader think and feel about the murder as a whole.  There are some things that may sound odd, but that I am not in agreement with or find strange.  In my opinion, I think that the book is good because I can relate to the character of the victim and the situation of the murder. The main point that I find that this book makes is that you can never be too careful with a weapon in a life-or-death situation.  While this may be a bit extreme, it seems like a very effective way of dealing with an issue.  As far as the story goes, it is not that important and could be read completely for entertainment purposes alone.  If you enjoy good, entertaining fiction and want to know how the world would react to such a situation, this is a good read.

I'm a big fan of Dany and I was looking forward to this one.  This is a great series, and Dany is such a likable character.  The author writes in a very realistic style and makes you care for the character.   I also loved the story of Darry and his struggle to survive.  It has a really unique story and it made me sad that it wasn't more in the storyline of A Feast for Crows.  Dany was so amazing in that book and I want to see her do a good job as Hand.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very excited to get this book, and am now really glad that I did.   It's definitely a must have for fans of fantasy fiction, or anyone who likes reading about magic and the supernatural.  It has a great world building, and there is even a few glimpses into the world's history.  Unfortunately, the main character has a very poor attitude toward magic, so a lot of things that should be awesome are boring. The second book will make up for that! Also, I have a problem with the language, as it's not as good as the first book. But other than that, it's a great book!

Write a positive review about a good book:      I was really excited about this book, but was very disappointed when I picked it up. It's not like anything I have read before, but it has a good, but unexciting set of characters. I know the author likes to use the "good bad" trope, and this book is very much a product of that; we get a good set of good guys, but they're only in it for themselves. We get a couple good villains and one good villainess, and they're a bit too perfect to have much of a personality. The action and the story are pretty good, with a lot of exciting fights. The writing is good, and I liked the twist on some of the characters that came in the last couple of pages, but overall, I really just wasn't a big fan of this book. I'm not even sure if I liked anything the protagonist did. I think the main characters are pretty interesting, but I didn't like them very much. I did like how they seemed to care about one another, but when they are off doing their own things, it really didn't have much impact.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book     I was given this book on the recommendation of an old high school friend who, while I wasn't a big fan of the book in question, still felt like a good read in spite of it. I, too, have never read it, but it's not a hard read - it's mostly dialogue and the stories told aren't too shabby either. The characters have a nice, natural chemistry to them, and their interactions with each other really helped get me invested in the story.   This was a great read, and I would absolutely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that will stick in the reader's memory.   It has very little to add to the current "doom and gloom" of modern climate science.  The title of the book is not a misnomer - in fact, it is a good name for it.  Most of the time the author goes into great detail on the "lack" of global warming in recent decades, which is not really surprising given that the world is experiencing the coldest winter and hottest summer in 1,300 years.  Yet, the authors' "prediction" that global warming will cause more droughts, floods, and hurricanes in the future, is just a prediction, and if you use the same techniques used in previous "predictions" in predicting the weather you would also be right.  A good book is one that can inform and inspire, but it is not the kind of book that makes a positive impact on the world.  In fact, I think this is an easy to dismiss book, but if I had a choice of books on climate change, I would probably select this one over anything by the IPCC.  It is not about doom and gloom - but it will probably make you laugh a bit too.  This one will be in my bookshelves, along with a copy of the recently published book by Stephen Schneider on "Why Is the Sun So Hot" which is really an updated version of The Collapse of Western Civilization: A Natural History.

Write a positive review about a good book:     The characters are all so well done and the world is fascinating, especially the magic and folklore.   I'm so happy I bought this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read this book and loved it. It was a little tricky to read because the first few pages are narrated by a female protagonist, but when I was done I wanted to hear what the author had to say. She is so insightful and knowledgeable about things she doesn't even know about (I don't think the narrator has a clue what her name is) and you learn so much about the world she is from. I loved the ending, though I was disappointed that the characters didn't get more time to grow, but hey, I'm the kind of person that wants a book that makes me happy instead of a book for me to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters, the writing, and the plot, are what kept me reading.   In fact, if you're a fan of YA paranormal romance or supernatural romance, then you really will like this one.  I really liked this book.  The author has a very easy to read writing style.  They have interesting characters that are really likable and likable for different reasons.  It was a good read even if it was just a series of short stories about different people and situations.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first book in this series (and the first book I've ever read that uses a true story as a source) is a breath of fresh air. I would have liked to see the rest of the book told from different characters' perspective, but that's just me.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know if this book was written by a man or woman, but the main character is a strong, independent, woman. He is intelligent, has a decent sense of humor and is just as likely to be a hero or villain as any man in the book. The main villain in this book is a girl who wants to be accepted by all men and women. She is like an "evil twin" to her brother and is a much better thief than he is. The best part about the book is that the main villain is a very likable character and not at all what I expected. The bad guy is just evil, but not for any good reason.   I did get a chuckle from the author's reference to a "stereotypical teenage girl" in his own words when talking about the two characters they met. But I didn't like the writing in that reference. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read!   "It's not the war you don't know. It's the war we don't see, or care to see. It goes on without us, it goes on inside of us, and it makes us different. It makes us stronger. It gives us meaning. It is our survival. It has always been our survival, and that is why, when it's over, it will still be ours. This is where the books comes in." - Christopher Hitchens
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in the month or so before I returned to grad school for my PhD. I was really happy with it, and had to go back and re-read some of the older parts. It's a good summary of why we as a species are bad. It will also motivate you to start eating more fiber-filled food like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  My favorite review:  In the first two paragraphs, they discuss the dangers of sugar and how there's some evidence to suggest that eating a diet high in processed food may be harmful. It seems pretty clear that if you consume a lot of sugar, this could lead to health problems like obesity and cancer.  I personally love this book. It gives you a good overview of what it is that is wrong with us as a culture. I think that we are just now understanding the importance of eating whole, real, organic, locally-sourced foods, and I think this is one of the reasons I find this book so interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It is very well written."  "It's a very good book, very well done." , a non-fiction book about what it's like to be a transgender woman and a "lesbian" in New York City.  "This book has lots of information about people who transition.  . It is written from the point of view of someone who has been in transition for over 30 years and has done a lot of the work herself to support others transitioning to their affirmed gender.  The author explains all the details and takes us through the process of gender reassignment, what it is like to go through a reassignment as well as how it feels.  I loved the fact that it has lots and lots of links to other websites with more information about it.  It makes it more interesting and useful as well." There's a whole lot of information in the first few pages.  Not as much as some books, but a good amount for the length.  Some things were a bit "off" to me.  For example, "it takes a village," "it's easier to have children than a penis," "to live as a woman is to live in constant discomfort," "you can't feel female," etc.  This can't have been the author's intention.  Unfortunately, I believe this is a book for people who are quite cisgendered and have no clue about how they feel or what it feels like to have a gender identity and expression that doesn't match the physical one they were born with.   The author does mention, with great detail, that there are trans people who don't want to transition, but can't stop themselves from having their male genitalia, so they are in a "transitioning cycle" and want "to stop."   But, why should someone who feels and identifies as male want to stop transitioning?   She is suggesting that they might want to "pass."  I would have preferred to have learned the author would like to continue to transition.   She also mentions that the trans person could live in a state where a person can legally change their sex, yet live as the opposite sex at home and in public.  "Transgender people can live in 'passing' as the gender they are living in life.  As long as their birth certificates say male, then they can't change their gender on them."    This sounds like this person may have a female
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've read in the last year. The writing style is well written and clear and the story is a well written one with some interesting twists and turns. There are some strong, memorable moments and character development. The characters are well fleshed out and the plot is well thought out. This is a book for lovers of the science fiction genre as it is very action packed and suspenseful. This book has some good pacing and it really keeps the reader wanting more. If you love the genre of science fiction I highly recommend this book and will probably re-read it this year to see what all the fuss was about. The third book in the series, " The Mote in God's Eye ", is set in the same universe and explores a very similar theme of a man who discovers the soul of a deceased relative that has been sealed away for centuries by a cruel, old, and tyrannical mother.  I wasn't sold on the first two books (they were a bit too much like the same old'science fiction book' trope) and this was the book that pushed me into buying this series. However, the third book is a bit stronger. The action starts off well and the author is able to convey a lot of action and drama. The story then takes a dark turn however. The tone of the novel is quite grim and dark and the character is fairly grim as well. If that doesn't make you feel like you are in a science fiction world, I don't know what will!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best one I've read in the last few months, and I really love it. In a very clear and direct style, Dr. Linton has managed to write a book that covers a lot of important subjects without boring you. Dr. Krakauer's book will not make you a master of nature, but it will make you aware of how we got here, why we should try to preserve this wonderful world for future generations, and why we need to change our way of doing things.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book to put on your shelf and read to your friends.   The plot is simple and easy to follow, and the characters are likable.  The ending is a little abrupt, but the final scene was well done and satisfying.  There are few things in this book I didn't like:  the characters.  In my view, everyone in this series, even the bad guys, is just a little too perfect.  I also found the sex scenes in this to be really sexy, but I'm not sure how they should be depicted in fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a bit more than the average book I have read. The author is an interesting person who is writing in the popular science and history field. I read this book while having my brain turned upside down. I am also from Canada and have travelled to many countries and continents and I am in my second year of University. I enjoyed this book because I found it interesting and insightful.   I really enjoyed this particular book, so good I think I have to get a second copy for my bookshelves.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I enjoyed the book. It is about the struggle between the rights of the individual against the state."

It's not clear how well it will survive." "I liked it because it helped me understand our history, our current situation and the future." "An enjoyable, informative, and timely book."

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not bad, just... not what I was expecting from a YA book. It's a little disappointing because I really enjoyed the characters and the story.   The ending was a bit rushed for me, but overall, it was a fun story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    " It's not a book to read on a Sunday night. It's a book that is worth a read on any day of the week and even on a Tuesday. It is not a fun read, but it is a thoughtful read and it's worth a reading all its own."  " This book is an absolute treasure. I don't think it is the best book on the subject of the Second Amendment, but it's certainly the most entertaining. It was a great surprise to read an article by someone that is actually in favor of the right of Americans to keep and bear arms. You never know what to expect from this book, but you won't be disappointed. And I hope to see a whole series of books like this one." , but, It's certainly and It's worth  " This book will keep you on your toes, you will always be on your feet, you can't go wrong with this book. It makes you think, it makes you question what you know, and it makes it challenging to the way you've been taught to think about guns. I highly recommend this book." ... and it is worth the read on every day of your week: ... I have just been reading this book for almost two weeks now and it has kept me on my toes, on my feet, and always on my mind. I have never enjoyed reading a book so much before.   This book is not just a history book, it is an examination of how a people's most fundamental right to self-defense has been corrupted over the last few decades by politicians and legal theorists who have been hell bent on taking that right away. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A great read, the book covers a lot of ground, but the writing is a little dated. However, the characters are well developed and the plot is exciting."   The main point of this novel is the story of two people who come together at a time of great change in the world, when the American government has been brought down by a military coup and is going to be replaced with a dictatorship, run by a new elite, or "elite", named "the 1". The 1 are the super-rich and powerful, who own and control the world as a corporation. The main theme in this novel concerns a certain type of elite in the US, a certain elite in India, and how both these elite are coming together to create an elite in this world in which they have a monopoly on power and wealth. As the novel progresses it develops a clear and definite storyline, and as the book goes on, a plot develops. The two main characters in the book are William Atherton, a retired CIA officer, who is on his way home from the CIA training facility at Fort Holabird in Maryland, and his wife, Marjorie, who worked for the CIA, but who left it for a more honest and moral world. William Athertons work was to track down the head of the CIA in India in the days after the coup.   It is William's love that gets him into trouble with the 1 and that gets them both into trouble in the first place.  The main story is set in India during the last week of January, 1984. I really enjoyed this book, and I was glad that I found it when I did. I have never read a book that is about the elite of the world having a takeover in the way in which this story is told.  In my opinion, there was a definite "elitist" flavor in the characters of William and Marjory Athertons lives.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am always impressed by books written by authors who have a real passion for what they write about. For those who don't know her, this book will certainly not disappoint.   For those of you who have not read her blog about the book (http://www.bibliotropic.com/bakethemom/index.html ) you should really read it.  What this book is, is a book about how the church has been wrong all along.  It is an eye-opener. The fact that the Church can be so wrong all the time, but still remains relevant to some people, is not surprising at all. It is just another example of the world being imperfect but still being full of goodness. I do have one complaint about this book, and that is that it takes quite a long time to get to the good stuff. I find that the book would be more interesting if it were shorter. It could have been written in under an hour or less. I know there are people who like to be told what they want to hear, and this book would have been a good addition to that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book. It's been a long time since I've seen a book like this. I think the best thing about this book is how it uses the idea of "the dark world" in the world. The characters in the book can see it in a lot of ways and it's easy to follow the progression of the characters. One of my favorites is the idea that "I want the world in my hand but can't touch it. I want it to be there, I don't want to touch it but I want to know how it came to be." One of the themes I find interesting is that the characters are constantly having to fight. A lot of this book reminds me of the war in Iraq. The fact that they have a military system in place in a time when people don't even know about technology and have a lot to learn. Also a bit disturbing is the lack of privacy. The author goes into a lot about the fact that the military is always watching and a lot more about the military. One aspect I love about the story is the "wish list" that each character has. They have things they want. They want to become heroes. They always want to be the good guy. I also really like the way she makes the characters feel like they're part of a world that's far away and more magical than they can ever be. It seems that all the characters come from this "dark" world that no one is really prepared for. I don' t know if I have to say this but I think this book will appeal to anyone who likes books that are not about a military based world that is controlled by a man.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad I picked this up on the recommendation of my fellow audiobook geeks! This was my first ever audiobook purchase and I'm glad I made it. The story was engaging and had a great ending.   My one gripe about the narrator was that he was not as audible as I would have liked him to be but it was not a huge issue. I gave it four stars mainly because of the ending. The narrator had a really amazing finish to this book. The ending was great but I feel that it needed a bit more.  A couple of things that annoyed me about the book. First of all the story was great, it just didn't happen. Second of all, this book was written with the assumption that everyone is going to listen to the audio version, but for me, I bought the paper version so I could keep a closer eye on the story. I just wish I had been aware of the other option at the time.
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is very thorough and interesting!   - I can see how some of these issues can be challenging for women, and it was very helpful to see that it is a spectrum, not a monolithic problem. It's just as much about the men as it is about women.   For a very good intro to the topic, I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    -   The title alone says it all. I read this as a kind of fantasy re-telling of the original Hobbit. I was skeptical about this book when it came out, but the ending was quite good (for me, anyway). The story itself is about a man and his son who leave his old home and head for the big city, where he finds a job, but realizes there is more to the job than meets the eye. It also explores the relationship between father and son, the love of adventure, and the magic of the woods. I loved the use of magic in this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book of the genre, for my money. The author does a nice job of explaining the characters without ever becoming tedious. I particularly like the way he depicts the relationship between the mother and daughter, and in particular the tension between the two of them, which is one of the most interesting elements in this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:     I like this book but I do not know if I agree with everything it says. There is some confusion about where the concept of "self-help" began. In the first part of the book, she talks about how you can get "nagging thoughts" by asking yourself, "Am I a failure" or "What if I do something different?" (The first part seems like a good intro to the book since that's what I'm looking for, but the last part is a bit confusing). I think the confusion comes from the fact that she thinks these nagging thoughts are about you and not the situation. I don't think it's about you, but it's not necessarily self-help either (maybe she just didn't know how to use the concept)? I feel like if you read it for the first half, it helps because it's more clear than "self help" is a phrase people use for self-improvement or something. But the second half, the self-empowerment part, seems a bit awkward to me. It seemed like this was a discussion on what you should be thinking and how you should get rid of negative thoughts and replace them with something positive. I do agree with the concept, but that is a huge mental shift.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book a lot and wanted to read it as soon as I could get my hands on a copy. The book itself is quite good. As others have said, it is definitely more entertaining than a regular book. The writing is funny and the descriptions of the book are accurate to the text. The ending was a bit abrupt and a bit too quick to leave things hanging but I'll give it that. I don't know if I'll be giving this book to my children for Christmas but they could certainly use a good read!
Write a positive review about a good book:   On a scale of one to five (5 being perfect) I give the book a score of 4.6. I don't think it's the best book ever written but if you want a history of the world you read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's the first book I've ever read by a man.   I'm surprised there's been so little buzz about it.  A good novel that doesn't rely on magic or the supernatural, it's about a normal person whose normal life is disrupted by a supernatural event.  The magic happens to be in the book.  But it's not a supernatural world that's threatening to annihilate the world.  Instead, it comes to earth from space and the people that live there are a little more than they seem to be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was in awe when I first saw this book on Goodreads, and then later on a few other sites. In short: It's good! If you want a fantasy about being a soldier in the Middle East in the middle ages, then give it a try. It's about a man who's a soldier (not a wizard). He's also a bit on the dark side, but that's more in the sense of him being evil than anything else. He's like Frodo, and that's ok because it was written before the movie. In the movie he's more like a wizard and gets more evil. Still, it's a good story and good characters. It did not have a huge plot or twist, but it had the best parts. I gave this a 3.5 out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of this book, so much so that I was going to buy the sequel on Amazon before it came out, but my copy has been delayed until March so I can still use it.   The stories are so well written that I never feel bored (which is good for me since I'm usually a bit of a space cadet and can usually find a bit too much boredom in my favorite space novels).   And the characters are all so well fleshed out and believable.  The aliens are well developed and have a sense of humor that makes sense with the setting (the Martians are an odd breed of aliens that seem like they're from another planet but I can't figure out why).  The writing is as good as I expected, and the ending is what I always look for in a ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I did not have a chance to read any of these books, but I have heard great things about them. My son is about 6 months old and he loves the dog. When we brought out our new baby, my baby started having an attack of the sniffles, which were very uncomfortable. At that point I tried to get a second dog to join in the fun. We ordered the "Mister Yummy" and he has been playing with it, eating a good amount of it, and he even likes to carry it around and lay on top of it.   I like this book for two reasons: (1) My son has been a bit of a snooper since his very early days. He always finds the squeaky toy, and then we have to tell him to stop (not fun to say, especially when your child has a hard time controlling their sniffles). Now that I have a dog, my son never lets me leave him alone while he is playing with his new toy, he is constantly asking for a treat or for me to find a new one. (2) The book focuses on the benefits of puppy play, and how they make play time better. When I first read this book, I thought it was a good idea to have a book for puppy play and "naughty" activities, and this book makes sense.

Brownlough (Academy Press, 2004) , edited Thomas W  Comment on this review  A really great introduction to the history and development of modern science... the first half is a fascinating overview of the development of scientific thought, the history, controversies, and development over a period of some 400 years. It covers such topics as the development and impact of physics, chemistry, and biology. The second half is what makes the book interesting, an overview of some of the major theories of modern physics, a good discussion of the quantum theory, and the development in general of scientific methods. A really good read! . 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read with a good plot/plot twists. A nice story, the main character doesn't feel boring for the majority of the story and is believable. There are a few bits where the plot twists are out of left field and sometimes the twist doesn't add to the story or doesn't make much sense but the overall story isn't the main reason to read this book. Also some good action scenes and a cool concept to build up on. The ending to the book will please those who have read the books that are set in the same universe as this book and will also appeal to those who do not want to read an in-depth look at the characters/their relationship and instead just want a good story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the few novels I haven't finished yet, but will definitely finish! I liked the mystery of the book. The book opens up a lot of possibilities and possibilities lead to more twists and turns of the story. I liked that the book starts off by telling us that our heroine's parents had an affair, then goes to show us how their affair was the catalyst that led to a major character dying. The author writes with a good sense of humor and gives us plenty of twists and surprises. I'm going to have to re-read the book once it is completed, just to try and figure out just what happened to the woman's mother. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of murder mystery novels and are looking for a book that is a little different from the usual.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read this book first and then looked it up, and found that the book I had ordered online is the actual one that is available through the Library of Congress. There are also two ebooks that have been published, but they are NOT the same as the original book. One was released in 2007, but apparently has gone out of print. The other one is still available online for free (a very good download), but there are no comments on it.   It's hard to imagine a better read, except maybe for a young one who wants to learn more about the Founding Fathers and the American Revolution.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book a lot. I loved the characters and their interactions. I liked the story. I thought it was fun. I think the book could have been a lot better if the author were a little less vague about the history of the world or if he had written a little more about why there's war between the two races. Still, a good story and characters are worth a read for me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.   A lot of the information in this book is outdated.  There are some interesting information but it should not be required reading for everyone to be able to understand the threat and to think about counter measures.  I was able to take a couple of the most important aspects of the book into consideration by doing some research on the topic.  I also found it interesting that these two books that are supposedly so similar are not exactly the same.  They are very different but you can get the ideas from both of them.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I would like to thank the authors for writing this novel. I like the fact that the book is not a typical military story, that is why I purchased it. The book provides a lot of historical and interesting information, which I like. The writing is good as well, and the book makes the reader think and makes the military experience more believable. The author does not overuse the military jargon but he gives the reader enough to understand it. For the students, this novel is a good choice. Recommended for students and military veterans alike.

I am not averse to science fiction, but I like a good mystery more, and I'm really pleased to have found this book. I hope my friends find it as great as I did.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first thing you'll notice about this book is how much it differs from your average "novels"--it doesn't have a "plot". It's a collection of short stories, and I find that refreshing, because it's the kind of writing that's so easy to write and hard to write. One of the most exciting things about this novel is that it's not about one person. It's about a group of people, and all of the relationships are deeply complicated. When one of them dies, they don't just go to pieces; they go to a place where they can't go back. A good book is a good story, and this is a great story. There's a great deal of love and sadness. I found it a little depressing to read because it seemed as if the characters would end up with someone. I was hoping that the characters of this book would end with the love of their lives. The only thing that saved the book was the ending. It was a really great ending. The narrator didn't seem too realistic, but then I didn't want a narrator who was too realistic because it would have been hard for me to get into this book if the narrator didn the same things that the main characters did. I'll be reading a lot more books like this one in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun and quick read that didn't overstay its welcome.   It's not a big book, but it is well written and contains some of my favorite characters, the "Gorges" and the "Fisheries."   The humor is a bit dry (and a bit too predictable in a couple of places) and it might have benefited from a bit more of an emotional component, but still very fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book, and even though I found it to be pretty weak on the overall plot I am happy with it as a standalone. I loved the description of the world, especially the descriptions of how it's been used in the past, and I loved how it made me imagine what a magical world would be like, and how different it might be from what we see in the movies or TV shows.   The setting was pretty cool too.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had an absolute blast reading The Way of Shadows. I loved the characters and the story. I loved that there were two endings to the book.   It's got a really good beginning and the ending was perfectly fitting. I think it's great to read books about women as they are so unique and often overlooked in fantasy books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in the market for a good cookbook last year, when I read this book. I am a big fan of Italian-American cuisine, so I was excited by the idea of learning how to prepare some of their favorites. I have been wanting to learn this cooking style for many years, but was hesitant about learning it from the cookbook's authors, especially as it was one of the most expensive books I saw on Amazon (it was $13.99!) I got my hands on a paperback edition and decided to give it a try. What a great book, I found the recipes very easy to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to enjoy Italian-style cooking, whether they are an old pro or a newcomer to the cuisine! I was so pleased when I received this book in the mail and took it to work, where I immediately had people asking me where they can find the Italian recipe for "fettuccine alfredo". I was also able to make the bread pudding with some of the recipes, which was delicious. I will definitely be looking for more of the book, and am already thinking about buying it again.   - Lisa S.  Review for Easy Recipes in an Italian Cookbook:  Yes, I would buy the cookbooks again. I like to cook Italian dishes at home but can be intimidated when it comes to recipes. This book has easy recipes from all the main Italian regions with great photos. The best part about the book are the great descriptions of the various dishes that are very similar in taste and preparation. For example, the fettuccini alfreda recipe that I made was wonderful and I liked the instructions on how to store it and then reheat it. I did cook the pasta to a very soft state. That will take you a bit longer but I believe it makes it taste better. There were a few recipes that I would have liked to see a bit clearer or more precise but overall I would give this cookbook five stars. - Stephanie M.  in Review for Easy Italian Recipes in the Italian Cook Book:  This cookbook is definitely worth the price. I've cooked with many of the dishes featured in this book and they have all turned out great. I do agree that the recipes are not always clear in some of them. - Melissa D. I have loved the recipes in this cook book. The author is a very experienced cook who knows her recipes inside and out.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book. The only thing I could wish for would be a glossary or an index.   I was surprised how many things I didn't know about this area, because it is so interesting to read about the historical context and the rise of the scientific method.  I enjoyed it, and recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most recent book I've read by Michael Flynn (the author of the best-selling The Black Banners, A Soldier of Fortune, and the recently finished War and Peace) is The Art of War: Napoleon's Last Campaign. As a history buff, I find that all of his books have a great historical perspective. As for his book on the Napoleonic Wars, Flynn does a brilliant job of drawing out the personalities and politics of the generals and admirals involved, and he does a good job of making sure we are not going to miss anything important in terms of the battles themselves. In addition, his writing style is so much more enjoyable than what I've come to expect from others. (I think I liked the first Flynn book I read that much better, but that was only the third or fourth book out of dozens.) This time, Flynn is writing about the early years of World War I. The French and British armies have not made great strides in the war since the First World War, but the Germans still have the upper hand. A German invasion, they think, would crush the French army completely. So when they are informed that the French are planning to take a new position on the western front and launch a major attack on a German flank at Auerstadt, French General Georges-René Laporte sends a small division to test the theory, but he fails. He was defeated. However, Laport is soon persuaded by a British officer, Sir Herbert Plumer, to try again. Laport sends his divisions on a desperate retreat to the eastern front, but there is no French support to aid them. Eventually, Laporete returns, and his French army is triumphant. However the success is short-lived. In the following years, France is divided, and Laport's French forces are defeated time and again by the Germans, but eventually he gets the upperhand and takes Breslau. The German general von Moltke takes control of the area as well and turns it into a German-controlled region and makes himself the ruler of the region. Meanwhile, Laporte is not doing well at all. During a meeting with his friend the British commander, William MacNicol, the two discuss their experiences in the First and Second World Wars. MacNickson gives an anecdote about how a few years earlier, MacNigan, a former British officer and one-time captain, had been given command of an infantry unit, and
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am really pleased with this book, I have read many, many books in the same style as this one. It seems to me, that some of the things you need to know in order to write a good story are really easy to find in books that do not follow that format, but the writing style of this book is quite different. If you are a fan of fantasy, science fiction, or historical fiction, this book should fit you nicely.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was impressed by the book, although I don't consider it a classic.   I'm not sure that any of these classic works can ever be improved upon, although some have come close.  The book has a few shortcomings.  There are some factual errors that don't make much sense, such as a quote from a book about The Battle of Gettysburg that is supposedly from a different source than the book I am using as reference.  I also think the book needs a bit more detail and detail on the historical people.  At some point in the story the author talks about people like Abraham Lincoln and James Fenimore Cooper who fought and were shot for their belief in the Union, and yet it seems to me that there's a disconnect between the character and the fact that the characters were executed for what they believed.  In my opinion, this does a disservice to the historical figures involved and could make the reader uncomfortable with the subject matter of the book.  An odd book that could use some work:  An odd book I found interesting and fun.  A bit hard to describe and I am not a scholar in the history of science, but it is a book where it takes a long time for it to get to the point.  It also features people who could be considered "science heroes," but the "science" is based on what other people were doing in the time period.  For example, a physicist, Isaac Newton, had a theory that he thought would be the final answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything.  But the way Newton presented his theory, people who didn't agree with his theory were called "Newtons" because they were the last to accept his theory.  This is a good example of a book that I found hard to get into.  As it has no plot I found myself enjoying the chapters, but I couldn't tell if the book was really good or not. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book.  It has some similarities to other stories that have been written in the past by others.  One thing that sets it apart is the great use of metaphors in the story and the strong connection between two children that makes them feel like they are part of the story.  This isn't a "classic" story. This is like the best kind of story where the message that is being conveyed is powerful enough that even a 6 year old will be able to understand. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good story or a good way to understand some of the things that go on in this world.  I highly recommend it!   Read more of this review...

Write a positive review about a good book:   What do you get when you cross a book written by a man and a woman? What I got was a book that both is an excellent and a challenging read. I would recommend this book to any woman who's felt that she is not a strong person, and who wants to get stronger and stronger. I have seen a lot of "how can I be a better woman" books but this one is much more practical, and is more down to earth. The author, who I think was the mother of a few boys in the group, is a very compassionate and caring person and this book is filled with her wisdom. If you are a woman who thinks she is weak, I think this book will change your perspective, and may lead to an overall change in attitude. A great read that will leave you inspired and will help you achieve your goals. I love the fact that the author of this book has created a place for females to gather and share their strength and help them achieve their goals. It has definitely been a learning experience for me. The women were incredibly supportive and uplifted each other to overcome their own obstacles, and the book even included a quiz to gauge each person's strength level. I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone who wants a real boost for achieving their goals! "It wasn't long before the women were running in place, their muscles pulsing with each bound. At least once a day, a girl would break down and cry, "I've never been so strong" or "I'm so excited to do this project," as if their whole world were spinning inside. This sense of pride was contagious." "The ladies who participated in this group are some of the toughest people you'll ever meet. It is a true triumph to see a woman in full flight." "I never want to be like those weak, pathetic, weak little girls. I want to live up to the standards of strength shown by these women. I am so, so proud to be a part of a program that can help make that dream a reality." "These ladies are so strong, I can't even begin to imagine it." "After we had finished up the last run, we started talking about how tough it must be for these girls to be in such good shape, considering they have no children and no one to encourage them." "One thing I noticed about the women in this program is that everyone seemed to have an extraordinary level of discipline, and no matter what
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Good Earth is a story of a boy and his father, and the struggles they are facing to raise their son and their family. This is not the story of an evil world or a monster. It is the story we all must live by; how to be true to ourselves, to love ourselves and to be loved in return. This book is a wonderful little picture of what a good life really is, a life where the good and the bad are not so far apart from each other.   I did have one minor nitpick with the book though. As the father and son struggle to grow up, I was slightly annoyed that they didn't learn how to grow into their bodies and become adults earlier. Instead, the father was forced to struggle for a while until the boy started to mature (which, to be fair, happened after they had left the village where they lived in a log cabin for a long time). This would've been a very interesting story if it had gone the other way around and the father started to grow and mature as he was struggling to get old.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed the books in this series. They were all good. The first two series (Book 1 and Book 2) really showed the magic of the wizarding world and what it can do, as well as how much the wizard would love to be able to do magic as a hobby. They show the way to get into magic and also teach a bit about how it works. I also liked how some of the books have a more humorous tone, which is a little jarring in the previous series, but works well in this one. However, some of them are kind of slow and drag in the later books as well, but it's more for plot reasons. I'd recommend the first two books in the series to anyone. The third book I'd like to read myself but won't be buying in paperback. The fourth book is interesting but the magic is kind of strange and not as exciting as what I was expecting from the second two books.   The only thing I could have done with the fourth book (Book 5) was the same as the one I did with Book 3. The plot is still good, but I feel that it has lost a little bit of it's focus. I was not in love with the story line, which just dragged on and on. It's really not all that exciting and I find it hard to really get invested in any of the plot points. Maybe if I reread the book a few more times.  I had no expectations for the fifth book, but wow did I not think this book was going to be any good at all. I honestly wasn't prepared for the story to go the way it did. I felt like the plot point which I expected to be the most important one to the plot was barely touched upon and the plot twist I didn't see coming completely missed the mark. If you are expecting a continuation of Book 3, I'd say you were just wrong.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a fascinating, original, and beautifully constructed book. The authors have done a wonderful job of telling the story of how some of the greatest minds of our time met to share ideas and solve problems on topics that were not considered scientific or of interest to them when they were young. In short, the authors have written an engrossing account of some of our most brilliant people having an important exchange of ideas about a very broad range of important topics and problems. The book was a joy to read and to follow.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! In a nutshell, The War of the Worlds will have you guessing if the book really is a hoax. It's so well written, you will almost think it's real. The novel ends with a nice, big bang that will make you think twice about letting your family members or friends listen to the radio again. I can see why George RR Martin would've done this novel, especially since it's written in the same style and style in which he wrote A Game of Thrones.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because the author is a friend.   He has an interesting and unique perspective on the business of writing.  There are some very useful exercises and I learned a lot from them.  I have used the exercises in several of my own novels, and the techniques have had a big impact on my writing. The book is geared toward professional writers who want to improve their craft.  The author is very upfront about not knowing everything, and he is generous with his advice and examples.  Also, he has a great way of describing the way a novel or short story is made up of different parts and how they work together.  Overall, this book is a very good book to read if you want to get more out of writing and have a little fun along the way.  The author says:  To be a good writer is to be good at knowing when to stop.  It's the act of stopping, at the end of a long, exhausting day, that reveals a lot about a writer's true creative nature.  This book teaches the skills you need to tell good stories, and it's a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think I finally got around to reading the "Tales of Beedle the Bard"   this was not a book I'd given much thought to but I read the summary and I was pleasantly surprised. The book was told from the point of view of a young girl named Gellert Grindelwald (who was the grandson of Gellir Grindelwold) and her life was affected by the story that came before it. It was actually the first in a series but the books are all connected and I love that aspect of the story.   For the record I've never been fond of the Harry Potter series but as far as a children's book goes, it's definitely worth reading.  Sandra Doremus, the daughter of the book's main character, is a very young witch. Like many of the witches in the story she has suffered in life and it's only her ability to read (which is not really all that great as most witches are more apt to speak) that keeps her from becoming a Dark witch. This is one of the things that makes her a lot more like the other witches in this story: she's also a bit clumsy and rather socially inept, but she's smart, clever and pretty. One of the major themes of the series is that magic is good and a very powerful force, but it's always been very hard to use it and use it correctly (and I'm not saying that is an issue for all witches, just that in this book Gellort's father has a rather strange and rather dark view of magic, he's a rather arrogant guy, and I couldn't agree more with him). I thought the author captured the sense of the characters and of the world well, particularly in the way they talked. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most important thing about reading this book is the book itself.   I am not sure if it is the story, or the characters, or just the overall plot that is so compelling, but I truly liked it all.  I think it was just all of them.  At least until the end.  The narrator was a little annoying at times, but it did nothing but add to the overall story.  Overall, a fun and enjoyable read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Like a good coffee: the best when you really want a drink. The best with a good story.   I am a book lover, but my tastes have changed a little bit. When I first started reading this book I really loved it. I enjoyed the story, and the characters. But I got tired of the author's use of the first person. I thought the characters were weak, and that the story was too predictable. So I read a second book and I loved this one even more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     As the title says this book really gave me chills!   I bought this book because of the review at Goodreads which recommended it, and I couldn't wait to try it. I bought this based on a review by a friend, he gave this book 5 stars and recommended it too. I liked the review so I had to give it a try.   So the book is about a child who lives with his uncle, a farmer and a fisherman and his daughter. His uncle has no son so he has adopted this girl to help raise his own son. When the baby boy is four he is taken by the family dog who is a cat. The dog is actually the cat's daughter, she is very mean, and has no personality at all.   at first this seems like a good idea as the child really needs the help. the problem is that the family has a very old dog named 'Nose' who doesn't want anything to do with children and is the reason no one wants to take the baby son to the family. So eventually Nose turns on the family and starts taking children.   in order to save his son he has to learn to speak to the baby girl and he has no clue what to do, it gets so bad the boy has to run away to his grandmother, she sends the baby home with him but the grandmother wants the baby back because she doesn't know what to believe.  . The child's name is Jack, he's not very intelligent, but he's got a huge heart and is willing to put his life on the line for his friends and family and in order for this to happen he must overcome his fear of animals, he has an incredible mind and always knows what to say when someone is upset or has a problem. His grandmother is a very caring, loving and loving woman who is very protective of her grandson and the boy's only friend is Jack's sister. There are a few other kids and a very weird but funny dog in this book, it's a pretty long book, but it's well written and very emotional at some points so I didn't feel left out. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is pretty well done, the only thing I didn,t like was that it wasn't about the family, it was more about Jack the child.  I gave it 4 stars for the ending but it made me cry a lot! The ending was very good, I loved that she saved him

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a general rule, I tend to try to avoid any kind of "hater" book. It seems almost unprofessional to judge a book based on the fact that it may be hated by people who hate others, or by people whose tastes in books may vary from person to person. I've read this book before, and I loved it, so I was excited to read it again, and especially to review it again.   I'm usually not one to read books about the Middle East, but I must admit to liking the book enough to write a review.  Picking up the book was actually a little difficult for me, because I don't usually go for non-fiction books that are just about Middle Eastern stuff.  Most of the stuff I tend toward is written by Muslims and other Arabs that has to do with the Islamic world, and even then I don "t necessarily buy anything by Arabs.  "   At the very least, it would have been nice to have the book about other Middle East countries.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are not a big fan of the "Lord of the Rings" series or even Tolkien's books generally, don't read this. The story is about a warrior named Balin (who we'll get to later) and his wife who both go insane while waiting for the return of their son. The book is well written, but not a masterpiece. The pacing is a little off, the characters are a little two dimensional, and the ending is kinda lame. However, I think that Tolkien's stories were good because he was an excellent story teller. I hope to find some good stories and more good stories. Read the first part of this book, the rest will follow. If you want a good read about a strong female character who is fighting a good fight, then " The Witch " should be your next adventure.

Draco and Draco's relationship was more interesting than Harry/Ginny's. The author is very well versed in the Harry/Daphne love story and has made a good Harry/ Draco story. I think this will be a good read.   "I love you." Draco whispered. "I always have. You've been through the wringer, you're a good person, and I'm happy that I could spend more time with you."   "Yes, I understand." She sighed. "It's not easy being a single mother. It is more challenging than anyone thinks. You have done a wonderful job raising me. I'm so proud to have you in my life." "I love my children too." Draco kissed her on the cheek. "We are very close, though, are we not?" He looked down at her. "You mean you don't think I should marry someone else?" "Yes," she said with a smile. "Draco, I'm just saying." Draco laughed. "Really? I thought we were pretty far into that." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like how you did your homework on the characters. The author's style and writing were very easy to pick up and understand. The characters are all very distinct.  I enjoyed the story and characters. I would like to see some more action, though.
Write a positive review about a good book:    (This review is a review for the first edition of this book) I've found myself enjoying this book and that is what I've read the last dozen times. I started reading the book about two weeks ago and have already finished it. The story and the characters are very realistic to me. I feel that I understand these people and how they think and interact with each other and others. I'm not saying the story is perfect, but I have seen better stories with less fluff and less unnecessary details than this one. There are some scenes in this book that I wish had been more detailed, such as some of the moments in the beginning where the woman doesn't really look at the situation that is going on with a child in a restaurant. The details are very important to me, so I can't help but wish that there were a bit more in there. I also really wish that some of those scenes with the women were a little longer. I wish that they could have been a few more pages, but the story works for me anyway. I know that people have different views on this book as to whether or not it was "great". In my opinion, if you enjoy stories about people who don't give a crap, I guess this book is for you. For me, I'm glad I have read it and I am looking forward to reading more.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must have for every student's library. It contains great pictures, and is full of interesting information. I highly recommend this book to all students interested in reading about the history of English and history of science.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book to get away from the constant political propaganda and the false accusations from both left and right. My rating is based on how much I enjoyed the book. The book has many different elements that make it worth reading. If you are not ready to read the whole book, read the first 50 or so pages. Then when you get into the meat of the book, do so and come back for the end. The first half of the whole thing is very well written. It's not perfect by any means, but it's a solid book. There are very few mistakes and there is a lot of substance in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book, but it has some errors.   Some of the pictures in the book are quite a bit out of scale.  I have seen many of these pictures used in other works, and they look much better in this book.  The story is interesting and a good way to make money in the industry.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My mom always used to say when I was a child "It is your destiny to become an awesome writer."   So this book was perfect for me!   This book is about a woman who's mother died suddenly, leaving her a legacy of her own.   The author does a good job in getting us to relate to the emotions that a parent's death can cause, and then the author takes the opportunity to address the larger issues of what she calls "The Death of the Mother."  This is a good story, that does not just focus on the parents.  The characters are realistic and the emotional moments are well done.  It's all about the death and how it affects a family, that is a very difficult process.  The book really gets into the dynamics of a family and how that affects each person.  This is a great book to read if you are a parent and want to see the loss of a parent or a child and how those changes can affect the family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story was really good. This was my first YA book so I had no idea what to expect. I thought it was about 3 or 4 stars but was actually about 4 and a half. The setting was cool, and it was definitely a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I was looking for a book to give a good review about and this is it. The only thing I noticed was that the author was being very negative about the book and I feel he might be over reacting.   I don't believe this is an accurate portrayal of what happened.  This is what happens when you try to change the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the entire series in a single sitting, so I have only read the first book (which is good, but far from great). The story is good and enjoyable, even though it isn't the best I've ever read, so if you don't like this, that's okay, but if you do, I recommend this for you.     Review:  This series is fantastic!   It is so good, you can't wait for the next book!    
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion this book will prove very useful. I find the details of the operation to be very important. I do find it odd, however, that the author assumes that a machine like the C-47 will be available in the future. Although the description of the C and V planes is accurate, this doesn't mean that you can fly them in the next century.   From this point on, the book becomes more interesting, but the basic information is excellent. I did not like the explanation of the mechanics of the V plane (there were other authors I tried to read more about this in a magazine), but I did like the descriptions of the operations of the B, C, and G planes.  There are many more interesting and well-written articles about the planes in the CACAC (Chickasaw Aircraft Commission) publication.  Recommended as an invaluable resource for anyone with a small plane or even a small helicopter.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can't believe that this book is about a black woman who falls in love with a white man. I know that it's a romantic novel and that it does have a black man in it but it's so over the top and unrealistic. It was so funny at first but then it started to get really boring and ridiculous. I did laugh a few times but that was it.   Recommended: No
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book. If you can read, you need this book. I love the art, the atmosphere, the story, the plot, etc. There is a plot twist at the end that is so well done I almost cried. I am definitely buying the next book. Thank you for such a beautiful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read the first three chapters of this book, which are a "how-to" for creating a working email marketing campaign for clients. The first few chapters are about what email marketing is not, and what it is. Then comes the actual how-to. I'm sure the author is an experienced marketing and sales person, but it is pretty easy to read a book on email marketing without realizing it's very technical and not so easy to implement the best practices you're trying to learn. That's why I read the book as a good place to learn how to start a campaign, but the "how to" is really all you need to do.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book at a library sale, and now I'm obsessed with it.    As a child, I always wanted to be a vampire.  But I couldn't.  This book changed that for me.  In one of the stories, a child dies of a nasty cut on his forehead.  The doctor tells him that his parents are going to have to take care of him.  So he takes off.  At this point the book has got to be an amazing horror-romance, but it's not that easy.  They don't have vampires in their world, but they have a "vampire doctor" who can give people magical healing powers.  Unfortunately, this doctor is a bit of a jerk.  However, when his patient dies, he uses his powers to turn the boy's friends into vampiric teenagers (a sort of child-vampire hybrid), and all of the teenagers are really nice and helpful.  Now I'm hooked!  I'm going to read the rest of the book, to make sure that it doesn't get stale.  Recommended!  (reviewed 27 days after purchase) I wanted to love this book, but I didn't. The story is fantastic, but the plot doesn't hold together well at all, and the story could have been expanded a lot more.  If you like a good dark urban fantasy, then this book is for you.  It also has a nice ending!  It was a little scary at times, and I don't know what the plot was going to be.  There were a couple of cliffhangers that were so unnecessary, I didn' t want them to happen.  This is a great book, and so was the cover.  I think I will be purchasing the rest to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a pretty good book to read if you are going through a rough patch. I have a strong dislike for all sorts of religious-type stuff and I don't particularly like the idea that one of these bad books is going to get me to heaven. But this book doesn't really have anything against religion, nor does it have much of a good thing to say about anything. In fact, it's pretty much all bad things, which is a little disappointing. However, if you're not religious, you might find a lot of the book interesting. Also, as long as you're ok with the author saying stuff like "God" more than the Bible, then it's worth reading. The worst part about it is that it makes a good deal of what the author has to say sound like some very silly, over-the-top, or overly preachy things. But even though it might sound like that, I'm actually a big believer in things that are good and good for the world. If the author of this book had just said what I believe he actually believes, then he wouldn't have sounded so preachy. However the book is not very good, so you can't really judge his claims on their own. If it weren't for the "Good Book" sticker on the front, I would probably never have read it. In a way, it kind of makes me want to go to heaven just for the heck of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I loved this book. I enjoyed the characters and the storyline, the characters in the book did have a few character flaws but for the most part they were very believable and their interactions with each other was a lot of fun. I thought the main character was the main point of the story. This is the first book where I felt that the main male character could be a guy with a disability or a character that's more like a gay or bisexual male."
Write a positive review about a good book:   I started this book because I am an avid reader of sci-fi/fantasy and enjoyed the two previous books by Mark Lawrence. I especially enjoyed the introduction, which explained the characters and setting. I will probably be reading the rest of this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book in this collection! I would like to know more about the story of the book itself and the characters involved. As far as the book, I enjoyed the story line and the character development.   Thanks for making this series! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very pleased with this book, and I have already read the second book (and it is even better) by the same author. The story was very well written, and the story was told well enough that I couldn't wait to get the next book. I think that if you do a good job writing a good story, and writing it well enough for people to be able to read it, you can make a decent profit, especially if the first book is really good. You can't take anything away from this book except that it was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. (I mean, seriously? It wasn't too hot! And it's not a "literary" book. It's not supposed to be literary. It was supposed to just be fun!)
Write a positive review about a good book:      A book that will be in my bookshelf forever. A new friend to read with my grandson. I love the book because it is very different from other stories of the time period. It gives a real view of the times. The author is not trying to be like the other authors of the day, but is telling her own unique tale. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  I love the cover of this book! I especially love the fact that it has a picture of a giant head as the cover image! My sis is a huge fan of this author and her books, so she was thrilled when she found this one and I am sure she will be very happy with the rest as well!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am giving this book a 4/5.   It is a well written and clear read.  I have read about about 200 different kinds of books on a variety of topics.  To be honest I am a big fan of The Secret as I have been looking for it for ages.  It really does bring home the importance of your thoughts. I am not sure what else I would add but perhaps someone can tell me? I hope so because it is a fantastic book to have in your collection.  Write a negative review about the worst book ever:  What an awful book! I hate it.  This book makes my stomach churn and makes me feel like a bad person.  Why anyone would want to buy this, I have no idea but, I'm not buying it. "The Secret" is the third book in a series by author Lisa Smee.  She has written other books about relationships and the effect of drugs in the lives of both men and women, but this one deals with women. The story is told in a number of vignettes, each of which follows the actions of a particular woman in a variety different settings.  In the book, the narrator's husband has been addicted to meth and is doing the same in his wife.  After her suicide, she has become a recovering addict and she takes on the role of an enabler of her husband's addiction, as he takes her advice to help him clean up.  The narrator is an old friend and confidante of hers who helps her cope with the changes in her life.  Even though she has had a few brushes with addiction herself, the reader learns that she is still very dependent on her husband.  What makes this book worse is the fact that her husband does not even take the advice to keep their affair secret as she has warned.  Despite her advice, he goes to the police and eventually her life is ruined.  He is put in jail and she is given a long prison sentence and no chance to see him.  When her husband goes to prison, she is forced to leave the city, although she is aware she will be able to return once she is released.   Smeecks third book is a very unkind book and even though the author makes no excuses for her husband, she still blames him for everything that goes wrong.  The last two books in the series are great and I recommend them to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was good to see that this series continues to be a worthwhile story that still has new ideas for the audience to appreciate. The art is good, the plot makes sense, and the characters are developed. It's really been awhile since I've read a story this good. Highly Recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really excited to read this book. It's my first foray into the fantasy/sci-fi genre and I'm looking forward to a great story. The world building and world building only make me want to read more books from this author.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite books of 2013. It was the first book I read about women in the military, and the fact that they were so well done is amazing. There are a lot of interesting facts about the women and their families that I didn't know, like how the military forced some wives to "pump breast milk" into a baby to keep it from being rejected. I've been to Vietnam and Korea and I thought the women there were super strong and determined, and so this book makes me want to do the same. One of the best parts of this book was the "Pigpen" section, where the author describes some of the things that happened after he left the Army. I don't have any of the military documents here, but I think the part where he talks about how he got back into porn was pretty spot on, and it makes me a little sad to see so many great men gone.  "Sitting on the edge of the bed and trying to imagine what the future held...I felt a terrible weight lift from my chest. I'd done it."  -Pig Pen

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is very good. The story has a nice story, but the characters and plot have some problems. I don't know if the author is a little over-eager to write in this genre, or if this is just a case of "this is where I am. I have to write about this." She has a lot of good ideas in here, but her characterizations are a little too realistic and not enough quirky. That being said, it's still a very fun read. I'm going to give it a 5, because it's better than I expected.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very interesting and well-written book that has helped me improve my Spanish.   The book is great for students of Spanish and people like me who want to learn more about this fascinating language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is much more to a good story than the plot, the characters, and the author's style.   In this story, the author made a good effort to introduce a character that is well thought out and written, a well thought-out plot that is complex and fun to follow, and a compelling story that manages to make you care about two characters.  In short, the story has a good flow, a good ending, and good characters. Not bad for a short novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I really like the way it is laid out.   There are some good ideas here, some bad ideas (for the most part), and some great ideas (again, mostly the bad ones).   Overall, I was really glad I read this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, it was quite a bit different from the books I usually read. The story is quite compelling, but is also quite funny. The main character, Nick, is very different from most of the other heroes I've read about, especially since Nick's not a typical protagonist. I didn't expect Nick to be a hero of the people, but that's what I got. It also made it very enjoyable to read about Nick's adventures, while other books have been quite dry. Overall I had a great time reading this book and recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book quite a bit. While a lot of the book was about the early years of the space program, there were plenty of references to the more recent years. The book had a lot more space history and science information that what the book by NASA actually said. The main character in the book, William A. McCool, had the opportunity to observe many different things that had happened during his time, but in the end chose to go to the moon. He also is more involved in the space community now than when the book started. The first part of the science section was pretty dry, but as the story progressed it was fun. I liked the idea that the first two attempts to get into space had failures, but the third attempt was made when the government and its scientists were much more in tune with the space industry. I also liked the part about space suits and how we are always worried about leaks in those. It was a fun read for sure.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is very good. I'm still learning, but there is enough here to make a good, thoughtful book.   My parents read this to me as we were reading. I liked how it wasn't just a story for teenagers and I like how it's an adventure story.      I liked the story, but I wish they had gone a bit further in creating the cast of characters. The book isn't all action, some of the characters are not as interesting as the main ones and there's some bad things happening. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author does a good job with his characters, as a lot of them have flaws which I found quite endearing, and I enjoyed all of the scenes.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I loved this book. I was very disappointed at first because I thought it was a joke. Then I saw the cover and realized it wasn't. It's really good and I'm glad the author thought of that. And that the book is about a guy who loves dogs so much he just had to make a book out of it." --The author's own words. " I love reading. I'm lucky enough to have lots of pets around, but I don't read to them. This book was my chance to show them to someone who loves them too. If the authors could have made a dog book, then I would have been fine. But a guy's first book is all about his dogs. Not a big surprise there." --Another reviewer, adding their own "I love this book" (also the author's words) I've always loved dogs, but this book got my attention. I love the author -- he wrote some real good stories in it. I loved the author, so this was an easy choice. "   My cat loves this book (and so does my dog). The story was cute. It got a good rating from everyone who read it. " --My dog loved it too. " A very well written book, a little dry, but with good stories. I just wish it had a little more of a plot." --One of the few reviewers who really liked it. So I've decided to give this book four stars instead of three. I'll keep it a three because the cover (not really his fault), the book description, and the title all say three stars and this one has four. But the writing, the story, and my dog love for this book make me give it four. Also:  If you do get a copy of this book, do not buy the original. It was probably written as a joke, and they printed it as such. But if you want the book, please don't buy the "new" edition, which has changed the story and makes it very different.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. The writing is great and it covers quite a bit.

Review: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R Tolkien is a monumental feat of fantasy. It's the final volume of Tolkien's beloved trilogy. This is one of the most complex and interesting fantasy series of all time. Tolkien took his story from The Lord Of The Rings and expanded it with over half a million words into a truly epic story. The series has sold over 70 million copies worldwide and has inspired a whole generation of fantasy fans. The trilogy is based on the classic book and film of the same name by J R R Tolkien. The second novel in the series, The Return Of The King, is also set in Middle-earth. It tells of a battle of good against evil in the lands of the living. It was the first novel in what would become a seven-volume epic cycle called The LordOfTheRings.   The books have been compared to the works of J. R. R Tolkien himself. It is no secret that many Tolkien fans are devoted to the books and have read them all. It seems as if everyone has an opinion about the books; some are even devoted to their preservation (although the books are being increasingly read in digital format, so no worries there). But which is the best? How do we rate The Lord In The Rings as a work of fiction, as a series of books, and as a cultural touchstone? Let's take a look.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've really enjoyed this book, I think it's a really well-written story with really interesting concepts.

I've read a few books about the 'War of the Worlds' and this one was just a little bit more of a realistic tale. In this case we learn that a radio broadcast was received by all the radio stations on the planet at the same time, causing them to panic and report the aliens are on their way. "We can hear the sounds of their approaching ship, the waves of panic as they take their departure."    The main characters of the story are a pair of scientists, who find themselves on a hostile planet that is rapidly becoming uninhabitable. They must take refuge with the natives (we never hear their names, but it could be either a race of aliens, or just humans that just got a bad deal) and use the radio to broadcast their plight.      The story doesn't really feel rushed. I think they could have gone a little further and explained the circumstances behind the 'incidents'. That could have added a little more depth to the story.   It's very interesting to see the world through the eyes of a human, seeing the differences between Earth and this other planet.   It's a very good story that could be a good read to a wide range of people.     (review of commercial product) Summary: A group of scientists have received a radio transmission that they believe is from another planet. In fact, it is from their own planet.  The scientists soon discover that the aliens have come for the very Earth they have made for them. As the conflict spreads from Earth to the entire galaxy, the scientists are forced to make a desperate decision.   The War of the World's (in-game name) is a science-fiction/romance book set in a fictional setting of the Star Trek/Doctor Who universe.  The story is set in the late twenty-first century where a radio signal from another planetary system is broadcast into space.  An angry military force is sent to the planet and discovers it is already being occupied by
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first three books of this series have had me excited for a new series. I love the idea of the main characters being able to learn how to use magic as a career in their adult lives. The magic is well done, the plot is enjoyable and a definite plus.    An excellent story about a family with a magic legacy:  By all accounts the first three novels in the Inheritance Trilogy were a disappointment to me. I really loved the world-building of the series, and liked the way that all the various cultures interacted, but I felt that the characters fell short. In particular, I felt as though it was a bit too convenient that all of the characters had the exact same backstory, so there wasn't much depth to their characters and their relationships. The main characters in Inheritance 2, however, are so much better than their predecessors, that I would recommend that anyone who is looking for a fun, exciting, magical, and interesting world-builder read the Inheritence Trilogy.  This series had a lot of potential:  I was intrigued by the Inheritor trilogy when I heard that it was going to be written as three books; it's a series that I had never heard of before, and the synopsis was intriguing enough to warrant looking into the series. The series has great world-making potential, and in addition to having a great plot, the characters have a great deal to say about their family, the world, and themselves.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased The Hobbit, an English translation of J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, a trilogy about an isolated hobbit living in a small village in the Middle East and his adventures in the Second World War. The translation is pretty much flawless; it reads like a proper prose storybook, with no problems. It's a very enjoyable read, a bit more serious than I'd like it to be, but it's good enough to warrant a four-star rating for me.   It's not the best translation of the series, as a number of modern Tolkien fans have pointed out, but if you want a good, well-written, easy read, you should definitely pick it up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I did not think I could like this book, so I gave it a try. It is a good read.   It is one of those stories where I am surprised that someone is still making films. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is a must-read for anyone who has ever experienced any type of interpersonal trauma. It is a wonderful and accessible introduction to healing."     "The depth of what's in the book is astonishing. I hope that this book, which I have already downloaded to my Kindle, will be useful for the many people who have not seen a mental health professional in years. It may also help other family members and friends of those who have been abused or victimized by this evil practice. It's a real eye-opener." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently got the chance to read the new book by a former member of the International Olympic Committee. He describes some of the problems at the IOC that have gone unpunished.  I have the book and have not read it yet but I am excited to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book a lot.   The main characters are likeable, even though they are different.  The only thing that I did not like was how the world ends at the end, but I understand why it is like that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book to review and have been wanting to read it. I am glad that I got this book in the box since I already own many of the books in the series. I'm glad that the series is complete because I did not feel like I was missing anything by not reading these books in between the other books.   I do have to complain about a few things. First, it's odd that they only include the first five books in each series and not the other two. The other books have some very good writing.  Second, although this book is set during the First Crusade, there isn't any of the historical fact about that time which could have been added.  In conclusion, the series was very well written and it was a very enjoyable read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book is good for anyone with an interest in the paranormal or history.    The main character is really smart, but the writing style could use some work.  I did not enjoy the ending.  The book is written in a very traditional style, so I can only give it a 3 star rating.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many books about the Holocaust and this book has helped me understand it better.   It's a great story that shows us what went on and why it happened.  It will also teach us what is truly important about the Jews in history.  I like the fact that the author includes many interesting facts that the average reader will not find in most Holocaust books. I recommend this book and recommend it for all Jews to read.  The History of the Jews of Poland, from its Early Beginnings to the Great World War by Edward R. Murrow, Jr. (1968)  For Jews, the most important part of history is what happens before the Holocaust, but the Holocaust was so big that even that important part had to be left out of the "official" Holocaust story. That is why the most widely read book about the holocaust is not the diary of Anne Frank but the one written by the great American reporter, the late Edward R, Murrow, about the last days of the Warsaw Ghetto. The author is a Jew and has never shied away from confronting his own Jewish heritage or being sensitive in presenting the Jewish situation to the West. He takes us from the time of the Jewish revolt of 1776 through the time when the ghetto was destroyed in 1944 and even into the period after the war. The book gives an insider's view of the situation in a time and place where most other histories were written in terms of the past, not about the future. I highly recommend this work to all Jewish history buffs. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is quite funny.   The only problem is that there are many good books that are less funny (I love J. K. Rowling).  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't think I will ever read another YA book that is as good as this one. It's great that they have gone to all the trouble of putting a book like this into print.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be one of the best books I've ever read. I liked the story very much, but was bothered by the ending. The author goes into great detail on her personal experience (her husband died in the 9/11 attack), but the end comes off as rushed and doesn't give us an opportunity to feel for her. But overall, this is a really good book. I especially loved the book's title.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a fan of historical fantasy and are looking for something new, this book will satisfy your cravings. It isn't a fantasy that is a mix of some of the best elements from other fantasy genres, it is something new altogether. This book has a story that can stand on its own two feet. While there is an element of historical fiction to this story, this is not a retelling of a true story. The world building is solid and interesting and there is a lot of depth to the characters and their experiences. It will appeal to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and likes a good adventure.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this a couple weeks ago and it's the third book I've read by John Scalzi. I'm a big fan of science fiction, and I love his books, and this one is a great example of the genre.  I liked that he put some of the humor in his work, and at times the humor was really good (and it sometimes felt like it might be at least partly a comedy of errors).   The book also has a bit of an action/adventure element, though not as much as some of his other books, though you can definitely feel the action.   If you're a science fiction fan and you're looking for a good adventure book, this is the book to read.  This book is about two brothers and a girl, the girl is a witch who has been exiled for being a witch.  The brother is a scientist.  One of the things I liked about the book is that Scalzi went out of his way to show that science and magic are very different worlds. In science, you're very focused on trying to understand the world and build it, and the main characters are doing that in the book. In magic, the main character (the witch) uses her magic to travel from one location to another, and in the end that's what the book was about.  There's nothing in this book that was a revelation to me, and everything I already knew, but still, I like a good mystery book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " This book is really well put together. The author is able to explain everything in detail and to have all the information in an easy to understand format is quite a feat. It will take the average reader a good while to get used to the terminology and the grammar, but once they do there is a nice sense of understanding of how it all fits together, and what the real purpose is. I found it easy to follow, and the explanations for many different subjects was helpful. If I could rate this book five stars it would be 5 stars. "

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had heard about this book many years ago when I was a young lad. I had to buy it, I liked it so much that I bought a second one, and then bought a third. I was very pleased with these books. The stories are good, and the pictures are good. I read the first two books at school before I knew that the other books were also by John le Carré. I have had this book since I was about 13. It is always on my bedside table. - April 18, 2010A great read
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always been interested in spirituality. I've read the Bible several times. My mother and father are ministers. I have a spiritual life now.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good story, well written and with a good ending.   There were some small flaws I found though, and some issues I would like to see addressed before a final rating:  A lot of people I talked to about this story were critical of the ending, which was just about as unexpected as you'd expect in a book with a happy ending. I personally think the ending is great and I think the author has made some really good decisions about the characters.  There's also a lot of action and lots of death in the final chapters.  I'm not sure how you can leave your characters in a happy place in this book.  Overall, though, this is a great book and I would recommend it to any fan of fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must read for anyone interested in the history of Christianity. The author is not a professional historian or a scholar of the Middle East, so this is an accessible, well written and comprehensive history of how the Bible changed and adapted to the cultures of the day. It is certainly not the last word on the subject, but it is a very good introduction.    9 of 10 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    There's something about this book that makes me excited about how it will be remembered by the generations that will follow me.   I have to believe that many of the things said about this author by other people who have read this book will be as true as mine was.  But, it is an absolute work of genius and I'll be forever grateful for having gotten the chance to try one of the best, and most beautiful, books I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an interesting story and very well written. It does not focus on the typical hero/heroine relationship. The male protagonist is an ex-convict. He was set on fire by his wife, when she wanted to get rid of him, and had to figure out a way to make it pay off. The female protagonist, who was a housewife, had to learn how to deal with her ex's criminal past and help him out. The book is not a classic crime romance, though, because of the way it deals with the two main characters.   The romance was somewhat predictable. It is a good read, however. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. The author, Richard W. Pynchon, takes you on a trip down memory lane by bringing back and retelling some of his favorite stories. The characters in this book are all very likable, and the story just flows nicely from one thing to the next. I particularly liked the stories about the two women. This book is not a light read. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through, and if you're a fan of the author's work, you will not be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a couple of the books in my YA library and they were really good.   Unfortunately, one of the best in the collection is being reissued as an e-book a while after the first edition was published.  So what is the point of having a library if you don't have a copy of one of your favorites?  The story is a little corny but not too much so.  It's a classic with a twist which is exactly what I love about this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a word: Awesome. This book is a great reminder that one's self worth can be built and strengthened when one follows a path that they truly love. The book helps bring in the new found appreciation for the value of hard work and hard work alone. The author has written a beautiful book that not only helps new and experienced yoga instructors alike, but also those who aspire to be like her in the very best sense of the word, as well as those who need a good reminder. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not sure if this book is "good" or not. The prose is so good and the content so much. The story itself is so engrossing and the ending just has to be read. I would highly recommend this book for those looking for a unique fantasy read that has a unique plot.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Loved the book, and loved the book's ideas" "This is a wonderful book. The whole book is a model for any writer to follow, and I hope they all use this book as they write." "This is not a typical book about writing. It's more about the craft of storytelling as it applies to the writing of science fiction." I like how it focuses on what makes a story work.   The book is about using the reader's imagination and their emotions.  The book describes a few different kinds of writing and uses the science of story writing to explain how these things affect a story.  "I have no doubt that we've all heard the expression, "If you have to ask why, you don't understand." Well, I have no doubts about that either. It is so easy to tell people why something is good, but what's so hard about using your imagination and your heart?" My favorite part of the book is when it describes how the author uses what they write to build their character:   "The thing that makes the reader feel the most empathy and understanding for the character is when they can think back to when they felt those feelings themselves. This was the hardest thing to write for me, but it's not at all a weakness." The only thing I don't like about this book is the last chapter.  One of the things that I find difficult to do in fiction is use the reader as a proxy for my own character.  I always use the characters' actions and thoughts to illustrate how I feel about the situation or what I want the reader to think about.  It seems that the author just used the reader and his feelings to explain the character.   There's a lot of criticism that this is "pointless" writing.  Here's my response:    If the book didn't have a protagonist and the author was completely selfish, that would make it no better than any other short story. In fact, that's exactly the point.  For a good story, you have two people talking about the same thing.  This book didn, and maybe even still does, resonate with me because there is no character. The author used the book to show how it would be if the author were in that situation.  The point isn't that you have the character, it's that you're talking about that character. I find that when I read a book about what it's like
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is a very interesting man, who is able to take care of himself, as well as have a good friendship. The art is also nice, but not so good as it was with "The Sword and the Sorcerer" or "Dragonlance." This time, the artist draws the men's clothes and the women's hair in the same style, which makes it look even more like some sort of parody of fantasy fantasy manga. The only problem is that the manga is long, but it's a good read nonetheless.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love it, it's been a great gift! My students are enjoying this book so much! The teacher even mentioned that we should check the book in class again! Thanks for all your work in creating this book! I highly recommend it!  How to improve writing by Rolfe B. Jones I read this book over a year ago now. I loved it as a student. Now as an adult I would say that the teacher needs to get this book out more often to help students improve on their writing.   What is a good way to improve a writer? The key is learning how to make sure you write in the voice that you're comfortable with. In other words, you have to try a lot of different styles and styles and keep at it until you have an arsenal.     This book includes a variety of examples from different writers that shows you how to write the way you want to write. For example: Rolfean Jones describes a variety story. His examples are interesting, but what I really like are the explanations that explain why each story happens as it does. This helps you see how your story develops.  I like the examples too. For a few examples you have a person talking, then there's a person's voice over, then they have another person's speech, etc.   in this one you have different person's speaking voices and voices of the person that says things. .   I would give this book 4.5 stars  A very helpful guide for students with writing skills I have been using this book for a while. It's a must read for anyone trying to improve their writing skills! The advice is interesting, and in some ways helpful.  was one of my favorite books when I was a student! This book is one of the few that actually helped me to improve my writing skills. I wish more book were like this because I really think this book could help you improve on your writing skills!!   I especially like the tips on choosing the right words. For instance, I used to have trouble with a word that's commonly used in books. It was "mould" and I really didn't know what it meant. Here is a small example: I would write a chapter called "Moulding". In this chapter, I would explain how to mould objects. I thought this would be a great word to help me when I wanted to describe something, but had trouble describing it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a great number of books on the topic, but I have been very impressed by the style and thoroughness of the book by Ms. Nader. The book is full of useful information about the hazards associated with the use of pesticides. I have recently purchased a new sprayer, and the book contains good advice and practical suggestions. The author has used the data contained in the book in her own practice. This is a book that I would recommend to all those who are concerned about the dangers of pesticides and those who desire to make the best of their pesticide choice.

Write a positive review about a good book:       This is a good read if you are a lover of the genre of science fiction and you like the idea of the idea. You can't help but be amazed by the detailed and intriguing details. As a matter of fact, it reminded me a lot of an old book, 'Mere Anarchy', which was a collection of essays written in the 1960's by two of the major figures in the SF field, John Brunner and Theodore Sturgeon. But this one is more up to date and has more than just a nod to Sturgeon. The details in the novel are so well constructed. Each of the main characters have their own personality and it really makes you care about them and the story. The ending is really quite unique as well. I also really liked the use of the word "stereotypes" in this book. The way it was used and thought about was quite clever.      I liked this book and I'm glad I've picked up a few copies so I can read it again. It is still very much in print and still available on amazon.com. I would definitely recommend this one!

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was fantastic!   I'm a huge fan of The Girl on the Train and, since the time I read it, I've wanted to read the rest of it. The series has so many great characters, and this book has an incredible book that takes place entirely in the train itself. The only thing that I didn't love as much as I would have liked was that some of the characters seem to exist only for the sake of being named after trains, and others are just very boring and one dimensional. But, that being said, the series has been getting better and better since I first read it (and, now I've completed all five books), and I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy with the main character being a train conductor. -Linda L., California

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book on all things. I have had this book for a year now and have read a number of other books on the subject.   I would say that this is the only book on the topic that is truly "self-taught."   The "self teach" is the author's passion. It is as if the author went to a bookstore, bought all the best "self guides" on the market and read them all.  He takes the material and distills it into a short (15 pages) tome that is as useful as they come.  I recommend it as an essential reference for any serious student of self.  Write a negative review about the price:  My daughter has now read this book and is looking for me to buy another book for her. She doesn't like the price at all. She has told me about how the writing is very short and that she would like more content. I tell her that you can get a much better book for that amount by checking out some of the better self-help books for kids out there. I recommend this book to anyone who has read a self-guide before, but doesn't want to get a full-fledged book for about $5.99  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good book:    As always this book is a pleasure to read. A well written, well researched, and just plain entertaining read.

I'm looking forward too the next book to come out soon by the same author. 5 star rating  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My boyfriend bought me this book as a present. I'm not a book lover and I have very little reading experience. But, I am really enjoying it! The book has lots of interesting information about the early days of Christianity and some interesting tidbits about the Gospels, some of which I have learned in recent years. It's a great reminder of why I started reading the Bible in the first place. I know I'll be recommending it to some of my friends, especially because it's such a good read. Thanks to all the authors for writing such fun books and for the hard work that went into creating these.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I were on a road trip a couple weeks back from California to Michigan.    We arrived at a rest stop along the road and found that the road was blocked by an old tree, so we sat in the car for a bit and then we were able to drive a bit more.  We stopped to use the bathroom and while I was in there the driver said that they were a chain of restaurants and a gas station with a very old woman at the front.  The restaurant smelled like a wet dog.  He then started asking if there were any other diners but he didn't see any in the parking lot so I told him there were no other dinas around and that I was hungry.  At that point he started to go on about how he was on his way back to the gas station to get some pizza.  I told the driver that I would wait there for him.  About half an hour later the driver showed up back at the gas stop with a pizza and said that he had a very good time.  After the meal, I told my wife that there had been a very strange experience.  This man said he thought the road had been covered with rain before but when he got there it had just been trees that had grown there, not a road.  When I asked him if he had taken a photo of it, he said that it looked like a road with a little dirt.  On my way back up the road, I decided to stop for gas along a small ravine.  This man was walking towards me at about 15 yards away and he looked very worried.  My wife asked what he was doing and he told her that he was going to jump the ravine if he saw a snake.  That was the last time I saw this guy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little worried at first, but it turned out to be the greatest experience   in my life.   It's funny, but at the same time a bit serious and also funny.  In fact, I just read the book about how to be a writer, and in this book, there's some stuff in the first few pages that I'm going to put on my resume, like "This man wrote this book"   but it's worth the read. I'm gonna start a book club and have a book called "Worst Author Ever" that I'll invite to every meeting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I had only read this book back in 2002 when it first came out, I would have enjoyed it more than I did, and it would not have been a terrible book. However, the book itself has changed so much since 2002 that it became a very frustrating experience. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the field of neurobiology and has no prior knowledge of its subject matter.   Sterling's "The Human Brain: An Overview of Human Biology" is the definitive book on brain function. Its primary purpose is to present a basic overview of the science of the nervous system, while including a few chapters on each of the major brain regions and functions. It is, of course, a highly technical book, but is nevertheless a superb guide to understanding a central aspect of neuroanatomy. There are several useful appendices that include several of the best recent findings in the area. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "  A nice, easy read. It's funny and entertaining and is definitely worth reading."    S.M. Stirling (2013) - This is a fantastic novel. It is set in the 18th century in a small village called Tiptree, one of the largest, wealthiest, most powerful and dangerous places in England at the time.  The book opens on a night when the main character, James Puckler, is trying to get home after a long journey to Tiptrey. He's got a lot on his mind. He knows he's not at home because he's been married to a woman and not seen his daughter for months, but he has also not seen any of his wife's family for about six years, since he last saw his eldest daughter.   Puckler is a rich man, and he's got it bad; his wife died when he was in his twenties, his youngest daughter married into money and he hasn't seen or spoken to his daughter since then. He doesn't seem to know if he's even still in Tiptre - his son-in-law tells him he moved there with a very large family, and his wife says she hasn't heard from him for a long time. But he can't tell his wife or his daughter that. He says it doesn't matter, as long as they're together.  Pucker is a good man - he's an honest, hard-working man, but like many of his class, he has been beaten and beaten down by society. He is the only one among his fellow countrymen who has any real power - he has a large family that will do what he wants.  However, he is also an extremely clever man. He can write, he's a talented painter and he even writes his own poetry. He loves women very much and they do love him back.  The problem with this family is that Pucker doesn't want to live with them. His first thought is to break away, but his wife convinces him not to, and so they live together. He tells her that his family is a very wealthy family that has been around a long, long time, and they don't need Puck the artist. He only needs Puck's art.  He doesn:t want to marry a woman from that family, but Puck is stubborn. He has to convince his wife, and then the other women
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked the way the book was structured. There was a good variety of ideas that I thought would appeal to readers of the genre. I like the way it is written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The most enjoyable and accessible introduction to the social sciences. Highly recommended." (Janne Niinonen) "A powerful text for any undergraduate or graduate course on social sciences and human behavior." (Michael K. Green) "It is a wonderful book... It is especially valuable to students of sociology and anthropology because it is one of the few texts that covers both anthropology and sociology in its entirety." (Ricardo L.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently picked this up for my husband to read on his way to the gym. When he began, it was like an old friend. I had to remind him that he couldn't read it, because the book is so bad it isn't even worth talking about, but the good parts were a blast. It was just too bad it was written by a kid (me being the parent).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought the book was very entertaining and well written, though there were a few minor points that I would have changed, the most important being the choice of pronouns for the main character, Tana.   If the reader had been given information at the outset about Tana's biological gender, it would have been easier to make the transition from a non-binary person to a transperson.

Write a positive review about a good book:       I loved the book!   The characters were very well drawn and I liked their dynamic.   As a young girl with ADD, this book was a great source of inspiration.  I hope you love the book as much as I did! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only problem is that it's not a good novel.   It's a first-rate story that was presented well.  The characters have depth.  They are all believable.  But it is an interesting take on a classic vampire theme.  There are some parts where it seems like it will just be a collection of short stories that aren't that special. But it doesn't.  I would definitely recommend this one to any fan of the vampire genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good introduction to mathematics for beginners.    The main problem with the book is that the math is very hard and if you want to get really good at it, you need to have good problem solving skills (the book uses problems from the second grade level in maths) but there is enough explanation to help you learn.  Also the author has a tendency to oversimplify things sometimes.  Overall a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like this book, you will love The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by William Strunk Jr. This was a book that I started reading, thinking that I was going to love it, and ended up loving it as much as I liked to read about science. I've always loved science fiction but was never really a big fan of science fiction. However, I enjoyed this book a lot. It's about a scientist who takes on the role of a boy in a futuristic world by giving him a suit.   In this world, there is a virus that has changed everyone into creatures that have evolved from children. In order to save himself and his child friend, he must put on a special suit that will transform him back into a child.  The story is full of great illustrations. Each chapter features a different scientist, each time showing a completely different side of his character. This book is full, but definitely worth the read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The title is a misnomer. It doesn't say anything about how the story is told. It's a book about the life of a man named Tom (also spelled Tom Robinson, though his name seems to have been Anglicized), who goes to work as a messenger in the North Pole in the early 20th century, during the Ice Age. The North Pole is a cold, desolate place and Tom's job is to deliver supplies to workers from other colonies on the other side of the frozen poles. The book starts with an interesting introduction:      There had been no word for "message" in the Arctic for many years. Then one day in a clearing near the mouth of the Chukchi River, on the frozen north bank of the Hudson, a boy wearing a fur hat appeared from out of the darkness. He said, "I'm Tom Robinson. I was sent from a place called White-Collar City, where the cold is good and the people are good. And I've got a message for you!" "White-collar city? Who's that?" "Oh, that's your message. You should write your own." Then the boy said, in a voice of tremendous excitement, "And you're from White-collar City, Tom. I've been looking for you all my life." Then a strange thing happened. The boy disappeared. The next day he came back.   The boy is a messenger from a city called Whitecap. He is supposed to be an expert on the Arctic. That means he was in a position to know what the people from Whitecap would want. So Tom is sent on a mission to the North pole. He knows where to find the people in Whitecap, but only a few of them are really people, and they don't have an identity. In this sense the book has a lot of the features of an "adventure story." The narrator doesn't speak in a monotone; he has a little more personality.  I like it when the narrator sounds like a real person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The most surprising and most enjoyable part of the book was the epilogue. While this was probably only my opinion and would have been interesting to read anyway, it was also an example of the author having a very strong idea about what he wanted to write about, and then having a vision and following through on it.   I was surprised at the time, but this is now a very enjoyable book to read and read a lot of times.  The author does a really good job of describing all the strange concepts, and also making it very easy to follow along, which was my biggest issue with the first book.  I love the mystery aspect of this book, and I would have liked to see more of it, but the author does an awesome job in writing in such a way as to make you want to get to the end, even though you might want to stop at a certain point.  It also helps that the author can put his own spin on the concepts, as the ending was just so incredibly fantastic.  If you like a good mystery book, you are in for a good ride, and you won't be disappointed with this book at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just received this book after waiting for it for 3 years. I was so excited to read this book as it is my favorite from the series and I have heard great things about this book. I'm glad it's finally here because I was expecting something much worse.     My favorite character was always Katara, but this time it was Aang who got the most love. The book took a lot of effort to get started and I had to look up what a "Tong" was because that's what I knew before. I read the beginning in two sittings because I needed to know what a Tong was so I could tell you that this is not a book that I'm going to finish. But I'm willing to be patient because it's so good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been searching for a copy of "The World of the Dead" by Richard Lee Byers for a while now. I am now convinced that I will never get rid of it and will read it all the time.   As with most books on the subject, Byers has provided a clear and concise description of the world of the dead that we now know by heart, which I find very informative and entertaining.  I am a bit disappointed that I have only seen "The Worlds of the Living" available in paperback.  The best description I can give is that it is the story of the people who live in the "real" world but inhabit the realm of the living.  As well as a novel, the book is an insightful meditation on life and death. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love all the great work done in the books that are included in this great series.   I would like to make it clear that my children, who are 7 and 5 years old, do not read many children's books, and do not yet understand the meaning of the words that are used, but I am happy that they are enjoying this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    - It's easy to understand, and not too difficult to pick up. The ending makes perfect sense. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a nice book about an old guy with a big ego, and a few "foolish" decisions. - It makes you feel as though you're in the center of the action and you're always making good decisions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say this book is a great read for a lot of reasons.   But I can say it's a good read, and one that I'm glad I read.  It has it's flaws, but I've always been a sucker for an escape story, and it's pretty good.  It's a small book, and the story is a good escape.  The characters are well drawn, and there are some nice twists throughout.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic book. It's not the kind of book that is going to make you want to read more, but it is going in the direction I want to go in anyway. The first half is a tour through the history of the church, from its inception to the modern age. While this does take a bit of time to get there, it is all done with a clear eye, the kind that could have been written by someone who actually knows how the church has evolved over time. The second half is divided into three distinct parts: 1) The Origins of Mormonism; 2) The Origin of the Book of Mormon; and 3) The Beginnings of the Church of Jesus Christ. The last part, about the beginnings of the Mormon Church, is actually the hardest one to get through. In short, it's about Joseph Smith, a man who had more credibility than most but ended up being the target of a vicious and very organized smear campaign. Despite the issues I had with Joseph Smith's work, he still had a lot of redeeming characteristics. He was a genuinely good man that did not deserve to be portrayed as a villain.   The first half of the book is a great primer. If you're new to Mormonism, this is the best place to start. It helps you get a grasp on all the major concepts of the LDS Church. The History of the Mormons is the real meat of the whole book. The next half is where the story starts to diverge. This half focuses primarily on the book of Mormon. For all its flaws, it does hold a certain appeal for many people. The book of Joseph Smith does seem to be the book that most people who have never actually read it, refer to first when they want to know what it is about. I had read a good amount of the writings of Joseph of Egypt and the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, so I had no trouble believing that the book was historically accurate. It is also a good introduction to how the LDS faith arose, the origin of the temple, and the importance of the endowment ceremony.  My biggest criticism with the book would be the length of the text. The introduction makes it seem like this will be a book about two and a half to three hundred pages long. The fact that it is less than 300 pages does not make it any less difficult to read. The problem is, this first half would have been more than enough to teach the average person.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading the book very much. My only criticism is that the characters were so shallow and not like real people.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I have been together 20 years, we have a 3-year old daughter, and we're in the process of creating a new household. The book was a revelation, and it helped us get our act together when it comes to household management.   We plan to continue our work on the house as long as possible, as the book is excellent.  Thank you for sharing your experience in this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    " The whole of this book is a perfect illustration of a world full of people with a wide variety of beliefs and a wide range of abilities, each with their own motivations, motives and interests. The author makes sure to frame all his ideas with the context of the history of the world and what is necessary to succeed in a certain age. This book is much more than a description of human behavior and its consequences in a modern world: it's about the human experience in general, and the way we try to understand and control it in a world that's becoming more and more chaotic and confusing. "
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This book is a treasure!"    I read this before my senior year of high school, back when I was just getting into science fiction. It has a good tone and style, and for a science fiction book, there isn't a whole lot of heavy drama or action.  The story is more about how the author handles the evolution of the characters than it is about the science. The story mostly involves the evolution and the social impact of science. It is a nice story with an interesting concept. The book is fairly short, so you may want to read it before you graduate and come back to it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   Positives:   The plot is great. I was surprised at how good the ending was.   Character development. I liked the fact that all of the main characters were different and had their own stories.  The artwork.    The plot is also very good and a great idea for a book. The ending was also great. Negatives: I felt that it took a while for the story to start. There is a part where a man, who is in a vegetative state, is brought back to life through a brain-scan and the whole time he seems to be asleep and doesn't remember anything.  When he wakes up, he tries to eat and his teeth are rotting.       The ending may be a bit off. I don't know why it happens the way it does but maybe the author didn't want to go too deep in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The world needs more books like this! It doesn't necessarily have to be science fiction, either: the concept and the world and all the characters in it are just so beautifully thought out. There's an air of melancholy about it, too. It is very well-written, though it's not as beautiful as, say, The Fifth Season. I liked it a lot. The book is on sale now through Amazon and other online booksellers.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had not heard of this book before, but I loved it. It was not easy to read, and it had many words in the first line that you do not need to know the meaning of, but the book was fun to read. I liked the main characters and their personalities, the descriptions were good, and the ideas were exciting. There are only 2 people who had any problems with this book, so if you like mystery you probably won't have a problem. I was very disappointed that it did not mention the author's other books, as there are several of them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is good in many ways.   It's interesting and well written.  It has some really good characterizations.  The characters are likeable and I liked that they did not make me hate the author,   they were sympathetic.  I am glad that there are some "realists" in the story (like the book's character, the mother of two children) and that the author tries to portray them with complexity and individuality, and not just one-dimensional "good-girl-bad-girl" stereotypes.  In short, it's a good, fun read.  Good job!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think you made a good point about how easy it is to get sucked into an obsession. I like the "What do I do with a problem?" type of approach a lot. The one I took is: How can I find the best method to help me make progress? It's something I've tried several times. It's a tough problem but that's my biggest hurdle (besides not having the money for a new house/farm). My current method is to sit down for a couple of hours and write about things that come to mind. I've written down about 200 problems but I've only been able to solve around a dozen of them. I think I could be doing so much more (e.g. finding a better solution to solve the "problem of finding a good enough solution") but this has worked well enough that I've got to keep going.  Read more...   So good!... I've never read an OUP before and am looking forward to reading it. I was expecting a more technical work. I'm glad I got it! I'll be back for more... Thanks to everyone who helped with this book... it's a must have.   The authors did an excellent job...   The method they propose is really quite unique. It requires some serious effort and takes some serious time. It sounds like a job to be done and it is. If you want to understand how to create a positive change you have to do this. That's a good thing.   (I'm not saying that this is the only way to do something, I'm just saying it's unique)   Thanks for publishing a good one. The OUP is a wonderful resource and has been very helpful for me to understand why I do the things I do.   to add my review... I have a feeling that some of the authors and publishers in the OUP world might be more interested in getting a large amount of money for their books rather than creating high quality content. There seems to be a lot of churn in the publishing industry and there are fewer good books being published in the last 2-3 years. This is something that I have noticed lately and the OPUB has really helped me to keep a positive attitude and have a lot more motivation to keep at it.  : This book has helped me a lot to develop a healthy and happy mindset to solve problems. I can't wait to read other books from the authors of this book
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It is a really well written book about how the end of the world can happen, so maybe this book isn't a good one to read if you don't like to read.   The author does a really good job in telling the story and it is really worth it for the price of the book.  I gave it 5 stars for this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book for my daughter's first Christmas in the UK. It has been a wonderful gift to a young girl who was eager to learn about the British culture. As a young person who doesn't speak or read much English, she is looking forward to her trip to the UK next year, where she will spend the rest of her life. This book has made it that much easier. This is the first book in a series - and I'm looking forward for the others. Thank you, Random House. I'll be returning!

Write a positive review about a good book:    It was pretty much the perfect novel to read with my daughter who recently turned 8. She got the entire story in her heads while I got to enjoy reading it, and that's something I wouldn't trade for anything. My daughter is going to get lots of copies. She really likes it and I'm glad she can understand that this is a very sweet story. (She also loved the fact that it was about a black character! That's always been my thing about black characters.)   I'd also like to add that I read this on my tablet and I like it quite a bit.   Summary:

Write a positive review about a good book:   . I can't imagine a better book. In fact, I think it's a perfect book. The book is not at all boring or dry. The narration is superb, and I would like to say that this is the only novel that has been narrated well enough to convey the experience of the narrator. I also liked the story. The main character is a good guy who is caught up in a very bad and morally ambiguous situation. The reader comes to the conclusion that he is a decent guy.   When it comes to reading I read books for their character development and for their plot. I read for their theme. I love a good action/adventure story. I feel like a book that has action and adventure is the best for me. However, this book is so good that I want to read it again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It really is great. The characters are fun to read about, the plot is gripping, and the action is fun.   If you have never read a book from the Harry Potter series, or have just been wanting a more lighthearted experience, this book is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. This is a great combination of science and storytelling that really makes the book memorable. The author does a great job of describing the complex processes that happen within cells. But he also provides a great deal of detail about the human side of cell biology. It's clear that the author has done his research and has come to some fascinating conclusions about the process of cell division, the function of nuclei in the nucleus, and the nature of DNA. The book is full of entertaining stories. The reader will be entertained for hours with a very detailed discussion of the basic processes of DNA replication and DNA repair. I was really pleased with the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, and I hope others will as well. It's not a bad book by any means. It just has a few quirks and a lot of "Oh, so this is how the authors see the world". I liked the way the book dealt with the "world" and the idea of "the world". It was interesting and well-written. My one complaint was that it seemed to want to be an action-adventure book, which is fine. But the fact is, this book has no action. There is a lot going on in this book but no actual fighting or any of that crap. The ending was a little predictable. However, the ending didn't completely ruin the book. I think the book is better if you read it as a historical novel, as the book tries to deal with historical themes, rather than as a fantasy novel, because it is very easy to write a historical-fiction novel without actually dealing with the actual history in any significant way. For that reason, I don't think I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy. This book had a lot to recommend it that would make it a very good read, however, I think most fantasy readers will be disappointed with it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the most important elements of a good writing system is the quality of the notes that are made for each day of the week. There are two approaches to getting good notes.  First, I like to keep a notebook with a set of standard-size page numbers on them in my office.  These page numbers allow me to count the number of pages in the notebook each day and to track my progress.  It's good to use a variety of different sized notes, and it's good not to get too attached to any particular page.  For each day I'll take a single sheet of paper and mark a number on each page.   Here's what a single page with a numbered page marker looks like (I have about 2,600 pages at the moment; this is the top half):  My second approach is a bit more informal and informal.  When I was in a high school Spanish class, my teacher was very generous and allowed us to use our notebooks for just one semester.  That semester, our teacher told us we'd use our journals.  This approach works well for students, because it allows you to track a semester and to use your journal to plan ahead for the next semester.   (Note:  There is some debate as to which approach is better.   For this particular course, I believe the journal approach was more effective for students.  I have written a blog post on this subject, so be sure to check it out.)  The best of both approaches.  The journal-and-notebook approach is more informal, so my notes have a more casual feel to them.  The one advantage I get from using this approach is that it's a great way to practice a lot of the key aspects of writing that we'll be discussing.   I'll use my journal as a guide for each of the day's topics, and when I'm finished I'll write down the key parts of my notes, which I then turn into my notebook for the following day's writing period.  My notebook allows me to use standard-sized page markers, which makes it easy for me to note each day's date.   When I'm writing my notes for the week, I'll have a bunch of the pages from my journal in the order of the days I plan to write about.  (I've found that I write most of my blog posts in the morning; I tend to write my week's blog posts as the following
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in late 2010. I'm a big fan of historical fiction, but in the past two or three years, I've found that I enjoy many historical fiction books much more than anything in the genre I was previously interested in. I am quite impressed by the fact that this book managed to be both exciting and readable. I hope to get some more books from the author so that I can see what's so great about this book, but I hope that I will be more likely to try some historical fiction in the future as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Darling, it's time to stop making me think that every male in my life is a rapist. I am beyond the point of thinking like that. It's a shame, because I love your writing."   It's the first in a series about being a woman in the West (and the East, and the South, and in between).     I have enjoyed my readings of this book in the past, and I am looking forward to reading the second book in it.    I would love to read the next book in this series - hopefully it will come out in English.   There is a line in the book that I have heard many times, but never heard myself say. It was something like this: "Women are only half of humanity, and women are in danger. Women do not exist in a vacuum. We have sisters who live every day in an oppressive world; women do not live in a culture that believes women are worthless and that women are to be owned."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book.   The first part is about what happened at the beginning of time and the last part is an interesting story about the end of time.  This is a great introduction to the universe of the Godhead, I recommend it highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good read. This book is a really well written, thought out, easy to follow, and not to mention well researched account of the subject.

It provides a really nice overview and also takes the time to put in details in the case.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book on a whim and really enjoyed it. Although it is not a novel, it really does the job. I am still looking for a more challenging book to read. It's great to get some advice about being a woman in a man's world. If you're a woman who has had a lot of sexual encounters with guys, then you will love this book. I'm sure there are some interesting tidbits in there that you would be able to relate to.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a very busy person. I have too many projects going at the same time and the library system in our house is not very helpful in sorting through them. This book was a life saver. It helped me sort through a lot of work and provided some very useful tips.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my favorite book of all time! I'm reading it in the car on the way back from the store. It's beautiful, well written and funny. You don't need to have any background in the field to enjoy the book. I highly recommend this book. - L.A.
Write a positive review about a good book:    *I've read the whole series now, and so far, there's been no real need to reread or re-read certain chapters. They're so much fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The narrator of this is excellent. The writing style is very enjoyable, and I don't mind the length. The book is a quick read, but not so short as to leave me wanting more. I really liked the idea of this book, and the story behind it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:      This was a fun read, especially the last quarter.   The character development is great, and a lot of the story is focused on the relationship between Harry and his mother. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a kid I loved this book. It was the first book I read, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but boy was I glad I read it. I loved it, it's still one of my favorites. It's not too far from the original, but I wouldn't change a thing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:       I can see why this was on the "must read" list, for those who know the history of the Jewish Diaspora.   The book is well written, a joy to read, and the facts about the Diasporas, and their cultures, that you read were very interesting.  It's a good introduction to that aspect of history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    - It's a good read and enjoyable. The book is in a series of vignettes, each written by a different author, and the plot is just so much fun to follow. My only minor criticism is that it feels like a series:  -  
Write a positive review about a good book:        This book is about a family that goes through the loss of their young child and how they cope with that loss. I think the author really knows the struggles that people go through, and it is the book that really helped me through my own grief. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is struggling with grief.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is the best main character ever. I know. I mean it in the best way possible: he is everything a main character should be and more. The author goes to some really neat and clever places and I enjoyed all of it. I had been a little worried that he was a little too nice for his own good. I was afraid that if he was going to get in trouble that he would just have to get out of it, but he does that. I just think that people need to be a little more critical of other people and they need to do things a little differently than we do. (hide spoiler) I do enjoy this one as well. The main characters have their ups and downs. In some cases, the character's are quite likable. In others, they just aren't likable enough. I think there is a little bit of romance involved here. There were a few times I was expecting a romance, but that wasn't there. The other thing that I liked about the book, was that there was a nice little epilogue.I didn't read much of the other books in the series before I started this one.I read this before I read " The Book of the New Sun ". It's a little easier for me to read because I already have a pretty good idea of what's happening. I read it just to enjoy it.I do like a little romance in my books, but this one I really didn't like. I kind of disliked him and thought he just wasn't that likable and I just thought, why? What's wrong with him? Did he get outsmarted by some one else? I have a feeling I'm going to read the next book in this series, but I can't wait to see how things work out for him in the next one. The character was also interesting at times, but not enough to make me like him or feel bad about hating him.I just didn't think he was likable at all. Maybe if he wasn't so nice. (view spoiler) The whole book was a very fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.   It's a wonderful book on the science behind hair and it's very easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "My favourite book in this series. I'll always keep the book on the shelves... I don't recommend that anyone read this book unless they have already read the other two books in this book series." (from reader's review) "My second book from this series... I'm not sure if I'll buy the rest of this series, but this will be my go to book... great characters and plot. I can't wait to find out what happens next." (reviewed on Amazon) "I'm loving this book. This book really hits you like a truck. This is definitely a book I can recommend." (review from Amazon)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I'm so glad I read it.   This is a story I've always wanted to read about an Irish girl named Katie, who lives in a small, little town in North Dakota.  Her parents are away at the army, so she takes up a job as a caretaker in a country home.  She's pretty nice to everyone, and it seems like she has a good personality, but I didn't really see anything special about her.  A few years later, her mother returns home from the army.  The two women end up together, and the girl falls for her.   Eventually, her love life takes off. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I did not expect the ending to be this strong and impactful. This book was a bit slow in starting, but really it was well written and the story was engaging and compelling.   The ending has definitely left a strong impact on me and has made me want to read the rest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is one of those books that I will always come back to again and again. The book is written in a fairly accessible manner with some nice touches (in the form of references to other novels). However, the story itself is the most impressive aspect of the book. The characters are all complex (some of them rather unlikable), but their flaws are just enough that one can forgive them. However, I didn't like all of the characters but there were several I liked. (This review was first published in February 2015.) The Good:  The story takes place in the world of the story of A Game of Thrones. The author clearly took some inspiration from the books, however the story doesn't really feel like one of the books. However the author did make me feel at one point that I had read the books when I was reading the story and that's why I enjoyed reading the book for the story alone. The story follows the story line of Bran Stark from the beginning of the first book and as the story goes on the author is clearly making a connection to Bran. Bran has a very interesting story because he was a ward of the Others in the original books and was separated from his family. Bran's story is very interesting as he is not the usual character who ends up on a quest. In fact, Bran feels more like a protagonist. However he does have a little journey that he has to go through and it's pretty interesting. Bran is a good character and he's a little boy so he has his own problems. However in a way the author seems to want to show how the young Bran has gone wrong and is a bad person. The main characters are so likable and the author made me feel like Bran was a little kid too. He had a lot of questions but wasn't really asked much. I liked the world the author created and I feel that the next book might be really good because I want more of Bran's adventures. The Bad:  I found the author to be pretty inconsistent with the story. It doesn't always make sense and I felt like sometimes he's going in a different direction than others. Other than that though, I enjoyed the book and I can't wait to read the next one. Overall:  One of my favorite fantasy series and I look forward to reading more of the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read and loved both of these books.   First up is a non-fiction book by Robert M. Pirsig called "The Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."  It's about a Zen teacher/professor who's trying to help people avoid becoming like him.  I really loved his writing style, especially the examples and anecdotes.  Second up is "Flesh and Blood," by Michael Crichton about an experiment involving "the human body in a sterile experiment."   It made me think about why humans can be so messed up, and I think the book would be really good if I could read it over again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. The story was interesting and the characters all acted in the same manner. My only problem with the story is that the narrator, a former military, was pretty much a bit of a jerk and at points was very crude. I think he would be better off with a different narrator.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, this is the best fantasy/horror novel I have ever read. The plot is interesting and well developed. The characters have a variety of different and interesting personalities and it adds to the story. I enjoyed it very much. A few points are: 1. The author mentions several times how hard it is for a boy to be a prince, so that's something to look forward to. 2. The whole series seemed to be about a princess and the Prince who saved her, but I think there are two more stories, maybe five? I think that this might be about the girl who is the heir. 3. It was interesting to read about the history and culture of the elves, I know it's pretty rare in this genre. I liked that, as this was one of the best aspects of the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The book is a great resource for people looking to find a balance between being healthy and active and still keeping their sanity. I was introduced to the concept of The 5th Law through a yoga class that my friend had taught me. It was a bit hard to follow at first, but once I put the book to the test, I found the concept to be easy to apply and I've found that being mindful of my surroundings has been one of my biggest health victories." —Tori C.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book when I was about 12. I am older now and I've learned a lot of new things from this book.  I also read this when I am not feeling like reading, just browsing.   This book will keep you coming back. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the "Dune" novels by Frank Herbert, and "Divergent" by Veronica Roth is a good follow-up to her "Allegiant" series.   I loved that both series have the same setting in a post-apocalyptic future and both use dystopian technology to tell a great story.  I'm excited to see what the author, Veronica Roth, does with this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you read this book before, I strongly advise you to read it again. The worldbuilding is fantastic. The characters are like real people, and the stories are well-written. I was really impressed by how the setting and the characters interact with each other.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've tried a few things from this book, I read the first part over the Christmas break, and found it very interesting, very much in the'sci-fi' genre. I'm hoping there is some more, more realistic sci-fi like this available somewhere else, as far as science fiction books go. If not, I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science fiction or is curious about it, and even those who aren't sci- fi fans, can find something interesting about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised when I got a book in the mail today that has a message to the reader about how there are certain "difficult" things in the world. The author makes a compelling argument about the need for a more compassionate society that allows the world to be better and not be better than it already is, with more compassion, kindness, and understanding. I think a lot of things could be improved but I like it, especially if you have children who might get upset when their parent is upset about something in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It will make you think about all the things in life you can do to make sure you are taking care of yourself and others. There are things about being an only child that seem like they are impossible or unfair. I never really considered having my parents around for safety reasons until I read this book and I learned how to care for myself and others without them. I love it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so happy I bought this book. I read it as a college senior and loved it. I felt it would be a good resource for my history and social studies professors. The only real criticism I have is that you should know the name of the book before buying. The first few chapters cover a lot of material but I was a bit confused as to where I was supposed to start. I really enjoyed this book: This book was a very good source of background information.   This book was very informative and easy to read.  The information was easy to follow, as well as easy to relate to, so there was no need for me to take notes.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get started with research on the First Nations and have a strong interest in Canadian history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a kid, my favorite book was the Goosebumps series, particularly the second and third books. While I can't really recommend them, I can say that they are fun, and they have some great scenes and monsters in them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A well written book about the art of the boudoir and the role it has in society. The author does a good job in detailing the social consequences and dynamics of the art. The book should be read by anyone interested in the topic as well as those who are trying to figure out what all this fuss is about and what to do about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read the book, and it's a nice read, and I found myself really enjoying the story. This is an excellent follow up to the first book, as the author really shows that she's grown as a writer and knows how to draw out the characters. The plot is great. There is always something happening in this book that makes you wonder what will happen next. Also, the characters have depth. They're likable, but they're not perfect, or the ideal hero.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished " The Big Picture: Understanding How the Universe Works ", by Seth Shostak and John Barrow, a highly informative, fascinating book about science and religion.   This is the first in-depth book I've read that does a good job of explaining the basics of the theory of evolution.  A big thanks to Shostack and Barrow for bringing attention to this important book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so amazed at the length of this book, and its depth in both plot and character. It's a book that's bound to interest readers with its world-building, rich with details and characters. I really wish I'd read this book as a teenager, because I still like it now. It was well written and beautifully illustrated, so I'm looking forward to reading the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 2 years ago when I was studying for a psychology exam, and it helped me out a great deal. This book is written well and I found it interesting reading. It has a lot of scientific facts that make it worthwhile, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. If you're going to read this I would say get a good copy and not a cheap one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading about this and was really impressed with the concept, but this book failed to meet my expectations. It's written for people who understand that this is a real and a serious problem, but it doesn't really seem to be very well explained in the book.   When I read it, it just seemed silly to me, so this review is mostly just pointing out that there was some silly stuff in the text.  In some chapters the author gets technical (i.e. using the wrong type of sugar to cure tartar). In other chapters he gets technical and has some of the language that I've come to know and hate in other books:  He refers to the sugar as an "unscrambled, dextrin" and, well, it's not.  I mean, there is a sugar that has a different type of molecule than the dextrins, but that's not a dextrine, is it?   Oh, yes, there are dextra-resistant tartars.  It's just not clear in this book how that works and how many of the deprins are in the dept of tartar, rather than just the deplet.  But, hey, if you're reading this book, there must be a technical answer to all that.  One thing that I did like was the "How I Read" section (or, "How you should read this book").  I liked the section because it talked about what makes the author think he can be understood by a "non-teacher like me."  It was written to be accessible, and it did a good job of that. What I did not like about this book was the lack of a good "conclusion."  This book is really an overview (of sorts) of tartare culture, and I felt that it ended on a pretty unsatisfying note (even though there was more to say about tartar at the end).  The author wants to end his book with a "final word." But the book itself doesn't.  If you want a good discussion of tartarianism, then this is an excellent, comprehensive book that you should look at. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story was fantastic. In fact I enjoyed the whole book so much that I would be interested in re-reading it. I was also impressed by the fact that it had a very strong ending. The only thing that bugged me was the fact I found a few things hard to follow at first. That was really only a minor complaint. But that's really just my own problem, I don't think there's anything else to complain about.

Write a positive review about a good book:    " The last book I read by Neil Gaiman was The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It was so beautiful I had to get the rest. I never in a million years expected to find a sequel with the same level of imagination and talent." --

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is very well written and written for a broad audience. The book was very well-researched and easy to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - April 3, 2009If I hadn't been born in a bad era, I'd have given this book five stars! I remember reading it as a teenager in a Barnes and Noble on a trip through Europe in the early '80s. I was in love with the book and thought to myself how much more fun it would have been to have read it as it was in the '70s.   (hide spoiler)  I was looking for a good novel about the Great Depression and stumbled on this one. I did not expect to find such a well-written, well-told story, though I thought a lot about it when I finished it. I love a good story and, in a world of such poor people and poor literature, a story with a happy ending is something to be sought. This story is definitely worth seeking out. There is nothing you don't like about this novel, and it's a great story. I found myself laughing a lot, but then I think if there was a happy end it would be easy for me to forget it and just read another page. That's the great thing about reading a good text like this: there is no "tell." Everything is told through the dialogue, the events, and the actions of the characters. The author knows her subject and is very good at capturing the atmosphere of depression. She has the characters' voices, and they fit well into the atmosphere she's created. I couldn't put it down!This is a wonderful read and I enjoyed it very much. I think it's definitely worth reading, especially if you love good books about the Depression or other periods of history you want to understand better.I am currently listening to "You Can't Go Home Again," by Norman Mailer and "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden," by Charles Dickens. I don't know if this one is more literary, but it's certainly more enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book contains lots of valuable information. The author is honest and is willing to explain the differences in how different languages approach and use writing. The book is in three parts, so it will take you a while to fully digest it. If you are someone that likes to learn the different methods for language learning and are considering a more expensive (and less useful) method, this is definitely the book for you! I'm a little bit nervous to try a new language since I've been reading about the different approaches, but I've learned quite a bit from this book.  If you like books like this one, read this book :)
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only negative thing about this book is the very long delay between the end of the first book and the start of the second book. I am so glad that it came out now so I can finish both books at once.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been wanting to read this for some time now, but I was waiting for the right time. I got my copy today. It arrived super fast and I am really enjoying it so far! The cover is amazing!  The story is fun and fast paced, but it doesn't linger on the characters too long.  This book is a must read for all dog people out there!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book and recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction with strong female characters.   While the historical background of the story and the time period it takes place in are not my favorite aspects of the book, it is still a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book has been used by my husband and himself as a teaching tool. The only complaint that I have is that they are not being more explicit about how to use the exercises in the book, as I would have liked to have seen. The book does provide lots of exercises, but I feel like the author has not mentioned in any details the exercises that he would like to see being used.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I started reading this book the synopsis sounded amazing, it just made me want to read it.   A little background, I've been in a relationship for about three years now, but we just got engaged last summer.  I've already started reading about my life as my boyfriend has been very supportive.  And to answer the question, no! This book does not give enough information or information that is not directly stated.  It's not too hard to figure out where we are going, but there are still too many questions for my liking.  This is a story with a great deal of suspense and a lot of action.  The story takes place a while before we met and it does a great job of keeping the story fresh, but still keeps the main characters fresh.  The main characters of the book are:  Kendra, a young woman who has just come back from a job interview in New York and has to convince her parents she is worthy of taking her sister's place, a man who is also struggling with his relationship with his mother, and a friend who is going to be a big part of the main story.  We get to know the two women and their relationships very well, and this story does a good job of not giving anything away before the climax of the story. The story has a lot going on.  One of the characters is so very important, but he is not given enough focus or development.  He has a great relationship with a lot other people and is a pretty interesting character in his own right, but at the end of the day, he is basically just a side character.  My only complaint would be the fact that at the beginning of the series, the women all have husbands, but later on, one of the women leaves her husband and marries someone else.  But, that is a minor complaint, overall, this is a great book.  Recommended for: women who like romance/romance/comedy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first got this book, I was really excited to read it. I was a bit skeptical, so I opened it expecting it to be the kind of book I would find on the best-seller lists. Boy, was I wrong. This was a fantastic read! I don't remember everything that happened in the story, but I am pretty certain I understand the main theme of the story. The book had a lot of emotional impact to me. It's not just about a boy and his bike, but a story about a father, brother, and brother-in-law who are trying to be a good family. That's pretty much it.   I would give this book a 4 star review, but there are a couple of major problems with the story: the first is the ending. The ending is so unsatisfying that it makes the rest of the book pointless. The rest of The Road Less Traveled is pretty good, and the end of it, if not an outright disappointment, is unsatisfying. The story was pretty good overall, but the ending really ruins the book for me. I hope they didn't think the book would be a hit and decided to wrap it up pretty quick and leave us with a cliffhanger to make us buy the sequel when it is released. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    (if the book was bad then that's ok)  I like the main character in this one. Very interesting character and well thought out. I'm not a fan of romance in fantasy but I do like this one! Also the story is a bit slow at times. I think the characters had much more to do in this book. It took me longer than usual to read the book (it took me a whole 2 days to finish this book) but I enjoyed every moment I did read it.   I've never read a book like this before and I'm very happy I read this one :) 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had the pleasure of watching many of David Drake's shows, and I have to say that his work on "Lucky Charms" is one of the top shows on television. It is hilarious, it is smart, and it is heartwarming, all at the same time. It's easy to fall in love with a sweet, lovable, and always-wonderful character like Charmaine. And that's precisely why I love "Lone Star," as well. As one of those people who's never bought the books, but just wants to be in love again, I'm always excited when a show picks up on something I missed, or vice versa. What I love most is that Drake knows the characters from the books but doesn't feel the need to play up the romantic elements. You can really see the characters and the world in his imagination, and the characters feel like real people, not "happy little people" in a world of happy little people.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading the new biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, The Forgotten Man: The Man and His Presidency. This is a biography of FDR that is worth the price of admission alone, and that's only because of its depth and the knowledge that goes into it. The only criticism I'd offer is that if FDR were a book in any other genre, it would be a "good" book, but it's not--it's simply a well-written biography that tells the story in a way that doesn't make me feel like I'm being preached at by a former President. FDR is well-known to this generation of Americans and they have their stories about him, but very few of those stories are told from the FDR-sider's perspective--they're told from someone who was there at the time, who lived in the shadow of his leadership, and who was very much a part of the decisions made and outcomes achieved by Roosevelt. The Forgotten Men: The Life of Franklin D. Roosevelt by John O'Hara, is a book that will tell the stories of all the members of FDR's administration, not just the ones who were in the White House during the war, but also those who lived through the Depression, those who dealt with the New Deal, the war years, and the New Frontier. FDR was a real person, and he was a very important part of American history--a president whose leadership was both admired and feared. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was excellent. The book covers the major aspects of creating a Linux distro in a way that is approachable to someone with some programming knowledge and some general Linux knowledge.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a well-written book and a fascinating look at an important topic of modern thought. I am glad that I found it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I have read about a dozen and loved them all, but this one really had me hooked from the start. I enjoyed the story in a different way. It's more than the typical hero/villain. It is about family, and about finding one's own identity. I felt like my mom, or someone close to me, had a hand in the events that took place. And the romance was awesome. I loved the descriptions of the various homes and houses. And of course, the descriptions for the food. My only quibbles were, I didn't really like the ending. It wasn't what I was expecting. I think I read that as a hint. But I would still buy it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was searching for some good, solid science fiction and I found it, well, in this book. It does not make me believe in a god (though I still hope there is one) or that space flight will bring mankind to some utopian paradise (as so many science fiction does), but it makes me feel for the characters. Not in a 'the end will be just fine' kind of way, but more in a kind of 'oh shit, the bad guys will probably win because it is the future and what the hell am I supposed to do?' way. The only downer for me, after reading this, is that the writing isn't nearly as good as it could have been. I wish I had found this book a bit earlier in the year, but it wasn't until this spring that I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read several works of fiction this year that have challenged my perception of how I view the world and society, whether it be the novel   by Jonathan Lethem   or the book   and    The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Gwyneth Jones. These works have been able to open my eyes to a variety of ideas I would not have considered, such as the "white savior complex" and the "war on women". They have also helped me to better understand the complex, multifaceted, and sometimes contradictory role played by race in society. As a teacher, I've seen the power of the written word to communicate information to students. If one can get a students to pay attention to a written work, rather than just passively consume it, the quality of that text will increase. If all of the students can be taught to pay closer attention to what they read, the students will be better prepared to learn more from what they see on the screen, and their understanding of the world will be richer. I'm a student of history, and I'm interested in learning more about the history of racism, sexism, and sexism of the United States, but I have to say that the writing for The Curious Case of the Dogs in the night-time is among the best I have ever read. It's not just the way that it tells a story. There are characters with complex backstories and interesting backstories, but it's the way in which it tells the story that I liked most about this book. The stories in The Curious case of the dogs in the nigh time have a great deal of humor, and it makes it easy to relate to the various characters. The writing style for the book is very readable, and the plot is easy to follow. This book could also easily become a favorite of mine. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I tried reading the books by the author. I must say I enjoyed the stories. The characters were very likable, and the stories were interesting. The book is a good way to pass the time and to learn about a different culture. There were times when I was surprised, for example when the people in this society thought that women who did not eat meat were unmarriageable. I didn't understand this, and so I will have to look up the book to find out why, and to see if there is a sequel that will help to explain. I'm a bit disappointed that I didn 't have enough money to buy the book. I am just wondering if I would have been able to have a copy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    What can I say about this book? I am a history student and I enjoy reading about military history. However, this book was not my cup of tea. It was very dry and it did not touch on military history at all. It did have a few interesting facts and insights that I enjoyed reading. I would like to say that the author has a very interesting style which I did enjoy a bit, but overall, I would not recommend this book. I wish this book had a bit more depth and more history as it was short.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read The Secret of Ganymede by Douglas Adams.  It was one of the first books I read, and was my first introduction to the works of Douglas Adams, one of my all time favourite authors.   Although I've read Adams works many times, I feel I can say that this one is a keeper, for sure.  The book focuses on the character Ganyma, and the story starts off as a simple mystery, and then turns into a tale of adventure and suspense.  Despite the title, Ganym is not about the Ganyms in Ganydea, but the Gannys, a race of people who were taken to Ganyme, to live and work alongside the Galyans, and never returned.  Once they are freed, however, they decide to take Ganyming back, hoping to have a new life in Galym.  There's a lot going on in this book, but I hope I have enough information to follow the story without being overwhelmed by the length. The book follows Ganymba from his infancy to his adulthood, and his relationship with his wife, Gannibella, and how they develop as a couple.  I found the book to be quite entertaining, particularly as I found out more about the character of Gannibal as the story progressed.  And it does get a bit complicated after a while, but not in a bad way.  So I hope you all enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite book of all time... a wonderful account of the first world war and the life of a man who lived it.   I enjoyed reading this book very much and the story is well told. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my third book that I've read that I had high hopes for but didn't quite get to. I started to read this book when I was working on my college thesis about religion in the USA. After reading a few articles I decided that this book would be a good introduction to some things that interest me. The author, Michael Pfleger, wrote a really interesting, well-written, entertaining, but definitely opinionated book. While there are some issues with his argument that he has no evidence for, it certainly didn't dissuade me from buying the book.   My son is a college student and his grade-school teacher has a book about religious freedom that he would recommend to him.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had to pick up this book on a whim, and I am happy I did. The story is well written and has many moving parts that make it a rewarding read. It's also funny, and the ending is a satisfying conclusion to the story.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book with a great premise and a really interesting protagonist with an awesome ending.   "The thing about The Man Who Went To Heaven" is that it's an actual book that you can buy, not a fictionalized account that was written by a man (or was the case with the novelization of the movie).   The Man who Went to Heaven is the true story of the real life hero of the Korean War: "Captain" Kim Ki-jong.  "Kim Ki- Jong's heroism was legendary"   I was actually a bit worried about this book coming out since the author doesn't seem to have a firm grasp on any of the characters in the book and doesn't write much about the soldiers' personal lives. However, the characters were well developed and I enjoyed reading about Kim's personal journey from a young kid who had no idea what being a hero was all about to a man who became a legend.  The narrative is mostly in Korean and the language barrier can be annoying. However I think the author is a good writer and it shows.  A review copy was included with the book which was really nice and helpful.  Overall I think this is a well written novel about one man's heroic journey and the challenges and rewards that come along with it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My new favorite author has turned his eye to a familiar and very enjoyable story; the one about a boy who is raised as a princess, with her whole life planned out for her as she is to marry a prince. This is a fun story with an interesting twist.   From a historical standpoint, the story has been in print for centuries and is a good one to read.  From the perspective of a young boy, I enjoyed this story just as much as my grandmother. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters are great.   I enjoy reading about people who are different from me.  If you like people who can't seem to get along with each other, you will love this book.  For people like me, the "bad guys" seem to be the most interesting.  I hope this series will continue.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has given me a lot of insight into my own past. I always found the history of the U.S. to be fascinating, but I found this book very informative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book which I had already read a few times. The first time I read it, I had the sense that it had been written for children, which it was. The illustrations of the animals were also very cute.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book. It was easy to read and easy to understand. As always, I was amazed at how much knowledge was crammed into a small space. I learned some new facts about the universe and the universe was the best part about the book.   The most interesting part for me was the "fictional aliens" story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title alone could give me a feeling of uneasiness, but the author uses this book to provide answers. After reading the first few pages I thought: "Hmm. A book about the meaning of life?" This is, of course, my biggest pet peeve with some philosophy, and I found the book interesting.  I found that the first half is actually an introduction to Nietzsche's philosophy. He is very clear and concise, and there is a clear delineation of how his ideas fit into the rest of philosophy.   From there the author shows how to apply the first three lectures to everyday life.  His main thesis is that we are the product of our beliefs, and the things we believe about the world help us create our identity. The problem with this idea is that our beliefs influence our actions, but we're also the products of our own beliefs, which in turn affect how our actions affect our identity and our actions change our beliefs.  In order to change our belief about the universe we must have a clear idea of why we believe that the universe exists in the first place. I can't say that I completely agree with this, but I don't think it is necessarily a bad point.  This is a good philosophical book, with the best part being that it is well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - I was not sure how I felt about this book, but after finishing it, I really liked the author's style and the way he wrote the book. He has a unique, fresh, and fun way to approach the subject matter and he does not use a traditional point of view - rather he gives the reader a whole new perspective on the subject by giving a good overview of the different opinions out there in regards to the subject (there are many opinions). I think that some of the opinions that this book gives are valid and valid opinions, but they're not the ones I personally think of when it comes to the topic. But the author is well-known for having a fun way of writing so I can't fault him for that. I especially liked the fact that he took an unorthodox approach by bringing in his daughter and brother-in-law - a great addition to the book - and I feel like those two adds a lot of personality and insight to the characters. In fact, the only complaint I have with the book is the fact the author did not give a summary for the book on Amazon or on the publisher's website, which I think would have been useful. Other than that, this book really got me excited about books and about science, so I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the topic or even if they haven't read anything about the subject before. Posted by Gwyneth Krantz at 11:07 AM A little about me: I'm a science and nature writer/blogger (that means I write about topics in biology, physics, physics/mathematics, anthropology, physics and mathematics, engineering and astronomy, psychology, and so on), and I have blogged on topics ranging from astrophysics to quantum mechanics. I'm also a computer scientist, and I've written about such topics as network security and computer-based design. I have done a lot with the field of artificial intelligence, and my current research is in cognitive science: the study of human cognition in the context of artificial systems (such as learning from data).
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had to read a book about the Holocaust before I could put down The Diary of Anne Frank. I wasn't surprised. But the book was written so well, it was hard not to fall in love with Anne's story. I loved the fact that she wasn't afraid to talk about the horrors she experienced in her life, including the suffering of the other Jews. In addition, Anne's father wrote her a letter to tell her about the camp, her family, and the diary. While this book is more historical and historical, I also enjoyed it because I am a fan of the books. The first time I read about Anne's life, I did not understand why she was in hiding. I was surprised to learn that the Nazis were not trying to identify and put a Jewish girl in hiding just because she was Jewish.        I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the story of a girl who lived through the darkest times. I found that she talked about it in such a way that it didn't take me very long to understand why it would be dangerous to be Jewish in Europe.      In conclusion, I am so thankful that I have this book, as well as the other Holocaust related books I have. I have been through a lot over the past few years, but I have always been thankful that it wasn't my parents or grandparents who suffered. Thank you for this book and all the other books that help us to know what is really happening in the world today, and I hope you are able to write something like this for Anne Frank, as it is something that the Jewish people need to read. I would like to thank my good friend and teacher, Mary Lasker. My teacher and I always talk about Anne Frank's diary, which we can't read every year without giving the children one of our favorite books for a homework.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read "C. S. Lewis' Mere Christianity". This is a really interesting and worthwhile book, and is definitely not just an apologetic for the Christian faith, but a very thought-provoking exploration of the Christian scriptures.  The book opens by briefly discussing the Christian doctrine of God, the Trinity, the Incarnation, and so on. This is not the first time I have read this type of article, but I believe that it is the best. Lewis begins by discussing the question of why the Christians believe in a god so much.  He goes on to address this by explaining why he and the other Christians believe that God is a being who "cares" about us and that He is "the one" who "did all this and sent His Son". The reason we should believe in the Christian god is that God gives us purpose in our lives and gives us a "real existence" in the world. The problem with this idea is that there are a lot of other people out there who do not seem to have the same level of purpose, and in fact, we are likely to die alone in the "heavenly" afterlife.    Lewis then discusses what it means to "faithfully believe" in God, which is basically a very different thing from believing in God as a being that "cared" about you.  Lewis explains how we need to know what we "believe" in to be truly "believing", because if we do not, then we are in effect saying that God does not exist.   It is a subtle, and perhaps somewhat confusing, distinction, but at least it makes sense when you think about it.   In other words, if you do not believe that the Christian God exists, then you are not truly believing.   And if God does exist, then how are we to know that He "care" about what we believe?   And finally, Lewis discusses how a Christian worldview might best "explain" why Christians do not do well when their society worships the wrong god.  There are a number of reasons why Christianity fails in many countries, including the fact that they "worship" the wrong gods, or that the people who follow the "wrong" god are not really "believers". Lewis states that one of the main reasons why a particular religion does not do as well as the one in which he lives is that people simply do not follow a god who cares about them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I had a few doubts about this story because I'm not a huge fan of horror but I think that the horror aspect works quite well here.   The story is set in a town in Ohio called "Buckeye Falls" which has a haunted house and is a small town so I wasn't expecting to see any major monsters. However, when you see what really goes on in that town I think you'll be shocked! I was so surprised by this book because the author did a fantastic job writing the story.  The ending of this book left me totally breathless!
Write a positive review about a good book:      " This was a fantastic book. I enjoyed the book a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book. The author's research on the subject is thorough and provides a solid understanding of how the effects of the Cold War, especially the so-called "dual containment," developed. It is easy to understand why this situation was so devastating to U.S. national security; the Soviets were capable of producing weapons far more sophisticated than the nuclear-tipped missiles they were sending to Cuba that were capable, in theory, of destroying the continental United States. The Soviets, to put it plainly, could not be trusted. If you want to know why the Cold-War arms race developed the way it did, this is a book worth reading.  My only regret is that the book was published only in Russian. I have no desire to live in a nation controlled by a regime that is willing to sink the world to the level of its enemies.    The authors make a great point that a full understanding of why the Cuban Missile Crisis turned into a nuclear war cannot be gleaned solely from hindsight.  I am, however, a firm believer in historical amnesia:  to the extent that a nation's history cannot be easily separated from the present, as the Soviet Union was for most of the 20th century, this should be taken as a sign that history's arc bends toward more benign outcomes (though that's a topic for another post).
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book for my nephew who's a big fan of the show. He asked for a book about the characters and this is a great book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't really know what the big deal is, but I think I have finally discovered a true "classic".   The book is "A Man with No Name", written in the 1920's and tells the story of John Dillinger, a "man with no name".  The story is one of redemption and redemption is what the book is all about.  The author explains the Dillinger story with this: "He spent most of his time in prison, living the American dream, until it fell apart. Then he was sentenced to life. The authorities knew who he was, and when they caught him, they locked him up.   He served his sentence, and in exchange he gave them his real name: John Dill."  I thought this book was good and the ending was good.  I have read more than one account that gives the account of how Dillinger got his name and he told the reader how his sister had tried to kill him after she saw a picture of him in a magazine, but Dillinger said to her that his name was a "fake name", and that he had no "good" name.  So what about this story?   It is a true story of a man who lived in the world of violence and crime and was one of the most dangerous people in America.  He would rob banks and have people shot for making mistakes with his money.  Dillinger was also one of those men that would use guns and bombs to destroy his enemies.  The story also shows the way the media is covering the story, so it was important to know that.  And I also liked how the book explained that he was a member of the "Black Legion".  But the best part of this book is the story itself.  It was a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first one I picked up in the series I was disappointed by the writing as there was a lot of "what I've read before" and the pacing of it is kinda bad in my opinion but I'm glad I bought it and read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:      The idea of being forced to be gay by someone who is not in a position to make such a decision has been around for quite some time.  The bestseller in this field is about a guy who's being forced by his older step brother to take a "lifestyle" that the elder brother doesn't want to see him pursue.  I like the fact that this book takes its subject as seriously as a family member or close friend would take the topic, so that the characters feel real.  One of the reasons I love reading this book is the way the author does it.   I think the story gets really interesting when the topic of having to be homosexual is finally discussed in a realistic way, and the authors doesn't pull any punches, not even in the matter of the step brother.  He's portrayed as the jerk, but the characters' feelings about him are understandable, and we're not made to think that being gay is a bad thing.  In fact, one of the characters, whom the book is about, says that being a step brother is like being a surrogate father, and that the feelings the characters have for one another are sincere.  The only drawback of this book was that the ending turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.  But, I would definitely recommend this book if you're looking for a book about gay men who are forced to come to terms with their own sexuality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was excellent.   I think it is a book that every serious person would want to read.  It is very informative in the area of what is involved in making a good nuclear weapon.  From the basic engineering of the bomb to the actual production of the bombs.  The history of the development of the atomic bomb is very interesting as well.  While the book focuses on the production of nuclear bombs the writing is very educational as it discusses the development.  I would definitely recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book, it was a good read, with a funny and a good plot, if you like that type of book, read it. I liked that it is about an alien that comes to earth to look for a human mate. There is a good story, so I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The title of this book would probably better suited for a children's book, because in my mind it could be easily described as "I hate you and I love you all at the same time", but that's a pretty boring way to go about describing it.   This story centers around a group of children from a rich family who are about to leave on a vacation to Europe. After a few weeks of being treated like babies, and being told all of their plans by a woman who is clearly crazy, it seems as if everyone is ready to pack up and leave, but not before the author takes her time to explain how all of the other rich kids are living a life of luxury on the vacation. At least one character says, "I'm sorry. You are all crazy and I don't know what to do about it."   But then, in the second half of the book, the author explains to us how all the rich kids came to live with the poor one's mother. It's a great lesson in life and why we need to keep trying to be better people, no matter how much we hate others or how much money we have.  I love this book. It makes me laugh out loud and also make me think about the things that we as a society say are bad or that we should avoid.  If I ever make it to a foreign country, I'm going to have to read this book to learn about the people around me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard to explain the power and significance of the first part of " The Great Deception " without having read that one already. And to me, it was as shocking as any other revelation in this book. The book is very hard to put down, but there's something just so damn good about it. This book is about an organization run by a sociopathic, deceitful, and completely immoral leader who makes millions off of the suffering and desperation of his victims while they are still alive. His only purpose is to extract as much money as possible from the victims to fund his lavish lifestyle.   This is a book that will stand with the classics of sociopathology, not just in the fact that the author was able to write it, but in the level of research and writing that goes into it, which is not a common thing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful book with a number of gems. A good read for children. The author makes a real effort to understand the importance of nature and wildlife. The pictures are lovely and the book tells the story well. I like that the author gives a little history of the wild animals and people who have lived alongside them. I don't think it is the best book, but I'll read more of it because it is good for kids and adults alike. Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing I was not pleased with was the title of the book. I guess it could be a parody or a parody of a parody, depending on the person you ask. But, if it's not a parody... well, you're just not getting any humor.  "What makes a man happy?"  It's the same as asking "What makes any woman happy?" In this case, we're looking for the man's answer.  This is what happens if you don't ask the woman's answer:  When I ask a woman, "What do you make of this?" I want to get her to say something like, "I'm glad you asked!"  So I'm not looking for a female answer, I'm looking for one for males.   I mean, who knows better than a male how to be happy?  I thought this was a book about finding happiness for a man... how about some for a woman?  "... I don't know what happiness really is, but it looks pretty good to me."    My daughter is a female student of psychology and a female friend of my son.  It could be, however, that they have the same opinions about happiness but have different perspectives.  I like that this is an example of what a person who has nothing to lose does in order to find happiness.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am just finishing The Devil's Advocate, and I must say I enjoyed it.    First, the book is well-written.  There are two things that I noticed, and one of them is very good.  One is that while the narrator does a good job with the accents, the use of them to portray the way people talk is good. This helps the tone of the book. The second thing is, the author does a nice job of describing what it's like to be a young woman who's married off to a rich man.  I know this might not be the book for me, but I was surprised to find that this is not the usual kind of book that I think most young women would read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've just read The Great Gatsby, and I can honestly say I loved it.   After reading many books, I was prepared for the fact that the book would be somewhat predictable, and that the characters would play like a string of dolls, all the way through to the end.  When I read about the characters in the book, I could just about hear the audience laughing and cracking up.  I loved their eccentricities, and their unique abilities.  There were no dull parts to the story, and the ending was satisfying.  The only flaw was that it was a bit too much of a "let's all get together and drink a lot of alcohol and laugh a lot" type of novel, though.  I don't really like a lot to be honest with you.  This book is definitely one of those books that I read through the eyes of a character I thought was a complete asshole.  He's supposed to be an extremely successful businessman and a playboy and I have to say, I didn't have high hopes for this book.  What I like about this book is the way that it gives you a little glimpse into the lives of a lot different people.  Even though the characters are very well defined and developed, you don't know what's going to happen to them, or if they're going to survive the book. I don't think that this is a bad thing, though, because it really gives the book a bit of depth to it, which I think is something the author did well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book. The stories are well written and have a nice progression. I'm also very pleased with how many different characters are mentioned.   One of the things I liked most about this book is the way it was narrated.  The narration was quite pleasant and even though the characters are in a book, the voices are easy to understand. This was a very enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.    
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book for those of us with ADHD. I love that this book gives me a few hours in bed each night after a long work day.    Thank you, David Ritter for this excellent book.  I was given this book as a gift and I have to say that the author is fantastic!   It has made a huge difference in my ADHD, I am able to go to bed after my normal work day but before bed time.  I have also found it very helpful for managing my ADD/ADHD.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "  A solid, if a little slow, adventure novel, The Red King was a great story.   It   does   a lot with a little.  I   liked the way   it   went from  a   small, quiet town,   to   the   largest and most important town in the kingdom.  The   action   is   fast-paced, but   not   excessive." "   The book does a good job of conveying a small village to the reader with a lot of detail.  It does have its ups and downs, but the book is also a nice story."
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a lot of good things about it, but it also has a couple of shortcomings as well. First, the book's structure is really weak. The first book has an almost linear structure: we meet the main character, a few of his closest friends, and the reader/viewer is introduced to the world in which the story takes place. The second book doesn't follow the same pattern at all, with a lot more plot, characters, and settings moving around. The book doesn`t really get going until Chapter 13, at which point the plot is about 70% finished, but the world isn`t fully realized. The writing is okay, but not great, so you can`t call the writing brilliant.   The plot is pretty simple: a princess has been kidnapped, there`s a quest for her recovery, and there`ll be some bloodshed along the way. The actual plot is rather simplistic compared to the rest of the series, but in a very good way. You won`t be bored, and a little bit of blood and guts can` t hurt.  Overall, the writing and characters are very well developed, and although the world is very simple and the plot isn` t particularly compelling, the overall story is really interesting.  I had two major criticisms with the book. First: the book`s structure. The initial book introduces the main characters and the setting as one, with the second book following that structure. However, both books can be read independently of each other. Second: the characters. The characters in this book are very, very likable. Their motivations are believable, and they`re very well written. I wish we`d seen more of them, though. The story ends up being rather confusing, and all the characters seem to go their separate ways.  My Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars  by: TheLonelySky I was so glad I picked up this one! It was a fun adventure fantasy. It had a lot to offer, as it did the most I could ask for in a fantasy book, and it was well worth the time and money I spent to read it. The series itself has been very popular. It does have some flaws, but I`ve found that a lot has been written about the problems in the series and the ones that I have had, while missing the other aspects that make it a really good series to read. So I will focus
Write a positive review about a good book:    It took me a long time to get around to reading this book. I was worried that it might be boring and preachy, but it was very thought-provoking and filled me with a sense of understanding of some of the difficulties we face.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    - I liked this book. I was disappointed that it ended abruptly; however, it's too bad because that's how I'd like to read more of this author's work. This series is a mystery of the mind with a little bit of paranormal and mystery thrown in. I recommend this series to people who enjoy good mysteries or mystery thrillers.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It is a great story, and the author does a great job of using humor to tell the story. I wish the book was longer, but that's how I like my books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased the book through Book Riot. The book is a good introduction to the subject of religion in the modern world. The author discusses a number of different aspects of religion, some of which are somewhat controversial (evolution and creationism). He also discusses the various forms religion takes, such as Protestant, Catholic, etc. This book is for anyone interested in religion. My only criticisms of the book are that some of the facts he presents are just not well-sourced (evangelical Christians have been more accepting of women in the pulpit than mainline Protestants) and that he doesn't mention a book that is also helpful to the non-believer: Christianity in America: The Rise of a Religious Nation. I purchased both these books and have enjoyed them both. Thank you for creating a book which I recommend.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a good story, but it could have been a lot better. It felt like a one shot that was written to wrap up a series.    Write a negative review about an ok book: I have not enjoyed this story. I am not disappointed because it is not a bad book but I wish it had been more focused on the book world, the characters and the plot line. I was very disappointed with the fact that the book ended before the characters had their payoff, and the ending didn't work as a character piece.  I am sure that it was because this book was meant to be a one-shot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can only add a negative:  This is a story about a man who has been abused for many years. We see him come out of a coma in a very physical way and his wife who is the love of his life finally does not hate him.   It's a very strong and important book about life that I think should be read by anyone who's been abused. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been working through this book for a couple of weeks now, and it is a very, very good read. It is a classic that has been made into a movie but I have yet to see it so can't comment on that. The book is about the life of a man who is in love with a young woman who is from another planet. He is an average person trying to save his soul from the wrath of a higher power or something to that effect. So far I have enjoyed the book very much.

Write a positive review about a good book:     This is a well written book on how to create a successful website in less than a day. It also explains the entire process step by step so if you have any doubts at all you can just skip to the end where you can choose to use Google or whatever. I was also surprised that Google is the most useful because it explained how the search engine is used to help find content and it is a lot more precise and easy to use.  My only complaint is that it doesn't really explain how to build a website or get someone to link to your blog from their website. It just tells you how to use it! I'd like to see a video that explains how it works. It does give a little information to get you started.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read the book because the author has a long and distinguished publishing history as a children's book author. I do not regret my purchase of this book and I recommend it highly.   If I were a kid I would have bought it.  I have a book club that selects new children's books from the authors who have been part of the literature scene for the longest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never read a book so beautifully written. The narrative is beautifully told. It is just what you expect.   My only complaint is that it's the first of a series. There is not enough time to see everything before the next one.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was at a big gathering of people (which is a common type of gathering, especially at the beach) when I saw a man who looked like he had been in the army and just was a bit too comfortable. When I walked up to him and he saw me he looked a little startled. He sat down next to me. We got to talking and he told me he's been struggling to get out of his funk for a while now. He had been a soldier in the navy for a bit, and then got caught up in a drug bust. He said he was in jail for over a year, but was able to get himself back on track after a while, but he couldn't keep the dope from bothering him. He's just a little too comfortable with things he shouldn't be. He knows I have no problem with people and he knows I was never in the military to be scared of people. He just wanted to share what it was like. He was a great talker and a wonderful storyteller. He made a lot of people laugh and he did so in a matter-of-fact way.   - T  I 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book so much I gave it 5 stars.   As my first book I've never read before it was perfect for me.  I love the characters and the story it tells about the journey from girlhood to adult life is great.  A bit of fantasy I like in this is a bit creepy I just don't want the kids to become monsters like they did in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I like the tone that David has taken in these reviews, and I like the way that he has been able to show some of the flaws that I believe are present in the book. I like that David is very clear about why he is doing this, and about what he believes to be a serious issue with the writing. I also appreciate that David acknowledges how he has a certain amount of privilege as a white man with access to certain resources, and this has contributed to a lot of the racism that he finds himself being subjected to. The book is worth a read, as is the review.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. I have always loved historical fiction. When I was younger I used to read a lot of fiction, but then I started looking at history, as well, and I have been hooked ever since. This book is set in the early 1800's and tells the story of one of the earliest settlers of the state of Minnesota, John "Red" Aitken. The book is told from the perspective of John Aitkison, and the book doesn't disappoint.  John Red Aitkin is a bit of a buffoon and a bit crazy, but that doesn't make him any less interesting. The story follows him as he travels the United States, where he learns of various people who have passed away, and decides to leave America with his dog and horse to settle somewhere in Europe. Aitokon follows his heart and ends up in the Czech Republic, and he does what he thinks is best for the people he met there. He ends up marrying a Czech girl and starting a new life there. The ending is very sad and I found it a bit depressing. I enjoyed this story, but it was a bit too sad.   This book was very easy to read, and it did not bore me in the least. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a brilliant book with a complex and fascinating philosophy.  The author is a fascinating figure.   She is a woman from a middle-class family with a long professional career in her field.  Her life story includes being the target of sexism for much of her career, and having her professional life threatened in the 90s when a male academic she worked with committed suicide.  I found it a great story but I have to say she took a bit of a back seat for me.  She has lots of insight but in the end she doesn't get to do anything interesting with it.  It was a book that I would have liked to read more about but it is a very good book.     I also found the book's philosophy interesting.  Like many philosophers, she wants to re-interpret Kant to reflect the way we really live our lives now.  That is a noble goal and one that I found interesting, particularly the way she sees the world today as a time when the world has changed and changed a lot.  But I didn't find her approach very convincing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a lot of talk in my class about how to choose your first career (I'm not even a teacher) but that's a totally different discussion. I've been looking at this book and reading some of the reviews by other students who are in similar positions.   I'm a full time freelance writer and part time consultant.  The book is great for those looking to start a career in that field.  There's a great mix of stories, tips and insights.  One of my colleagues is going to be hiring a new editor.  I was looking at her resume and came across a list of her credits as a professional.  In addition to my education I also have a couple of years as a copy editor. I hope that someone with this information will be able to hire her as an editor soon.   Good book for anyone:   I like the way the author walks through the different aspects and benefits of becoming a freelancer and how to decide what you like to do.  It is the "how to" aspect that I do like.  This is a useful read for anyone who wants to be a professional writer.  Thank you for putting this into print!  A great read for aspiring freelance writers.  A must read for everyone who's interested in a career as a freelance writer!  I love how the author offers tips on what types of freelance gigs you can get and how you can find the right clients!   the "How to" book is a good place to start.  Although, I still think a course with a local school with a few more books on the topic would be more helpful for a student starting out.  - April 24, 2018This is a great book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this one. There's quite a bit in here I don't really know how to categorize. It's kind of like a mix between a crime novel and a fantasy novel. The writing is strong and the writing is interesting, although you will find yourself going back and forth on who this author's primary focus is. A definite recommended read, definitely worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book. It's about a woman who is a very well adjusted woman who's husband gets a little violent towards her in the past. She's been in therapy a while. When she gets pregnant, she wants to know if it's ok. She has a son who she can't seem to take care of. He has autism. She tries to help him, but it's not a priority. She does get a good job as a personal assistant, which is a good position for her to have. I also enjoyed the characters in this book (the author herself). I have been married to a man who has been in the military for years and years and who just seems to get worse and worse. His wife, who is an office manager at a large company, gets jealous, and he can't help but get violent. He does seem to realize something is wrong, but then keeps going down the same path. One thing I really appreciated is the character that is diagnosed with autism. I've heard a lot about autism, but have never really seen it. I like the fact that it's addressed in the book. Also, the ending was really, really depressing. But, I was willing to go on with it. If it had ended, I think I would have quit reading it. This is the kind of book that I think most people who are parents, or people in the workplace, or teachers, or anyone with a tough job need to read. It'll help you understand some of the issues they have with getting along with others, and some of what it takes to get your child to listen to you.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It has lots of wonderful ideas and is filled with some fun ideas for creating a really great game system. I also like that he didn't get bogged down by trying to write the "real game" (which I know from reading various books can be hard).   The book is full of fun and useful rules, but that doesn't stop the author from going off on tangents to tell you that the rules in this system are actually the rules of a fantasy game.   For me, this is the kind of book I want to keep in my RPG collection so I can learn some new ideas and add my own flavor to the world.  This book is pretty good and well written with lots of interesting ideas. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story, the characters and the pacing were amazing. If I had to compare this to any of the other books I have read I would say it was much more like Harry Potter than the other two.  The writing was very good for a first book and as the book progresses the writing has improved even more.  I am now on my third book in the series.   I really enjoyed the beginning of the book. It was very intriguing but not overly so. I was hoping for a more serious character in the beginning and that is definitely not the case. The characters are all interesting but it is difficult to remember a name. The beginning of this series did not disappoint and I would highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished the new book by Mark Anthony Neal (The Power and the Glory of Myth ). It is very good.

It will not make you a better or more compassionate person. I have had plenty of unpleasant experiences in my life and I can appreciate the struggles of others.  But I do not agree with her conclusion that we should ignore the suffering of others for the sake of our own welfare.  There's a lot to admire in her writing.  She manages to show compassion for all who suffer in ways that a lot of us don't dare.  In addition to being a good teacher, she's also a good writer.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a few books about the end of the world, and was left with a definite conclusion. This book isn't quite there yet. There's plenty of information that can be presented with a lot of details, but nothing seems quite concrete enough to me, yet. I've read a good amount of apocalyptic books (there is nothing I haven't read in the last 15 years), and this one isn't the best I've ever read (not as good as "The End of the World as We Know It," which is the most recent book I've tried to write about). It's interesting to note that in this book, the world does not end on November 1st, 2011. Instead, a large meteorite impacts somewhere in Siberia, and is later discovered to have crashed to earth in the region of the Ural Mountains, on April 15th, 2061, and that a nuclear reactor in Siberia has gone critical, as the explosion would cause a global nuclear holocaust. The book mentions, briefly, that a group of Russian scientists working on this reactor are going through some sort of malfunction, but not much is said about what exactly has happened. However, the main story here is the Russian scientists, and this is how I found it: there are two main groups, led by one scientist, who are working to save humanity. They both believe they're correct, and they're even able to communicate using radio. They're on opposite ends of the spectrum, and I'd say they're on the same side, although that side seems very hard to distinguish. The first group seems to be trying to save the world from nuclear fallout, as they believe that by stopping the meteorite from hitting earth, and keeping it from impacting other places, they will be able to save it. The second group is trying to preserve as much of the planet as possible in case of a nuclear holopocalypse, as this is the only way we will be spared. The two groups are fighting, and it's very confusing at times. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but I feel like there's a conflict between the two groups that could have gone better had the author given it more focus. In other words, it seems to me that if this had been a different book, but the same author, then the story might have been much better. There are a couple of points that did stick out to me as I read the book, and in some cases, made me think that
Write a positive review about a good book:    Like most good books, this book is well worth reading and I feel the writer, James Kagan, has done a fantastic job of conveying his message through the different chapters. He is very eloquent and has a way with words that I really enjoy. The book is very well done and well researched and shows the different types of people that existed in ancient Egypt.   This book is not a history book, as I feel it should be, and does not delve into how the various kings and emperors and what not have influenced the different people and cultures of the Middle East. This book focuses on the various myths, legends, and beliefs surrounding the world and civilizations that have been around for thousands of years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book I read from the perspective of an Israeli soldier who was captured by the Palestinians in 1967. The Palestinians had kidnapped him as a result of the incident in the Sinai Desert in 1967 when an Israeli patrol tried to evacuate a wounded soldier. The soldiers found themselves surrounded by hostile Arabs who shot and wounded the soldiers before one of the Arab terrorists killed one of them in cold blood.   The book begins by describing the Israeli soldiers' apprehension about what is to come after the rescue.  He is in the desert and has seen some of the atrocities that the Palestinians have committed in the course of the recent past and is concerned about what the future holds for him. He describes his fears and the reactions he has seen among the soldiers and he gives his take on what is likely to happen.  The soldier is clearly concerned about his future and his survival and he is not as cynical about the intentions of the Arabs as he was in the past. However, the real issue is the issue of the captured soldier and the issue that the soldier and his captors have in common: they both want to survive. They both desire to be liberated and have a desire to return to the battlefield.  These are all valid and necessary desires.  They are not incompatible desires. If they are not compatible desires then it is only because it is easier to live in a country where one's countrymen will not want to kill him as they have killed others.  We can see in this that the Arab's desire for freedom and the Israeli's desire to survive are not mutually exclusive but are merely different ways of looking at the same thing.  I found that the author's approach was very clear and easy to follow.  It was easy to understand what the author was trying to say and I think this helps the reader understand the motivations of the soldiers very well.  In summary, this book is excellent and worth reading.  Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The world of the occult is one of the more fascinating realms on the planet. From the Ancient Greek and Roman Mysteries to the Christian belief that Jesus is the anti-Christ, to the modern-day practice of the Tarot to the occulted world of The Illuminati, there's a great deal of mythology involved in the world of occultism. So, when I found a book called The Occult Origins of Christianity, I knew I had to have it.   This is a book that shows how the ancient Egyptians believed in the Christian god. In particular, they believed that he was the god of Light. They also believe he was part of the solar system, like Apollo and the sun. In fact, the ancient Egyptian sun god was called Horus the Red Sun. He was also known as the Sun God, or the Horus. As such, he was worshipped by people from around the world. They thought it was necessary to have a god to light their path and guide them through the darkness. However, they were also taught to avoid the sun at night. The reason was because the Sun was said to be the god that had the power to destroy life, and it would cause death to those who were caught outside at night to worship it. In order to avoid this, they taught that you should live in the shadow of the night god. The book goes into great detail on how the early Christians adopted the worship of the sun god in order to help them get closer to him.  The Book:  The Occults Origins of Christendom   Author: Robert T. Barrett ISBN: 1-85925-042-6 Paperback: 9.5 x 7.75 inches Pages: 200 Publisher: Bantam Press (April, 1996) Pages: 202 The Ancient Egyptian religion was a great influence on early Christianity. It is a belief system that had a lot of similarities to the Greek and the Roman religions. In the ancient world, they had a religion known as Isis. The early Christians called this a "myth" because it was just one man's belief. It was not actually an actual religious doctrine. In Egypt, the goddess of the Sun is often considered the god Hathor. Hathor was often portrayed with a headdress called a scepter. In early Christianity, the Romans were the ones who claimed the religion was from god of light, Horus. These two stories have a lot in common. The same goddess that Isis worshiped,

Write a positive review about a good book:       I have enjoyed many of the books in my collection of classic works.   It is a very enjoyable read, it is entertaining and well written.  The characters are well drawn, the setting is fun.  I really recommend this one.  I am a fan of the book series and I always look forward to reading new books in it.  This series started with the first book in the series (The Sword Of Truth) which I liked quite a lot.  When I heard the author wanted to do a sequel to this book I was very excited.  My expectations were high because The Sword Of truth has been an instant classic in my opinion.  With its dark, and evil world building and epic battles, this book is definitely a must read for fantasy fans.  It's the first of the series, but I will continue to read The Sword of Truth in the coming years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book, especially for the history portion. It's a bit dated, but still a good read, and the content is still relevant.     I don't usually do this, but if you ever get a chance to check out the B-movie "Krampus", it was inspired by this book. I think the story is great, but I feel like Krampus probably isn't as evil as the stories.      Rating: 4 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a little girl, my parents told me they were buying me a book of fairy tales to make me a good reader. The book is the one I got, but it's also the only one I'll ever read. It contains stories about many different types of creatures, but is most famous for the one where Cinderella gets a magic lamp that turns her into a mouse. The story is full of wit and wonderful characters, but also makes you wonder just how a lamp would turn a princess into a squirming mess. My parents don't get the reference, because they've read it to me many times.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best sci-fi books I've read in a long time. It's hard to find an old-school science fiction series that doesn't have a few flaws, but the author has made some changes so that I can appreciate the books as they were intended. The book is great to read and the characters are complex and interesting. I would definitely re-read this book. I really can't say much about the other books in the series without spoiling them! It's good that there is no book 2 in the trilogy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    What a great book to have a go at and find out how far I have come since then, and what I really need to work on.   My daughter has had problems with the language in some books and I was really glad she found this.   Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? Why or why not? I'm going to give it a few more listens and see where it takes me.  Who was your favorite character and why? What do you like about the story? A young girl and her teacher find themselves in a world that is a little bit like our own, but in an unknown and frighteningly familiar way. They have to work together to get out of the mess they find themselves stuck in, but only through the help of their two best friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read this book in the same way that I read, and enjoyed it as a whole.   The author does a great job of giving a short synopsis of the story before the start of the book, which is great.  I felt as though the author explained everything that could possibly be a possible outcome to the book very well.  There are several short chapters describing different things that are discussed throughout the story, and each one is pretty well thought out.  Another good thing about the book is that it doesn't have any "too complicated" concepts, which means that if you can read it on one page, you could probably understand everything about the plot.  Also, I was glad to see that the author includes pictures in the book (mostly drawings, since she has a good understanding of what she's talking about), as that is a very good way to visually illustrate the ideas that are being described.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the information that the book gave me, and I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I loved this book, I felt that it really captured a time in my life. I'm not an expert in anything (especially sports) but I felt like I learned a lot about life. " -Nicky, age 18, San Diego, CA (review from a high school senior) "I liked this book. It is an extremely detailed look at how a child and adult can handle the trials and tribulations of their lives and the things that affect them. I especially liked the part about being an athlete. It's nice to learn from someone as smart as Brad."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite book, read all the way through.   Not a bad time to read.  My friends would call it a classic.  I liked the characters.  The way the characters were drawn were so well done.  Very interesting, it had me hooked the whole way through and I am looking forward to the sequel!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book!! I am a new mom, but have been reading books on parenting for years. I am so excited to read the book because I know I'm not the only new mom I know who has had to learn to cook and cook to live, and then cook again, and again, until you make something just right for you! The book is written in an easy to follow style that I love. My favorite part of the book was the list of ways to cook things like chicken with potatoes. I have read a few books on how to make chicken with stews, but nothing that had the combination of the potatoes and chicken I love to eat. This book gave me a lot of good ideas for making chicken and potatoes, and made me want to try my hand at home cooking. The recipes in this book will save you lots of time, and will be a big time saver for when you have the opportunity to make something quick and easy and don't want to take the time to make dinner. This is an exciting cookbook for new moms and for any mom out there with a busy life. The only thing I wish the author would have done a little better was add a few pictures of how to cook it. The recipe in the book is great, but I wish there was a little more about how to actually make it, or the different cooking times. I could use a little help in cooking this! I am excited to try a few of the ideas in the next few weeks. I can't wait to try some of the chicken and potato recipes in my new book. Thank you so much for helping new moms to cook with ease. This was a great help for me, and I definitely plan to purchase another copy in the future!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book as it was written and the story line was interesting.   If you are a fan of John Cleese, I recommend you read this book.  I liked how he did not go to Hollywood as the other characters did and I appreciated his ability to work with characters that you may not see every day.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has some good writing and good ideas but is lacking a lot of the more interesting characters and interesting concepts.   The story is interesting but doesn't have any of the most interesting parts of fantasy (e.g. magic).   I feel like there is a lot left to be explored in this world that is really nice and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for my son to read while playing in the kitchen. He liked it, and he really likes reading. He asked me to read it to him, so that he could get a good idea of what a book like this would be like. The illustrations were very well done and the story was excellent. The only problem I had was that it was a little lengthy. But still, it was enjoyable, and it was the perfect book to teach my son about the things that have changed and the things we have left behind, the things for which the family will always be grateful.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one that I will be reading a lot more of. I'm a writer of horror stories and this is probably my favorite. The writing is excellent, the story is interesting and intriguing.   It's not a perfect book by any means but this is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is so much more interesting than her sister.   She has the heart of a princess.  The two of them are the main characters.  They were so very happy to meet each other.  It was like a big brother/little sister's love story.  All I know is that the characters were perfect.  I was so happy to see that there was no love triangle.  So many times in my life I wanted to marry someone, but was unable to due to a love triangle or a sister/sister's love triangle.  I had no clue how the story would end. The ending is just perfect.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well written book. I feel I know the main character, and what makes her tick. She is funny and smart, and I like the idea that her father is her guardian.   I wish I had read this before I started writing in a book club. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As an amateur writer, I've always felt that my first published works were terrible. In fact, I still feel that way about many of them, but there's a part of me that will never give up hope and try again.   So, here I am, over a year later, trying to do this, again. A lot of the book reads like it was written by someone who knew exactly what he was doing. He has great ideas, and has a lot of fun with them. If I were an expert on the subject, I would have done a lot better job at this one.  I'm not going to say that it's perfect, but it's definitely a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a difficult time rating my books.   My books are mostly well written and written well, but that's about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read.   There are so many excellent ideas about social problems in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a beginner in programming. The book starts by teaching you the basic fundamentals of programming in JavaScript. The first section teaches you about the variables and functions that can be used in your program. Next comes a discussion on how to loop over the data in a variable and get the next value. After this, you are given a basic program to build an input field and a output field. This is then followed by a discussion of loops in JavaScript, as well as a couple of examples of what to use if you are not familiar with them. This section covers arrays and the for statement. The section on function overloading is about how to use the functions and the "this" keyword. After the section on functions and arrays, you learn how to build simple user interfaces.   The book ends with an introduction to functional programming and how to work with data structures in JavaScript as well. The exercises in the book cover basic arithmetic operations as well a few other things you might be curious about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am enjoying this book so far. It has a very good story line that will keep my interest for a long time. The protagonist, Mary, is an older woman in a nursing home. After losing her beloved husband to heart disease, she has lost a lot of herself to it as well. She also is in denial, so much so that when her new partner comes to visit she lets him and a young man stay in her room. When his friend dies, she is shocked and devastated. She begins to get very angry, and starts to believe that all the pain she is feeling are signs that her husband is alive and in heaven, and he isn't going to take good care of her. In the meantime, the friend is in a coma and the family has to deal with his death.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a fan of a lot of the non-fiction in the world - including this one - but this book is more of a history book with a lot more anecdotes and insight than a typical historical book. It's a fascinating look into the lives of the founding fathers (and some of the more famous people from the time) but it's also a real eye opener and fascinating read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The plot is well thought out, with many plot twists and a satisfying conclusion. The art style is cool, and the stories seem to flow in a logical manner.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a good one, and I've loved reading it so far. It contains a lot of what I'd look for in a book about living in a society and being a girl (not that that's a bad thing!). In particular, it includes things I'd like in a fantasy book. However, I would still like some more background on the world and the people, but for now, I am very happy with the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author has a way with the characters and the story in this book was very good, there was a great fight and the action in this was fun and there were many plot twists and turns.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I have tried many types of "energy" books and this is by far the best. I started reading it the first day it came out. I just found it so fascinating and entertaining. I loved it! "Energy" is a really cool sounding name, but it's also very honest about what you are really looking for. I'm definitely going to try it again. I also bought this on Amazon and was amazed by the quality of the book and the reviews. It's also a very easy book to read, which is really nice. It could be a bit longer, but that's my only complaint.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good books always take me back to when I was a kid and my mom would take me over to her cousin's house and get her books for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:       I was skeptical when I first saw the title, but in the end I think I found the book.   This book is a classic, a collection of the best books on the subject.  It has been the topic of much discussion and debate and many people have claimed that they are great but that others have done a better job.  This particular book does a great job of capturing what many people really think about it.  I am not a student of this subject but I am glad to have read about it and glad that there are more books to explore it. It is a great book to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Brett Easton Ellis' debut novel, The Informant is a superb thriller of a tale that will delight both serious and casual readers. It's a good read, one that should be required reading for anyone with an interest in America's intelligence community. Ellis and his co-author, John Connolly, have taken a big idea, and made it feel even bigger." --David J. Schmader, Booklist "It's an extraordinary book that reveals the secrets of the intelligence community with unerring clarity... Ellis is one of the great talents of our time." --Publishers Weekly "The Informant exposes the inner workings of a highly secretive, well-funded, and often dangerous organization -- the CIA. With no apparent evidence to support his claims, Agent John Connally (Ellis) gets caught between a rock and a hard place. If he sticks to the truth, the CIA will believe him and prosecute him for a crime he didn't commit. If Connally takes the information to the CIA's top brass, they'll have his career ruined and his family killed. How does a CIA agent balance his duty to the country with the duty to his family? This complex thriller will appeal to both the intelligence professional and the casual reader." -- Kirkus Reviews "One of the best books of 2013." -- Kino MacGregor

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book, but it does have a few problems:  1) A good chapter should cover the main problem: why humans are so good at so many things.  2) I find the title 'the origin of civilization' a bit misleading as there is nothing to support it.  3) This book is very focused on the last 1,000 years or so and, to me, there are other books that cover this period as well.  4) I don't agree with the idea that humans were smart enough to build a complex machine from scratch in a cave in the middle of nowhere.  5) The book does discuss the effects of the development of agriculture and civilization, but does not go deep into it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be an interesting introduction into the history of cryptography.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - I haven't read it, but this was recommended to me by a friend.   I think I need to go read the rest of it - this is a very unique story - I like how it is told in flashbacks, but I also like that it is presented in one story.    I liked the narrator - he sounded like a college kid, but was obviously experienced.  - His voice was a little too deep for my taste, and I sometimes had a hard time listening to a few words when I first got started.  I'll have to have a re-read!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author takes her time to explain things as she goes along, so that even when I had a couple of questions, I was able to understand them and move along.   Although some of the descriptions seem a little silly or overly detailed (the'stairway' in my house, for instance), other descriptions are spot on (the time when the wife was told that her husband didn't have the energy to take the children to the movies, when she had spent the day making the film, and it just so happened that a friend was coming over to watch the film...and he came in a while later).   It's been a while since I read a story that was so engrossing and interesting (at least in a serious manner), and the author is a terrific storyteller.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read two reviews of this book, one that is very negative and one that, although positive, is not complete. I think the book is good, and I am grateful that I read it. I was very concerned that this would be a book that is so negative and I was also a little worried about what I would find in it, but what I found was not only good, but actually very uplifting.   The book begins with some background information about the author, the author's experiences, the book, etc. Then, we're taken to a place where this book is about a woman who has lost her faith, who has abandoned her family, and who is about to have her own kids taken away from her. She has spent her life as a member of a church that has rejected her and her kids and has, apparently, been wrong in the past (see also this review for more details about her history). At the point of the book's start, we discover that the pastor of this church (who will appear later in the book) is one of the few in the area to have read a lot of books on "theology," that is, on the topic of God's work of redemption in the world. He is about the first person I'd expect to have that background, and his background seems to make him very knowledgeable about his religion.  ... but, as we see, he's still not sure about his faith. He has read a number of the same books that I have and he has done a lot more reading of the Christian world, but he just can't seem to be sure that he believes the same things that I do. He feels as if he's on a roller coaster with each reading of an author who may or may not know what he's talking about. He's always on the verge of abandoning his church, which is a real struggle for him to overcome, and then at the last moment the book makes a suggestion that maybe it is true after all, that his faith may be a little more solid than he had originally thought. He does not, however, abandon his church and his family. He goes on to make the book a series of short stories and a short story collection. These are written from his point of view and they, of course, portray how the pastor's struggles are the struggles of all the members of the church, including him.   This brings us to the final part of the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and I want one for every library in America! I loved the way they gave a voice to the children:  the adults are too busy or stressed to give any real meaning to what these little kids say.    But at the end, when the kids find the book and learn that the world really does exist and has a real purpose and will save them from the bad ones, you can't help but be moved. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was excited to hear the new book by Robert Pinsky. I'm a big fan of his books (he's an amazing writer and I'm very grateful that he put me on to all the good stuff).  . I'm also happy to be reminded that he writes about sex as a human phenomenon, not just the sexual act.   He writes about the pain and the pleasure of foreplay, sex, masturbation, and sex with his wife.  He talks about the psychological reasons why some men have better sex than others, and how to do the things that will make you happy and make sex more enjoyable.  What's great is that he offers solutions for men that don't just make them feel bad.  I'm grateful for these insights.  Thank you, Robert Pinksy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are many good books out there, and some that have been around for a long time.   It is possible that some of these books have become lost to time and that no one will ever find them, but for a good read there are a lot of them.  I don't like the idea that someone should pay money to go into a bookstore and only see a few good books.  But books can be good, even good books you can find in the library.  There are good books I have read at libraries and good books that I have found in used book stores, in flea markets, in thrift stores and in libraries.  It's interesting to compare how these books compare.  A book I have recently read, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, is very good and is a great story.  If I had to say a book that I think is a "good" book, it is This Is a Good Book, by Barbara Kingsolver, a well written and interesting book that teaches you how to read a book.  This is a good example of a good and bad book.    The Good Book by Barbara K.  Kingsolver  is a very funny book about a woman who writes a book about her cat, but her cat is a horrible person.  In the first chapter, she tells how her cat stole something, and then she writes about how she learned not to trust her cat.  She is told that her cat was a good cat, and so they go on a vacation.  The main character was a horrible cat, so I think her book is a bad book because it shows the opposite of what we need to see.  It's not a good, funny, funny book, but it is a well thought out book about reading a book, and why that's a good thing. 4.  Good or bad, don't be a bad person by Michael Patrick Hicks:  This book is about a character who becomes a good person through trying to get back to the old good person that was inside him.  He starts a church.  As a good Christian, it feels very good to read about a Christian doing good things for people.  At the beginning of the book, we see that this church has all kinds of rules, but he tries to do good things.  We see this bad character become good. I think the only bad thing about the book is that the church
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much. My husband read it but he didn't really get it at first but once he caught on, it was a great read. I was just excited to see more of his favorite characters so we could all get to know them. I especially loved the story about the three sisters, as it made the whole story seem a little less scary. I would definitely recommend this book.   The final review I'm going to do for this book is the fact that I was hoping to see a little more detail about how many times the narrator had taken drugs before. But, there was none, no matter how much he swore he would tell her. (And that's my main problem with the book, he says he won't tell his family anything because he is so ashamed of how he uses drugs, but it seems like his sister would rather not know.) Also, after this book was over, my daughter had a big argument with my husband about his addiction. So, this will leave my husband without a book to read for a while, but I think the narrator will grow on me (it's been almost a year), and the little detail about his childhood is really sweet.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not a writer, but read this book and felt like I got a good introduction into a whole new sub-genre of stories. The plot is very well developed and the characters are real. I highly recommend this book!  "The Storytelling Artist" by Robert Louis Stevenson: (3.5 out of 5 stars)  This is a book that I have been wanting to read for quite some time now. It is a great read. Stevenson wrote a novel that follows the character of John Fitzgerald, who creates a fantasy world in which he is the main character. The first half of the book is about John's life in the fantasy world and how he develops his writing abilities and uses them in his work. The second half follows his efforts to save his world from being taken over by another world. It's a very good book. I would recommend this to any fantasy writer.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I did not have much to do with this one, I only skimmed it. It's been a while since I read a book. The last book that I picked up was The Girl in the Fireplace. It is not the same kind of book. I like the character of Mrs. S and the story is good. But this one is so much better. The story is set in an English school. There is a new principal who teaches the children a lot of English and that is why she is very interested in her pupils. But when the students are all busy with their own studies the teachers are left to teach as they see fit and sometimes have to be quite cruel to get the best from them. I liked this one a lot more. The book is divided into 3 sections: A, B, C. In A, the school is under new management but the students, despite a new name and new buildings, are still poor and the class is still very hard to make friends with. It turns out that the school was once known as a school for children who were neglected by their families, but now they are the only ones who can afford to go. But the teachers have some difficulty because the students want to become professors but can not get a degree. B has the students in their new uniforms. The principal takes it for granted that all the students will be as good as each other, even though one student, Miss L, gets so nervous about her new uniform that she is a very difficult pupil. C has a lot to say about the new teacher, Mrs. J. It seems to be a good teacher, but she is so bossy that she won't allow the students to have a good time. She likes to be on top of the class so that they will be her favorites.
Write a positive review about a good book:    - - - You have made a great read! - - In this case the author wrote a novel which I could get into. It does not contain the "magic" to have made me get a laugh out of the story. - - The story is a good story but I had to keep reminding myself the story was set in the future and is a science-fiction. The whole story is set in a future where the humans are dying and it is up to a female cyborg to save the human race from the virus. It is a story which takes the time to explain the world, the technology, and the characters. Overall a good read but maybe one for you if you are interested in the science fiction of the 80's with an alien female cyberex.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am in love with this book. It's great!   It is not very long but the author wrote the first one very well and it's a very well written book as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book in exchange for an honest review. I really like the premise and the book is well written.   The characters and setting is very well done and I like the characters.  My favorite character is a bit slow to act but he will be very important later on.  This is the third in a series so I am looking forward to seeing what will happen in the next book.  I do believe that the setting and characters are a little weak in this first book, I feel that a lot of the action is in the third book. The third book should be called The Fourth Book because I think it will be even more epic.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the very few book I could recommend to my friends who are still in the dark. I'm still a little confused as to how this story went from concept to being published but this is a great start for new readers. A very easy read, it takes just a few minutes to get through the whole book and is really rewarding once you do. My only complaint is the fact that the book was so long but I'm sure you get a good dose of the story here.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character and the antagonist were both very likable. I liked the way they interacted with each other.   I liked how the characters all had very different views on the world.  I really liked how each chapter is really a short story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is short but contains everything you would need to know about playing the violin or ukulele: from what the best players think about each other to the different types of stringed instruments and how to set up an instrument, to how to choose the best strings for the instrument, and many other details, and is definitely a book you'll want to keep on your shelf.   I'm in the process of rereading the book to check on my understanding of the book.  I am a beginner and this book will give me everything I need to get started and keep me going for a long time!   - Janine
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It is a lot of fun and I enjoyed the story. I like the way the story was told and I also liked that the narrator was in the same role as the main character - she is the one who had to take the test. I will definitely read the sequel. I would also like to mention that the cover is a great idea!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. It is short and doesn't go into a lot of depth but provides a lot that will interest and entertain people. The ending is a little bit confusing and may take a few reads to get it, but the main thrust of the story is good. I wish this book was longer and had more action.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read about the time I spent in the trenches during the first World War. I found it hard to put down and had a great time reading.   I have a great feeling that if you have ever been involved in a military conflict and your unit has been involved on a war front, you'll appreciate the story. I liked it a lot. I found the war story very interesting. There are a lot of things that are true that the people of the world don't know and the details, however hard-knwon, are important. The author's writing style is very well done and you're left feeling very satisfied when you finish the book. There were times when I could tell that the book was not going to be as long as it was. I would have liked to have seen more about the British and the German forces, especially the fact that the German unit is not as much of a military monster as it is portrayed as being. It seems that some of the German soldiers did some very bad things.  The book ended very nicely. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like to read about the lives of people in difficult circumstances, people who do difficult things.  When I found out about this book, I decided I had to read it.   But this is not a normal book - it is about a "bad" man and his wife, and about how a "good" woman handles a bad man.  One other thing - what is with the author's use of the word "bad"?  I understand that he's trying to put a positive spin on his own personal situation, but that isn't the same thing as calling a person a bad person.  I also think that I get a more positive message out of reading his book if he called his wife a good person. What I learned:    That not every person who goes through difficult circumstances will be able to handle a bad situation, and that a good woman will be better suited for a good man.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I'm giving it 5 stars for the style of writing, for the content, for what it can teach us about life and about God, but also for its practical application.   This book is full of truth.    When I first discovered a book called "What to Expect When No One is Expecting" I thought that it was the work of a very young man or a very old man who is no longer quite right in the head.  The "How To" book, which can be downloaded from Amazon, shows a man with some very serious mental problems.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be the work (nor my guess is it) of the same author or the same writer.  I think the title of this book is a little misleading, as "What To Expect" is not a series, but rather a compilation of many such books.  As someone who has read a large number of religious books, I have learned that there is no such thing as a perfect book.  And yet, this one is a must read for those who like to learn about Christianity.  Some of the questions that have been raised by this book were: 1) When a person makes a decision (e.g., for Christ) in which all the factors involved are unknown, why is that person entitled to claim a reward for his or her actions?     2) When you look at things from the standpoint of God's viewpoint (a person's), who should determine what God's interests are and what God ought to do? 
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is a very entertaining read.   I enjoyed it as I have been reading about these groups of people in America since the 1940's.  I can see how this book might be difficult for some to understand as there are a lot of different cultures involved in each group.  There are some very well put-together stories and I am not sure who the authors are but the people involved in this story seem to be people from the South who have found a way to make their way into the modern world.  The characters were all unique and very real as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book as a gift, and I loved it!   The characters are well developed and they have a lot of fun and adventure.   It was an interesting book to read and I enjoyed it immensely.  I was not as into this book, but I would still recommend this book to anyone who loves a good adventure and likes fantasy/SF. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     This is the first book in the original series that I have read, and it does a great job of bringing the characters to life. As someone who didn't read fantasy books as a child, it's very exciting to read this one, because the world is so fantastic. Even though the setting is a far away place, you can almost taste the piney scent of the woods, as if you were there. I particularly like the way the character interactions come off. As a fan of the Dragonlance series, I really like the fact that the characters and their interactions are a lot more detailed than what is shown in the TV series. The books are long though, so don't read this if you aren't looking for a full sized tome.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because it has a lot of the "how-to" advice I'm looking for on how to make things better in my own life. I'd been doing a lot worse than I am now with the books I read. My wife has been giving me some solid tips on making her life easier and so has a couple of my friends. If you're looking for some tips on how your life can improve, this is one book worth your time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book with a few friends, some of whom I had met at some events of the previous year.   We met up in Chicago after reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.   After a few drinks we took a taxi to the bookstore.    When we got there I looked at my friend (who was just a bit ahead of us) and said:  " I'm not reading this book anymore "   The girl with the dragon tattoo didn't know about The Girl With The Dragon TattOO but she seemed happy to learn about this new genre.  She is now my favorite fantasy heroine.  The main problem with the book is the narrator.  This narrator is not in character, but rather, in the middle of a story.  He doesn't sound like a character either, and he is more like a narrator for a story than a character in a story, in my opinion.  My only other complaint is that there is a lot of sex in the book, and I didn't find it to be a problem.  I just wanted to say:  The Girl Who Was Raised by Wolves is not for everyone.  It does have its fans and I've read the second book but it is definitely a book you have to take to read carefully.  " In the beginning of the second millennium, the land of Golarion is plagued by a scourge, a disease that devours the souls of children. No cure has been found, and many have fallen into a state of despair as they are consumed by the disease. Those who survive the ravages of the curse are known as vampires.  "  This is not my favorite novel, and my least favorite character is Gennar, the main character, for whom I think there are a few other characters, but they do not add to the story. In my opinion the book has a few problems. I really didn't like that it took so long to get to the good part and the main problem is that the second part is not a complete story. The story was good, but I felt that the beginning and the end are two separate books.  A lot of the characters are just a few pages, and there is too much sex, so this book will be for the people who like to read that kind of thing, and the more adult people. I think I'm going to give it three stars because of this rating but the author says that it is
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a lot of good info in this book. The author explains the various types of plants and how to care for them. He then covers some basic care for your plants and the diseases they can get. There are not that many pictures to help explain. I got this book for my little girl who is about the age I am. She loves plants. The pictures were easy to understand and they were all great for young kids. There were not a lot in it for people older than 4 or 5. But, I still gave it five stars because it explained why plants get diseases. She now knows that she shouldn't have her spinach when she has her lettuce or her carrots when she just bought some parsley.  My two little ones, ages 2 and 4, loved this book! Thank you!

So, I grew my plants in pots and then put them in a shady spot. They have thrived! They were planted about 4 inches apart and have been going well. The plant likes water well. It is very, very thirsty, so it can't get very much. So when it's not getting enough water, the leaves just wilt, or die. It's really sad, but that's just a by-product of the way the plant is wired. It likes to take a good soak in the rain, but not so much that the roots don't grow. I just water the plant just enough to keep it from dying. The leaves look a little fuzzy around the edges, but they are still nice and green. I've read a few of the other reviews about the color of the leaves (a few seem to think they are dark green, but maybe it's just the soil), and they're not really any darker, but it's a nice soft green.

Write a positive review about a good book:        I had high hopes for this book, which was one of my favorite books from the first half of this year.    I really liked the premise.   What if there were a kind of force that, when you try to force it to do what you want, forces you to look at things from new perspectives?   The concept was compelling and the execution was superb.  Rating:  4/5    I have always had a fascination with the concept of the "hidden life" and have read many books on it.  I was hoping that the book would include a bit more detail about this idea.  For one, I feel it is difficult to really comprehend what "the hidden life" really is and how it differs from the mundane everyday life.  While the book gives examples of various "secret societies," it seems like such a small part of the world that these societies have.  Additionally, the concept feels somewhat like a throwaway at times.  The author says at one point that it was really just a "social experiment" or a "thought experiment."  It's a lot of fun to read, but the details in it are somewhat lacking and would have made it much more compelling. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is a good one. The author's goal in writing this was to make a good game out of a good movie. I am definitely glad that the movie actually had some real potential to be a good sequel. I'm not sure it will have any chance to be anything else than a good adaptation if the game isn't any good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When the story is done you are left with a good, thought-provoking read and you want to continue the story.   The author does a good job in keeping the world, characters and actions fresh.  Also, there is an interesting mystery about a boy and his friend who were both murdered in the same place by a group of unknown assassins.  The ending is great and gives hope for the future of the world.  I will have to pick this up in the near future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly to a friend. I enjoyed a lot about it, the characters, and the story. It wasn't exactly a love story (well, that wasn't the plot) but it was interesting. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the protagonist was not just a pretty girl who loved to read and make art but actually a writer herself. The book took me to a small town in Minnesota, and I liked that, since I live in a small city, I can explore this part of the country more. Also, the narration was a pleasure and the way she described the weather and the landscape of the town was perfect.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after a long period of boredom. I have been reading a number of stories lately that are basically the same, but in a different way. This is a great book with real character development and a fantastic plot line. I don't read that much science fiction, but I'm glad I got to read this one. I also recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading about the future, but is also interested in a good science fiction story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is a good primer on how to write a book, one that even students who don't have their A's in English literature can follow." -Aldo Smith, University of South Carolina. This book is good if you are just starting out. It is good for people who are looking to become more sophisticated writers. But I think it is best read if you already have some experience with the literary craft of fiction. As far as writing fiction goes, this book has more to teach you than what you can expect from a college textbook. The book is very practical for writing a well-written novel, and includes more than a few suggestions for different types of characters and settings that will appeal to readers. My main criticism is that the first two-thirds of the book is almost purely dialog with a lot of repetition and lots of little details that are really annoying and annoying to read over and over. By the third or fourth chapter, I realized that all the dialog is very repetitive. At first, I thought it was intentional; it just seems so tedious. But then I realized it's like listening to a bunch of people talk about a movie while waiting for someone to make a decision on a movie. The only way I could make the book more interesting and engaging is if the narrator would make it all sound like his own opinion, which, to be fair, he doesn't. But that's too bad, because in many cases the reader can hear him thinking about his own feelings, and the book becomes more interesting. Still, I was able to find enough to enjoy reading his opinion and observations, even though I still have a lot to learn.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My second book by this author was very good. It was a very good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is just a good read.   It's like one of the great adventure books. You never know what you're going to get.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book off amazon just a few months ago and I think it is an excellent book. I have only read the first chapter so far and am going to read the rest when I have more time. I would say the writing is quite good. The characters are quite relatable and are likeable, not unlike the protagonist in the first book. The plot does not rely too much on supernatural elements, which is nice, and is much more grounded than the first one. The book is not very long so it will not take long to read. However, the plot and character development is excellent, it will be nice to see how it will play out next book in the series. The only negative I have is that it does feel that it is a bit too long. Other than that, it was a good read. I recommend it for everyone to read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I am going to give this book 4 stars but I have to give it 1.5. I was able to read the book in one sitting but I couldn't read it in one morning. I just didn't feel like putting it down. This book was very helpful and is not only very informative but it's written very clearly and was well presented and I believe the book would be helpful to many people. It's definitely for someone who is trying to improve their own writing and I highly recommend it. I will definitely be purchasing more books from this author in the future. I enjoyed the book as a learning experience and I was hooked for the rest of the day."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read quite a few books by Richard Dawkins over the years. They have mostly been about evolution and/or the theory of intelligent design. But this book was different. This was not just a critique, this was a detailed analysis of the theory that I hadn't considered.   A lot of the criticism of the book focuses on the lack of an explanation of what an evolved mind is like. The book is not about that, but the idea that the reason why there are no examples of what the mind looks like today is that we don't have evolved a mind that looks like ours.  I didn't like the idea of a'mind that looks just like ours' at all.  This is not just about evolution though. The idea of consciousness is also not discussed as it is not even mentioned in the book. I found it very strange and off-putting that in the same book that you have a chapter on consciousness and you don't even mention it. It is only discussed in one footnote in the end of the chapter.  As for the brain, the theory is flawed.  In the chapter on the problem of consciousness, he makes many more claims, many that are not mentioned by the theory.  He claims that the 'brains' don't produce information. He claims the information is stored in the memories. He even claims that we cannot communicate to other brains and our brains are just the storage locations.  It is also mentioned in another book (The Selfish Gene) that the idea is based on the fact that we have cells with a different structure that are responsible for different things.  Not discussed is that the information stored in these cells (called chromatin) was found to be similar in the brains of monkeys and non-human animals. There is more that could be said about the book, I found the chapters on consciousness to be interesting and important, but these are just a few of the most important points that I found very wrong with the theory, and not mentioned in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book. The pacing is quite good, it's a short read but really interesting, the dialogue is very good, the characters are really interesting and likeable, the worldbuilding is rich and the story is quite complex, as the characters move from the village to the city, from the countryside to the capital, and the battles and wars are very well explained, and even the magic is explained with a very thorough and detailed explanation. The only problem I had with this book is that the author tries to explain everything in such a detailed and thorough way that the readers have to read all the things she writes in order to understand it. However, if the reader is not able to understand everything that is written about him or herself, then I think this will be an unsatisfying book. That's why I think you have to understand the world building, read some of the history, some of what the people are like, try to find out the story from what is written, and if this is not enough then try to think a bit more about it, and read some more to see if this will become clearer. The best advice I can give to you is just read. If it is not good then just forget it. Good luck to you.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished the first of several in my series about the creation of the human race. If you enjoy science fiction, or history, or just have a fascination with this amazing subject and the people who have been involved in it, you should definitely give this book a try.   It's full of great, interesting details about the past, and the future, and is well paced.   If you are looking for a well written, readable historical account about the development of the first modern humans in the first part of the last 10,000 years, then this is a book for you.  I was really impressed. I found myself having a lot of fun thinking about the history of mankind. It was well done, but not over-the-top. The plot is straightforward, and I don't know why it isn't more popular with historians, but the story just seems so much more fun. It seems like a perfect book to give to the kids who love history, and who might like a little sci-fi thrown in.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book in an antique shop. It was so strange how it got here, that I had to read it several times, because there's so many weird things. The main character, the boy, is the only one who has a chance of getting it all together. The little girls are pretty boring. The best part is when he decides to go back to town and try to convince everyone that the monster isn't real. The only problem I had with this book was the fact that some pages seem like a bad version of "The Monster at the End of This Book". I wouldn't mind reading this one a second time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a good deal of respect for James's style. He's obviously an accomplished writer, and he writes his way through the experience rather than the way most would (I am not suggesting this to be a criticism, I am merely pointing out that he might have done it this way rather than this way if he were a professional, or if he had his heart in the right place. I am only slightly joking here).   But my main problem with the book is that I felt it needed to be very, very, much shorter.   There was a very long section in the middle that I enjoyed, but it really felt like the author was not doing her research at all. I think that the book might have been better if it were edited down.  If the book had been shortened by a few pages, perhaps that wouldn't have been an issue, but at 778 pages, it really needed a lot shorter. It felt like reading one book after another. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read about 10 or more books by these authors, and this one is the best so far. I've been following the story for a long time, and it was interesting to see them go from their past to their present, the struggles and happiness and how things change over the years. The story was told with humour and a lot of heart, and I loved how the author wrote about a lot more than just her book - she talks about her family, her school days, etc.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't believe how much I've enjoyed this book.   At its best,   it is a great combination of historical fiction and horror, with some fantastic ideas about   "a time of great upheaval and danger" -- with some interesting characters.  While there are plenty of horror elements (mostly the creepy things that go bump in the night in the countryside) and plenty of fun action sequences (with a great little race across a mountain),   the overall effect is so much more.  The writing is strong, the world-building is solid, and the action sequences are solid.  A lot of people I know are going to have to get their heads around this book -- it really is a well-written, fast-paced read.  And I'm not just saying that because I enjoyed it, but because of my excitement at the prospect of reading more.

Write a positive review about a good book:    (I have just read this one and liked it )   I am having the time of my life and can't wait for the second book to come out. I'm now over 50 and I find the stories of those who were younger still resonate.  Review by KJ on April 15, 2014 :  This book was the inspiration for my first novel! I had heard so many good things about it, and wanted to read it right away, but the deadline was over, and so I waited. A few months later, I heard of a paperback, and I picked up a copy.   This time, I didn't waste any time! The first two chapters are about me, my father, and my father's father. They show that these two characters, when they were younger, suffered in a small town when the people who raised them turned out to be not what they thought they were.  , but that was a very close sequel, and the plot thickens as I read about the people and events in the story that I am familiar with. But I'll tell you right now, that the story and characters are not the only things I enjoyed.I'll start my review with the review from the Goodreads page:   I loved this book, and read it in one day. My only criticism is that I wish there was more of the story before I reached the first book of this series. This is the first one, but if I had known, I would have read the other books in this series sooner. (I'm a bit of a picky reader, so I want to read the entire series.) I will not stop reading these books, as they are all fantastic.    (This review was originally posted on the website of the author)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was searching for a good reference on my last field trip to New Orleans, where I live, and came across this book. I will certainly have it on my shelf.   " This book has a wonderful collection of references on New Orleans and the French Quarter. Although there are numerous New Orleans monuments on the site map, not one of them is in the French quarter. A good book to have on hand!" -- David L. S.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read, and one that I enjoyed. There are a lot of people on this planet that are going to take it for what it is. A story about a boy, a boy with a bad reputation, and his family. There is a fair amount of angst, but I didn't find that to be a bad thing. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. It was a good story, and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to know something more about what happens when a boy tries to live his life without any help from the adults in his life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   . I found this to be a very good book that can be used for many courses. In fact, I have used the entire set of "Teaching About Death" in several classes this semester!   I was surprised that this is a college level course, however, it is not difficult.   "Dealing with Death" is a good set of lectures that explains how death can affect you psychologically and physically.  The first lecture, titled "What Does It Feel Like to be Dying?" gives a very simple description of what it feels like to die and what you will feel after you die.  After this lecture you will hear an overview of death and the basic stages of death as well as a discussion of the five stages of grief.  In the second lecture, entitled "The Importance of Self-care when Death is Near," you will learn about things you should and shouldn't do after a death, as well the importance of having a sense of self in death.  This course is a great way to prepare students for the college level, as many of the concepts covered will apply to the graduate school level.  For a course that costs under $20, I cannot find a better set of material for a student to use in their college course.   "Dealing With Death" Video Review:  When I first watched "Dancing with Death," I thought that it would not be a good video for the purpose of preparing students for death. I was not wrong. After watching "D Dancing with Death " I realize that this course will be very helpful to all college and graduate level students. As long as you do not try to do too much, there will not be any problems with your video. This course will get you prepared for the death of a loved one and it will help you to deal with all that comes after. This is the best course on dealing with death I have found. I have been looking for a good course on this subject for a long time.  - Debby W.  Video Review of Dancing with Decease: "Dying with Grace and Love"  When first seeing "D Dying with Grace & Love," I was completely confused. I had a hard time believing that this would be a death video. But, after seeing it, I feel like I found the best resource for a course on dying. The best thing about this video is that it is an overview. The videos start with a
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most engaging book I have read in a long time.   As it does so much for me, I am inclined to expect it will do the same for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of fantasy novels. In the past couple of years, I've read many of them and was really impressed with the quality. I decided to start with the series "The Way of Kings" by Robert Jordan and was thoroughly pleased with it. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy and/or science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I loved it. It was a quick read but also a deep one, one that gave me a good laugh along the way and a great idea that I've been thinking about for a while now. It's a great story and the illustrations have a timeless quality that I love." - L.A.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book at a local thrift store a couple of years ago, and I remember loving it! I didn't like it when it came out a few years later because the humor and the writing got lost a bit when the author tried to put the characters through the wringer of trying to be funny, or when the humor got lost when the characters took themselves so seriously. But as long as the characters are happy and they have each other, I think this is one of the best books in the entire series!  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's easy to get confused and get lost in this world of a million names, all of which can mean so many different things and all of whose history is largely unknown to us...   It was like the novel's version of some very bad movie where the names of the different characters are very confusing and have nothing to do with one another. I know there's an "alternative" ending but it's kind of sad because it seems so very uninspired. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and the author. The book is short, fun and entertaining. This book will appeal to many.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is full of interesting and well-documented observations about the history of sex education in America. If you want to learn more about sex and your own sexual history then this book is a great place to start. Highly recommended"  - Dr. Julie Burchill
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent and well written book that is relevant to the current debate on the future of the NHS.   The book includes a section on "NHS Reform", which is written by Simon Stevens and Stephen Crabb (both former senior civil servants) and is a good introduction to the topics discussed in the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book and it was a fantastic read and a good introduction to the history of a great nation. It's worth buying if you like the history, but not if you're looking for some action or drama.   " The first is the great historian who will show you the truth of what the American Revolution was all about:  "The first is who will tell you the great history of the American revolution and the principles upon which it was founded. He will show how our Declaration of Independence was founded upon a philosophy of freedom and democracy, the same that has found expression in the teachings of all great civilizations, the most advanced and civilized of all, and how this philosophy was the basis of the Constitution. He'll show how the American system of government is founded upon the same principles, and he'll give you the reasons why this was done. He shall explain the causes which led to the War of Independence and the ultimate cause of our independence from Great Britain. It will be illustrated with examples from the annals of history, so that you will understand exactly the principles and the great causes that have led to our independence. "
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't normally read YA fantasy, but this was a fun read. I love the characters, and I love that there are two of them at the same time in the story. I like how different they are (the teenage boy, and the adult woman). The romance is really enjoyable, too.     I really liked how the author introduced the characters through the letters and interactions they had. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is about the importance of doing things as an adult, not as a kid.   A lot of things you may read in a young adult book are actually just very good advice and things you should try yourself, because they are good advice.  The reason why they are a good advice is because as adults we are more careful with our thoughts and actions (in all kinds of things).   This is also because of our age.  A very young adult would think that if a person were to say that they were going to kill someone they could not get away with it.  If you look at a 17 year old you would probably think that was pretty dumb, so it seems a great idea to a lot of people that a person is 17.  Some very good parts of this book: The first thing that really caught my attention about this book is that the author is a writer for a TV show called "Masters of the Universe".   It's great that the book is really about the people who do the things that they do, but even more awesome is that it's an adults only book.  For some reason, I thought that a lot this book was aimed at children, but I guess that is my own problem. Some bad things that I found in this book were:  The main character who is in prison.  This book is set in a prison so I would have liked more information about how they got in prison and why.  Also, I think this book could have done without the "the only thing that matters is what you do now".  Also, I can't wait for the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was intrigued by this book and was glad that it exists in print, at least in a digital form. There are many different ways to approach the topic of children's rights, and as a parent of young children, I appreciate that the author presents a balanced and informative perspective that I agree with. The book is full of fascinating and helpful information, and I'm glad I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a great book for a group that I took and I enjoyed them.   I had trouble putting them together, and it took a few sessions for them to connect the dots.  But the characters really came alive, especially the little people and the big people.  And it's fun! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read "An Outpost of Progress" by J. A. M. Barrie, and I really enjoyed it!   J.A.M. Barlowe is the narrator for this book, so he speaks the words and you feel his emotion, and the book does well to illustrate his character, with his troubles in the past and struggles with the present.   "An outpost of progress" takes place in the same fictional landscape as the earlier book, and there are some pretty familiar names there.  Unfortunately, I did find a few spelling errors, and a couple of the characters in the book have some pretty odd names.  I will definitely be buying the next two books, this one being the only one that I did not like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A terrific book for children of all ages, who love history.   If only all history books were this well written   - A nice book to look at, with lots of pictures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a fantastic book that will keep you company for hours. The book's setting is really intriguing and unique, and the characters are extremely well-written. I really do like the character of Darrow, and his struggle to do right by his family. I highly recommend this book. What other book might you compare Darrow to and why?   Darrow is a great example of how fantasy can be so much more than fantasy when you have a good author and a good story. His writing style is just pure fantasy to me and it is great. He has a great cast of characters, and all of them are well-developed and have great backstories. I'd also say that his writing style would be good for children. If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?  The best of the best. Any additional comments?  This book is a must-read! The characters are well written and the setting is beautiful. The story is not complicated, but it's very interesting and well-paced. I especially liked Darrow's struggle to protect the people around him. You should definitely check this one out! (hide spoiler) [Haven't read it yet but will be doing so soon] I am very disappointed that there were no other reviewers that didn't give it 5 stars, but I think the book deserves every single star. It is one of my absolute favorite books of all time, and it's also one of the few books that I can recommend to my kids. I also enjoyed the way that it presented children's books in a world with magic and dragons, and I liked that the ending wasn't really happy. The characters were unique, well-defined and interesting. The world was magical, and that's really the main point of this particular story. Darrow takes the reader on a journey from youth to adulthood, and he does a wonderful job at that. The setting of the book is magical, with a lot of castles and a lot more dragons than you would expect from the description. I found myself longing for Darrows adventures in the world of the characters and loved the writing style of this author. I loved the way he portrayed the different cultures, the nobility, the peasants, the mages, and also the way the book presented the different magic systems and their uses. The art is beautiful as well. It was definitely well worth my time and money, and this is definitely one
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to admit I was really nervous about this book, it's a science fiction book with some dark themes and very strong and disturbing scenes. However, after reading through the book, I really enjoyed it, and it definitely made me think about the way I see our current society, and how this could be seen as one of its flaws. I think it's one of the best science fiction books I've read in quite a while. I think it also makes me see our society as being divided into the wealthy and powerful, the rich who have power, and the poor, who are powerless and don't have any.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good and entertaining, yet at the same time has a deep message about being happy and being in the present.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Like the rest of the series, this one really is good.   It tells a story about the early days of a world's first democracy.  It's a pretty cool story and one that I hope will become popular.  As mentioned, the book is short, but the story is well told.  Overall, I give the book 4/5.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book has a lot of great information in it and gives an interesting look at the different levels of leadership in the Church.   It would be helpful to have more specific information on the positions in each of these levels so I have a better grasp on them as an officer in the church.  The books also does a good job of telling about the historical development of the positions of Elder and high councilor.  It has also been a great resource to me as I'm learning more about the history of the Church, and the position of bishop.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book very much. The plot was interesting and well written and it was easy to follow. The characters were all interesting and likable, and the ending was just what I wanted.   The only drawback was that the book is long. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     "What's that? You didn't like the book? Well, I've just got to get this off my chest..."   The last couple of years I've been reading a lot of books on modern and contemporary topics, and this book stood out for me because of its subject and its writing style. It seems like a really nice overview of what's going on with the music scene right now, with a great mix of opinions and facts and figures, and with a lot to say on the state of the music business in general. There's a lot here that isn't generally known or understood - there's a great example of the importance of a label to the success of a artist, for instance - but it also seems to be an honest view from someone who does get a chance to talk to the key people in the industry.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book. It's such a well written book, it's so funny and it's well-paced and it keeps you invested in what's going on, so many laughs in this book, I love it! It's also very thought provoking, and I don't even like science, but it's such an engaging read.   The only things I don;t really like about this book is that I don';t think that the "gastrointestinal tract" and other digestive systems really work like we think they do, and that the end of the book is a bit of a mess. But this book would be perfect for a college class, or just for people that want a good laugh, and if you love science, this is a great book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I said, this book is not for the faint of heart. It's very dark, very violent, and a bit difficult to read at times. It has been a while since I read a dark fantasy that I enjoyed. This one isn't my favorite but if you are looking for a darker, more brutal read, you could do a lot worse than The Night Angel Chronicles  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's about a guy, and he loves his dog and all the other people, but he hates women (at least in a romantic way). When he gets out of prison, he thinks he finds his place in the world as a straight man.   The woman he loves, but can never have, is the one who can do all of the work, even if she's not the best.  " You'll never know if you don't do your part."   A good book to listen to if you are getting a divorce.  In the early part of the story the author tells us the author's mother was the perfect mother and that her father's absence as a child caused her to feel like a failure. This is the perfect story about a young woman finding a love she didn't expect and the consequences it has on her life and relationships.  What makes this a classic is the way the book presents the problems and feelings of one individual without trying to tell a story about everyone in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book.   I was a little wary when I first started reading this.  It was written by a professional researcher so there were some things I was skeptical of.  But I found them to be well researched and presented, including the research for the chapters.  I am hoping I can use this knowledge to make my own research more reliable.  And I am really glad I chose this book. I am also glad I read the other reviews on this book to see what others thought. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of the series since it came out and this book is not only very well written but has some great characters as well. This book is the kind of book that will keep you going through the end of a long book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most amazing thing I've ever read. It's just so fucking good. The concept, the idea, the plot and the characters are so rich and intriguing, you feel like a total loser and the whole thing just oozes with meaning and character development. -Laura -   It's been six years since my father died of a heart attack, so a bit late to get back into reading, but I have to say this one I got back to after being away. I feel so blessed to have a brother like this to take me away from things that I couldn't cope with or that I wasn't able to relate to. -Shaun H   An absolutely fantastic read! As I've come to understand it, this book has been described as the second coming of The Bible, the other being the Book of Mormon. It's one of those rare books that you can't put down and doesn't stop telling you a story after you finish it. It was a real struggle reading the original version and now I feel I can understand it as well as the other. I love it. Thank you so much to everyone who gave it a 5 star review and to those that are waiting for the second edition. I would love to hear if there will be a second edition, or how long until it is out. I will definitely be reading this for a long time to come. -Joel T
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a few chapters, but had no problems with the book's structure, and very good story, though I don't know if I was really interested in learning about her past or just want to learn more about the characters. If there is one thing I would change, it is how she presents the characters (their motives) - for the most part she makes them look like complete idiots, but I suppose it's understandable since they've been brainwashed by the Cult (if that's even a thing)   In the end, the book is not as good as some others I've read but it's good and interesting (especially when she mentions that "I still don't fully get how she managed to survive"). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I started reading this book, I had no idea what to expect. The first few pages were interesting, but not much else. Then I realized this was going to be a very slow burn.   This book has so much to offer that I couldn't stop reading.  I can't recommend this book enough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are believable and well developed. The plot is also nicely done and interesting. The best part is that it is a children's book and we got to meet a couple of the main characters at the end.   The characters are realistic and well done. The story was not too bad, but the ending was too rushed, which made the story too short. The children's story is good and is very imaginative.  Overall, I would recommend this book for kids and parents of kids.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this was a pretty good read, and that's saying a lot considering how much I loathe modern YA fiction. I didn't enjoy the writing, as I found the plot to be a bit of a mess. I liked the characters, but they didn't feel very real to me. I'll admit it didn't completely suck me in, but I never could get into it, and it ended up feeling like I just wanted to leave before the last page was read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am surprised and delighted to say that this book really is a masterpiece and is a must-have for any and all writers. It is written in a lucid style and is very practical to anyone who has the slightest inkling of a writing problem. The author explains the rules of writing clearly enough for beginners to succeed, but also in a way that the more experienced writer will appreciate, too. The story line is interesting and the characters have personality, which in my opinion are often lacking in fantasy stories. I loved this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book about a year ago, and I read it the day it came out in the library. I loved it.

I hope more people read this wonderful story about a little girl who doesn't like her birthday present, and she gets to enjoy all of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The story, characters, and development of the main character was a little confusing at first, but I got used to it in a few reads. The prose was good for the most part, although it sometimes needed a little tweaking as the author used too much jargon, which I understand in many ways, but at the same time it was hard for me to keep straight, I have an ESL teacher who was supposed to review this book, but didn't, as she said it is hard to comprehend it in her    class.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I can really say is that I enjoyed reading the book. I loved it. The story is pretty cool and the author wrote the main characters well. I would definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! It was not something that I was expecting, so to be able to read it was great.   The storyline of this book is very unique and interesting to me. It was also different from what I normally read. This was my first time reading an original story and it was a very enjoyable read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I read the description for this book it sounded like a very unique idea:  "The world's greatest hero is a woman."   If that's the case, I'll keep reading... But I'm still a little hesitant.   My wife and I took this book to our local bookstore. The bookstore itself wasn't all that great, so we opted to have a sit-down dinner nearby. After we got home I looked up a review that was a few paragraphs below mine, and the reviewer had a much harsher tone than I had: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are a lot of books out there about the "American Revolution," but this is by far the best one I have read. I am in the middle of studying the book for my honors thesis, and have to have it to read and get caught up on.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great read for those who have been wanting to study theology or biblical theology but don't feel they have any depth or expertise, or who have heard good things but are intimidated by theology and would like to become experts.   The author does a great job of explaining theological concepts in a way that is accessible to even non-believers.   This is an excellent book.  Very well written.    I've been interested in theology for years and this book was the first book that really got me interested in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. It was a very interesting read about a different time in the history of the world. I would definitely recommend this book to any Sci-Fi fan.
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The prose is simply marvelous. There are so many examples in this book about how we as humans can become better people, if only we would get our priorities straight. This book isn't just about the book itself, but about the message of getting our priorities right. We all get caught up in other things to the point where we forget what is most important in our lives, and what we should be most concerned about. I would have to say that my life is completely better because I took a lot more time to consider what was important in my life before making major decisions. I also remember what it was like to be a little boy who was struggling in school. The message of The Art of Happiness has a lot to say about that time in our childhood. The Art also tells you how to create a happy life for yourself. It also has a bunch of examples of great people who have made great discoveries and found true happiness by focusing on what is truly important to them. I read this book a while back, and have since re-read it with my children for their birthday. It's one of those books that I'm glad I read all the way through, and is definitely something that I would recommend.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   There's really no other book like this one:  - A short, well written and compelling mystery with a dark twist.  - The story is fast paced and exciting, even though I didn't have the patience to put it down to read it on my own.   - I thought the characters were the best part of the book, and there's so much more to learn about them.  The book is very well written:  I love the tone of the writing.  I really enjoyed reading it.  In spite of its short length, it will give a lot of enjoyment to those who enjoy mysteries.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very pleased with this book. I have read the book twice now, and have enjoyed the process of finding my own way to the end. In this second reading, I came across a minor quibble that the author did not consider. For example, there are two places in the book where the author quotes the first-person plural "I" to refer to his or her own mind. When he does this, one is able to see how it might be a deliberate "faux pas" if used, say, in the sentence "I see him walking". In this instance, as in many others, this would be an unforced error. But instead, he seems to be making a serious error when he uses a first-personal singular (or any plural) for his own self. This is a great example of how the author can bring out the subtleties of the language, and show how the conventions of a particular culture might subtly differ from one to the next. I hope this is the case for the rest of the book, which I am looking forward to reading. Read more...

Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character is so likable that I found myself rooting for him. There are a lot of interesting ideas and it is refreshing to read a book in which science is not only done properly, but is a fundamental aspect of the plot. The author doesn't go too far with the science (a minor nitpick), but I do think that the use of space travel is a bit of an over-reach.  You might find this book at: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    1.5 Stars:  I read this book because I was looking for an update on a character I had come to love. The book follows the story of a young man who was born and raised in the country. He loves the countryside, the trees and is interested in learning about the world and history. However, he is not quite like everyone else. He is a "balding, bespectacled" man with a love for his family and an interest in history. I appreciated that he wasn't the only one who was interested in history and didn't think it was ridiculous that he was born in the same year as the first man to walk on the moon, but he was a little weird in that regard. I thought that it was nice that his family didn't know anything about his fascination with history, and was more concerned with the things he enjoys than anything he's done. He was also interested in the history of the American Civil War, and it was interesting that he came from a place where that war was fought, so that makes sense. 3 Stars: The book focuses on a lot of the problems of growing up in the US, but is so well written that I found myself actually excited to read it. This was my first experience with a family who had been out of the country for a long time and was being forced to return to the States. It was funny reading about how some people think their "sophisticated" and "intellectual" family will come back into their lives. I liked it when the father, who is a bit more laid back than most, tries to help his son, because he isn't really a great student and needs his help. The characters all have unique and very relatable traits, which I loved. The stories of them growing up and growing up to be adults was really moving.  4 Stars: This is a great book to read if you're a history buff or want to read a really good novel about American history. The writing is clear and easy to follow. I loved the characters, their love and support of one another and their struggles to come to terms with their past, even though they were not perfect or perfecting their lives in a way that made them happy. 5 Stars :   If you like books with strong female characters, read this. It is a book about what it was like growing up as a woman in the 1930's in America, and about how hard it
Write a positive review about a good book:    The way I like to read is that the book comes with a glossary at the beginning and you can follow the links with the dictionary definitions for every word.   My son and I just finished reading this book, and I am pleased to say that it is a good read. I thought it was going to be a hard read because of the "spiel" but he just liked the way the books were written and I found the book fun!   I have not read a good children's book for a long time because I have read the Goosebumps books and I thought they were a little dark but I have to say I enjoyed this one and think I may like it a little bit more.  The picture book was a nice touch.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to admit, as someone who has read many books about history, I was a little disappointed in the coverage of the Civil War. But then again, I thought, there is nothing quite as gratifying than a good bad book.   1.    The Best of All Possible World War II, by Norman Mailer  (1963)   This is a must read for anyone who has just finished reading this book. Mailer was a great war correspondent who covered the war from an early age, and he was a friend of many great war reporters, like Walter Duranty, Harry Enten and John Le Carre. 2.   Civil War, the U.S. and Southern States   by Paul     (2004)   For a general reader of books on the war, there isn't a better one than this one, even if I'm not quite ready to call it a masterpiece. 3.   The American Civil War by Edwin Black    (1993)   I'm so glad this book was written in 1993, because I could not put it down. It's probably the best book on the Civil war that I have read, even though it does take quite a bit of the story from two previous books (The Battle of Antietam and The Lost Cause). 4.  The Last of the Confederates by John Brown: The Man and His Battle by John O'Brien   This is an amazing book that looks at what happened to the black soldiers.  5.   My Affection For The Dead: The Story of the War Between the States   By John L. O'Sullivan   This book is a biography about John Brown and his wife and how they lived together for years after Brown's death.  I've never met John Brown, but from the description I get of his personality, I can see why he became so famous.  (In fact, after reading the book, I would have been more likely to kill a man with a shotgun than go through with a long term marriage.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I got this, I was expecting a dry book. It's not really that dry - a nice bit of humour here and there. I don't know that I would be able to get much out of it without some light-hearted humour. The humour is fairly well-crafted and the characters are well-developed. It isn't the best book on the list, but I wouldn't have minded having a few drinks at the end of it. I'm not sure I'd go out with it at night, but as a quick one-shot it's fine. It was certainly entertaining!

Write a positive review about a good book:    An enjoyable read that I can definitely see myself returning to.   I don't own any of the previous books by Alesha, but the story still impressed me and I'll definitely be reading them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The reason I didn't give this book a 5 is that the story was too convoluted for my eyes. This book just didn't have a hook for me. It's a book I wish I had bought before I read it, but I think the only person who really needs to read this book is the author. I'm not a fan of her writing style. She has a habit of doing too much with too little, so this doesn't help her work much. This is the main reason why I don't think this book will be a long-term favourite.
Write a positive review about a good book:        As a parent of a child with autism, I have read many books about autism, including The Autistic Self and Autistic Behavior by Peter & Kathleen Sargent (2001). This book, by contrast, is more about the autistic and how autism affects them.   The author does a great job of conveying the depth of what autism is like, and how it affects autistic people, families, friends, and society as a whole.  An interesting insight is to understand the different ways people with autism can function within a group. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't believe I didn't read this one sooner. This book is about a girl who is in a long term relationship with an abusive man. The relationship is not loving at all, the man is just controlling and the girl has to live with it. The story is funny and not at all a love story.   I am glad I picked this book up as I was looking forward to reading more about these stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a very informative book about the life and work of Albert Einstein. The author writes well and has a good flow, and this makes the book read well. The book is also very good about the work of Einstein and other notable scientists such as Albert Lindemann and Ernest Rutherford. There are many other great books about science available, but this is an excellent one.   I also like that this book makes it clear that Einstein was a very human being, that he had a lot of failures along the way (like many people, I guess), that he was a womanizer, and that he did not have a scientific mind.  This book is a great addition to the growing collection of Einstein-related books out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone who likes good writing in fantasy.   A young woman, Trelawney, lives in a house filled with books. A young man, Sam, is looking for a book to read. They wander around the house and find books by various authors that are never mentioned again. Some are lost forever, and some may be used again, but never mentioned. Some books that Trelawndey owns might be read by another, but she never finds out. Sam thinks it is interesting that Toldrawyn had never heard of this one before, but the books are on a shelf, and that is it. One thing that seems pretty obvious is that the books of the house are not all books written by men. There are two books written and published by men and one by a woman, but they never appear together in the library.      As the story progresses, the two find books at different times that Tregawndy owns. They both find the book by the young woman that Sam thought she had owned, but it is a book written by a man who never mentions it. They end up in a dead end and it is Sam that convinces Trelay to find it. But when she does, the book is a little more magical than Trelany thought. It is one of the rare books that was written with more care than the writer of the novel. Trelayne can't believe it when she opens it and discovers it is called the "Dance of the Hours". There is magic in it that doesn't look human. They make their way into a tavern where they have an altercation with a girl that has her own reasons to dislike Trelana. She tries to be friends with Trelani, but ends up feeling sorry for her, but is too afraid to go home and tell Trela. Instead she is taken away, and they end up alone. She decides that Trellay is a horrible person because she won't tell her what she found in the book, but Trelna disagrees and tells her that she must. Trellana finds the book in a manor house and realizes it has been written by someone she has never heard about. Tregay decides that she doesn't care who the author is, as long as it doesn't write another book about Trelina. After all, that is just the way things are. The two

This is another book that I would recommend to a fellow history buff.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My only complaint with this book is that it is not well written, and I think this is my only real critique. This is a good introduction to the theory of social relations and to some of the most basic and important questions concerning them. As usual with books on sociology, the text is filled with examples from everyday life. But the book really shines with its theoretical and practical suggestions for how to think about the everyday in these sorts of ways. (I think this makes it easier for us non-economists to understand the book). I'll conclude by reiterating a point I made in the introduction: if you are interested in sociology, you should read this book. It's short, but not a waste of time.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found The Girl Who Was Plugged in useful and entertaining. My son was able to sit through the movie and even had a good time at the end (he got a little weepy and I think he wanted to keep the money for his car). My husband, who is a physicist, liked the physics as well and thought the explanation of the laws of motion was interesting. As I have always wanted to read the book, I'm very pleased with the result, though I will try to keep my expectations low.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I thought this book was very good, and I hope they write a sequel, too! " - John M. I thought this story was well written and well illustrated. There were some nice images that really made the book come to life. The story was good and a great change of pace from the more realistic series. It was really enjoyable to read. I enjoyed reading about a child in a very rough world who was in need of a good friend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're like me, you might get frustrated and leave a bad review or two about a book that doesn't quite work for you. For you out there who really don't like a book, I have a few simple recommendations: Don't like the characters or story? Get the next book in the series. It's a good thing it's in the same universe. Don't know how to put that in other words: Don not read this book.  Recommendation: This is one of those books that takes an interesting idea and twists it into something completely different. I'm guessing the author does that to make readers think about what's real, as opposed to what's in their heads. I would have enjoyed this book more if the author had made the characters more believable, or more sympathetic. The main character is an arrogant and narcissistic narcissist. He's an asshole, with a bad temper, and is so full of himself that he's totally oblivious to the fact that his actions are harmful to others, especially the children. But, I still found it interesting to watch what the other characters were thinking and doing, especially after he became a father. If you have a child or children, I think you'll like this book, even if you're the only one to like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book! It has been a while since I have read one so I am glad to have a refresher. The only thing I dislike about this book is the length it takes to read. The writing style is not for everyone but if you are looking for a book about how to make a name for yourself or do a lot of cool stuff, this book will provide that. I think I could have gotten some of the information from a book that was longer but was less wordy. This book will definitely have you laughing a lot and keeping you guessing a little. It is a fun read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first thing I noticed was how well it tied into the rest of the series. The books all tie into one another and that is an advantage for a book about elves, as they all have one thing in common and that's being elf. The story begins with the main character being taken captive by elves. They then send him to find a magic ring for himself to use against their enemies. After finding the ring, the elf leader tells him to kill a few more elves to get the ring back. The next chapter begins with a few elves escaping to a ship. The last few chapters of the book tell the story of their return to the ship and getting on to a new journey to another land, which ends with the ship finding themselves on the beach with no way home.   I was interested in learning more about the world they live in and the elves, so I really enjoyed reading this one. I'm a huge fan of fantasy and elves so this book was really enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I started reading this book about six months ago. I am new to the world of writing but I enjoy fiction. As a result I picked this book up mainly because of the title. I liked the idea of what happened to the girl who had the ability to communicate with cats but didn't have any luck. I didn't want to read more about it but I found it interesting and very interesting. As I was reading I kept looking forward to when I would find out what was happening to her. I think the story was too short and I think I would have liked it a bit longer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. I have read a bunch of children's books in the past, and this one had me smiling the whole time. I didn't realize what a unique and fun concept this was until my daughter tried out it last night. It's like an interactive children's book... it's like a book she'd play in the car with her friends.   I'm also a mom, and I loved the little facts and trivia she included about the characters.  My daughter loved the characters!   The writing was a little cheesy at times (and there's that same sort of quality that I sometimes see in children's movies, especially ones that are supposed to be kid-friendly) but overall it was a pretty fun read.  I would absolutely recommend it to any parents or kids out there, especially if they have young ones.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book is The New Yorker's "The Death of Superman." It's a brilliant satire on the super hero genre in general, and it's a delight to read. The book begins with a little scene about a little kid in a Superman costume going on a crime spree, which of course, everyone laughs about. Then the kid is caught, but his "super powers" keep him going. A really solid story, and the only "super" book I've read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a child, I have always loved these books. They were always fun, creative and made me want to be a writer as well as draw. My favorite characters are the ones that get to the ending and live happily ever after.  What do you think of the narration? I love the narrator and was happy to get to read this book with her as my new companion. I love that there were some fun characters in the story.  The sound effect in this book was awesome. The opening words of the chapter were wonderful and the last words, "It's hard to say goodbye." were the perfect end of the story for me. I loved every page of this story and am looking forward to the next one that my gifter sent me. This was definitely a book that I will keep in my library. Thank you, I will be reading this one again and again.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It reminded me of the classics of science fiction in terms of the characters, their struggles and the overall plot and how it works.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to other women in any field who have a problem with being treated differently in a male dominated profession, and especially in a science. It really shows how a lot of women have a hard time believing that they will be hired over a man when they have the same qualifications.   The author addresses the issues of sexism head on.  SciFi: (SFF) Fantasy is a genre where the hero can be a man or a woman, but the woman in most cases will usually be the protagonist.    A good female hero in a fantasy story is sometimes called a woman of destiny.  When the heroine is a man, she is often referred to as a hero in disguise.  There are two types of heroines, those who are strong and those who can get a man to love them.  The heroines in fantasy stories are often the strong ones who show the way out of hopeless situations, and are sometimes the ones who end up with the man they should have been with all along.  Some people in the SF genre are just as sexist as the rest of us.  SF writer John Ringo was sued for sexual harassment by an assistant who had a crush on Ringo.  This lawsuit was overturned and Ringo eventually made a good living as an editor, but she has been a lightning rod ever since for people wanting to take her down.  She's been the subject of several books and a series of articles and a movie about her life.  I read the John Ringoff book trilogy, and I have to say that most of the men in the trilogy were not heroes at all.  It really made me think about the problem of sexism in SF as a genre, and it was a good read.  After reading Ringo's trilogy, I found some women writers to be more than just heroines.  One woman was a brilliant doctor, and another was a heroine.  In a book about a woman who could see the future, the main female character is just a love interest for the hero, and they spend the entire book together.  I didn't find this book to be particularly sexist or oppressive, but I could see how a man might find it difficult to feel like he could get a woman into bed.  And I'm not a fan of romance novels that have sex scenes in them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a huge fan of C.S. Lewis, and this novel was like a massive dose of Christian spirituality. There was a very nice spiritual element in this book, that you just never get from other Christian writers. I really liked the idea that the good book is in fact a good bad book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not usually a fan of chick lit, but I read this book and I was so glad I took the chance. I was very intrigued by the premise, but it was also intriguing how this novel took some of the most familiar and romantic tropes and rethought them, all the while retaining a lot of the original feel. I think I would recommend this to a certain type of reader, a "love with a twist" type person.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in January 2016 when I was looking for a new reading assignment. I am in my first semester of the MFA program in writing, and this book is very interesting and insightful. The author gives good insight into the "how" and "why" of writing, which is very valuable in terms of learning and developing as a writer. The book is not written from the point of view of a writer, as a novel would be, but from the perspective of the writer, and it is very useful as a study guide. The only downside is the language. The first chapter is not as concise as I would have liked, and the style can be jarring at times, but overall I enjoyed this book and will definitely re-read it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A novel about an atheist who is recruited as a missionary by a Christian preacher. It does not have the best characters, but there is not a whole lot of conflict. This is a good little Christian-centered book, with good prose and characters.  Review of Genesis by James N. White: This book is full of religious rhetoric and Christian beliefs that I don't think are compatible with scientific thinking.  the problem with the book is that the character believes that they have been chosen by God for the job (that is a religious belief) and they go on a mission to convert people. In one chapter we see this character go to a pagan temple to find idols that were used to worship God, and the characters claim to find an idol on the top of a statue of the god, when in fact it was the bottom, or a different statue with the same name. The rest of the book, however, they all seem to have their beliefs that are different from the religion they grew up with.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is wonderful. The story is the main attraction. The plot is interesting, I liked the character development and the world building. I don't think there is anything bad to say about this book and I'm glad I read it. The only thing that didn't work for me was that the ending was a little abrupt and the pacing was a bit slow.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book after I had finished the previous ones, and while I didn't enjoy the previous, this book wasn't a let down.   The book is set up as a "science fiction" book and has some science and technology thrown in to the book.  But the writing isn't bad, it's very good, I think that's why I enjoyed the book so much.  One thing to point out is that I don't understand why they didn't do the same thing as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where they have the aliens communicate using a kind of weird language.  It wasn't necessary, but it was nice.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a science fiction book with some action.

I enjoy the occasional bit of escapism, but even more when that escap  I really liked this book, and would have liked it more if it had a lot more female characters. I liked the way they were written as separate personalities rather than "one woman who loves a different man". However, it seems that the main characters had a different relationship with the main male character. The main male characters were like "my man", while the secondary male characters liked him for the same reasons.   The main character is named Jack, and the secondary characters are named Sally, Molly, and Alice. Jack is a very interesting and well-written character. He doesn't seem to have a lot going on in his life other than having a lot on his mind. He knows a lot about his father's business, but is mostly focused on the new book he's writing about his old job. But as time goes on, he starts to realise how much he cares about Sally and Alice, and how much they love him. As we learn more about each character, it's revealed that they aren't actually as "crazy" as they appear.  ... The best part of this book for me was seeing Jack's relationship with Sally grow as they went from friendship to love to attraction. I really liked the fact that he was always looking for ways to please her and she was always finding reasons to give him reasons to be pleased with himself. It was really quite refreshing to see a book with male characters who aren't always about sex and romance.  The best part was seeing Sally and Jack together.   on November 27, 2015 - 10:58am, This was an interesting read. I enjoyed the main character, Jack, in the beginning, but he really wasn't what kept me reading the rest of the book. The story is more about the love stories that Jack has, not Jack's life. I also liked the side characters that were introduced throughout the story. I wish that I could have liked them better, though. I will be checking out the sequels when I get a chance. , by Katherine Day.  the book follows Jack, a journalist, and his love interest, Sally.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As a very well-read and well-traveled woman of fifty, I have to say that if it were up to me, I would have taken a day or two off from traveling to this book and gone for the reading alone!   The whole experience of reading it has been a pleasurable one, and the book does offer a nice amount of travel information as well as general information.   I hope that it continues to come in future and as a reader. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    -   In the year of my first visit with Sontag, she did not tell me what the subject of her latest book was: she merely said that "an artist of her caliber is almost as rare as a unicorn." It was not until I had read the second page, though, that I discovered that this book was not about unicorns or any other animal. Sontags "art" is to doodle and sketch, in which case her work is always excellent. Her works are in the same vein as those by Ed Ruscha, Robert Crumb, and Mark Rothko, but, unlike their contemporaries, they are also works of serious visual art.   So I am reading a new book by this writer who is obviously brilliant and brilliant in ways she would never let me see. A few days later, she gives a talk in which she announces that she is going to do something for which there was no market: she is quitting writing.  But, I am to read a new one by this other writer who obviously is not brilliant but brilliant in a lot of ways she wishes would be brilliant.  She reads her book, then gives a few remarks about it, and goes off in search of some other subject.  The book she read was the essay collection, "Rear View Mirror," edited by her husband, Paul Bowles, which came out last year.  I am not surprised that the essayists were not invited to present their work at the festival; I was at the conference and had the opportunity to meet many of them. In fact, I remember thinking during the conference that the selection of essays was, on balance, good. The authors were excellent, and all had some serious books in print. I am also not surprised about Sontagen's withdrawal from writing. The reason I was surprised was that I thought she would be delighted to write a book of new poems.  It was her favorite genre, and she was at least as passionate about her work as many of the poets present were. But she said she would not be able to do it.  This is a great loss to all of us who love Sontago's poems, for I would have been very happy to hear Sontaga read some of her work. It is a shame too that the festival would not have been as good a place to hear the works of all the other great American poets.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read! This is a very good book. I liked the idea of this book but the execution was a little rough. The story was pretty straightforward but I was disappointed with how much info was presented in a short amount of time. The pacing was a bit off also. It could have used a bit more info and character development. But overall, this was an enjoyable read. I did find a few things to dislike about this book, which I will list below. But in the end, it was still a good read. - The ending was a very abrupt. The author didn't really make it clear what happens after the main characters get to the afterlife and there were some things that didn't make sense (what happened to the boy and the demon). - I'm a little disappointed in how the demon is portrayed. At first he seems very scary. But then he makes it clear that he's not really bad. But there were things that made it seem like he was just a demon. Like he couldn't stand the light (so he would not be able to get close to the woman if she was in the dark room) and he wouldn't even bother going after the man who died. - I didn't find any really strong character development with any of the main leads. For the most part, I found that they didn't have much going for them besides being the main character. So if they were to get a book about them again, I would probably read the book again. But for now, it will be my only book with these characters. - No, this isn't a bad book. But I think it was a really bad book when it was first published.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In summary: it was a fantastic read. It was a good read in the sense that there were interesting things said that we should know about.   We're all born ignorant, but the truth can be hard to see if you only look in a certain direction.  This book tells the story of one of the most influential people in the history of music.  I enjoyed the story, and the book has a good feel to it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading this book.   The characters were all well rounded, and the setting was a great place for the characters to grow.  The ending was really awesome and I'm glad this is one of the books that's coming out in 2013.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very easy to read. It's an interesting and well written read about the "Gone With The Wind" movie and the "A Few Good Men" trial. The book is a historical account, so there is a great deal of historical detail and details about key people in the events. As well, I thought the author did a good job of explaining why the movie was so successful, and why the court was so corrupt. A few minor quibbles:

Write a positive review about a good book:    As the author notes, the book is a "work in progress" and as such I have only read the first two chapters. I'm only going to comment on what has so far impressed me: 1) A new approach to a classic topic. I've read a fair bit about the war and it is not my favourite book on this subject. The author's approach is to look at a wide range of sources.   The sources he does select have been good - a lot of important books.  But I want to see the book move beyond the more popular, but of little interest to a lot more people. 2) The authors approach to what he has to say. He focuses on the psychological, social, and political dimensions of what happened during World War II. He has some interesting insights.  I will see if I learn anything from these sources that others have missed.

Write a positive review about a good book:      The book was well written, very interesting, well written by a well established author.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because it was very close to the one that was described on a library shelf. It was a very informative book on one of my favorite authors.   This book is more for fans of his work, which is all good for a fan.    The story is well-written and the narration of the main character has a lot of emotion, and a very realistic attitude.  I like that this book also covers some of his earlier works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book, and it is written very well and is a very good read. It is a great book to read with children, or any adult who wants to read a good story with interesting characters. It's a well-written story that follows the main character, but doesn't waste any time on explaining anything that a younger child might not know. It has an adult-like feel to it, as the main characters do things like talk to cats, make a "magic" potion, and have their "magic spells" backfire on them.   It's a very interesting and original story, so I highly recommend it!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "   The first time I read The Great Divorce (a novella set in a family court), I felt like I was reading a story about a typical divorce—a father and a mother. But then I read it again and realized it's a book that tells us something very different from what we usually think about family court.   "   This book is not about divorce. But it does say something about a dysfunctional family and a person who is at the mercy of a family law court, as a judge. It's a story of a woman named Kate, who lost her husband and three children in a car accident. After several unsuccessful attempts at legal intervention, Kate decides to take matters into her own hands by going to court, on her own, to ask for the custody and visitation of her three children.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read for everyone who is interested in the history of India in the last 1,400 years. The authors present a rich and detailed history of the development of India and it's various kingdoms, states, republics and empires from the end of the 12th century AD to the year 1757 AD. A fascinating account of this period of India's history and how it came to be a secular state is presented through the use of fascinating primary documents. In addition, the author has written a compelling novel based on his personal experience as the last son of a wealthy Hindu noble family. The story begins in 12th Century India where a young woman falls in love with a Buddhist monk who is the son of an important king. In the ensuing battle, the boy loses the battle but survives. The king then decides to adopt the boy as his son and give him a kingdom as his new kingdom begins to rise and thrive. The author brings to light fascinating details about the events that led up to this historical event and how the lives of the young man and his royal mother influenced their son's future political involvement. This is a wonderful and enjoyable read.   - Reviewed on: July 6, 2008 This book is an excellent book that should not be missed. Its content is comprehensive and there is an enjoyable tale in this history. It is written in a fascinating, interesting way. This book provides a broad understanding of India that is accessible for everyone without bias. - Reviewer from Germany - Review reviewed on: February 9, 2008 The book is very much detailed and I appreciate how the authors used primary documents from various periods to build the story. I found the biography of King Vajracharya especially fascinating and it was interesting to hear the background of the kings who would have been the rulers of the various kingdoms. The history is quite thorough, and provides much information on the major events in India's development. A good read and a must have for anyone wanting a clear understanding of the growth and development of an ancient society. -Reviewer from Finland - Review submitted on: January 26, 2008 A good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm new to the world of sci-fi, but the world that's being presented in this book is a very compelling one. I was also excited to see a novel that doesn't seem to revolve around the main characters, but instead explores the relationships between them. The worldbuilding is fantastic, as you might expect from a fantasy author.   This isn't the most innovative science-fiction I've read, but it's still well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My new favorite book.  I am a former Catholic (former member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). The stories in this book were incredibly heart-wrenching to read about and deeply moved me. I feel the author was a true witness of the Church, so many of his stories of former members are heartbreaking. The only downside I could find was that the book felt a bit long, and sometimes he just wasn't sure of what he wanted to say. But these two issues were minor in my opinion and I definitely highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the characters in this book. The book is a "coming of age" story about three girls in the beginning who are growing up. The three girls have different strengths and weaknesses and have a hard time fitting in with each other and their surroundings. But at the end of the book, they're all still friends. I enjoyed the book and found it fun. I have to admit that I had to put down the book a couple times, but I don't really care because I think I've found my new favorite book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "A powerful book to read, one which should not be missed". —John Galt, (The Anarchist FAQ) "An extremely well written account of a political conflict which had profound implications for the libertarian movement in the United States and the world." —Cynthia A. George, (Founding Member of the Free State Project) "One of the most important books I have read in a long time." —Michael Huemer, Ph.D., author of The God Species "I had read a number of books on the history of the New Deal and its legacy in the American Left, but none that so neatly, effectively, and succinctly summarized its main themes and arguments." —George M. Cohan, former Professor, Princeton University "A must-read for all libertarians." —Ronald Lee, author of Free Minds, Free Markets. "A classic work of non-fiction, as well as political biography. It gives the reader an insider's view of the history, psychology, and tactics of the "New Left" in the 1960s and beyond." —T.H. Luker, M.D, (Co-author of The Free Market in History) "It is important to remember that, as the subtitle says, the New Left's political action was aimed at "reducing the size and power of government." It was not an attempt to abolish all government. Instead, it sought to eliminate only government-based forms of coercion, including taxation. The New Left did not "want to destroy capitalism, and that does not mean to abolish capitalism entirely. Rather, it wants to destroy the state's role in the economy." —L.S. Shook, Ph,D. "The New Left is a fascinating account of its roots and development." —Paul Bloom, M., (Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences) "Bast's book is one of the best historical accounts of the libertarian Left, written in the context of the Cold War. This book is well worth reading by those seeking an insight into the thinking and actions of the free-market New Left." —Randy Barnett, M.D., (Professor of Family Medicine and Public Health, San Diego State University) "I've only read one other book that fully captures this history — David Gordon, Free the People: The Ron Paul Revolution and the Future of Liberty (Liberty Fund). Bast is the only one of his kind." —Juan Cole

Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is one of the very few that I have read that is actually about "the thing."     "I was an alcoholic before I became a journalist and I never thought I would have the chance to write a book about it... [I]t's impossible to write about this disease and not get some form of personal interest... I think everyone can relate to the feelings of isolation, pain, guilt, fear, self-loathing, and all of those things I felt while drunk... The alcohol problem is a really great subject to write from, because it's universal. I can't imagine why we haven't written a book like this. It's a shame that it hasn't been written." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book when I was in the middle of a serious breakup and needed a good break. The whole experience in the woods was intense, emotional, and really helped me to heal a lot of brokenness.  . There are some real gems in this book, like the "solar panel" for making contact with the sun, and the "laser light" that changes color when it hits the light bulb and shines. It was an incredible trip down the rabbit hole into my darkest feelings and it all came out in the end.  The whole book is extremely thought-provoking and is a great read and refresher.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The good:  It's not a bad book, but you have to read it slowly. And it has a lot of things that are interesting. If you are a fan of science fiction, you should really check out "The Long Tomorrow"   "The Longest Day" by A.E. van Vogt  It's not bad, but it isn't the classic. It's pretty short too. The bad:  No doubt about it, there is going to be people who read this book, and it won't be because of the science-fiction aspects, but just because it's short and it has so much to say.

Write a positive review about a good book:     The Good :   1) In the beginning, I couldn't help but want to read more about the magic that was created by the original series of books (and then some more by the films). This is the best entry point I've had so far into the world of Stephenie Meyer's books, and is definitely the one I'm going to go back to again and again.   2) There are enough new elements to keep things interesting, and it's a good thing to see how things were different during the final book and the beginning of this one. I'm curious to see what the author will do next with this world and the characters.   in the beginning I couldn´t help but to want to get into this book more, but my wife said that she can´t get into it because of the "pussy factor". But that's just me, the main character is such a sweetheart, so I can forgive it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently got to try out the new version of Dr. Seuss' book The Lorax, which I read when I was a child and never got around to reading again until now. The new version is much better than the older edition, and if you haven't read it yet, you need to. I especially liked the stories about how the Lorax and the tree grew up to be friends and become one of the most iconic creatures in the world. The Lorac books are some of my favorite children's books. This new version features several new stories that I found especially touching. The old version was a bit hard to follow sometimes, but I'm glad I've picked it up. Thanks again, Dr.Seuss, for the timeless classic! :)  Review of Seussical by David W. Smith The book is a delight. It is a lovely mix of science and humor that I really enjoyed. I loved reading about the Lorac tree, which seems to have been a favorite of his. I was surprised, though, at how much humor there is in this book. The story starts with a man being told he has a very unusual illness (for people of his age) and is to be treated with a strange plant called the Lorasene that is not very effective, but has some. Then, just as the man is being given the plant to administer to his disease, something comes into the house and kills the Lorisene. The man is devastated, and the Lora tree comes to the rescue. When it asks to be taken to the vet, the man refuses. So, the tree gets up, and, of course, it is rejected by the man, who has decided he is going to kill it in vengeance. But when the tree asks if he wants it to live, or if he would rather it die, the sick man chooses to live with the tree. This is the Lorafaba, who becomes one of his closest friends and lovers. The next few books in the series are great, and I recommend reading them all if you can find them.  Book Review: The Lorica Tree by Dr. M. S. Sezsef I've read Dr. Ssef's other books in his series and they have been good, but this new book, The Loria Tree is better. This novel has a nice mixture of science, art, and humor, which makes for a fun read. One of my favorites
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy reading the new books of the  John Wesley Harding  series, and the newest edition,  The Way We Were, is a fine continuation of that tradition.   The character of Harding was a refreshing change from the usual male hero.  His personality was a reflection of his time and background, and he was a hero to me as a child and as an adult.  He was a flawed man, but the character of his character was a strong one.  The new book features several new scenes that give a better impression of the time Harding lived in.  Harding was born during the Civil War and as such was born into a time where racism was prevalent.  Like many other characters of the era, Harding's father was in a terrible marriage.  This meant that both of the parents were "forced" to leave their homes to join the war, resulting in the young man having no real father figure in his life.  Once the war ended, Harding returned home to be a husband, but once again, he was not welcomed back.  Because of his past, Harding was treated as something of a pariah among his peers in town.  Although I understand that many people of that time were prejudiced and held that Harding's background made him a threat to the social order, there was no need to treat a person like that.  While some people may consider this novel to be racist, it was a far cry from that at all.    Although Harding wasn't exactly well liked in town, his friends found a place for him in their home.  That place was the home of Mrs. Denny, an extremely strict disciplinarian.  She is able to handle Harding's misbehavior and maintain his good behavior, but in return for her devotion to her "truest friends," she is able find ways for her husband to support his son during the tough times of his life in a very loving and nurturing manner.  I think that what makes this novel so compelling is the characters.  Even though Harding's family was prejudiced, they still cared about him enough to invite him to join them in their house, even if they thought he should go somewhere else to be safe.  Mrs. Harding seems like the most normal of the characters in the novel, but you can tell that she has been through a lot, and even though she has not spoken about her experiences, she does speak to Harding as a friend about them.

She has decided to travel, with the hope of making things right.

Write a positive review about a good book:    -   The most interesting book on the subjects of meditation and mind and the spiritual life in general, without a doubt, for the amount of research and detail put forth in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The author's experience is typical of my own: She was never a part of the Mormon church; had been raised a strict Catholic; became a Mormon in her late twenties; has remained a member of the church, and, like most Mormons, believes in the Book of Mormon.  She has also read a lot of other books on Mormonism. In fact, the more that I read, the less I have any doubt that this book is accurate and insightful.   One of the main reasons for my negative review is the title.  As someone who has studied religion and theology for a good part of my life, I find it a bit silly.  I find that if you are going to pick an argument or point out an error in a book, you might as well pick the most obvious one you can.    This book is the exception.  The title is a little misleading.  If you think this book's only contribution is to debunk the LDS church, I say, why would you read it?   If it were a book that just dealt with the problems with the church the author personally experienced, you'd probably have a different opinion.  It is a good read if you want to find out what it is really like to be a member.

I've been doing a lot of hiking, and have found a good amount of books to read in each state, but I've found this to be my favorite so far.  The books are in order from most interesting to least interesting (though there are some surprises here too), and I like that the author lists the books in the order of their introduction rather than starting with the most interesting books.  This list includes short books and ones that cover lots of ground.  There are good lists out there like the American Library Association's Good Reads, and if you want to read something but don't have a lot, this is an excellent place to start.

In fact, I would recommend this book to those who like a good story and a bit of science.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for those who like historical fiction with a touch of comedy. The main character is a 19th century Yankee, as he is a New York Yankee who is the only son of a Jewish New Englander. His father died when he was very young. His mother died when she was very old. His great-grandmother died when I was born. He has an uncle who is also a Yankee and he thinks he is the one of his kind. The only thing that makes him different is that he is an old Yankee and is always going to be a New Yorker. His uncle is like his father but he is all about sports. He never liked being around the other Yankee players so much and has to leave the game for his wife. One thing that I really like about this book is that there is a lot of humor in it. It's not really a book for the faint of heart, but I definitely enjoyed it.

I would recommend this to all fans of Jordan's and to anyone who enjoys great audio productions.

I have a love-hate relationship with fantasy, but have been forced into reading more as a result of a friend with a looong history of lupus. My girlfriend is also a fantasy reader, which means that I've found myself reading a lot of fantasy books. I found this book very enjoyable. It wasn't overly grim and gruesome, though, and the world of Azlant is really interesting and has a really great magic system. A good mix of good and evil, with some real dark magic as well, that makes it fun to read. Highly recommend!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I've read in the last 3 years, and I'm very glad I decided to get this book to learn about a new topic. The book covers the entire subject of the theory of probability. It doesn't cover anything that is not covered in a first year probability course, it covers the whole spectrum of the subject, from basic questions about probability to more advanced topics like complex models. I found the book to be well written and easy to follow. The authors' research is impeccable and makes it clear that the author has a very good grasp of probability theory and probability theory of programming. In addition to the fact that I've seen so many books cover the same topic, I also appreciated the authors' attempt to avoid the pitfalls of the old "one size fits all" approaches to probability. There are plenty of examples and examples in the book that I found very helpful.

Write a positive review about a good book:    What I liked:  The book is really good, but there are two things I don't like about it. One, I really dislike that one of the most prominent characters is a girl who can't stand the sight of blood and she wants no part of it.   Another thing is that the whole family is called the Bloods.  This book was really a mixed bag. I was excited to start reading it, but I was disappointed at the end of it (although I would still read the other parts of the book and try to get a hold of more information on what happens to the characters after this book).

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really great book.   The characters, especially the one's who are not very good, really resonate.  The characters are all very different but they really relate to each other and they're all believable.  I really do recommend this to everyone and anyone who is interested in this genre.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good read, despite the title "The Art of the Breakdown" because the book actually shows the steps involved in making a good break-up.    I think that this book is well written and would recommend to anyone who has been in a long distance relationship. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is so good I can't even get out of bed in the morning. The characters are all so lovable. I'm sure this book is as much about the love triangle as it is about the book, but it would still be interesting if the love interest just ended the book. The author is so great at describing people's moods and personality. Even if he doesn't have them, the characters feel real and believable. The book has some really good descriptions and dialogue that I was surprised by. I don't think I would enjoy a book without some of these things.   My only issue is that it feels like the author could have been writing a novel (the romance in this book makes me wonder if it is). I wouldn't mind having a character who had to deal with the pressure of her relationship with a famous author.  But the author doesn't seem like she is going to go that route. I would also love a bit more information about the romance in the book and the relationship between the two characters.  As it is now, the book is really good, and I would love to read more about this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book ever! It is a very simple, but profound book, which can help anyone to understand the meaning of life and the need for love and kindness.  It is really quite a well done story about a man and a woman who meet and become great friends. Their love of each other drives the entire story. I loved the way that this story made me think about relationships and the relationships we have in life. I also loved the fact that the ending is very moving.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are not afraid to ask a question, this book will show you everything there is to know about what it is like to be in a long-term relationship. There are two parts of this book. The first is an overview of the subject and the second is a case study of the relationship. The case study part is the most useful and interesting.   After reading this book, if you want to know everything about long- term relationships, you need this book!   I would like to thank the publisher and author of this excellent book, David Sedaris for providing this valuable resource to the readers. I will never forget the conversations that I had with David Sedariss on how to have a long term relationship. I hope others take the time to read this book as it provides a great guide in what it takes to build a good and satisfying relationship.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best reads I have ever picked up. I love science fiction. It's all I read now. I was shocked at the depth of insight in this book. This book gave me so much to think about. I have been reading about the evolution of humanity, the evolution that is taking place today, and my son is very excited about the new species that are appearing on Earth, and the fact that man is evolving. I know some people are in agreement with me, but I do not buy that people should stay as they are. It is going to be a struggle if people want to change, if they want to evolve, if their minds want to become more mature. But if they do not, they will go to the ground.  " The people who are currently alive at the time this is written will be dead by the time the book is published. But the things that were said by them, the things they were forced to go through and the stories they were told are still important.  "  I have been following the debates around this topic for a while now and I think this is the best article you have written to date. I highly recommend it!  This is a very good book and it has a lot of information in it that you can use to understand how humanity will evolve.   A book about evolution is like a cup of water; it has many flavors, yet all tastes good.  It is the key to understanding the way the Earth will be destroyed. The key is in the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:     So here's a tale of a man who is a little bit crazy, a little more so than I am.    He gets his hands on a box full of old newspapers and turns them into a book - which he has to publish - using the money he has just earned.  This book is full of humor, and if you read the whole thing I would guess that you'll enjoy it.  I think this is going to be a classic someday. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character of this book is a little girl, and her life is so boring because of that: she's got a great book series and a great aunt who does nothing except sit at home and cook. In the beginning of the story, it seems like the only thing she does is eat and sleep: then we learn that she is a witch. After that, she's a little boy and she learns that she has to do some serious magic. But, even though she knows what's going to happen in the next book, she can't seem to get it all together! I liked the idea of being able to see how these characters live in a normal world and their lives in a magical world. There's one plot that just won't end, and that's one of the reasons I loved this book so much! It's all about how much it all takes to live in this world.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book on audiobook at a public library. The audiobook was good but not great. The dialogue was good and the story kept me interested throughout. My only complaint was that the author is so boring, I didn't understand most of the dialogue and I really didn't care who the characters were.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have read my previous review you will be quite glad to know that the sequel is also excellent. It is a more mature book and it is a lot more interesting. If you are looking for a darker story with lots of angst, this is definitely not the book for you, but if you are the type who likes a good story with some humour in it, I highly recommend the sequel. If I was to say the reason it was a good sequel is the fact that it is set right after the first book and gives a bit more insight into what happened to the characters. However, it is still a good read and if you like the first one this is a must read. Read full review If I had to sum up how this book felt...     This book was like a combination of both The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner. It was epic, emotional and exciting.   It was well written, well paced and I loved the twists and turns of this book.  My biggest problem is the characters because I was expecting a more "serious" book but the worldbuilding was fantastic, there were a few twists which caught me completely off guard and there were many likable and likeable characters. I'm glad that I had the chance to read it. Read more
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book has done more for me in the last year than I can say.   The basic plotline of this story is excellent, especially for a young teen reader:  To be a tomboy is to live an uncertain, self-doubtful life, with little time to relax and do anything, but also with endless opportunities to feel like a girl.  The characters in this story are not only believable, but I would never consider one of them a stereotype.  For example, the main character, Todar, is extremely brave and strong-willed but also deeply sad and insecure.  To keep her at a competitive level she is required to take her brother's place in school and to compete as much as she can with her peers.  Her brother, Siyabonga, on the other hand is a more reserved and more passive character and the book makes it clear that she is the more mature one.  Todas mother is a great mother to the younger two and does what she can to keep them going, but still worries about her own kids.   The action scenes and the characters' back and forth between the two sides are well-written and believable.  However, I have to say that I was never completely sold on the ending and found myself a bit surprised.  There are some flaws in the story and I would recommend it to a young reader, but it's definitely a good story and a good first book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read The Great Gatsby when it came out back in 2006 and thought it was one of the best books of that year. As an admirer of the novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald, I had high hopes for this novel. So far, it is on my list of the top 10 most amazing and beautiful books I have read in a very long time.   "The Great G  "I read The Greatest Love Of All: My Friendship with Gats by William Faulkner in the late 60's. I remember reading it and how beautiful it was. It is still as beautiful in my mind as I remember and still, all these years later, I find myself thinking, how did he know so much about friendship? How did he write such great books? How could the world be so good that the author was so far behind the times in every aspect, yet, somehow, his stories are still timeless."   -David Sedaris
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A very fun read - one of my favorites! I have enjoyed many a good mystery and this one is a keeper."    -Cindy H.   My review: "What a fantastic set-up! This is a perfect introduction to the fantastic world of James Ellroy. This is the kind of book you can sit down with, start to finish, and never tire of. The plot was just perfect and I was eager to keep reading. The characters were so interesting and believable, I laughed throughout the book."
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's funny, a little sad, and very true.   I don't want to say too much for fear of spoilers, but I loved it. It's not the "real world" that's been described in the book, but the kind of fictional world that can be imagined. In that regard, it's a lot like a movie, and much more interesting to watch. I know this is just one man's opinion, but if I had to choose one book for my 11th grade English class, this would definitely be it.
Write a positive review about a good book:      In this I read that the gods and the devils in the Old and New Testaments are often portrayed as identical. The only difference is that the Old Testament gives Jesus a role in the universe, while the New Testament does not. The book's title says it all.         I love it when a book is more than just a story. A book should provide insights, ideas and experiences, but most importantly a book should challenge, change, and move the reader. This book does that.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. As I said before, my first foray into fiction, this book is a good, fast read. The plot is pretty straightforward; one year after the events of the last novel, the two heroes must go back in time to try to stop their sister from becoming a criminal, but to do that they have to become agents for the FBI. So the plot is straightforward and you know when to get on with the book. The characters are likable, and there's enough depth in them to keep you engaged. There's a lot of humor, and a couple of very clever plot twists. In the end, I found this to be a pretty good read, and I'm looking forward to reading more from the world of Fortuna in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this as a young adult. It's one of those books that I didn't realize until after I finished it. I think it would work well for an adult reader, and it's one that I'm sure a lot of young adults would enjoy, but I still think it could work for a more mature audience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is an excellent book. It teaches you the principles that will enable you to be your best in all your professional dealings, including all those that require interpersonal skills. It is also a very good book for those who aspire to a higher degree in the law." --L.F. "  I was a lawyer for 10 years before going into administration and teaching. I find the writing excellent, the concepts in here are very applicable to almost any area of law, and the examples to be used are very clear and very easy to understand. My experience working with lawyers (and clients) has been excellent, as this book will be used with all the other lawyer books I read." --B.R. " I have always felt that lawyers have a lot of power over the world of work and that this power can often be abused by the lawyer who is the most aggressive and arrogant.  This book, in many ways, makes this argument very clear to the non-lawyer.  The author presents a theory of power as it relates to interpersonal relations. The author is careful to distinguish between the different types of power that exist, which he discusses at great length.   In short, the book is an eloquent and interesting presentation of the idea of the difference between power, dominance and the lack of power.  What you'll find is that in relationships there is power in the power exchange, power in what you are able to do and how you are allowed to do it, and also in the respect and the appreciation that comes with a relationship with a person.  " --A.P. " What I found most helpful in the book was the author's distinction between dominance and power as they relate to relationships. The fact that he describes power as something that is gained and maintained over time is very helpful in understanding the concept.  It should be noted that the author takes a somewhat different stance than many, including myself, who see power as the only way to get and maintain dominance.  Instead, he uses the concept of power to illustrate the difference in how we should view our relationships and to illustrate how important it is to recognize the difference.  Again, a few of my favorite parts: 1. The role of "power" in relationships.  2. The concept of mutual respect and appreciation.  3. The idea that in some relationships, people are actually better off without power. " The book may be read as a textbook for attorneys, but it also could be
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book!   This book is about a young person who lives with his father in rural Wisconsin.   The father's work ethic and a strong willed attitude are the things that have sustained the young man throughout his life.  His mother is often absent and the two have difficulty making a life together as a family.  This story has great characters and is filled with adventure!  The narrator is well-written.  It was my first time reading a work of non-fiction, so I was surprised by how well this narrator communicated information in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner.  The plot is interesting, though I was confused a bit as to how the father could survive without the son's support.  I wish the author had gone a little deeper in her research and written a little about the family dynamics and their background.  Overall, I'd give this book a 4.5 out of 5  
Write a positive review about a good book:     "It takes a lot of work to become a hero, but the reward is worth the work. Not too hard to understand, although the writing does a better job at it than the movie did. But then again the movie is a lot easier to understand. And you get to see more of the action. Not a bad read in my opinion."
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was interesting and a very interesting book for a man of our time. But I do believe the best way to view it is as a cautionary tale about a time when men could be as good as women in the area of business. This was before the time of the feminists when there was less respect for women than there is today. If a man takes the time and effort to write a book about business as a woman, he should have the confidence and resources to do what a woman should have done, and be more successful than a woman would have been. This is not a criticism of the book, but of the times when a woman took the initiative to succeed.   Overall, I recommend this book, especially for the man of the '80s. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been a fan of the series since I read the first book, The Dragonbone Chair, and was delighted by the second book, Blood Song, in which I was introduced to some characters I already know but also had some surprises.   The trilogy continues the good work of author Stephen R. Donaldson, with the third installment in this tale of magic, dragons, and intrigue taking us from the world of the living, to the world under the undead's boot, and on to the dark corners of the world, where the living fear and the dead know they are more powerful than the living.  This book will appeal to anyone who enjoys magic, intrigue, and the dangers that lurk in the world around them.  I would recommend this book to all fantasy lovers!
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This book is excellent. This book is absolutely excellent." "This has to be one of the most important books on language ever written." "The language you learned today will be the language that you speak and write in forever." "You'll look at a piece of paper that says, 'Loan a dollar to an American, and receive a dollar of interest,' and you'll see that in the way your brain functions, the dollar symbolizes the interest that will be paid on the loan." "One of the great things about this book is that it shows you how the language works and that the language isn't a toy you're playing with; it's something you live with. It's an intimate part of you that has to do with who you are, the way you think and the way people think." "It's one of those books that you can't put down, not because you can see all the information, but because the language and the culture are so beautifully woven together." "I learned a language just by studying and speaking the same way. Not because I'm a good listener, but in fact because I was good at making people care about what I said. I think I had a knack for it as well as I learned to use it." "Most language learners spend their entire lives without ever encountering a language. But it can be just as easy to use the wrong language as the right one."
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second installment in the series is a decent start but leaves things for some of the characters to get better. This book picks up where the previous book left off with a few new characters and a few good twists and turns that make the story more complex. The plot of the series starts out with the main character looking for her missing daughter who she hasn't heard from in ten years. She finds out that her daughter has disappeared and turns to her friend to help her track her down. While there, she is attacked by a killer who was trying to get revenge for an earlier killing. This main character's daughter is also a character in this book. The story takes a good bit of a step back from the previous books. There is a lot of character development but the author doesn't make the effort to tie up the loose ends of the previous three books. A couple of the relationships were a bit too confusing to figure out. I don't think there is any one character I really disliked in this novel, just too many for me. Also, I'm not sure if the series will continue or if this is the end of it. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery/thriller set in the mountains.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is so helpful that I would recommend it to a friend. He's going through a lot of grief because he is going to have to give up his job. This is a very helpful guide for someone going through the same type of thing. I would like to see more books like this because people are going through really tough times. Thanks a lot for writing this book. -- R.B.  Review of The Grief Journey: What to do when you're going through what others call 'The Loss' (with Erika J. Martin) by Erika Martin:    This book is a good guide, especially if you are going thru a really bad time. My main concern is that it is very much aimed towards people who are going to be at work for a long time. Not for people going through divorce or divorce, but just for the long haul people who want to stay at work long-term. I can understand that, especially when people are not planning on taking time off to grieve or to help someone. This book has many good advice, such as taking a step back when you have a bad day and having a good day instead. A book with that type of advice can be very helpful. -- S.C. ,  New York, NY
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book after a long time and I am happy. I liked the idea of a boy, a girl and their parents who never stopped trying to understand each other and make the best out of their situation. It was a very pleasant story to read. It took me to an imaginative world with well thought out plot that's easy to understand. The characters were complex and made me care about their fate.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a big fantasy and science-fiction fan, I love this book. The characters are fun, the story is engaging, the world is fun. The only thing I could think of that's lacking is the romance. But maybe that's the point, isn't it?
Write a positive review about a good book:    * The main character, a young man who has been given up for dead after a car accident, learns that he has survived because someone found him, and that he was the victim of an act of terror, as a result of which he has been raised by a woman, a nurse named Nelly. He learns that Nelly's husband, a drug dealer, had been killed in a shooting in the past, that he is the only one in his family who doesn't remember anything from the attack, and eventually that he's the only person who knows what happened to him. The ending of the book is not quite what I'd expected from an adventure book. It's not as tense or exciting as I had imagined, but there is a definite sense of tragedy in the story. * The pacing of the story was good. While the book didn't do anything completely new for the genre, I think that it did enough to satisfy my own preferences. I liked the characters, the setting, and the way the story unfolded. * There is no love triangle between Nelly and the boyfriend, and Nelly herself was not as compelling as she could have been. She's just not as much of a love interest as other authors are, and I found her less likable.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that every good SF/F fan should own.   It's fast-paced, action-packed, and just plain fun.  The characters are well written, with a little bit of humor here and there.  The book is set in the late 70's, in a city in the United States called "The City of the Dead". The only problem with The City of Dead is that, in the City of The Dead, the "Dead" never "die". They're always rising, and are always evolving. The only way to keep the dead from taking over the city is to have a "Resurrection" event.  One day, a woman named Amy is asked to lead a "resurrection". The problem is that Amy has been dead for several months, and when she is asked if she will go, she knows something is a little off. The other people that will go are the same as she was - a young man, a few old people, and a dog named "Jody". Then, the main problem with the event is the fact that it's been kept secret from the rest of the world. When the city of the dead falls, everyone will find out what really happened. When Amy and her "team" finally get out, she gets killed and a mysterious figure tries to get everyone to stop looking for Amy.  I read the book over two nights in a row, and I enjoyed the story very much. It's action packed, fast-moving, and very fun to read. The characters were well written and had some nice jokes and stories to add to the story. I think this is one of the best books I've ever read, and that it may well be one of my favorites for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I really like the premise. It was very clever. It's a bit of a departure but it is not a total disaster. It could use some more depth to it. But it's a solid read." "This is really a must-read, and I am excited about what this book brings to the genre." "I've always been a fan of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, but I never really understood the connection. This book takes you into a whole new galaxy.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have heard a lot of positive comments about this book, and I agree with a good portion of the review that was written by David Gaughran, who reviewed it for this site. My only complaint is that I didn't like the book, even though I liked the characters. I don't know why this book is popular among some fans, but it seems that no matter how much I like this book (as a fan) I can't find myself feeling that I learned anything new from it.
Write a positive review about a good book:     The book was a joy to read - it is a lovely story and it is the most heart warming one. I loved it!    The narrator (who sounded like a young girl!) is just amazing! It was a really funny book, I can't imagine not having it read to me.  I can not give this enough stars!  It was so nice to see someone who knows what it is like to be a little girl in a world where most things are not normal. It really made me feel for the characters, and I enjoyed it so much. It is just a wonderful book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When you get the chance to review a great book by a great author, the best thing you can do is share what made you enjoy it so much.   In the beginning of the book, we learn about Rolf and his journey of learning what it means to be a man, to love others, to be honest.  Rolf's story is a story of learning how to be authentic to yourself and not let others' opinions make you feel like a fraud. I read this book while driving my son to school, and I'm glad I did because it's a story that will help you become better and be more authentic with your loved ones. The characters are great and are well developed. I also like the fact that the author uses humor in her stories.  I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to all men who want to grow into men. It's a great read and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of the original series. This second book was an improvement in every way. The writing was better, the world-building was more complex and interesting. I'd even say this is a slightly better version of the first book than the original, which was a bit of a disappointment in some respects. The story is much more personal and less a big epic in scope. The characters are not as fleshed out and developed (I found the lack of character development a bit disconcerting), and I found that the plot was somewhat repetitive. However, my main concern here is the ending. As I said, I was disappointed that the story did not develop the main characters more. The main character, Nika, is still a bit flat and lacks depth. I feel that the ending was unnecessarily abrupt and unsatisfying. I have seen much better endings in other series. I would highly recommend this one to fans of the books, but I'm not going to waste my money on the second book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, to me, is the best I've come across in the genre of dystopian fiction.   In a world where the "end of civilization" is an inevitability, a woman and her small group of friends are left to build an alternative society on the remains of the one they are leaving behind. It's a story about survival as much as it is about technology.  There are some flaws to the story. The book is written in the third person.  This is a short book, but I don't like that.  The ending is not that great either.  My friends found it hard to read, so I recommend that you pick up a copy.  I don't know how it is possible, but for once I don the glasses (on one eye) and my friend doesn't.  What's with this guy?   He's clearly the coolest of us... And you are the coolest. I mean, I'm cooler than you. But I can see that. Well, except I'm not in the same league as you are, so there you are!   You know what? I don The characters of the story have a kind of real depth.   It seems that every character in this book is at least somewhat likeable.   What's more, I can't help but think that it's a shame to see a lot of great books lost due to lack of sales.  They are so much better than what we read in the mainstream.  It's like, you know what, you can see what's so great about this book, and I'm going to quote one of the characters at some length:  "A world is a wonderful thing to live in and a terrible thing to destroy.  No matter what, one thing will always be true:  To get to Heaven, one must start out in hell.  " -Gideon's brother What a concept!  And the author knows this. And I can tell you this:  The book ends on a high note.  If this author had been more prolific, we would have had a few more great novels, and there might not have been this post on this blog to tell you about this novel.  Thank you, Elizabeth Bear.  And that's it for this week.  Thanks for reading!

We discussed the different things in the book. The book is written in a way that my son is more than capable of understanding the points and the illustrations are helpful. He was able to complete it with little problem.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit skeptical about this book at first, but I have to say I was very satisfied. I have never written a review for a book that didn't enjoy it enough to recommend it. My daughter enjoyed this book and it has gotten her interested in being a writer. I had a hard time finishing the book but I can see myself reading it again. I also feel like the book could be a good tool to help students to understand and learn from difficult concepts.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've ever been so close to a really good book that you feel like you'd die if it wasn't the real thing, this is the book for you.   The narrator is great.  She keeps a fast pace, and the stories are interesting and well-developed.  I think this book would make a great audiobook. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book that I loved - I'm a little bit nervous but glad to have finished it, because I wanted to finish it because of how well it was structured for me (I'm a student in a PhD program, not a scientist). My professor encouraged me to read this book (after I did the readings for my thesis!) and she also told me that she had a copy and liked it as much as I did. It's been a good read so far!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, and I am looking forward to a lot more of Mr. Gaiman's works. The only thing I found problematic was that the characterizations of "The Man with the Golden Gun" weren't really all that believable.   I'm a big fan of Mr Gaiman and love his work. He is one of my favorite authors and I think this book is a bit more like a mini-anthology than a full novel, but still, I can't wait for more.

Write a positive review about a good book:        I love this book, because it is so different from what I was expecting.   I have read many books about writing, including the very famous David Foster Wallace book The Art of Fiction.  The Art is the book that is the most influential for me.  I've tried to learn about what Wallace was trying to accomplish with his own writing through the work of his peers, but I feel that I've failed to find anything new.  It's a bit ironic that the book he cites as the source of the most influence is the one he writes about the least.  In fact, he is quite explicit about his personal struggles with mental illness, and that it shaped much of his writing.  Wallace is clear that the things that he tries to achieve in his writing are the things he is trying to get past as well.  This book is a great example of how different writers can write about the same idea, and the way they use different techniques to accomplish that.    I love this series, because of how well it has been thought out and executed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My two children both love this book, which is very good.   A good story, good plot.  The "good things" are also the "bad things." The good things are not so good. First is that the narrator is a woman who gives herself completely over to the story and doesn't give a damn about how it is told. She is also not very good at remembering how the characters in the story were developed in the preceding chapter or so. Second is the narrator's lack of insight about the book. I am very particular about the way I tell stories, and I'm not sure the narrator could do that. The narrator goes through the story like a "punch line," where she just takes a jab at every character and thinks of some way the character is better off or is worse off because of the events in the book, instead of taking an actual interest in the characters and making an effort to learn more about them. I also don't like the fact that the story is really about the hero of the book being the only one who sees the truth of the situation. I have a hard time understanding how the hero would be the only person who sees it. And finally, when the story starts out about the characters from the previous book being "saved" by the end of the last book, I can't get past the fact they were "saves." I feel like the story was going to end the way the last chapter ended, with a happy ending that was not necessarily the best ending to the book because the bad guys won.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a professional speaker (my husband is a businessman and he helps me with writing for business purposes), and I have used this product to help myself improve my writing. I have been using it on a daily basis for a few weeks now. I just received my books yesterday (I purchased 4 of them), and in the first book I didn't like all that much, so I tried another book. It has now become my favorite. I am more able to focus my ideas, and I am able to get through my chapters more quickly.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's easy to get into the head of the characters and their personal struggle to survive the coming of the apocalypse, but it's also easy to be disinterested with the plot.   The setting of a world that's been overrun by zombies is interesting, but the story ends up being a disappointment.  The worldbuilding of this story is pretty fantastic.  I've had more fun reading about a post apocalyptic world than a few other novels, and the world is filled with interesting characters that I really love.  A few of the details are lost when the story goes into the next couple hundred years, but that doesn't mean the book is any less engaging.  The best character is definitely the guy that has a robot dog. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book, the author presents an approach that uses the principles of quantum mechanics, but also takes some steps toward using it to describe quantum gravity. This book is really good for a variety of reasons, including a good understanding of what quantum mechanics is, its main applications, and why it is so important. It is not all about what you would get from reading a textbook, but it does explain how quantum mechanics may be of value in the future for the future of quantum gravity and for other fields such as quantum information theory. If you are familiar with some of the recent developments in quantum gravity, this book will give you a good introduction to quantum gravity theory and to some of its applications. It can also help you become familiar with current developments in some of these other fields of science.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many books but I have never felt as moved by a book as I did by this one. The narrator is a real character who has her own story to tell, but is not one of the characters. I really like the way the author handled her writing. I feel her writing has much to offer and will be a favorite of my children for years to come.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story in this book is well written. It is also well paced. It's a good balance of the two. The protagonist, Jody, seems like she's going to be the heroine for the rest of the series. She has the power of persuasion and the desire to help other people. Her character development in this series was well done and was believable. I felt like she matured as a character in this one and there was not really a point of no return where things ended for her. This was a nice change of pace and really well paced out. However, one thing that was missing from this series that I liked was a little more development with the other characters. The other main characters are given a little bit of background and are interesting enough to keep readers engaged.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have bought all the books by this author and they all have great story and well written. This is a book I will read again and again because I always feel a part of this world. I'm a woman and I think the world should take gender roles and gender roles, which are so important to me, more seriously. Thank you very much for a wonderful book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must read. I thought I would get bored with the book, but there is so much you can learn by studying this.   Thank you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been trying to decide which of these books to buy for ages now, and I think I've finally found the perfect fit. These guys have done an amazing job of writing an engaging book that is not just about the world of elves, but about human relationships in general. I love how the world is built and how they have introduced new elements while still staying faithful to the core principles of the story. I can't wait for the next book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My sister recently discovered this book and she loved it.   In the book "The Art of Living", a man wrote about his struggle to find the right life. He wrote about how much he was struggling with a decision to quit his job and follow his passion. He went on to explain how many others do the same thing. I am always trying to figure out what to do or not do. I find myself looking back at the mistakes I've made and comparing them to those I have made. I know many people struggle with the same problem.     I enjoyed reading this book because it helps explain a very confusing concept called "motivation".   There is nothing more confusing than this concept. I'm always asking myself, "Why am I so motivated to do something?"   Here is the answer: "Motivation is not about achieving a goal in life. Rather it is about achieving something you love in life"   You will find that it is difficult to achieve what you love if you are doing what you are not passionate about.  In this book you will learn how to build your passion into your life. You will also learn about the principles of what you should not do in order to achieve your goal.  5 out of 5   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought the book on a whim, but I'll be putting it to good use for years to come! The authors really go into the characters' minds, and come up with interesting ideas as well. I loved that they were both really into their characters and made some pretty good, humorous, characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed the book. It has several interesting ideas that are presented and then some fascinating history and a well-written book!  I really enjoyed this book and enjoyed the way the author described the different cultures, religions, and beliefs. The culture in the book that really impressed me was that there are a variety of races and classes and people of different colors and accents and so on. It's not always clear whether they are different from each other or not.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    There's a great reason why books are called "books" instead of "papers" or "carts," and that is because books have no "cargo," or carrying capacity. There's no need for it. Books don't need to move, and they can be safely shelved anywhere. In the first-person narrative (the voice we use to experience a work of art), we have all sorts of ways to tell stories, but in the "third person" (the kind we use when we're thinking of ourselves, and other people) we have to do a bit more explaining or narration to get our point across. In this kind of narrative, characters have to know about each other, or what's going on, or whatever, but what they need most is to keep talking. This is fine if we're talking about a small group of people, but if we want a character to go through a long journey with us, we'd better let him keep talking a lot. I read a book this week about an old man who goes to a retirement home for the elderly and spends a long time talking to the elderly. The whole thing is like a train wreck, or like a scene out of a soap opera. But the elderly people in the book are so stupid and stuck in their own lives that they can't believe this old guy would want to talk to them. That, to me, is the only flaw in the novel, but it's the one I found most compelling. I want to believe that the old man really wants to talk about what's happening in the world, but the elderly folks around him just think he's a creepy old guy with his nose pressed up against their window, and that his interest in them is a way to avoid dealing with their own problems. When we're reading a book and we want to find meaning, we have a hard time being satisfied by the ending. We're looking for a good ending that will satisfy both the author and our own expectations. In The Girl on the Train, the ending I wanted was for the book to end on a note of triumph. I wanted my hero to become the hero of the book and to take a trip to the end of the line. Instead, he ends on a sad note that says: The girl with the book was never going to read the whole thing, and it never bothered me. I guess I wanted the book, or the people, or both to go away. So, what
Write a positive review about a good book:   I started reading this book the day I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and it helped me stay positive in my fight against the disease.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best thing about this book is the description.   I never got a true idea about the magic of the land of the dwarves or why it was worth the time or effort it took to make a magic item.  I'm glad this book went out of print but I don't think there are that many people out there that need an exhaustive explanation about how the dwarven magic works.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I like the book and liked the story, but if I were to be asked to recommend this book, it would be to any reader who likes dark fantasy, grimdark, and mystery fiction: if you like a lot of mystery, if you find a lot in the book to be interesting, if, like me, you're interested in dark, grisly, violent stuff, if the story is well written, well narrated and you're entertained, and if you don't mind a little gore, then go buy this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing was good and the plot was interesting, but I felt like the book lacked a little bit of tension and I was waiting for the payoff, but there wasn't one.   There was one scene that really made me want the book to end, and it actually ended up being pretty good, but in that scene the main character was just being a total asshole. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a must have for anyone with an interest in history, or who just wants a decent read on the topic.   There are many good books available on the subject, but this is the best, period.  "This book can serve as a guide for students who want to pursue a history degree, a history hobbyist who is looking for a good story, or a history buff who wants to explore the role of the English language in the development of an American institution.  This is a book about a long, complicated, but essential part of the history of the American colonies, the colonization period, and, I think, of the world in general." - Tom Reel, Ph.D., Professor of History, University of California-Berkeley 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a prequel to the events of the novel, I don't remember it well enough to know whether this was a good idea or not. There was quite a lot of information on a specific race of elves who lived in a particular valley. There is a lot in this book to explain that there was a war with humans on the elves and what the elves' motives were, as well as a lot more to go into the history of the valley and the events. I really enjoyed the book, I was able to follow what was happening and learn about the elves, and it also gave the elves a chance to show their true nature as a race. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    What a wonderful book it is! I have had it on my shelf for a long time and haven't read it since reading all the great reviews of the first book in the series. It has a nice, light tone and a very easy and fun plot, and I love how it ties into the rest of the series and the rest (as well as the wonderful first book) that it's based off.   One of the big changes in the second book that I really liked, and the author seemed to really pay attention to is that we have to deal with some of the people that were in the original series but were written off as non-persons in the third book. It doesn't really affect the characters at all, but it's a nice change of pace to have a few of our favorite people in the universe who are still living and working in this universe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      "An extraordinary book, one which will be in the hands of generations to come. Its author has created an extraordinary world, filled with extraordinary characters, which is the real joy of this story. This is the ultimate fantasy, a fantastic tale which is full of surprises and a powerful message about the dangers of trying to control the world and how difficult it is sometimes to do that without destroying the people that have always been around."   - John Updike  "When one remembers what it was like to write fantasy and science fiction, and when one considers what it's like to be a man of science fiction and fantasy who has also written science fiction: this is a book that is truly remarkable."  - A.N. Wilson, The New York Times Book Review  "...an extraordinary book that can be read with or without having read a book by Ursula K. Le Guin in her lifetime. It is a great and powerful story. I have read a lot of books by Le Guend here and I am also a fan of Le Guind's; but this book is an especially good example of what Le Guand is all about: a vivid imagination, the use of her talents to explore issues, and the beauty of her prose."  to read review
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are so many things wrong with the book and so many other issues with it, but most of them are pretty minor. I really wanted to like the book. I loved the idea and some of the characters, and thought they were interesting (especially the bad guys). The main character (who is a scientist) is very flawed, but he's a very sympathetic and admirable character. And I was glad there were lots of other characters who did interesting things in different ways. However, there were a few things about the book that bothered me, though it didn't bother me to the degree that I would feel annoyed about them if I were the one complaining.     The most serious issue I have with the story concerns the author's use of "the whole damn world" in the first sentence of the book: "All of them, every one of them..." It's an example of what's known as the omniscient narrator, in which the author uses a single (or a few) characters to describe the entire "world," which, in this case, means the entirety of human knowledge (including all of the fictional books, comics, films, and so on) and a large fraction of all the things that humans do. In other words, the entire history of our species (both the past and the present), all the knowledge of our civilization and the society in which it has operated, and the various things humans do, are presented in a single sentence. Even if the author were completely right in what he said in that sentence (he's a "scientist," after all), it's just too much and unnecessary information for the reader to take in at once. I can't say this doesn't bother the reader in terms of the story, but it bothers me even more. I'm not just saying this because I'm concerned about it's effect on the story; I'm also saying it bothers the reader, because the omnipotent narrator is a powerful person who could, perhaps, be forgiven if he simply wanted to know the whole thing. (Which he clearly doesn't. He's the one who's got access to all this information.)   I'll conclude by saying that the book is mostly an entertaining read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book over a few years, and it's still great.   For some reason it feels like there is a gap in the middle, and that's because that's where all the stories and characters are.  I think you could do without the middle bit but it's a good way to close off the first half.  It's still a good read, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it will go next. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It is the only book I have ever seen that has really made me think about the impact that human interaction has on the environment,   and the impact it has on our ability to co-create a better world.  There are some interesting points in this book that have made a strong impression on me and I plan on making use of the information that I gleaned from this book for the rest of my life.   3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not much into romance, but this book was really good, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's about a girl who, on the night of her 19th birthday, comes to terms with her feelings for her best friend. It is not very romantic and it isn't as sweet as a lot of romance, however, it is an extremely well written book about the true friendship between two people who truly care about each other.  I will give this book 4.5 stars because if you love romance, or if you don't mind the genre, I really recommend you read this.   My one complaint is that the romance felt a bit forced and unrealistic, I would like to see a more realistic character who is not so obsessed with her friend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book really is a joy to read and I have loved it from the very beginning.   I like to start with something short and funny and this is so easy to read.  There are very few things that can be said about the characters which is probably a good thing because they have very little to do.  The narration is quite good and the writing style is quite unique, which is always a good sign,  Also, my biggest complaint with this book is that there is no conclusion.  I really want a sequel which makes the book even better.  But this is an enjoyable short story and worth reading and recommending to those who have already started the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A well-written and engaging introduction to the history of anarchism.   There are many ways to think of the anarchist movement in America, and no one book covers it all.  I highly recommend this book for the broad readership as well as those who have read some of the earlier books that cover the subject in detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book of Eibon is a unique and interesting book about a strange world that is a world not entirely ours but of our imagination.  It is a book that has its origins in science fiction, a book of imagination.   I was given a book about what we can know about the past and what we will know about it in the future.  This is not a fantasy book about dragons and magical kingdoms, it is a science fiction book about something else.  I have always been intrigued by ancient cultures, and cultures with strange technology.  Eiboon is not about dragons, it's about a race of beings whose technology is of an older type that we do not yet have.  The Eibos are not a warrior race but they use their own form of technology.  Eibons have their own language and customs.  They are the only race that lives on a world and whose technology works in ways that are completely different than ours.  It's interesting to see how one species has an "archaic" technology and another has a new and different technology. There are no dragons in the story and we can't go there.  These stories are written in the style of the ancient Greeks.  Even though the characters speak English, they are not of that world but are the kind of ancient cultures that we can understand and have many similarities to.   There is an interesting mix of cultures in the stories and the ancient technology has many similarities.  My kids liked this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good read, very thought provoking, a lot of info but also a very good story. I really like the author and I like what the story brings out to me. It really is a book about the real world, but in a different way than the mainstream world. "
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a nice little book with nice illustrations and a really nice plot. The illustrations are nicely drawn and the story has some nice twists. I liked this book and recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy/SF books.
Write a positive review about a good book:     "Grave Peril" is one of the most powerful books I have read, period. It is an important part of my life, but I am so glad I got to experience this story. It has made me feel like I am an author, someone who is in control of the world and I am here to guide you through it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a lot of books in the past and this is one that I kept coming back to again and again. The story has a great plot and a compelling protagonist.   He's a hero that you want to believe in, he's a bad ass, he saves the world in a way that only he can.  I liked the plot that took place in a post-apocalyptic world, the magic was intriguing and I liked how he was so powerful.  He was a hero I knew was going to win, I thought it was funny and a great read.  The action was great and there were a lot more details than I expected.  There were a few things I didn't like about the writing, but nothing major enough to make me not recommend the book to anyone. I gave this 4 stars for the story and 3 stars for writing, there was nothing in the book I did not enjoy.   28 of 34 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the world of short stories I think this novel is on the more difficult side of things.   However, that was more by way of the length than anything else, as it was a very well written novel and had a satisfying conclusion to the story.  Also, while the author is British and American, this is a great read for anyone, regardless of their country of origin.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book and one I will be sure to re-read.   I do recommend this book as the first "how to" type book to read for a new reader, although I don't have a problem with how it was written, it's just a tad bit slow for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book as a Christmas present for my daughter, so I could read it to her before Christmas. It was an easy read, easy for her to understand. It made me laugh and get giggly. She didn't seem to mind the stories at all, she was enjoying it as much as I was.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book. I like how the author manages to get at the core of a question, without going into a lot of detail about it, while also avoiding going over the top, giving examples and examples, and being so specific that you can pick it up and enjoy it without having to know all the details.   I would definitely recommend it!    I liked the book more than I thought I would, and found myself really getting into it, even though it is a science fiction novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great little book that takes you through a fascinating little history of science, technology and medicine. I don't want to give too much away but the author, Steven Johnson, has a brilliant idea and does a good job of presenting it in a way that people in the science and technology fields would find compelling. The book also goes on to cover the history of human intelligence and how science and medicine may be able to give us some of that intelligence in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading The Night Angel trilogy, which I absolutely loved! It's a fantasy novel with an added supernatural element that adds to the stories' realism. It's hard to review it without spoiler, but I think this book is a winner in every sense, and I can't wait to see where it goes. I recommend it highly. I would definitely purchase a hardcover edition if it came out soon enough.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good read. I am a big fan of Harry Potter and found this series quite enjoyable.   However, I am only giving a 4-star rating because of some flaws. Harry gets stuck in a horrible situation, I feel, because it is not the character's fault, but his own. The problem is that the author doesn't really know what to do with this problem. It has been made into a plot element of the series. The plot holes make it hard to understand the story and hard to enjoy it.     This was my second Harry Potter book. I'm currently reading the third.   If you are a Harry Potter fan and a big science fiction fan then this series will be the right book for you. If you like Harry but hate the character flaws and the author's lack of originality, then I'd say pass it by. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is one of my favorite novels I have ever read. A beautiful, tragic story about love and survival. My son and I have read it multiple times. A wonderful book about a wonderful hero." --Elliott Smith, "The Story of My Teeth"
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book will be in all of our libraries"
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't really like chick lit but this book blew me away. It was so moving, I cried and the story was truly believable. I think the plot was perfect. I read this when I was in college and still remember thinking it was perfect, though I've since forgotten a lot of details. A definite winner and must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the story. I didn't know it was going to be like this until the last few chapters, and I wasn't a fan of the way the story progressed. The characters are just so much better than the first one. I'm going to pick this up again.   3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book 3 times now and I'm still thinking of ways to improve. The writing is very interesting and I was reminded that the "drama" is really a drama of emotions. One could call it a memoir, but it is really more of a book about a very unusual childhood experience.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best of the many collections of poetry by Henry James. The poems are often hilarious, touching, or poignant. I also like the way it relates to his writing.     A little too long:      The only complaint I have is that the length is too long (and for some readers that's a big deal) for a collection of poems written between 1892-1918.   Other than that, a very good collection of Henry James and his friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading this book and I am in love. It's beautiful. My two nieces and a nephew and I were in our hotel room one night and my nephew got in the pool and saw this book lying on the water. He looked at me and said, "I'm never going to be able to read that book again." I know this will be a long time for him to love it and I want to give him a copy of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the better books I've read on the science of memory. It provides the science in a manner that isn't dry or dull; instead it provides a nice narrative in which the history of the field is presented in a way that is accessible and accessible to laymen.   It was a pleasure to read a book that doesn't seem like it's trying to be a popular science book, but instead succeeds on its own terms, and succeeds in a well-conceived fashion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book when I was still working as a bartender at a restaurant. It was about my friend, a waitress at a swank bar, who came up with a novel solution to a common problem with a couple of male bartenders. I'm not sure what it's about, but this is one of those stories that makes you think about what's really important:  I think one of the most important things about a novel is that it is written well. In short, a novel should be a good story. That said, my main gripe with this book is its format. The first 60 pages are spent describing a couple's day at a club. They get drunk, make out, have sex, then get wasted again. It's a short scene-setter, but it really drags on for way too long. The next 60 pages detail the next day in a swanky restaurant.   For most people, the first half of the book is a description of how a couple comes to terms with their sexual identity. It works for me, because at that point, the only thing that was holding me back was the fact that I hadn't been drinking.  It didn't take away from the fact, however, that the book failed to really tell its story. I think it could have been edited down.  However, one of my favorite things about this book was that it made me think about the things that I'd always wondered about the gay community:  How do lesbians feel about each other? What if one of them decides she wants to start a family, and is just too scared to tell her friends? What happens to a woman when she decides she has an itch to be a homemaker? What should a man do when he's attracted to another man and decides he has to start dating? These are the things I would like to ask lesbians and gay men about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a good story to tell and I would recommend it. The only thing that stands out is that it does not have the original story at all.  The author made some creative changes to this tale to make it more of a fantasy story, but the original is still very good.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the very few novels I can't put down.   It is such a refreshing story, and I have been looking forward to this novel since I read the short story by A.M. Homes. I have a feeling the sequel will be equally as good. This is a great read for adults. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     "One of the most profound books I have read in a very long time."      - Michael M. Bara, Editor and Author, Savor:   One of my favorite books ever.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was interesting to see how many of the characters, who were written as if they are a single person, have actually been people for the majority of their lives, and then had to work out their identities as adults and try to live together in a place like New York.   The characters did develop, and I do wish that it would have given us more of a sense of what this group was like, because the author was clearly so focused on the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I can say that the books I read have been much more enjoyable than the books i read during my years in college, and that's saying a lot. The authors of this series are amazing.     The writing in this series is as good as you'd expect from the author. The first book, The Darkling, is amazing. A nice mixture of horror and mystery, with an amazing character arc.  In the next two books the story is much darker, with many more deaths and deathtraps in the shadows. The world building is also incredible. It's amazing to read about the ancient cities that existed on an island of the same name hundreds of years before humans were introduced.  It's also amazing to hear about the creatures the ancient humans and beasts encountered, like the shaggy horse, giant spider, and the mysterious creatures called the Tagh-dheem (The shag is a reference to the shingles from a tree that were found in the island, but the horses are the biggest draw of this book).     The third book, Red Country, is a little bit lighter, and doesn't have as much action, but still has the amazing character development the series is known for.  As a bonus, it was written in the style of an old children's book.  The Darkling (The Darkly) by Stephen King    I recommend this book for any Stephen King fan.  This series is not for everyone.  Some people might not like the idea of "monster vs monster" or "monster of the week" stories. However, Stephen King is one of the most talented story tellers in the world, and The Darkly has a lot of really great stories to tell. It takes a good writer like Stephen King to take these characters and make them stand out and be unique in a world of many other similar characters, even better, take some of the original monsters that have appeared in books by others and turn them into some of his own.  Overall, this series gives you what you've always wanted to read. It is scary, it is dark, and it is great to read in short bursts with friends.  For fans of: horror, horror/thriller, suspense, mystery, history. The Red Country by Kij Johnson If you like: The Dresden Files, Stephen's monster stories, Stephen and Kij's other stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished this book, which is a very impressive read in both the story and the writing.   I just finished the book, and I just don't think I've read a more compelling book this year.  It's a fantastic story, and a brilliant, complex and enjoyable story with some very complex themes.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A few days after I started reading this book, I thought to myself, "Well, that took me out of the fantasy world, but it won't take me out" The magic system in the world of Arduin is really good, and the main characters are very well fleshed out. The author knows a lot about the history and history of the world and she gives a lot of history and background on the main character. I enjoyed the story and the characters, and while the magic system itself isn't really my favorite, it works very well, and in some ways, is even a bit unique. A good story with a good start and ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The title's a little odd - the book's a memoir, but is it really a memoir? Maybe it's a study of her family, but it has a tone that's less an autobiography and more of an "interview" - the interviewer is trying to talk her down from a dangerous position - one where she may or may not be right about a certain question. But the book does have a great, funny tone, as well as a great story about an amazing moment in her family's history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I think it would be good for a beginning reader. I am not a fan of the books that have sex and drugs in them, and that's not a bad thing to say in a book about sex and sex drugs. However, this book did not do that. I do find the sex part to be an exciting part to the story, but I do think the drugs part was overdone. There was some bad sex (though I wouldn't say they were "bad") and a bit of good sex. As with a lot of stories, you can't decide which is which. Overall, this is a good story, not perfect, and I'm looking forward to reading more of these.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not a big fan of fantasy (I don't think I would have read this if it weren't for the author's recommendation), but this is a good fantasy that manages to be both believable and engaging. It's a story that I would probably have read years ago if I hadn't read the sequel.   The book opens in the year 2000 and centers around the protagonist (who has a particular curse - he has a magical staff and a cursed magic sword). One of the other characters has a wand that gives people strange powers - magic. One character wants to use the staff to kill his brother-in-law. Another wants to kill the king. One of them gets a magical spell to make him invisible. And so on. The story unfolds very well. The magic system is well described and believable, the characters are interesting, and the plot keeps you on your toes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read The Great War by David S. Cowan when I was in high school. It took a while to get around to it, but eventually I gave in and bought the books.   As a story, The Great  It is a good story, well written, with a lot of action. I liked the idea that the Nazis were able to use a lot the knowledge of the British scientists that the British had helped to develop, as well as the fact that many of the technology that the Germans stole from the British was eventually used in their own tech.   I thought the ending was pretty good, although I was not totally surprised. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book, it is a good read, the writing is awesome. I don't like the story at all, but the character development is what I liked best about the book. Also the ending was a bit odd, but i am not complaining. It ended on a cliff hanger, but it did not have to be that way, the story could have continued a bit longer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this book, so much so that I may have bought a copy of it more than once, and would still do so.   The author has said that the book is meant to be read in one sitting. That is a very accurate statement. While reading, you do not feel like you are in any way lacking. You find yourself being drawn deeper and deeper into this world. And you, as the reader, feel the same way.   The story is written very well, and with the right tone. The characters are well developed, and the overall world that the author has created is interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like a book. I really do. That being said I think the story is so fantastic that you really have to give it the attention you should, and I enjoyed it as much as I did.   If I didn't like it, there's a pretty good chance I wouldn't have read it.  A definite read for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very interesting. I liked the way that she describes the various types of dogs, from the big family dogs to the little family dogs, but what caught my attention most was the way in which she describes what motivates a dog.   Dogs have a special place in the mind of each person.  A dog is a person's closest companion, and the first thing that comes to mind is affection.  An attentive dog has a calming effect and keeps people from becoming over stressed and emotional.  In addition, the affectionate dogs are highly motivated to please their human companion.  This explains how even the dog that has never been trained can be trained to perform well in life. I hope that this book will help dog owners to learn how to make their dogs happy.  Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. I am a writer of children's and young adult fiction, and I do not have much experience writing non-fiction. I have seen books that have gone through multiple drafts, but I have never seen books where the writing style seemed to be consistent throughout.   This book is filled with the kind of wit and humor that I love from Robert Galbraith.    There are so many wonderful characters in this book, and this one's name is Lizzie!    She is a smart and funny girl who loves animals.  Her father is an artist who loves to create.  She loves to write, but she hates to give a presentation on something.  The story deals with two young people who fall for each other but have a big secret.  I loved how the book dealt with two people who are a lot more than they seem. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in a few days. I got the book as a preorder at Goodreads and i really like the author's writing style. The novel is funny, with lots of characters and interesting plot. I recommend it to everyone.   My only problem with the book is the ending. The book is about two best friends who are very unhappy together. But then they meet the new guy in town, and he is not what they expected. The next morning the two friends are having breakfast and talking about their recent events, but the one who was so upset has lost the courage to go to sleep. So they go for another morning run. The new guy is an asshole and the two end up running into each other. The two guys end up getting into an argument about the new person and he hits one of the guys, and then they all go to the hospital and the new doctor is there to see them and the good doctor is nice, but he is also kind of a dick. The doctor comes in and tells the two guys that their friendship is over and they can't hang out anymore and they have to go. That is when the second friend says "I'm not happy, but if you want to get to know me better... you gotta go to college."   This book is a little funny, but then the ending is pretty abrupt. The author writes a lot about the two best buddies, their friends, their relationships, their school life, their childhood, their marriage, etc. Then the final scene happens, and the characters are all so sad and confused. They just don't know what to do next. The ending just doesn't fit in with everything that has happened. I mean, we see them on the first day of freshman year of college, and we know they are in love. But they didn't end up together. And then we see this good doctor in his office, and his face is really sad.   "I love you two, but I just think this relationship is over for us. We need to move on." What a jerk.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the type of book that will take you to the edge of the world.    This is a story about two brothers that are forced to become involved in a conspiracy to help a woman save her family in a small town.  There are some issues here but the two protagonists are a joy to read and you can really relate to both.  This book really gets into the story at the very end.  The pacing is great, the characters are amazing and I feel so sorry for the woman.  I really do hope that this story comes to a book and movie.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's like you went to a good restaurant, the food was good and good service was nice.   I also liked that the author had a background in nursing and was able to give some insight on the work that nurses do.  -   The book is great, very informative, well written and entertaining. The pictures really do the book justice!   This is a great resource for those who wish to better understand the nurses and the work they do. I liked that you included more of the patients history and what happened during their nursing career.   Thank you for helping me improve my knowledge and understanding of the nursing profession. -  I had some great feedback, thank you so much, I think this book will be a great addition to my nursing book shelf. - The book was very informative and entertaining, but I can't see how you could sell a book about nurses that has no pictures and has no text, how is that for a sale? - In my opinion you should have done a little more research about some of the things that I find confusing about the nursing process (I'm a nursing student so I'll be fine without the references to things such as "patient education").

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best thing about this book, is the author's passion for writing, in a sense it's the love of writing which I can relate to and can't help but be fascinated by, as the authors' passion for bookwriting is like mine, and I guess it's because of that passion for reading and learning which fuels our reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband's favorite is The Little Engine That Could by Edmond Hamilton. The picture book follows a little boy who is told the name of a book in a store window, but doesn't know what it is. He finds it and realizes the little engine that could could actually be a big engine. He writes a poem about the little machine and the boy's father's reaction. This is my 3rd favorite book of his collection.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was an eye-opener. I've spent years immersed in the mainstream Mormon Church culture. I am a former member of the LDS faith, and for a long time I thought I knew a lot about the church, especially in regards to the temple ceremonies and their importance in people's lives. This book really shattered my assumptions and opened my eyes to what I knew but didn't know. I don't think I will ever trust an institution that has taught me this much.
Write a positive review about a good book:   There is some very good stuff in this book; some very bad stuff as well. If you have never read or seen the movie 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan', then this is the book for you. You need not have watched the movie to enjoy it. For those of you who have watched it, you need to read this as well and understand the story line; but if you have not seen the film then this book is a must read.   Star Trek II was the movie that made Star Trek into the science fiction phenomenon it is today and the book that introduced us to Scotty and McCoy (William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy). A story about a crew of space explorers that, by chance, find a planet on which they have a living being who is more advanced than any species they have encountered. In the first book we are introduced to Dr. McCoy (McCoy being played by Shat's best friend and a fellow doctor, Michael Westmore) and his crew who have been sent on a dangerous mission. While on this mission they have the opportunity to study a planet with advanced technology, but are discovered by a race of humanoids, who enslave them and force them to use their advanced technology. As McCoy and his men try to get home they are attacked by the enemy and McCoy is critically wounded by a laser beam from a human female. He is nursed back to health by a man who he must help rescue from a group of humans that has been brainwashed to believe that it's a good thing that humans have destroyed a being they perceive as being superior to them. The humans have a number of different ways to get their slaves to obey their commands including hypnotizing them, or even putting them to sleep. It is in this way that the humans have been able to enslave many of the other species they find on this planet as well as the humans. At the end of the book Kirk is captured by the alien race who now have McCoy, and he must save Kirk from his captors by freeing his crew, even if it means destroying a planet, that he has to go home to. I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes sci-fi and like watching or reading about it; for the uninitiated it's an easy read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a fun, funny read, and you might even learn something from it.   In terms of being a good read, the story itself is excellent and will leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling.  The fact that you can just skip ahead or read to the end is a bonus, and this was a great read for kids, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read. Good job, Rook.   I am a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien, and loved this book so much I bought an edition to keep for the future.  Rook does a great job of tying Tolkien's stories into the universe, creating a coherent whole.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I read this book on a trip to England and it is so true. There are lots of places in the US and we were never there, but this is the best idea of what to do when you get to London or a similar destination and are not quite sure what to see, see or do. This book is full of stories and pictures of places around the world, but the stories are not in the form of a newspaper article or a guide book. Instead, it is a collection of short stories about things that happened to people in their travels. Great for the people that do not know where to go, but also good for the adventurous soul that just wants to go somewhere and see something.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I didn't feel like I understood everything in this book, but it was entertaining enough to keep me going.   I'm not sure I would buy it again, but I might have to give it a shot for another book I'm reading this summer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The book is filled with life-affirming quotes and stories about how the Buddha was a real man, a real person, who lived a real life with a real character, as opposed to a self-insert.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It was short and had a good plot with some great twists, but it seemed like the author wrote it to get attention because she felt it didn't deserve it. The plot is a bit cliché at first, but the second half of the book really made me fall in love with the characters.   I liked that she used the language of the characters rather than giving it a more academic tone.  The characters are really good too.  The author writes about a character that she describes as "A dark and angry person".   They have a really great scene where they find a dead woman on a street in a bar and she says "No one wants to go to a bar where a body was dumped."  "She has been there for too long!" the character shouts and then the scene turns to the other characters and they all say "Whoa!"   This is a character I really like and I think I'll be interested in her.  I was also a little surprised that she did not just write a whole book about a guy, because I thought that might have been more interesting to me, but I guess I could be wrong.    I don't know why she was so interested in getting people to read the book (like so many of her other works).
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I felt like it was well written. It was a really nice read with interesting stories and concepts. There were times that it just made me laugh out loud, but I guess this was an emotional book so it was a good thing. I would like to give it a good rating but the ending is very sad and the ending made me hate the author so much. I am disappointed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a huge fan of this book, though the ending seemed a little underwhelming for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a fascinating book about the lives of men of all social classes in late eighteenth century Russia. It is not as well written as the book on the lives and personalities of women, but it is also not bad and a lot of information is given in it.   I have read the other books by Alexander Dugin and the information from the book is still useful and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful look into the history of a subject so very important and misunderstood by the American people. The book has a very good balance of factual research and historical interpretation. The author is thorough and well-researched, and her writing style is clear and professional. There are no factual errors, no out of context quotes, and she makes her points clear. The conclusion she draws from her research is that it is the lack of public awareness and support for the American Revolution that made the Revolution the Civil War and not the other way around. This book has many chapters that are extremely relevant to this topic, and I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in America's past.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is good, but the plot holes are annoying, not to mention the fact that they're not a minor plot hole but rather major plot holes that are a huge distraction from the main story.   "I know the name of the guy that killed my mom, but I can't find out how he did it.  I've tried my best to find out, but there's just too many holes in the story, and the ending is just lame."   I'm not even going to go through the plot hole problem. There are over a dozen of them, and none of them is a minor one like the one in the synopsis.  The only thing good about the book is that the story can be good (if you don't mind minor plot holes, of course).   My wife and I were both disappointed by this book.  It would be better to say that we both liked it. The main character is not the one we expect to be. In the novel he is a good but naive hero, a kind person who helps others. He is smart and not stupid, he has good motives, and is kind to the animals (which is the main reason he is on the mission to save them.) In the film he is the perfect hero, because he is kind, does his job well, and even has a romantic interest in the beautiful alien that he saves. The problem is that his motivations and actions don't match what he claims. He never explains why he is helping them or why he can't figure out how to figure out the solution.  There are two kinds of movies: (1) "the movie" where the main character has some special trait that makes them unique, and (2) "movie-style" where everything is the same. The book had (1), but the movie did not (2).

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book many times. My favorite moment was the one in the first chapter when our main character finds himself surrounded by zombies who are in the process of raping and looting his mother, but is too ashamed to tell anyone. Then he sees the girl who used to love him, and his heart sinks in guilt. When I was in college, I was working on an oral history project on the Civil War. One of my college professor's subjects was a Union soldier in Tennessee who was very well-loved by his family and friends in the town he served in and who later returned to a life of crime. I'm sure that there are many Civil War veterans, both male and female, who suffer from Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For those of us living in a world that has not yet recovered from the devastating events of the Great Recession, and for those of you in the military who were deployed or on active duty for a period of time that is much longer than anyone's normal life expectancy, what this book says is something very important: that we, as Americans, are better than this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing was good. It has a simple and straightforward style. The book is not a good first read and there are parts that were just a bit annoying.   I enjoyed the story well enough.  I like the world building.  It is kind of like a mixture between the world of Game of Thrones and Harry Potter.  The book was entertaining. I think this will be something that I read again and again.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not about the history of the American Revolution, or the political philosophy of the Constitution. It is an account of the actual event, and it succeeds in delivering that event without seeming to embellish it. This is a book that is not only historically accurate, but also written by a historian with a good sense of the history and culture of the period. It will appeal to students who already know something about the revolution, as well as to those interested in the history or politics of the day.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The novel is well-written and enjoyable.   This novel follows the journey of the "Ritual-ist", a group of religious "Mormons" who believe that all of the rituals and beliefs of their faith are required to achieve the highest level of spiritual perfection.  The main character in this book, is a Mormon Priest who is trying to maintain his integrity, while also being a decent human being.  His quest for truth is not easy, and even when he does find truth, it leads him down a slippery road of deceit.  As he tries to uncover what he has done to earn his condemnation, he is continually faced with the threat of being discovered.  In the end, he realizes that God has made a mistake in putting him through all these things.  He also realizes that it is not too late for him to turn back, and is able to turn his life around after some great spiritual revelations.  If you are a fan of fiction, and want to explore the possibilities of the afterlife, and the beliefs of religious groups, then this book is worth checking out.

I liked this book because it was so different and different meant that it made for a different type of reading experience.

He is one of the most intelligent writers I have ever read, and his writing is at once witty, witty, sarcastic, and intelligent. He often seems to be making fun of the "experts" (he calls them experts) who tell him what to do but never actually do it. His words can be funny, too: a bit of poetry, a little bit of humor, and a whole lot of insight."   Posted by Michael at 6:56 AM
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book, but the author needs to improve some things. The book is well written and well organized. I wish the book included the chapters in the order they are written instead of just skipping around. This is a good read, and I recommend it to all my fellow geeks.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the book, although the ending could have been better, but the plot kept me interested. The pacing of the book and the characters in the story was enjoyable.  The characters are complex and well developed. It was a nice change of pace for a book that is not often about the war.   There are some things about the book that I do not understand and I would love to read a book with some of these elements explained. The plot seems to be a little too complicated for me.   I think the story did leave a little to be desired and I did have a lot of problems with the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. It really captured me and stuck with me. I like that the story is very light hearted. It's funny and charming. And while I enjoyed the story, I felt the book could have been a little longer. I think the first five or six chapters were great, but then I thought something was missing. It was then that I realized it was this little girl that needed a little more from me.   " The Girl Who Walked Alone" I would give a higher rating if I didn't hate the first two chapters and had the feeling the whole book was just meh. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    What a great story about growing up in a small town in America. I was raised in this same tiny town and am so thankful that I have a friend like Ms. Eason. She is a real-life, down-to-earth person with a great sense of humor.     The humor, and the way that she talks about the struggles that we all go through in life, just makes it all so real and honest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've loved all of the Harry Potter books and the movies. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best. I'm not sure if this is the "original" Harry Potter book, as they do make a few changes from the book I read as a child. This one is better, however, as it is a more original story. The characters are all interesting and the plot is a great adventure. I recommend this for kids. It is well worth the read!

Write a positive review about a good book:     "I read this book on my first day in a new city. I took the bus downtown in search of the best sushi in town. On the way I stopped off at a little Japanese bakery, where I grabbed a slice of kabocha for lunch. My bag, which had been waiting on my table for a long time, made a very unpleasant squelch as it deflated. I didn't want to go home, but my girlfriend insisted I go and gave me a couple of $1 bills. I went back to my apartment to work, and on the way home I read a book. It's not like I expected this to be a good experience, but it was, and I am going to go out and find a nice book in that same genre."
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very enjoyable read! There was a certain element to it that seemed like a throwaway gag at first, but as the story continued to unfold, I found the jokes very clever and amusing, and was glad to be able to laugh at it all! The characters were very enjoyable to read about, too! A good book for all ages.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good introduction to the concepts involved, the structure is simple and easy to follow, and it doesn't take too long to read.       It is not a short book, nor does it have any of the humor I'm looking for in a book about the occult. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     This was my second novel from The Spacer's Apprentice and I'm enjoying both it and the sequel.   While I'm definitely enjoying this book, I think the sequel will make up for a lot of what I felt The Spacers Apprentice failed to accomplish.  I didn't feel like there was a lot to The Spanners Apprentice other than the book being written by me.  And it is really written, not that I dislike it but I just didn't find it interesting enough.  This book is a bit of a slow burn, which may make it a bit boring for some readers.  But for those who like slow burn novels, this one's for you.  You will find yourself getting lost in the world of the Spacer, exploring many of its characters, but will also enjoy the story that develops.  The author really did a good job creating the world and even though there is a lot more of the main characters than you would expect (because of the lack of time), there are still a lot we haven't seen yet.  There is also a lot happening in the background.  In addition, it's a great book to pass the time, because everything happens with a certain amount of mystery and even a bit a suspense.   A solid read for fantasy fans: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first book in the Star Trek / Expanse series.   This book is the follow up to the first novel in the series, Star Trek: First Contact (and thus the series proper).   As a Star Trek fan, I've enjoyed every book in this series, from First Contact to Insurrection (and now to this).  The series continues from where the previous novel left off:  1) the crew of the U.S.S Voyager, including Captain Janeway, Commander Chakotay and Ensign Harry Kim (the two were close) have been captured and placed into a "transwarp" prison, where they will be imprisoned for a long time.  2) Their time in the prison will be punctuated with many adventures, which are often violent, such as a fight between the Voyager crew over the new "warp core" on their ship.  3) As in First Contact, a new alien race is encountered:  a technologically advanced species that appears to be on the verge of destruction.  4) In First Contact the new alien was more of a threat than here, here the new race is shown to be far more advanced than even Humanity. The second book in a series is never as good as the first, and it is clear that the plot of the book is not as interesting as the preceding.  However, I would say that I would rather like this book better than First Contact.  The story here is much less "flashy," and the plot is not very good, but I don't hate it. It takes some good twists, it's got some good action and it has some decent character development (though I never fully understood how much the two crew had in common. They both have a very strong belief in what is right, and they both love to fight. It took me a while to realize this). One of the biggest problems in First contact is the fact that the characters are all a bit too "villainous" and "nearly god like." I would really like to see a new group of characters introduced in the next novel (or at least that's my hope, so that some new characters can be developed). The other issue with First Contact was the pacing.  It had a good plot, but the author doesn't know how to manage his time. He writes a great part of the novel, and then gets impatient and writes a little less good in the other parts.  After
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was given a copy of this book by my dad and I was hooked from the start. I loved the way it had a very real look to it that made it very easy for my 11 year old son to read and understood how it would effect his life. It is such a positive book and I highly recommend it to any family that likes to read as it is extremely educational. Thank you for this!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is very well done, I do think there are problems with the execution, but I find them to be minor and not as important as the overall quality.   My son and I both enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's an incredibly good story, a lot of characters, a satisfying plot, and a well-written book, but the plot and characters aren't what make it good. The book is a bit of a slog. The first third is great and sets the stage nicely. The second third takes a turn and never really recovers. I really liked the ideas, the concepts, and the prose was easy to follow, and all the characters were intriguing. However, this is a story about three children who are struggling to survive as they attempt to escape a hostile and brutal world. At the end of the book I felt that I had a good amount of information about the world and it was exciting to see what the author would bring next. But, I felt this was a story that was going to go nowhere and was going through the motions. I was also confused and bored, but that wasn't the intention. I guess the point of the story was to just get across the story as a story and not a series of events. I wasn't sold on the characters, but I felt they did the best they could. I can see how someone else might like this book more, but to me it was just okay. It's interesting, but it didn't really hook me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is fantastic. I am a huge fan of the books by Stephen King and it's a pleasure to read something from this author again. He takes the horror of Stephen King's work and makes it very personal by introducing a young girl named Sarah Walker and her parents and the horrors they go through. They are a very dysfunctional family so the main plot of the book focuses on their struggles and how they cope with the challenges their son puts upon them. Sarah has this supernatural gift that can help save a child in danger but the family that has chosen to put her through her growing pains are not as understanding and will not allow her to use it. This book was a very good read for me because it's the first time I've been excited for a book by Stephen king and this one was a pleasant surprise.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't understand this book until it was over. But I thought it was good. It was well written and I like how the story was told. It had the kind of characters and a good story that I like.   The problem with the book is the pacing, at times it was too fast, at others it seemed too slow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In short, the book is good, as in that is has some interesting ideas and is well written. There is a lot to be said about the "fascination with the mind and psyche" in our society today. The book does not talk about anything in depth as I'm not a mental health professional, but I found the book interesting and helpful.
Write a positive review about a good book:    An epic fantasy in the style of The Belgariad and The Chronicles of Amber, with a twist.   "A large book, to be sure, but full of beautiful imagery, the story is excellent, the characters and their journeys are well developed, the writing is strong, and the plot is intriguing."   The narrator has no qualms about his style:  "I read the book in 2-3 days, in one sitting, and it was well worth the investment!"   In conclusion:  In the hands of an even better writer, it could have been a wonderful fantasy epic.  There's a lot of world-building here, and a few surprises along the way, but nothing earth-shattering. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I enjoyed this book.   A bit too long for the size of the novel but its not a bad read. It was a good length too for the price. The story is told via two perspectives. One from the point of view of the boy and his friend the other a female character who lives with the boy's uncle. The uncle tells his story first. In order for the girl to have any understanding of the situation the boy has to explain it. The boy does his best to do the right thing and get the girl out of the problem but eventually gets pulled into the situation.   for the character development I really liked the way she evolved and grew and the friendship that grew with the two characters.  :) I was also interested to see what would have happened to them if he had not stepped in. And what would the boy have done?   Overall I really enjoyed this read, i just hope it is done well on book 3

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most powerful, personal, and personal book I have read in a long time. I think it is important that I share my experience with other men who have suffered from depression and/or sexual abuse and how I recovered from my own experience. I believe that this book should be mandatory reading for everyone, as it describes in great detail the psychological, physiological, emotional, spiritual, and physical damage inflicted by child abuse, neglect and rape.   I'm a 40 year old man with a good career and a loving wife, I don't think I could ever recover from my experiences of child abuse as a child. My story is the reason that I became so concerned about my mental health when I was 40.  I began to feel depressed and unwell. I tried to get help from my parents and their friends and got nowhere. I ended up visiting my psychiatrist who suggested that I might be suffering from 'chronic depression' after I went through my 'emotional turmoil' as he called it. I found the book incredibly helpful. It was an eye-opener as to how I had been living my life. The book made me realise that my mental state wasn't caused by some psychological or biological defect. I have learnt that it is also not the fault of a particular person or a particular event or a single cause but a set of factors which include my upbringing, my childhood, the circumstances of my life, my experiences as a boy in a troubled home and the effects of being sexually abused as a teenager.  A lot of people will assume that I've been depressed for the past 18 years. In reality, I've had major depression for 18 years - I'd say at least twice a week since I was 20.  This book has helped me overcome my mental illness and made me feel that I am not mentally ill.  If you are struggling with your sexuality, anxiety or depression or have experienced the trauma of sexual abuse or rape, then this is a book you should read, if you can. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Hands down one of the best books I've ever read. Great work!" -David Schuman "I think that what makes this book work so well is that it never gets boring. Not only does it get you hooked (it's a slow burn, but it gets you there) but it's also one of those books that you're thinking about while you're reading. It is very thought provoking, yet still manages to be thought provoking without being preachy. Definitely a great book to be read!" -Gina Tachkin "A powerful book, beautifully written, filled with so much wisdom. One of the most powerful books I have ever read and I am forever grateful to have been blessed with this gift." -Maggie R. "This is a book that really changes the way we look at ourselves. For a book written in the 1950's about a man and his relationship with his son, it is so relevant. As a man I felt very inspired by the way that it deals with all the ways we have of looking at our sons and women and dealing with them. If only my parents knew what I have learned from this book, they would be jealous." -David D. "The man at the center of this book does not have the best relationship with children but has a great relationship with women. He also has a very strong and meaningful relationship with himself. It's a very deep book and one I'm still thinking about. I'm glad I got it." -Sara S. "I had this book at a Goodwill book sale a few years ago when I was a child and found it really useful. I still think about this book in spite of the passage of years. I am not a child anymore but I still find myself referring back to this book. It makes so much sense." -J.S. "One of the few books I own that I plan to keep in my collection. It has made me a better man, and I'm grateful for it. It can be difficult to be a man, but sometimes, it's nice to have a book tell you that you are not the only man." -Karen C.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book a lot. The story is very well done. It's the plot that is the main problem. I felt that it was somewhat repetitive. The way they went about things just didn't feel very fresh to me. But if you're a fan of good sci-fi books I think you'll enjoy this book. The characters are also very well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think the book has a lot of interesting ideas, and as a science writer, it was a lot more fun than the science stories I read about before. The author explains each mechanism, and how it works. I'm happy that science fiction can talk about some of the real science behind some of those ideas and not just be "science fiction".

Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing that could make this better would be a short, spoiler-free section at the beginning about the origins of this book. The book opens with a character named John who is in love with a woman named Anna. It's not clear whether John's love for Anna is a symptom of some illness or his own personal struggle. In this case, the illness being diagnosed seems to be something much more profound, and possibly existential, than the love of another person. The author has a way with words that I haven't seen much of in fiction:  A character's body being put into "state of death" is a perfect description of the state of one's consciousness during the transition from life to death.   Another description that makes this a must read for everyone in the family!   I think the idea behind the book is a very good one:  "One is supposed to be born into this world knowing that you're going to die."   The transition to the next world in the book makes sense and is the only logical place to start; however, the way the transition is handled is jarring.  When a character is going to be killed, he's still in the process of dying--he's just dead a little faster.  John isn't in the "state" of being killed, but he's certainly dead and that's what matters.  One thing I liked about the book was that Anna is very much a foil to John. She's both intelligent and has the same kind of naiveté as John, but she knows that death has been around forever and that John and Anna's situation is a "glimpse" into the future. Anna is the character that is closest to John and John's relationship with her is an important part of the story. Anna's role in the story is one of being "a person who has gone to the grave with a lot of baggage, but is trying very hard to let go of her problems."

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book and I have read a lot of books in general that are great. I did get a bit annoyed by the beginning where the girl is telling all the boys how great her school life is and what the future is going to look like but I was able to forgive that because the main point is getting to know the boy and she is just as interesting and interesting as the boy.   The two main characters are similar, they are both really nice and good-looking but they are different and it's hard to find a really good comparison to make. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading this book for a couple of years now. It's not your typical "I wish I had read this in a library when I was younger." It's good in its own way, but what truly makes this book stand out are the little details. For example, when you read about how the people in the local library are being replaced by robots.   He has a robot named after him.  The entire story about the town's first girl scout is a story of the importance of education, or something like that.  I know this isn't a big deal because there isn't much in the way of plot, but it really was nice to get something like this in an action/adventure story.

Write a positive review about a good book:     In his book, Mr. Beattie makes an argument about how all of our ancestors were more or less like us. "Our common ancestry is not really that far back," he writes. "The ancestors of most people in the world today lived in a time when a man could take a woman's virginity before marriage, and the law did nothing to stop him."   Mr. Beatta, who was a professor of anthropology and an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, makes the case that our common ancestor was probably a nomadic tribe of hunters. "We are descended from the nomadic people who left Africa at the beginning of the Holocene era about 40,000 years ago," he says. "And, as in the past, the first people to colonize new lands were the most highly mobile and most mobile-minded, including the first settlers of the Americas." The first American colonizers, he suggests, came from the same group of nomadic hunter-gatherers as our own. The earliest records of the first Americans date from 14,000 B.C.   Photo  The evidence that Mr. Biederman cites is more dubious, at best. The early settlers in the Americas were not the earliest people in North America, at least not at that time. The first people in this part of the world, in fact, are found in Africa, not in America. So what was the original migration route? That remains unclear.   the early inhabitants were probably not a nomad population, but the same people who are known as "Homo erectus" in Africa. They left Africa in a very different way: they left Africa by way of what is today the Sahara desert.   a similar pattern is seen in the origin of the "Languages of the New World." They come from an area very close to Africa, from East Asia. This "out-of-Africa" migration may have started when the first members of our genus, Homo, went to the Americas. The other explanation, suggested by Dr. Bousquet, is that our ancestors migrated from East and South Asia into Australia about 70,000 or 80,000 to 80,0000 years ago, and then into Asia about 40 thousand years ago.  ,,

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good, well written and informative book. It provides a good overview of the problem with government, how the federal government is failing and how you can make your voice heard.  The writing style is excellent.   You'll find many facts that you have probably heard before but you will also find many that are new.  I have read a few books and have used several methods to try to get Congress to pay attention to some of the issues but I never saw a single one that was as well researched, well organized, and so easy to read as this one.  This book will provide you with a lot of information that you don't have to spend a lot time reading and that can be useful right away.  My only complaint about this book is the fact that it is quite short. It may be useful to students, but the book would be much better in a larger format.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not the biggest fan of science fiction, but there is a lot that's going on in this book that I really enjoyed. I like the idea that there's another world where all the people are human and have evolved. The science is more complex than I expected, and the author has a lot of fun exploring the implications of such a world. The characters all seem to be pretty well developed, although I'm pretty sure that some characters might have been more fleshed out if the author had put more effort into developing them. I'm also glad that this story ended with some kind of resolution.   The book is a little too short to be an interesting exploration of space travel. I don't think it really explains the implications that the universe that we live in has. And then there is the idea of a world where the technology has advanced past our technology, and you have to assume that they'd have a somewhat more advanced understanding of space exploration. It's kind of a big, grandiose idea that I don:t get.  But I'm a huge fan of the world that this author has created, and I've found the ideas of evolution fascinating in many sci-fi stories. I've also had some really good fun reading the book, and am now really looking forward to his next book. I think that he could do a lot with a little more work in this area.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My son got into this book on the day the book was released and is already reading it. He is a bit more of an advanced student so I expect his reaction to be a little different than mine.   I will say, there is a good story line here and this is definitely a book to keep in the front of the room.  "When I was a boy I would dream about finding a magic box in the back of the school library. A small, quiet box, hidden in a very hidden corner. When I was growing up I would see this magic box on television shows or movies and I thought to myself that it had to be really cool to have a box that could let you into another world and see the things that had been hidden there."

" I am completely in love with this book. Every time I get to the end I'm almost sick to my stomach. It has the quality of a great read, but the pace is so fast. This is the book that I recommend to everyone, even those who have read Salter before. Highly recommended!" --Jane M.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As always, I enjoyed this book as a whole.   I feel like all of the characters really come to life, and it's good to see the book dealing with issues which the genre tends to ignore.  Unfortunately, the last third or so of the book was a bit repetitive.  I wish that it could have wrapped up in a different way, but it just felt like I was in a routine.  Maybe I just need to be reading the other books, but the series isn't what it used to be.  For more information about the author, please visit his blog

Write a positive review about a good book:    The story of how the great philosopher Immanuel Kant developed the view that all morality is grounded in reason is one of the great stories of moral philosophy. The book itself is about the moral philosophy of Immanuel and his famous pupil, Friedrich von Schleiermacher. Both Immanuel's moral philosophy and Schleiere's are about what is good and what is evil, based on a conception of morality as a system of rules that all people are expected to obey. Kant's view is more complex, but it is the essence of what makes Kant's ethical system relevant to the real world. What's good and bad, what is right and wrong, is to a great extent a matter of our values. To illustrate, suppose that someone comes up to you and tells you that the person next to you is the greatest, smartest, most beautiful man who has ever lived. If this statement seems to you to be a great achievement, then it is because you have accepted the idea that what is important is what is great, what's beautiful and what's smart and what people are like. The person next door may be a little more intelligent, a little better looking and a little prettier than the man in the room, but he will always seem to you more wonderful. If he's less smart, prettier or a little less beautiful, then you might feel a little guilty for thinking so. But if he is less smart or prettier but more brilliant, then he'll seem even more wonderful to you. It's not merely that you want the person in the next room to be as great as you are. It would also be wonderful if everyone you knew were as great and brilliant as each other. For people to be equal is to be good.     I've also read "Moral Landscapes: A History of Theories of Morality" and "Towards a Theory of Rights".   I think I'm in a bit of a pickle here, because I don't believe that the things that are good, bad or right are immutable facts. As we have seen, it is possible to change our beliefs about right and good based on experience, and I believe that there is great value in exploring new ways of understanding morality. But we don't have to look at Kant. He is just the most famous and influential example of how to approach moral philosophy from a different direction, and he's a lot more than just a philosophical scholar. He's
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the story of a young man who takes his life at the first attempt. There is a lot of drama and mystery about his death, but the final reveal is what made this book so memorable. It was great to see his character evolve into a man who is actually strong and powerful. The final chapter about the trial is a nice touch.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In the summer of 2001, a very nice man asked me if I wanted to read a book. I was interested and agreed to let him read it. The book was a history of the US Navy and a personal history of one of the authors. It was a very good read and I felt that if I read anything for the next four years, it would be the book I'd recommend.

Write a positive review about a good book:    As soon as I opened the book and saw the cover and title, I couldn't believe how good this book is. A fascinating, detailed look at the history and evolution of "sexology", a term which refers to the study of sexual differences, as well as the medical and mental health implications of those differences. The authors are extremely thorough and well-researched. From a medical standpoint, this is a must-have and essential book. From the social and political point of view, it is excellent. And from a historical perspective, this book will forever change the way one understands the "women's movement".
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story was good enough that I finished it in one day. I'm usually not a big reader but this was a good read. There were also things that I found interesting and it was interesting that it included the stories of the other side's perspective.

Write a positive review about a good book:   " I was blown away by this book. It took me some time to get into it, and it took me even longer to finish it. In fact, the final chapter took me over two years to finish.   This is a wonderful book by a marvelous writer.  I wish I had found this book when I was in college.  It is so full of life, love, and truth, you will not want to put it down.  One of the best books I have read in a long time." --M.M.A. "I was excited when I saw the title, and when I got home and opened the book I was more excited than I can ever recall being." --S.W. " I loved this book so much, I want to live in a world where it isn't impossible for a person to read this book, and experience the same emotions that I did when I read it." --A.T. "This book is so honest. I don't think I could describe what I felt or felt like until I read this story. I think it's so important to read about people's struggles with their disabilities, because they might be feeling the same way you are. It is easy to dismiss disabilities because they do not fit into our social or cultural norms, but when you see someone through their disability, it makes you wonder how we've come to accept that the norm is the disabled. I read the book thinking about how difficult it was to find the time to read, and that I would have to keep reading, and then read the last chapter three or four times.  Now I just want to read it until the end." --K.J. " The book has a very beautiful, simple story. We all have moments when we feel hurt or embarrassed about our disability, but you can't read this and not be affected by it." -P.J "This is a good read. It's a nice book to relax with and take a breath. It makes you think about your life with a disability as well as people with disabilities who have more problems with being seen. I would read the rest of the book." --D.S. "There is no better book for a day trip, a vacation, or to help people cope with a difficult situation. " -E.J
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy.   The last couple of books I bought for my son were fantasy and science fiction.  So when I found this in the library, I was all over it. I was hoping to find out more about it, but as I looked around the bookstore, nothing was available.  The only thing I found online is that it was originally published in 1974.  However, it was reissued in 2013 in hardcover, but not as the original.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Loved this one!" "I read this book when I had a very small window of time to do anything with my life. I had been married for about 3 months and my wife had had several jobs that she had quit over the years to raise their kids. This book helped me to see how much work we do to keep our family together. I am a man of the cloth who likes to give, so I would have never considered being a stay at home dad for a few more years. I will always remember this book as it was one of the best things that I have ever read about how to have a healthy family. The authors are wonderful authors. Thank you!"  Read a negative review about this book: The book has a wonderful introduction to the topic of parenthood, but the rest of the book is very weak. I was shocked to see so many parents complaining about how it is impossible for them to parent their kids the way they would like to be parented. What this book doesn't show you is how easy it is for a woman to raise her children, and how difficult it is to raise a man as well. The book also does not show how difficult raising children can be. It is a very interesting topic but the book doesn.t tell the reader why it is so difficult. I'm afraid that this book does not tell you enough about how important it is that you are a good father and not a bad husband or father. The best advice I received from the book was to read a book about how you can easily become a good dad without ever having a husband or children. It's just that easy. That book is the one that I read. The rest of this book was not worth my time.
Write a positive review about a good book:    (8/10) I am just starting to read it. It is a short book but it is a story about a boy whose mother has been murdered and the boys life. It has a lot of violence, sex and sadism. I have read the book in its original language and it's not bad but I did not like it much.   The book tells the story of a man who has killed his mother in front of his son. When he meets a man in a club called the 'Gangstag' he falls in love with him. When the man is kidnapped by the mafia it forces the boy to follow him to the 'gangstag'. The only problem is that the book is in German so he has to read in English. I didn't find the book very funny though I am a little disappointed about that.  An old fashioned detective story: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am currently working through a collection of "The History of Theodorus" by the famous Greek historian Herodotus. It's quite well written and it contains a lot of facts and figures about the ancient world. Herodotis is usually known as the first historian to mention the mythical kingdom of Erech and its chief deity, the Earth Mother, but also mentions Etruscan society, Achaemenian empire, Persian Empire, Greek and Roman republics and the fall of the Roman Empire. There are also a couple of interesting details about the Etruscans. Overall, the book is an interesting overview and the author has written quite well about the history of ancient Greece.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books I could never put down. I enjoyed the book more and more as I progressed through it. The story was very good and the characters were likeable. The pacing was excellent and I always liked when characters acted like adults, but not like their children. I also really enjoyed the humor in this book and how the author manages to show the characters' childhood in a realistic way. The artwork of this book was beautiful. The book does have some problems and some characters seem to be slightly stereotypical, but that wasn't the case in my opinion. I will definitely read the sequels to this book because I would like to see how far the characters have progressed and maybe how the adults changed over time. I did like that the author decided to put some of the villains at the end.   Overall I would recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I was thrilled to read the first volume in the series (a wonderful first volume!) by Jennifer Egan in paperback.   For a very long time I didn't know where to start or even what to expect with the first Egan.  She's never had any books in the big trade book market but in her earlier books (Pantheon and Gilead) there was always a strong, but not over the top, feminist twist that added a dimension to her prose and fiction that I hadn't thought of.  Her novels are often hilarious, often quite heartbreaking, sometimes even heartrending, but most importantly always intelligent.  This time I found myself not loving the first novel but just thinking about the series as a whole.  One of the main themes of this book was the power of writing and what you can do with the medium.  In this case, she uses the form of writing as a vehicle for a more complex and interesting narrative. I really like the book and am looking forward to the next installment!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the books and the stories were good.

It's also written in a way that makes it easy to understand.  I don't have it in the way that they describe, but the symptoms are similar.  This is the best book I have read so far about ADHD! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and the story behind it. I liked the plot. I'm a huge sci fi fan and I enjoyed the way this book is similar to the Star Wars universe.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know if I can compare any of them to anything, but I'm so grateful to have the gift of a book that reminds me to take time for myself. I found this book by accident, in my usual routine of flipping through my books, and it's just perfect. I'm an English major at a liberal arts college, and so far I love every book I've read, but this is an exception. This is what I need to remind myself of when I'm bored and need to do something. Also, my husband loves it, and I was just as happy to get a gift that was specifically for my son as myself.

Write a positive review about a good book:   . I read this book right after finishing my first novel, and I've been very happy with the result! The writing style is very fast, and the author seems to have a lot of passion about the topic. It's great to see an author with a solid foundation and passion, and that it was put to good use in the book, giving a good overview of the basic concepts and how to work with them. The author also explains his theory, which is well written and explains why his methodology works. I wish I knew more about the subject matter before starting, but I'll definitely be looking into the rest of his books, and reading some of his other work, to better understand the details and reasons behind his approach.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book. I read it in a year and a half since my last exposure to the genre. The premise of the book is that, with the advent of the nuclear era, a person in her late 30's, in her mid-40's, is given the option to take a huge risk that she knows is likely to get her killed, for the sake of her dying husband. It's the idea that gives me chills, it's the premise that I think is at the core of all horror. I enjoyed it immensely, and, after several months of re-reading, enjoyed it more than I thought I would.   If you like books where you think you will die, and are in the right age bracket to get something like this, give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Read on: I'm going to start by saying I love this series, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good fantasy. It has one of the greatest plots ever, as well as a really great character and a really nice plot and is full of action.   I love the way this series was written, it is full-on, but doesn't feel forced in the slightest. The characters are just amazing, and the world they're in is really well thought out, which is a good thing.  I really love how this series is written, there's so many characters, it's awesome, but sometimes it seems a bit overwhelming.  The characters in this series are all wonderful, but I can think of about 2 people I would love to spend all of my time with, and one of them is a main character.  It's really hard to describe how this feels like the first book in the series.  My only complaints is the pacing. There is too much going on and not enough time to read the books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of books about the Civil War but no books have captured me the way this book does. It captures my entire experience in the Civil war as a kid, and I think that is a big thing, for many people do not know what it was like for a kid to be there, especially a kid in the South. I love how it takes place during the year of the Civil  I have read many books about that war, some good, some bad, but this book has something unique to it. The author takes us inside a Southern home, a farm house and a Civil War soldier's home, and lets us see things through the eyes of the child who lived there. It is a truly unique experience. The book tells a story through the eye of the little boy, and it's really quite moving. The fact that there is a black boy in the story makes it all the more real, and the fact that the story takes place in the year 1861 makes it really magical. I am not saying it's a perfect story, but for a book written in the 1890's, the author certainly knows what he is doing.   The narrator, Mr. Huddleston, does a good job. He is not perfect, but he is good. He does a fine job of describing the characters and setting, and conveys the feeling that they are real and really lived in, even when they were not there. This book has a great ending, and one that feels appropriate for a child's story. There are a lot more books about this war than the one I read, but I have not read any books by the same author as this one, and my curiosity still runs wild.

Write a positive review about a good book:    -   If you like this novel, you should check out the rest of the series. It's not nearly as good as the first volume but has a lot more to recommend it.   Shelley is a very talented artist. She has a way of drawing faces that's a little too close to the real thing but I can forgive that because she's just so good at drawing. She makes this a real pleasure to read with characters I'm willing to put my faith in. I also love her description of the world. The world is beautifully described and Shelley gives it a very vivid feel. The only problem is she sometimes overstays the welcome with long paragraphs that just get tedious.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title is a bit of an overstatement - the story is about the "Majesty" of an immortal god. The story follows an immortal and her followers on a quest for immortality. The characters are fairly well developed, and some of them are pretty cool. The main character is a very intriguing, intelligent, and determined character. The plot is somewhat predictable, but it is worth the price. I really enjoyed the characters, and the action sequences were well done. I do not like the use of "magic" in the book, but I think that is due to my own lack of familiarity with the genre (in this case, epic fantasy). The story is interesting and the author did a good job of making it compelling. However, I feel that I would have enjoyed the story more if it had focused more on the "god" and less on her followers.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book! It is the story of a woman who lives in an old, big house. She is divorced, and her husband has a new partner in the next room. This is my first book by Sook-Yin Lee, and I love how her stories are so real, yet still so fantastical. Her writing style is easy to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I've read a lot of books recently and, while I've had a couple of good ones, my absolute favorite in this category is 'The Book of Names.'   The story is good, but the character development and development of the world in which it takes place is the real star.  The premise of the book is pretty interesting, but it comes down to the execution.  My only complaint about the book was that, by the end, there wasn't really anything more to learn about the main character.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If I'm not going to buy the book, I don't have to read it, but if I want to read a book that I want and that I can recommend to other people, I will read it. That's a nice way of putting it. This is a great book that was not that difficult to get through.   The story is one of exploration in space and time.  This is the second book in the Time Bastard trilogy that was written by Michael Flynn, and this is the first in the time travel, but still science fiction, book.  My thoughts on the books:  1) The Time Bastard series is amazing and so much better than the first Time Bastard in my opinion.  The book took place in the 30th century.  2) In this series, the story is not as simple as just traveling back in time. Instead, the time-travel is done in two different ways.  3) The stories are very fun, and the characters are all very interesting.  4) The book is easy to follow and not complex.  5) The endings are interesting, as is the beginning.  6) I think the books will keep me hooked.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am now almost 20 years old, and I have been reading a lot of science fiction. This is a wonderful book. The style is a little more realistic than some other works of the genre I've read, but I think the characters and the plot are much more important in this book. I also like that this novel is a book that takes place in the near future. I have found some of my favorite books to be from this time period. I would recommend this to anyone who has read science fiction or fantasy, or who just likes good books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very well-researched, accessible book. I am not the person to judge someone else's parenting style, but I did have a very hard time reconciling my son's tantrums when I took him to preschool with the way his father behaved while I was home (and at the same time, while I loved the books about childhood). I am a woman who works to keep her kids engaged and not to make them feel bad about anything. I don't think I could have done that with my son, and it is an ongoing struggle for me. This book is very helpful.   I got this book on a whim, when my kids were very little and I was looking for something to fill the time when we didn't have time for a book that was too educational. I know I will get more books when I have more kids, but for now this will do.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read "S.C.G." for the first time yesterday. In my excitement over this book, I went out of my way to find an old copy of it so I could enjoy the fun and hilarious banter of my favorite comedians, Larry Miller and Dick Ebersol. However, since I cannot remember if this is the same book I read back in the 1980's or the one I had before my wife discovered my copy, I had to pick it up again.   The funny bit about what a lot of people find annoying is the best part of the book. In the middle of one of the most humorous chapters, Eberso describes a conversation he had with a guy at a bar. The guy was having a drink with some friends, and Ebersos interjected some of his own personal wisdom on the bar scene. The rest of the chapter is about the guys getting to know one another, discussing their favorite music, watching sports, and talking about their favorite actors. But the part that I remember the most is when Ebersot told his bar buddy, "Don't ever tell a lady how much you like a movie, because a lady will take you out to dinner in a dress!" (Yes, I actually read it with my daughters, not because I thought the ladies would be entertained.) I'm really glad I got the book again.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was so good. I just didn't feel like the characters had much to do other than find out the identity of the killer and try to find him.   It was also really interesting to see how much people have changed in the last 100 years or so. I also found the descriptions of the world very interesting.  A couple of things I disliked about this book: 1. The description of the people in the village was a little vague. Why would they dress the way they did and how would they get around? I'm not sure how this would work if the story is to follow them as they did a century ago. 2. The story seems to be going nowhere for a while.  I would like to have gotten more of a payoff, or an actual answer to the mystery behind the murder. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      This book has me hooked!   " The Book of Thoth is written in a style that, to me, has a feel that's been missing from the books I like most.   I'm sure a lot of people who read this will find some of this frustrating, but I'm not.  "    The book really is an action-packed ride that is full of twists and turns.  It follows the story of a man who gets drawn into a war between the gods of the Book of the Dead and their servants, the Order of the Flaming Sphere.  There is a lot in this book to keep you interested.  Some parts were more enjoyable to me than others, but the ending and cliff-hanger made this book worth reading.  I would love to read more by this author.  3.5 out of 5 stars:    I have not completed the book yet, but it seems to have a good amount of content and was an enjoyable read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "One of the most thought provoking and useful books ever written on the topic of how to be a well rounded woman."   You'll learn about being a person, how to maintain your self esteem, and what to do about all those situations you see that are a challenge to your sense of self.   In order to become a "well rounded woman", you have to know who you are and what you like and don't like. I can not think of a better way to learn about these subjects than through a book that is not only very informative but also makes you laugh and make you smile.  You will learn about the difference between a woman who only thinks about herself and a woman with a strong sense of her self. You will learn that a "happy" woman is one who has some self esteem and does not rely on anyone to take care of her.  You will also learn about how your self-esteem, self worth, and ability to be independent are just as important to you as the men you date. This book is a great way to teach you some useful life lessons. You'll find yourself thinking about life differently, and I hope that you'll use it in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved it. This book is a great re-telling of the story. I was born and raised in a rural area in Alabama and the book is truly a great gift for my son. Thanks so much for this and an extra copy for me as a gift.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing is fantastic. The character development is strong, there's a lot of humour, and the world building is good.   I enjoyed the characters, the dialogue, the magic system, and some of the mysteries. It was also enjoyable to read the side-stories that came after the main story.  The best book I read in 2015: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book. It was very well done, and made me laugh a couple times. The main reason I like the book is because it was very entertaining and made you think about all the ways that we are flawed. As an academic, I think there's a lot of great research and ideas in this book that would be fascinating to read in a college course.   The "lazy" stereotype is a big thing that I really have to get over.  There are some bad parts but there were a lot more good parts.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really loved this book. I read the first two chapters and found myself wondering about the setting and how the characters were going to handle things. I also enjoyed the fact that this book didn't go too dark and had a decent amount of humor in the beginning. The setting, I felt, was really interesting and the characters did well. Overall, a solid, but slow read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is one of the best books I've read in years and I was hoping to get a free e-copy from the author, but she took my money and gave it to me as a book. She did a great job writing this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great and I really love how the book was written and edited. There were some problems with the book that were not corrected and it was annoying and disappointing but nothing enough to spoil the book for me and I will definitely recommend it to everyone and read more books like this one in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good read. This was my first book read by myself.   It was a lot of fun, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased this book a couple of months ago, and was completely pleased with it. It's not exactly a great read, but it is a good one. The author has a good sense of humor, and I found this to be one of the funniest books I've read all year.    I highly recommend this book: I found The Power of Suggestion a great companion to the other books in The Secret World: A Reader's Companion, as they each deal with a unique group of characters with unique motivations.    
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I didn't get the full explanation as I am only a beginner but for beginners with the basic knowledge of a math and physics the theory is very sound.    2.0 stars.  I liked the first half. The problem is that it ends as it is about to start, and that is when the problems become quite silly.  This is a good first book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really glad I picked this up. I think this book will be a very good introduction to some of the stuff you've read before (particularly the Marder series) but will also be quite helpful for new readers. The writing is quite clear and is very readable. It also does an excellent job of showing just how difficult the world of the Mardi Gras is.   The characters are interesting and different to each other, and the action is engaging, although the end seems a bit anticlimactic. I enjoyed the world building, and it's easy to see why it might be hard to sell this series elsewhere.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason why this is one of the most essential works of literature   is that it is a   work of fiction, so it   can   get away with   it. That's what makes it so   unique.   It's about the   human emotions of an unrequited love   as it percolates up from the subconscious. It   takes a couple of hours and   doesn't take any risks, but what's the risk?   This is a great   book   that makes you think   about love and heartbreak. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can see myself finishing this in the future. I do think it was very well done, though.   What else is there to say?  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like fantasy, or fantasy in a certain way, you need this. For me, it was a very important book to read as a teenager as it explained to me many of the things that I knew.   The book was a bit slow at the beginning, but it eventually got to the good parts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book really made me think about the meaning of life and the importance of living as a non-denominational Christian. It really changed my perspective. The book is not too preachy, but it talks about some of the more difficult things people have to deal with in their everyday lives.   - The book really changed me from how I was as a Christian to how I am now. I was going to be a fundamentalist but with God, a different kind of Christianity. Thank you!
Write a positive review about a good book:   The whole novel was very well written and made me very interested in the characters and their future, so it had a lot of potential to be a good read.   I would have liked it if they had chosen to follow the story through to the end, but since I read it at a bit of a stretch, I won't be upset if it doesn't continue. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm very much enjoying this book so far.   The story is very well paced and it gives me a lot to think about while I read.  I like the fact that it is a fantasy and is more realistic about how a man/boy looks for love.  It also has a bit of a fantasy element with the way the girl is dressed.  Overall I like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The narrator really gets inside the heads of these characters.   I read it in 2 sittings because I found it really hard to put down.  The premise is simple. One day, when the whole town is having a birthday party for a very well-known celebrity, they're surprised when a very mysterious old man shows up.  You never know what he's up to but you just know something is really wrong.  A really good mystery.  It's the second in a series (there's a third book) but I found them better than the first ones.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The first time I read The Book of Lists, I was thoroughly impressed. It is not a good one to start off with. "The author's use of "A is for Always" as a motto was particularly annoying; it's so vague that I could have picked up on it immediately by the use of that phrase. "But the book is not about A, but about the fact that you can write a list, and the fact of having a list. And then the author goes on to say that, even though I haven't read the original list, I'll still recommend it. "This is an excellent book; a clear, concise guide to the world of lists. There are things in The Book that I wish I had known in advance, such as how a list will never be a "complete picture" unless the items are grouped together by category. "As an overall introduction to writing lists, The Book is a terrific resource; I can't wait to find out how it will evolve as I continue reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The idea for this story is the perfect blend of fantasy, sci-fi and horror.   I loved the twist of the ending and the fact that the author managed to make a vampire that isn't an   ghastly monster out of an actual human being.  I'm curious to read the next book in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A wonderful read by my 2 year old, with a unique take on animals. He has already asked about the cat in the book! She's the most fascinating character! I have read this many times and I'll always keep a copy by my bed for my boys :)
Write a positive review about a good book:     The narrator has a good, though not great, voice. She's got a nice drawl but is not so much nasally as slightly nasal. The book is a real page turner, with both the main characters (the four women who are, by the book's conclusion, involved in the drug trade) and the side characters getting their share of good material.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:   . In his recent "Horn of the Lamb" novel,   he makes an interesting connection between a young girl and the spirit of a man who has died from a brain tumor. .   The book contains some very dark and depressing themes, and I didn't really enjoy it, but I felt that the story was interesting and that some of the themes were thought-provoking.   Somewhat disappointed with the final product,  I can't say that I'm completely impressed with the story.  I did like a couple of parts of the book, but  I thought the rest of the novel was quite bad.  While  The premise is interesting, it's not anything special.  In fact, it seems to be a pretty standard thriller set in the early 1900s, and not particularly interesting.  There are some good ideas here, but for the most part this book is just a dull slog, with some interesting scenes and concepts, but the execution is weak.  This book just feels kind of wasted, and for a first book I probably should have given it 3 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "When I first read this book I wasn't particularly impressed. There were parts of it that seemed like they should be interesting and there were other parts that seemed to be completely unrelated to anything else I've read. It seemed like a case of just trying to put together a collection of short stories, but I kept finding myself wondering why I needed this book. Then I read the last few pages of it and found myself really enjoying them. What I have found out is that the author has an interesting perspective on the universe. It isn't the standard science-fiction fare. He has taken elements of real life and put it into his story. I really enjoyed his take on things, the science was good, and the stories were good. If I ever feel the need to look up a particular fact about some of the places I have been in, I think that this book is the one for me. "
Write a positive review about a good book:   The second I finished this book, I was overwhelmed. I've read three other short stories about my sister, and this one was by far the best. It was full of emotion, and I found myself smiling all over the place. The ending had me crying. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading this book for over a week now. It was a very good read, although I had to stop reading after chapter 4. The narration is pretty good and very informative about the life of a Native American in America, although at times it was very harsh. There are some very interesting historical figures in the book, and at times some of the characters are almost believable. I liked the ending, although there were some points in the story where it was a little confusing. But I was still glad I finished it, and hope to see more.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not so impressed by this book as I was a few weeks ago, but it is still a very well written, enjoyable read. The characters, although a little odd at times, are very relatable and believable. The story does take a turn that will please the more serious of readers as well as the more light hearted, so please do keep that in mind before you start reading. I also agree that the ending will be quite satisfying, and as a writer myself, it is definitely my favorite ending. It also includes a lot of information about various medical practices and medications. I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in the human body, as well those that enjoy speculative fiction, science, or just good fun.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought this book was an excellent introduction to the psychology of personality. I liked the idea of the four facets of personality and how it's not all about the big four (open, closed, conscientious and extraversion) but also involves things like creativity, energy, imagination, ambition and emotion. I am a big fan of the author's books - he writes them very well, but he has a good feel for his subject matter and does not use it as a vehicle to drive home the message that he thinks is true. I read this book because I wanted to better understand the four types of personality, and the personality research behind them.    The book is not long, and its about 80 pages or so, so if you're just starting out on this area I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was the second volume of a trilogy. I've read the first volume in the series (Serenity) and thought it was good. The second volume (Firefly) has some good stories, but I was expecting more because this trilogy will continue the original series.    
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good novel I read and enjoyed!    The description makes me want to keep reading.   I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good story with lots of action and twists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      For the first part, I thought it was the right kind of story. The concept is solid, and the character development is good. The second part really took the cake. The way the writer takes the time to make you care about these characters is beyond wonderful. When this book has a real happy ending, you will be grateful.   I think I'll have to start off with a warning: this book contains very graphic violence. There is a lot of it, but it isn't really explicit (although I won't spoil anything). I found this to be a refreshing change from the violence I get from many fantasy books.   was a pretty good book. The idea is interesting and the characters are well developed. The story really comes alive and I found myself getting very interested in the details.   It is definitely recommended to anyone who wants to read a fantasy novel that focuses on the lives of some of the most interesting characters in all of literature.
Write a positive review about a good book:   . I don't normally read books that are just like this, but this was the first book that I have read that I liked.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a lot of interesting points but the only thing that sticks with me is the idea that you can make anything with your eyes, like a flower or a seed, with your own two eyes. The book was fun, and the book I wish I had read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've heard it said that the book "sucks balls", so I was very curious to read it. I enjoyed the book, and have a feeling this will be a great book to look forward to.  I liked the book's concept and the way it is laid out.  It is not very hard, and definitely not a page turner.  The author does a good job at explaining things, although this book is very well known, so the actual explanations were a little confusing.  One of my favorite scenes is the one that follows The Redeemer from a young age.  This part was just plain interesting to read.  It is a very well written story.    This book is a definite winner for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found that the novel was a great and engrossing read, but didn't see why the "book" would be called a "novel." I don't know that it ever becomes a "book," as the plot keeps growing and growing. The dialogue is great too.     If you don't mind learning something about the world's most famous explorer, I'd recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of books that can take me on a journey. I don't like to read one book before I move on to the next. I prefer to get into a book with all its potential and enjoy it for what it is. I think I've been in love with the Harry Potter series since I was a teenager. Now that I've read the first three books, I have a feeling that I'll love the series as much as I did as a teenager, but with more depth and more complexity. It may be a different type of Harry, but his charm will be the same.  More
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book of Lies by Stephen King "I love Stephen King! And this book is no exception, this is a dark fantasy with a little mystery thrown in. King is so good, I'm in love with his work. He writes in a way that is not too intense but makes you think. There is so much tension here and there are surprises that will really make you think."  --The Book Lovers Read Review   "A dark, suspenseful novel filled with secrets and secrets."

He builds a world with a great sense of place and character development, but you can also see a lot of elements of other worlds within the story." .  .
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only downside to this book is the narrator (who has an extremely annoying accent). The narrator just keeps going on and on about how important the novel is.   I found myself annoyed by his annoying voice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   My first experience reading a book on the History of the Bible in English was not very successful.   I had read a lot of what is now referred to as "modern" editions and many books from the early 20th century, and I was prepared to find that the Bible was much more complex than many modern versions have presented.  This was not the case.  I was impressed by the depth of biblical scholarship, the many different perspectives expressed by the various writers, and the fact that the editors are careful in their choice of texts.  However, as a book of history, this was a very weak book.  For all its great research, for all the different perspectives, and for the many excellent quotes from the Bible, the book suffers in comparison to the other works available.  It is a little too academic for my tastes.  An author might have done better with a few of the non-biographies, but most of the biographies are interesting and give a good impression of the authors' own views, which might not be the same as the contemporary.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received this book from a friend who has been a fan of the series for years and asked me to read it for her.   It's a fun read, and an excellent introduction for those who don't know much about the series.  It has a lot to offer. I hope that more people read this book. I know that I am sure will be a joy for me and my readers! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a fascinating book. I am a biographer of one of the fathers of the American Revolution, Samuel Adams, who has been overlooked by historians. I liked the history of this particular family and the history behind the "Carpathian" family, of which my grandmother was the last member to leave the family, as she died of illness. Adams' grandson was able to show how my great aunt was a strong, brave and influential woman. His narrative, though often somewhat dry and dry, was often engaging and entertaining. He also had great stories about his ancestors that made me feel like I had gotten to know him a bit. I also enjoyed how Adams made his case that women should have the right to vote, which I think was a major step forward. I know it seems like an old fashioned, but the rights of women were in decline at the time Adams wrote this, and I think that many of us have forgotten how important this was. This is also why I liked his "Myths and Legends of the Revolutionary War." He presented a balanced view of both sides and was very convincing in arguing that "there was no revolution in 1775, the people of the colonies were not yet ready to revolt. It was not until 1783 that the war was joined." I also liked the section where he discussed the religious history of the Revolution. I have read many history books but this one was my favorite so far. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful and well written fantasy tale of a young wizard, his apprentice, and their adventures in the far west. The prose was very smooth and clean. I loved the setting of the novel and the author did a good job of bringing it to life. This is a must read for fans of fantasy and of high fantasy literature. The characters were very well developed and the world was rich with detail. The writing is not a masterpiece but it is an interesting read. I only wish that I had gotten the entire series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad I finally read this book. I have been waiting to read this one for the last two years. The story is a good one. The illustrations are good. My only problem is that I cannot understand why the people in this country have such high expectations for their presidents, and yet fail to follow through. This book could have been written a hundred years ago and still be relevant to us today.  Read Next: 4 Books Everyone Needs to Read
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It made me think about why I enjoy reading a good story, what makes a good work of art worth the read, and what makes my reading experience good. There are also some thoughts on the social and cultural aspects of the craft of writing. I'm definitely going to read more works from Mr. Stross, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good science fiction or fantasy stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a nice book about my brother's experience with a young, gay, Mormon girl. It is so refreshing to read about such a young person (he was 10 at the time). It's refreshing that he has a brother who can be more tolerant, and it is refreshing to see him accepting. This is such a nice read for someone who is very familiar with gay/straight issues and is very happy that his older brother is so accepting.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm in love with this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as an undergraduate and it was very good. Although a few things may have been a bit silly in the first half, it is an excellent read. I especially liked the "gossip" section in the book - it is interesting and entertaining. The writing is excellent and there is a lot of information given. The most interesting part about this book is the section on how to make your own herbal tea.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   The book is a good read for the average person.  The setting, although set in the US, was interesting and well written. The story itself was also a good story.  I am not a big fan of the paranormal genre.  When I first started reading a book I always assumed the authors were going to use a paranormal story and a lot of the time they do not.  This time the writers chose to use their paranormal knowledge in a different way, making the story a little more interesting.  It is a great read for anyone looking for a good paranormal book to read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book but not for the faint hearted or the weak-willed. This is a story about one man's struggle to survive a zombie apocalypse but it is also a story of courage, loyalty, loyalty to a cause, and of the human spirit.    "The most important thing is to get the people to be together, and be willing to die in a great battle for something that you believe in."  --George R.R. Martin
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. I had not read many contemporary fantasy books prior to reading it, and I am surprised how well this book came together and how well the author's prose is woven into the story.   The story has a good mixture of action and adventure, and the pacing is good as the book progresses, with not too many long stretches of nothing happening in-between.  I was also pleased that the author did not have the "demented" feeling I've experienced so often with fantasy.  I was also very glad that the world of the book (and the author) seemed to be a fair and balanced one.  This book has a lot of depth and realism to it, but it is not heavy handed like, say, the second book in The Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne series by Christopher Paolini.  With this book I feel like the author has gone to a more modern setting, and it seems to me that this is more of a departure from the previous books in the series (and even from Paolini's work as a whole).  This is a nice departure for the series, and a nice change of pace for me from the grim, gritty, and hard-edged fantasy that has come before.  Overall, I think this is a solid effort from the author, and something I'll be looking forward to reading in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read The Unwinding World   as a gift for my son who is a big fantasy fan. His reaction is priceless : He said it was "fantastic" and "absolutely amazing". I'll definitely be giving this book to my son when we run out (or get a coupon for a copy on Kindle or at the library.) The writing style is unique. I love the story line. The prose is clean and well paced. I hope they continue to do what they are doing for some years to come. I loved this book. I think my son may be getting in a bit of trouble for buying this book as it is "saga" book and I don't think I have ever read that in all my reading (I'm a serious fantasy fan). That being said, I found it to be a story that would be good for all readers, no matter their genre. I liked how the stories flowed into one another. The stories were short and the author used the format to a good purpose. I like the idea that there are other worlds beyond our own as well. The world building felt complete in my mind as if I was reading a book with multiple authors. There was also a great amount of action and I enjoyed how the story ended on a cliff hanger. This was a fun read and one I will continue to keep on my shelf for a while. I would recommend this to everyone with a good imagination.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book is excellent.   A lot of people have talked about the lack of detail in the book, but I like that they gave more details.  It was great to have a detailed history of the Civil War.       I really enjoyed it.  I did have to go over my notes to try and catch up to a lot of the information and it took some effort, but it was worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a few of the "D'Souza classics" like "Obama's America" and "America's Stolen Narrative" and found them to be extremely entertaining and informative.   This book goes above and beyond.  A great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book a lot! I had the pleasure of reading this book by the talented Dr. David Siegel about a man named Dr. Seuss. Dr. Siegel's style of writing is always entertaining. It's like a Dr. Suess version of a Dr Seuss book. The book is filled with Dr.Siegel's observations about our modern culture and the people he met while travelling the world. I enjoyed the humor that was infused into the book. I liked the character of Dr.Seuss. His story is very enjoyable to read. It gives us a glimpse into the world of the future. One of my favorite parts about the story was that a man was able to become a professional cartoonist from the age of twelve! I thought that the humor was funny in its simplicity, and the characters were enjoyable to follow. The final chapters of the book were just as entertaining as the first few. One thing that I found to be a bit annoying was Dr.Suess' habit of using his characters' names to describe him. For example, "Nose" is Dr. Nose; "Naughty" is Nose; and "Hairy" is Hairy. While I don't mind his naming conventions, I found it to be annoying that he would refer to himself in the third person as "I." If he wants to refer to the reader or the reader's friends as Nose, or if he is going to use a character's name, he should use the first person (My). I know that this isn't the most important part of the story, but I found myself wondering why the author didn't simply change names whenever he wanted to use them. It seemed a bit like a chore to change names to avoid spelling errors or to avoid using the same name as Dr. Nook (the main character's grandfather) and Dr. Pookie (Dr. Suesses' first name) over and over again. I'm just a little disappointed because Dr. Snuss is a great character and the book does a good job of exploring the main characters personality and story. I recommend this book to those who love Dr. Druss, or those who want a good, funny read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book I've ever read by the author who gave me the title " The Last King of Osten Ard ". It took me years to read it because of a bad recommendation by a good friend. It was so good I read it twice.   I think this is the best fantasy I've read, in the last twenty years.  I have read other fantasy books written by the same author, but none come close to The Last Kingdom.   There is the feel of a traditional fantasy, the atmosphere, but it is a world in itself. It is also set in a world that has a lot of history but there are no heroes.
